    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of RHINIX™ nasal filters on seasonal allergic rhinitis
      (hay fever) in a park setting.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include 100 participants with grass allergy and will look at the efficacy and
      usability of RHINIX™ nasal filters on hay fever in a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, crossover design.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the change in daily Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) between Rhinix™ and placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>11.00-17.00 with recordings at 30. minute increments.</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline recording at 09.00 Run-in recordings from 09.30-11.00 Daily Total Nasal Symptom Score evaluated from 11.00-17.00 with the last recording at 17.00, recordings at 30 minute increments.
Total Nasal Symptom Score is the sum of 4 symptoms (runny nose, blocked nose, itchy nose and sneezing) which are each evaluated on a scale of 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe symptoms</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the change in Daily Throat Irritation between Rhinix™ and placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>11.00-17.00 with hourly increments</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline recording at 09.00 Run-in recording at. 10.00 Daily Throat Irritation evaluated from 11.00-17.00 with the last recording at 17.00, recordings at hourly increments.
Daily Throat Irritation is the sum of 6 symptom ratings on a Visual Analogue Scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the correlation between maximum TNSS and difference in Daily TNSS</measure>
    <time_frame>11.00-17.00 at 30 minute increments</time_frame>
    <description>Daily TNSS is described in the Primary Efficacy Endpoint. Maximum TNSS is the single highest TNSS between 11.00 and 17.00
The correlation will be graphically shown using a Bland-Altman plot.</description>

    <measure>Change in Daily TNSS for subgroup</measure>
    <time_frame>11.00-17.00 at 30 minute increments</time_frame>
    <description>Subgroup analysis of change in daily TNSS between RHINIX and placebo for the subjects with at least one rating of TNSS ≥ 6 on at least one of the two study days.
