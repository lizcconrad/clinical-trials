  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the response to chemotherapy with the drug decitabine combined with rapamycin in
      the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia in patients of all ages, and
      in the treatment of newly diagnosed leukemia in those who are older than 65 when diagnosed.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy of decitabine followed by Rapamycin in previously untreated elderly
      patients not able to receive standard chemotherapy or in patients with relapsed or refractory
      AML, through measurement of Complete Remission (CR), Complete Remission Incomplete Platelet
      Recovery (CRp), Partial Remission (PR), and event free and overall survival (Arm A).

      To determine the safety of administration of decitabine with escalating doses of Ribavirin in
      elderly leukemia patients or patients with relapsed/refractory disease with M4/M5 subtypes
      anticipated to express high eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) at diagnosis
      (Arm B).

      To establish effect of these sequential treatments on expression of phosphoinositide
      3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt /mTOR) pathway proteins and
      on eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) activation through Western blot and
      phospho-flow methodologies.

      To correlate the clinical response with baseline expression of phospho-p70S6
      Kinase/phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT) and with the in vitro inhibitory effects of
      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition with rapamycin or ribavirin on the level of
      downstream effectors.

      To determine whether a leukemia stem cell phenotype is inhibited by the sequential
      administration of decitabine/rapamycin or decitabine/ribavirin.
