    <textblock>
      The evidence is insufficient to determine whether the types of dressings containing silver
      differ as the time/proportion to complete healing of the wound and pain. We will analyze
      cost-effectiveness of these dressings in outpatients, considering the service provided by the
      National Public Health System.

      Clinical trial, controlled, randomized, containing two parallel arms, the single center.

      Adult patients between 18 and 65 years, regardless of sex, with second degree burns treated
      in an outpatient setting without the need for surgical treatment will be randomized (1:1)
      into two groups: silver sulfadiazine 1% on healing and the base nanocrystalline silver.

      Primary endpoints include

        -  time to complete epithelialization of the wound

        -  proportions of lesions completely epithelialized over a period (15 days)

      Secondary outcomes include:

        -  the number of dressing changes and the level of pain associated with your application
           and removal;

        -  direct medical costs and non-medical;

        -  need for surgery;

        -  incidence of infection;

        -  presence of adverse events.

    <description>Flexible polyester low-grip coated nanocrystalline silver dressing. The dressing was applied to the lesion after being soaked in sterile distilled water. About this compresses to bandage movements will have been added and comes to avoid tourniquet bandage on-site maintenance, temperature of the affected area, cushioning and absorption of wound exudate when present. Is finished with the application of crepe bandages in the form of flakes containment curative and maintenance of pressure. This procedure aids in the bloodstream, and avoids the increased edema. The bandage is started from the periphery to the central region, avoiding tourniquet. The exchanges were performed every three days.</description>

    <description>Ranges for rayon containing cream 1% silver sulphadiazine were used. Involving this layer bandages for dressings were added in movements back and forth to avoid the tourniquet, providing maintenance of the temperature of the affected area, cushioning and absorption of wound exudate when present. This application was completed with crepe bandages to contain the dressing and maintain pressure. This procedure aids in the bloodstream, and avoids the increased edema. The bandage is started from the periphery to the central region, scales, avoiding the tourniquet. Dressing changes were performed daily.</description>

    <description>Flexible polyester low-grip coated nano-crystalline silver layer. The level of silver is 1.64 mg/ cmÂ². This dressing enables the sustained release of silver in humid conditions dynamically and reached a higher plateau than 60 mg / L in less than 2 hours, and maintains a uniform level by 72 hours.</description>
