  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies have investigated the effect of caffeine on athletic performance, but the
      findings have not been consistent. This is due, in part, to the differences in response that
      has been observed both within and between studies. Previous research in our lab has shown
      that genetic variations affecting caffeine metabolism modify the association between caffeine
      and heart disease. We hypothesize that the inconsistencies among studies relating caffeine
      and athletic performance may be due to genetic differences in caffeine metabolism or
      response. Male athletes will take part in an intervention of caffeine versus placebo, using a
      randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled design, which will test various exercise
      protocols (power, strength, anaerobic capacity, endurance) that are associated with
      performance across multiple sports. We will conduct a genome-wide association study, which is
      an approach that involves scanning for markers across the genomes of our study participants
      together, not individuals, to find genetic variations associated with a particular trait such
      as VO2 max, lactate clearance efficiency, muscle fiber type and changes in exercise
      performance following caffeine. We will also examine known genetic variations that are
      associated with caffeine metabolism and response, to determine if these genes also affect
      response to exercise after ingesting caffeine. Subjects will be paid $50.

      Research Methods and Design

      Experimental Design:

      This randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled, within-subjects counter-measured study
      design will include 100 male athletes from a variety of sports. Females will not be included
      in this study because hormonal contraceptive use, which is common among female athletes, and
      the time of the menstrual cycle have a significant effect on caffeine metabolism and exercise
      test performance measures. Controlling for these factors would require a much larger pool of
      participants and require considerable resources and time. However, if the findings from the
      proposed research show promising results in men we would then aim to replicate those findings
      in female athletes.

      Participants will complete 4 visits (~90-120 min each) in the Human Physiology Research
      Laboratory in the Goldring Center at the University of Toronto. All testing will take place
      Monday to Saturday at various times. Participants will be instructed to maintain their
      regular diet (pre-testing meals will be replicated for all visits) and sleeping habits, avoid
      strenuous activity 48 hours before each visit, and abstain from caffeine one week prior to
      the first visit and for the duration of the data collection (4 weeks).

      Sample Size Calculation

      Parameters:

      Effect size = 0.25: Although a large effect size for the main treatment effect was found in
      previous research (0.38), it was decided that to be conservative, this trial would be powered
      to detect a small-medium effect size which is still of physiological importance.
      Additionally, we are interested in the effects between the two doses of caffeine which are
      assumed to be smaller than the main treatment effect. Therefore, a small-medium effect size
      was needed to ensure sufficient statistical power to make between-caffeine-effect conclusions
      for the time trial analysis. Finally, other parameters of assessment such as the Vertical
      Jump for power will likely have a smaller effects size than the time-trial as reported by
      Tucker et al. (2013) in a study on vertical jump performance in male basketball players.
      Therefore, a smaller effect size would be required to adequately power the study for all
      outcome measures (i.e. power, strength anaerobic, aerobic etc.)

        -  Alpha (error probability) = 0.025: In general, an alpha = 0.05 is the standard value to
           use for this parameter. However, in our study the participants will be enrolled in a
           number of independent trials, and therefore it was decided to use a lower alpha so as to
           take into account error that can arise from multiple comparisons such as by sport (power
           or endurance) plus genotype (risk or common variant).

        -  Power (1-Beta probability) = 0.8: The conventional value of 0.8 was used for power.

        -  Number of groups = 2: Number of stratifications required for genotype subgroup analysis

        -  Number of measurements = 4: The laboratory exercise tests

        -  Correlation among repeat measures = 0: Zero correlation between measurements was
           assumed.

        -  Sample Size = 74: Based on calculations 74 participants are required. We will recruit
           100 athletes in order to account for possible withdrawal of up to 25%, without
           potentially compromising the statistical significance of our results. In addition, if we
           choose to use multiple comparisons (genotype + sport) we would benefit from a larger
           sample to minimize the drop in effect size.

      Recruitment

      Recruitment will be carried out at the University of Toronto, Ryerson and York University
      campuses, the Canadian Sport Institute of Ontario, and at local running/triathlon clubs by
      flyers posted in appropriate locations. A standardized email with study and contact
      information will also be sent to head coaches and/or program directors of sports teams/clubs
      (at all locations listed above) with eligible athletes, who can then choose to make their
      athletes aware of the study.

      Parameters of Assessment

      Physiological data collected by two trained kinesiologists, a PhD level exercise
      physiologist, one student assistant and Nanci Guest, the graduate student.

      Anthropometric and Clinical Characteristics

        -  Resting systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure measurements, as well as pulse
           rate, will be taken twice, one minute apart. The mean of the two consecutive readings
           will be taken.

        -  Heart rate will be measured before all tests to ensure participant calmness and similar
           physiological state for all tests and test days.

        -  Heart rate will be monitored throughout the duration of the trials (Visit 2-4) by Polar
           Heart Rate Monitors (Polar Electro, Finland)

        -  Height will be measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a wall-mounted stadiometer and body
           weight will be measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a digital scale with participant
           wearing light clothing and without shoes.

        -  Body weight value will be used to determine 2 and 4 mg per kilogram of body mass dosages
           for caffeine treatments (plus a placebo dose) that will be ingested in random order
           (derived by research assistant and blinded to all investigators) during visits 2, 3 and
           4, over the following three weeks.

        -  Body Composition will be assessed by a bioimpedence scale (BC-558 Ironman Segmental Body
           Composition Monitor)

      Exercise Tests

      Descriptive Characteristics

      Maximal Aerobic Capacity will be assessed by a VO2 max test on a cycle ergometer. This test
      is part of descriptive data and will be used to determine resistance set in the time trial
      test (65% peak power). Participants will undergo a graded exercise test on a Monark cycle
      ergometer (Groningen, The Netherlands) until volitional fatigue. To determine maximal oxygen
      consumption (VO2Max), air samples will be analyzed for oxygen and carbon dioxide
      concentrations via an indirect open circuit spirometry system (Parvomedics, Metabolic Cart,
      Sandy, Utah). Subjects will be set up with a Polar Heart Rate monitor.

      Four main outcome measures (power, strength, anaerobic and aerobic capacity)

        -  Muscular Power will be assessed using the Vertical Jump Test (VJT) as described
           previously (5). Participants will complete two attempts at each of two vertical jump
           tests on a force plate (AMTI,Watertown, MA, USA).

             1. squat jump (SJ): from a squatting position (knee angle: 90Â° approximately) in which
                no preliminary counter movement is performed;

             2. counter-movement jump (CMJ): from an upright standing position with a preliminary
                counter movement; There will be a 30 second rest period between jumps and the best
                score of two will be recorded.

        -  Strength (upper body) will be assessed using a Handgrip Dynamometer (Lafayette
           Instrument Company model 78010). The highest score after 3 trials will be recorded (in
           kg).

        -  Anaerobic Capacity will be assessed using the Wingate Anaerobic Test on a cycle
           ergometer (Ergomedic 849E, Monark, Sweden). Participants will cycle against a fixed
           resistance of 0.085kg / kg body mass. Three main measures will be recorded during the
           test:

             -  Peak power (PP): a measure of maximal anaerobic power, or the maximum power output
                reached for a 5-second period during the first 10 seconds of the test. PP will be
                recorded in Watts (W) and W/kg.

             -  Mean power (MP): a measure of anaerobic capacity, or the mean power output achieved
                during the 30-second test. MP will be recorded in W and W/kg.

             -  Fatigue Index (FI): a measure of the rate of power decrease, or the difference
                between the highest 5-second power output and the lowest 5-second power output,
                divided by elapsed time. FI will be recorded as a percentage.

        -  Endurance/Aerobic Capacity and power output will be assessed by a Cycling Time Trial
           (TT). Participants will be instructed to complete a 10 km TT, carried out on a cycle
           ergometer (Monarch Sports and Medical, Vansbro, Sweden), as quickly as possible with no
           temporal, verbal, of physiological feedback.Time required to complete the test and
           average power output will be recorded on completion of each test.

      Additional Tests during Exercise Testing

        -  Blood Lactate Testing. Immediately after the Wingate test participants will have their
           finger pricked with a disposable lancet to puncture the skin and obtain a capillary
           blood sample for analysis with the Lactate Pro analyzer (LT-1710, Arkray Inc, Kyoto,
           Japan)

        -  Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) - The Borg scale for RPE will be used to assess
           subjects' perception of fatigue.

      Genotyping

      Saliva samples will be collected during Visit 1 of exercise testing using the Oragene-500 kit
      for DNA isolation using standard procedures as described previously.We will conduct a
      genome-wide association study, which is an approach that involves scanning for markers across
      the genomes of our study participants together, not individuals, to find genetic variations
      associated with a particular trait such as VO2 max, lactate clearance efficiency, muscle
      fiber type and changes in exercise performance following caffeine. We will also examine known
      genetic variations that are associated with caffeine metabolism and response, to determine if
      these genes also affect response to exercise after subjects ingest caffeine.

      Dietary Intake Assessment

      Subjects will complete a 196-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire to determine
      habitual caffeine intake as well as other dietary factors. Dietary intake information will be
      used to identify potential effect modifiers such as usual caffeine consumption.

      Health, Lifestyle and Physical Activity Assessment

      The General health, lifestyle and physical activity questionnaire (GHLPA) will include
      detailed questions on caffeine (e.g. intake habits, withdrawal effects etc), previously used
      in our lab, combined with a validated habitual physical activity/sport history questionnaire
      previously used to assess sport/physical activity in athletes.

      Statistical Analysis

      Analyses will be carried out using SAS (Version 9.2, NC, USA, 2009) statistical software.
      Briefly, we will report descriptive data (height, weight, age, blood pressure, caffeine
      intake and habits, body fat %, VO2max, years in sport, training hours per week, dietary
      assessment data and other lifestyle measures) comparisons between genotype groups using
      independent t-tests. Potential differences in VO2max, 10 km time trial, anaerobic capacity,
      lactate threshold, power and strength and rate of perceived exertion will be assessed using
      repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) with treatment as a within participants
      factor and genotype as a between-participants factor. For all RMANOVA procedures, posthoc
      tests will be performed using independent and dependent t-tests with a Bonferroni correction
      such that P&lt; 0.05 will be required as the threshold for significance.

      Experimental Procedure

      Initial Screening - phone call or in-person visit

      Potential participants will verify their sports participation and ability to commit to four
      2-hour visits to the lab 7 days apart. Participants will be reminded of the importance of
      maintaining their regular diet. The importance of the required caffeine abstinence, including
      any caffeine-containing supplements for 7 days prior to the first visit and the duration of
      the study (4 weeks) will be emphasized and reiterated.

      Visit 1 (~90 min)

      The first visit to the laboratory will involve familiarization, and obtaining written
      informed consent from all participants after an explanation about the aims, benefits, and
      risks involved with the study. Participants will be informed that they are free to withdraw
      from the study at any time.

      Each subject will complete an &quot;exercise readiness&quot; questionnaire (PAR-Q; Physical Activity
      Readiness Questionnaire) have descriptive and anthropometric data collected, including date
      of birth, height, body mass, and blood pressure, and they will also provide a saliva sample
      for DNA isolation and genotyping. During this first visit, maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max;
      described below) will also be measured for descriptive baseline data, and to derive workload
      levels for experimental time trials on subsequent testing visits.

      Visit 2, 3 and 4 (~120 min)

      All three visits will be identical with the exception of the 20 min waiting period (then 10
      min pre-testing warm-up begins) for serum concentration of caffeine levels to reach peak
      levels, where the participant will complete a different questionnaire or sit quietly with
      their own activity.

      Upon arrival participants will have been randomly assigned (to maintain blinding) to ingest
      either the supplement at 2 or 4 mg of caffeine per kg body weight, or dextrose placebo
      (PLAC). Each participant will ingest the same number of capsules with identical color and
      size during each visit, whether it is 0, 2 or 4 mg/kg, in order to maintain double-blinding
      of treatment. Each subject will complete a questionnaire or sit quietly (e.g. reading, using
      e-devices etc.) while waiting for the first exercise test.

      Exercise test protocol will be identical for visits 2, 3 and 4. After 20 min, participants
      will warm-up for 10 min and then carry out 4 exercise tests (commencing at 30 min
      post-caffeine ingestion) to determine different measures of performance:

      i. Muscle power - Vertical Jump Test

      ii. Strength - Handgrip Dynamometer

      iii. Anaerobic Capacity - Wingate

      iv. Endurance/Aerobic Capacity (aerobic power) - 10 km Cycling Time Trial

      Participants may drink water ad libitum throughout the exercise tests.
