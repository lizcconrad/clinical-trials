  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Do adults and children over 7 years of age with unilateral or assymetric hearing loss benefit
      from cochlear implantation on the worst hearing side.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unilateral hearing loss is known to impair binaural hearing abilities. Specifically,
      localization, speech understanding in noise, and binaural squelch suffer due to lack of
      binaural timing and level cues. This study is designed to examine how binaural hearing is
      improved following cochlear implantation on the impaired side. The study endpoints are
      collected at 6 months and 12 months post activation of the implant.

      This is not a funded study. All costs are billed through insurance for reimbursement. There
      is an insurance approval process that we move through after a participant has been evaluated
      at the Mayo Clinic and found to be a candidate for cochlear implantation.

    <description>A dual task performance paradigm will be used in which both the primary task and the secondary task will be performed simultaneously. The primary task will consist of speech recognition testing in varying levels of background noise and quiet, whereas the secondary task will consist of a motor reaction to a randomly presented light</description>

        This study includes adults and children over 7 years of age who have suffered single sided
        deafness. Word understanding on the impaired side must not exceed 50% correct in the best
        aided condition.

        Adults

          -  18 years of age or older,

          -  Hearing loss in the ear to be implanted must such that speech understanding is not
             possible with a well fitted hearing aid. Specifically, less than 40% monosyllabic word
             understanding when that ear is tested in the best-aided condition and the other ear is
             sufficiently occluded or masked.

          -  Onset of hearing loss in the adult group must be post-lingual (after three years of
             age)

        Children

          -  Children 7 years of age and older

          -  Hearing loss in the ear to be implanted configured such that word understanding is
             less 40% in the best aided condition

          -  Onset of hearing loss in the pediatric group must be post-lingual (after three years
             of age)
