      Subjects presenting to UNC Hospitals for routine endoscopic surveillance examinations for
      current Barrett's Esophagus (BE) or after successful radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of
      dysplastic Barrett's Esophagus (BE) will be offered enrollment in the study. After informed
      consent, and the same day as the endoscopic procedure, the subject will undergo
      administration of the Cytosponge assay. The patient will then undergo routine endoscopic
      surveillance, using a standard Seattle biopsy surveillance protocol. The Cytosponge will be
      placed in fixative and shipped to the Fitzgerald laboratory at the University of Cambridge
      for processing according to their established protocols. Tissue biopsies will undergo
      standard processing and H&amp;E staining, with assessment by expert gastrointestinal pathologists
      at UNC. The primary outcome variables will be sensitivity and specificity of the novel assay,
      compared against the gold standard of the presence of recurrent BE as detected by upper
      endoscopy with biopsies. Secondary outcomes include acceptability of the nonendoscopic assay
      to the patient (assessed by a standardized tool, the Impact of Events Scale, as well as a
      visual analogue scale), and likelihood of assay positivity as a function of amount of
      residual disease (as measured by Prague criteria).

      Esophageal Adenocarcinoma is a Lethal Cancer with a Rapidly Increasing Incidence. Barrett's
      Esophagus (BE) is the Strongest Risk Factor for Esophageal Adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic
      Ablation Induces Reversion of Barrett's Esophagus, and Decreases Progression of Disease.
      Unfortunately, data demonstrate a risk of recurrence of BE following successful eradication.
      Recent data published by the candidate and colleagues from the Ablation of Intestinal
      Metaplasia Containing Dysplasia (AIM Dysplasia) study demonstrate that approximately 25% of
      subjects who experience successful eradication of dysplastic BE will develop recurrent BE.

      Therefore, following successful endoscopic ablation, patients receive ongoing endoscopic
      surveillance. More recently, a simple, non-endoscopic device, termed the Cytosponge, has been
      developed for endoscopic screening of subjects at risk for BE. Cytosponge demonstrated a
      sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 94% for the detection of BE.

      We expect these investigations to lead to a less costly, highly accurate, less invasive and
      more preferred screening paradigm for the large number of subjects who have undergone
      endoscopic ablative therapy.

      The Cytosponge is a simple, non-endoscopic device developed for endoscopic screening of
      subjects at risk for Barrett's esophagus (BE) by investigators at the University of Cambridge
      in the U.K. The Cytosponge is an ingestible capsule enclosing a compressed spherical mesh
      sponge of 3 cm diameter, the center of which is attached to a string. The capsule and string
      are swallowed with water. The string is held at the mouth without tension by means of a
      cardboard tab attached to the string, and esophageal peristalsis and gravity move the capsule
      into the stomach. After 5 minutes (during which the capsule dissolves and the sponge is
      liberated), the sponge is withdrawn by gentle traction on the string and as it does so,
      collects cells from the lining of the esophagus. The sponge is placed in fixative, then the
      cells are pelleted, and processed into paraffin blocks. The pellets are immunostained with
      trefoil factor 3, which is interpreted simply as either positive or negative by the presence
      of any staining.

    <description>Acceptability will be measured the Impact of Events Scale. This widely used scale was developed to assess the distress associated with a specific life event. It includes measures of both the intrusiveness of the event, and any avoidance responses by the subject in response to the event. The scale will be administrated both shortly after, and 7 days after, the sampling. In order to allow the subjects to have time to reflect on the experience and to compare with the EGD, the 7 day measurements will represent the primary acceptability outcome of the study. Secondary acceptability outcomes will include a visual analogue scale of acceptability of the Cytosponge, performed after the Cytosponge is administered. Also, the subject will be asked whether he/she would be willing to repeat the assay, and, assuming similar accuracy between Cytosponge and upper endoscopy, whether he/she would rather undergo surveillance by Cytosponge or standard esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsies.</description>

    <description>The Cytosponge is a simple, non-endoscopic device developed for endoscopic screening of subjects at risk for Barrett's esophagus (BE) by investigators at the University of Cambridge in the U.K. The Cytosponge is an ingestible gelatin capsule enclosing a compressed spherical polyurethane mesh sponge of 3 cm diameter, the center of which is attached to a string (Astralen, braided synthetic non-absorbable suture) (Figure 1). The capsule and string are swallowed with water. The string is held at the mouth without tension by means of a 7 cm cardboard tab attached to the string, and esophageal peristalsis and gravity move the capsule into the stomach. After 5 to 7 minutes (during which the gelatin capsule dissolves and the sponge is liberated), the sponge is withdrawn by gentle traction on the string and as it does so, collects cells from the lining of the esophagus. The sponge is placed in fixative for 48 hours, then the cells are pelleted, and processed into paraffin blocks</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects, age 18-80 years,

          2. Meets the following:

             2.1. Previous diagnosis of Barrett's Esophagus (BE) with dysplastic low grade
             dysplasia (LGD) or high grade dysplasia (HGD), as evidenced by both classical
             endoscopic appearance of salmon-colored mucosa in the tubular esophagus, as well as
             endoscopic biopsies from the involved areas demonstrating columnar metaplasia with
             goblet cells. The diagnosis of dysplasia must have been confirmed by a second expert
             pathologist. Previous endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) of focal nodular high grade
             dysplasia (HGD) or superficial intramucosal cancer (IMC) is allowable, as long as the
             EMR specimen shows complete resection of any IMC with clear margins, and biopsies
             following ablation confirm excision of the lesion, AND 2.1.1. A history of complete
             eradication of both dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia by radiofrequency ablation.
             Complete eradication is defined as a normal endoscopic appearance of the tubular
             esophagus, and histologic confirmation by biopsies in 4 quadrants every cm from
             throughout the length of the previous BE (post-RFA cohort).OR 2.2. Current diagnosis
             of BE, presenting for routine care endoscopy (BE cohort).

          3. Good general health, with no severely debilitating diseases, active malignancy, or
             condition that would interfere with study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current use of blood thinners such as coumadin, warfarin, clopidogrel, heparin and/or
             low molecular weight heparin (requires discontinuation of medication 5 days prior to
             and 7 days after esophagogastroduodenoscopy [EGD] and Cytosponge administration,
             aspirin use is OK).

          2. Known bleeding disorder

          3. For the post-RFA cohort, prior ablative therapy of the esophagus other than
             radiofrequency ablation (RFA), including photodynamic therapy (PDT), more than one
             session of spray cryotherapy, and any other ablation therapies is exclusionary.
             However, prior endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is acceptable and up to two prior
             treatments of thermal/coagulation therapy (other than RFA) for focal residual disease
             following otherwise successful RFA therapy is acceptable.

          4. History of esophageal stricture precluding passage of the endoscope or sponge,

          5. Pregnancy, or planned pregnancy during the course of the study,

          6. Any history of esophageal varices, liver impairment of moderate or worse severity
             (Child's- Pugh class B &amp; C) or evidence of varices noted on any past endoscopy,

          7. Any history of esophageal surgery, except for uncomplicated fundoplication, and,

          8. History of coagulopathy, with INR&gt;1.3 and/or platelet count of &lt;75,000.
