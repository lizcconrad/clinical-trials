  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy is an integral component of the current multimodality treatment approach in
      locally advanced head and neck cancer (HNC). There is growing evidence that more aggressive
      treatment regimens improve tumour control and survival. However, intensified treatment is at
      the expense of increased toxicity, in particular severe acute mucositis. In addition and of
      increasing importance, late and irreversible treatment-related side effects, including
      xerostomia and swallowing dysfunction, occur in a considerable proportion of patients and
      negatively affect quality of life.

      High-risk human papilloma virus (HPV), specifically HPV type-16, is implicated as the
      causative factor in a proportion of HNC, especially those of the oropharynx. HPV-related
      cancers respond well to chemoradiotherapy compared to HNC related to tobacco and alcohol.
      Furthermore, the incidence of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer is rising in Western
      countries. Given the significant toxicity associated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy,
      subsets of patients could be managed differently.

      The first objective of the project is to develop predictive models for radiation-induced
      dysphagia and xerostomia in HNC patients. Clinical characteristics, treatment parameters,
      dose-volume effects on healthy tissues and whole-genome genetic data will be considered. The
      second objective of the project is to study the prognostic value of HPV status together with
      a panel of tumour biomarkers in oropharyngeal cancer patients. The overall aim of the project
      is to stratify patients according to the risks (side-effects) and benefits (survival) of
      cancer treatment using the developed risk models. Clustering patients into different risk
      categories may aid treatment decision making reducing therapy toxicity without compromising
      survival.
