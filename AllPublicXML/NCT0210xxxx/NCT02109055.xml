  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major cause of mortality worldwide is due to cardiovascular diseases. A way to treat
      these diseases is coronary artery bypass grafting, one of the most common surgical procedures
      in the world. The incidence of post-operative complications contributes to functional decline
      of the patient, reduced quality of life and post-discharge mortality. Also, cardiac surgery
      leads to changes in lung capacity and respiratory muscle strength, causing a decrease in the
      function lung. Physical therapy proves to be an effective tool to combat changes resulting
      from cardiac surgery, demonstrating beneficial results in the pulmonary function, functional
      capacity, and peripheral and respiratory muscle strength. The Pilates method has been studied
      as a therapeutic way to healthy subjects and various kinds of diseases, but there are no
      studies in the literature evaluating the effect method in patients after coronary artery
      bypass surgery.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Pilates on functional capacity , flows
      and lung volumes, respiratory and peripheral muscle strength after coronary artery bypass
      grafting.

      Randomized clinical trial in which patients will be eligible after elective coronary artery
      bypass surgery, randomly allocated into two groups : conventional physiotherapy group (n =
      15) and Pilates method associated with conventional physiotherapy group (n = 15). The
      outcomes will be assessed by blinded evaluator and data randomization will be performed
      through by electronic randomization.The interventions will take place during the length of
      stay in the hospital, totalizing a maximum of six days of intervention.

      It is expected that the application of the Pilates method exercise method associated with
      conventional physiotherapy in patients in postoperative coronary artery bypass grafting
      improves functional capacity, flows and lung volumes and respiratory and peripheral muscle
      strength.

      The exercise program will be held during the period of hospitalization for six days, often
      two to three sessions per day, totaling 12 sessions. The intervention will start on the first
      day postoperatively. The program may not exceed 30% of maximum heart rate reserve of the
      patient that will be calculated by the Karvonen formula (Karvonen, Kentala et al., 1957). The
      exercises will be conducted at the patient's bedside, using light resistance springs
      representing the lowest possible burden of springs to be used in the Pilates method. The
      exercises will be performed on the upper limbs alternating between the left and right upper
      limb and likewise would run with the lower limbs by means of a protocol consists of four
      exercises until the limit of resistance of the patient or interrupt pre-established criteria.

      One set of each exercise with a range of up to two minutes between exercises will be held. In
      the first three days of intervention 10 repetitions of each exercise and the remaining three
      days a total of 15 repetitions of each movement will be performed.

    <description>Regarding upper limb exercises the limit of flexion and abduction less than 90°, with the exercises involving only the movement of flexion and extension of elbow shoulder will be respected. Along with patient data will be an exercise protocol based on the Pilates method that will be performed by a trained team of physiotherapists. Before and after the exercises the data of heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and subjective feeling of perceived exertion using the Modified Borg scale will be listed.</description>
