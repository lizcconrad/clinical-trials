  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project addresses cardiovascular disease risk in patients with prediabetes. Levels of
      lipids after eating a meal (&quot;postprandial lipids&quot;) are strong independent predictors of
      cardiovascular risk. Newer anti-diabetic agents - exenatide and saxagliptin - impact lipid
      metabolism. These medications will be studied for their effect in reducing both postprandial
      lipid levels and arterial dysfunction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a paradox that medical efforts to control blood glucose in type 2 diabetes mellitus
      have not decreased the risk of cardiovascular disease. Postprandial lipid concentrations are
      a strong predictor of cardiovascular risk, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk
      factors. The new classes of antidiabetic medications - GLP-1 agonists and DPP-IV inhibitors -
      affect lipid as well as glucose metabolism. This study will investigate the efficacy of these
      medications in reducing postprandial hyperlipidemia, disrupting the concurrent
      proinflammatory free fatty acid signaling, and ameliorating endothelial dysfunction in
      individuals with prediabetes. This will consist of a single center, randomized, crossover,
      placebo-controlled double-blinded prospective trial involving three study arms representing
      the aforementioned medications: exenatide (GLP-1 agonist), saxagliptin (DPP-IV inhibitor),
      and placebo (control arm). For each study arm, subjects will eat a standardized atherogenic
      high-fat test lunch. Venous blood draws and measurements of forearm blood flow will be done
      prior to the meal and periodically during a 6-hour period after the meal. Forearm blood flow
      measurements will assess for changes in endothelial function. The blood will be analyzed for
      multiple markers of hyperlipidemia and free fatty acid signaling. After completing the three
      randomized study visits, subjects are invited to participate in an optional, nonrandomized
      extension study. For the extension study, subjects will take exenatide ER (extended-release
      exenatide) weekly for total of six weeks. Then subjects return to eat a standardized
      atherogenic high-fat test lunch. Venous blood draws and measurements of forearm blood flow
      will be done prior to the meal and periodically during a 4-hour period after the meal, for
      the same analyses described before. The results will provide new insights into the
      anti-inflammatory effects of multiple antidiabetic medications via the mechanisms of
      postprandial hyperlipidemia, free fatty acid signaling, and endothelial function in
      prediabetic individuals.
