      Among the various functions impaired by aging there is the muscle function, which indirectly
      affects the quality of life for seniors, since it is crucial to the progressive increase of
      the debilitating condition, leading to difficulties in carrying out everyday tasks and often
      making them dependent on the assistance of others. The possible neural mechanisms underlying
      this decrease in muscle function associated with aging include changes undefined in Central
      Nervous System, a delay in conduction velocity of motor nerve fibers and in transmission of
      the neuromuscular junction. In this context, it is necessary to develop procedures that
      reduce the functional losses and decrease the negative effects of the aging process,
      increasing the quality of life for seniors. Mirror Therapy (MT) is the one of those possible
      procedures, which is based on the activation of mirror neurons from the illusion generated by
      viewing the reflection of a member in a mirror. When performing a movement with a member who
      is in your field of vision, generated the reflection in the mirror is able to offer the brain
      a new, albeit illusory visual stimulus, suggesting that covert member is moving. This
      illusion promotes the activation of mirror neurons located in the sensorimotor cortex region
      and the progression of therapy, this activation drives cortical plasticity that promotes the
      reestablishment of functions, such as motor coordination and increased range of motion.
      Therefore, MT is a promising technique to reduce the functional losses of aging. It is then
      suggested the implementation of a protocol for functional recovery of MT hands in
      institutionalized elderly and the measurement of electromyographic activity of the wrist, the
      range and speed of movement, the writing skill and the application of a questionnaire to Katz
      index calculation in order to investigate whether the technique can benefit this public.

    <description>Muscle electrical activity will be assessed at two different times, one related to the collection along with the dynamometer and another related to the simultaneous collection accelerometer.It is expected that after treatment with Mirror Therapy for 2 weeks has been an improvement of sensorimotor functions, gain muscle strength , uniformity of muscle fiber recruitment and improves muscle synergy and gain in speed of movements.</description>

    <description>Manual strength will be assessed with the electromyography, asking the volunteer to perform the maximal volunteer contraction when pressing the portable manual dynamometer. It is expected that after treatment with Mirror Therapy for 2 weeks has been an improvement of muscle strength.</description>

    <description>The volunteers will writing a specified phrase and they will received a paper with four four geometric forms (square, triangle, circle and rhombus) to follow the line. This task should be done for both hands. The skill will be analysed by using a computer software developed to calculate the distances between the original line of the form and the line performed by the volunteer.</description>
