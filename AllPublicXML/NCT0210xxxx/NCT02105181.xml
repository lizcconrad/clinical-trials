  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic treatment of benign biliary strictures can be challenging. Balloon dilation and/or
      plastic stent placement are currently the most popular techniques. Partially covered
      self-expandable metallic stents have also shown to be effective but can be difficult to
      remove. A novel fully covered metallic stent has recently been developed.

      The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the placement of fully covered
      self-expandable metallic stents (FCSEMS) in this setting.

      After inclusion, an endoscopic procedure (ERCP) was performed in all patients in order to
      place a FCMS across the benign biliary stricture. The FCMS was left in place for 6 months and
      then extracted during a second ERCP procedure. An opacification was performed to assess the
      efficacy of stenting. Patients were followed up during one year after FCMS extraction.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  a history of liver transplantation, chronic pancreatitis or biliary surgery

          -  impairment of liver function tests such as elevated liver enzymes and/or cholestasis

          -  a biliary stricture associated with ductal dilation detected by US, CT or MRI, with a
             minimum distance of 2cm between the upper stricture's edge and the lower limit of the
             main biliary confluence or liver hilum .

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  an uncertainty about the benign nature of the stricture

          -  an intra-hepatic cholangitis and/ or a stricture extending beyond the hilum
