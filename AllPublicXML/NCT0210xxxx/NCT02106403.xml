    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomised, examiner and subject blinded study is to evaluate and
      compare cooling performance and overall consumer liking of the prototype formulation with the
      currently marketed wound spray and negative control in subjects with experimental wounds. For
      each subject, three superficial wounds will be induced on two volar forearms, by sequential
      tape strippings until a glistening layer is visualized. After wounding, a randomised test
      product will be sprayed twice on test site, and the subject will be asked to complete a
      questionnaire evaluating product cooling performance and overall liking.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Sensory Liking of Study Products</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediatey, 3 min, 5 min and 15 min after product application</time_frame>
    <description>Overall sensory liking of the study products was assessed immediately, 3min, 5 min and 15 min after products application. The assessment was done on a 9 point categorical scale where 1= Dislike it extremely, 2= Dislike it very much, 3= Dislike it moderately, 4= Dislike it slightly, 5= Neither like it nor dislike it, 6= Like it slightly, 7= Like it moderately, 8= Like it very much, 9= Like it extremely.</description>
