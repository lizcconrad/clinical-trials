      The purpose of this study is to determine biomarkers of exposure to Harmful and Potentially
      Harmful Constituents (HPHCs) in Cigarette Smoke and cardiovascular-related biomarkers in
      smokers and non smokers.

    <textblock>
      Since Japanese mortality associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) is lower than that in
      the USA although Japan is one of the top four tobacco consuming countries, this study aims to
      determine biomarkers of both level of exposure and CVD-related biological effects in Japanese
      smokers compared to non-smokers.

      Biomarkers of Exposure (BoExp) include 2-naphthylamine (2-NA), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP),
      4-(methylnitrosaminoi)-1-(3-pyridil)-1-butanone (NNK), carbon monoxide (CO), nicotine, pyrene
      and 0-toluidine (o-TOL). CVD-related biomarkers include white blood cell (WBC) count, high
      sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and homocysteine in plasma; complemented with urinary
      8-epi-prostaglandin F2α (8-epi-PGF2α), plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), urinary 11-DTXB2, plasma
      fibrinogen, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and von
      Willebrand Factor.
