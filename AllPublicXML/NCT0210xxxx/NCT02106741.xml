    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two kinds of self-administered acupressure
      (relaxation acupressure and stimulating acupressure) to usual care for management of fatigue
      and pain in low back pain patients.

      Hypothesis: Self-administered relaxation acupressure will result in improvements in fatigue
      and sleep quality, pain, and physical function compared to stimulating acupressure and usual
      care.

      Acupressure is a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) technique based on a philosophy similar
      to that of acupuncture. It involves the application of physical pressure on different
      acupuncture points (acupoints). One advantage of acupressure is the ability to
      self-administer the treatment. Acupressure is also a viable alternative to acupuncture in
      situations where patients: (1) cannot come to the clinic to receive an acupuncture treatment;
      (2) when a more frequent intervention is needed; or (3) where needle phobia or safety
      concerns are an issue.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the validity and feasibility of teaching
      acupressure interventions using an acupressure educator for the management of symptoms
      related to low back pain.

      Specific aims:

        1. To examine the effect of 6-weeks of relaxation acupressure (RA) compared to a regime of
           stimulating acupressure (SA) or wait-list control (WL) on fatigue and sleep quality as
           assessed by Brief Fatigue Inventory and wrist-worn accelerometry (sleep efficiency).

        2. To explore the effect of 6-weeks of RA compared to a regime of SA or WL on for chronic
           low back pain in terms of reduced pain and improved function.

    <time_frame>Week 0 (baseline) and approximately 9 weeks (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue severity and interference in daily activities will be measured using the Brief Fatigue Inventory. Subjects will answer the BFI at both baseline and follow-up. To investigate a change from baseline in fatigue, the difference between the post-assessment outcomes and baseline measures will be calculated. Analyses on these differences will be performed using independent samples t-tests between treatment groups. We will also evaluate all continuous outcomes by ANCOVA, adjusting for baseline value and treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Sleep quality via objectively measured sleep efficiency</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 (baseline) and approximately 9 weeks (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>We will use wrist-worn accelerometry to assess sleep efficiency. Subjects will wear a wrist-worn accelerometer for 7 consecutive days (at baseline and follow-up) that collects in vivo sleep quality data; an accompanying logbook will be used to enhance objective data. To investigate a change from baseline in sleep efficiency, the difference between the post-assessment outcomes and baseline measures will be calculated. Analyses on these differences will be performed using independent samples t-tests between treatment groups. We will also evaluate all continuous outcomes by ANCOVA, adjusting for baseline value and treatment group.</description>

    <description>The relaxation acupressure protocol will use a set of nine fixed acupoints: forehead, twixt the eyebrows (unilateral); posterior neck, behind the ears (bilateral); palmer side of hand at wrist (bilateral); inside of lower leg (bilateral); top of foot (bilateral).
A trained acupressure educator will meet with each participant and demonstrate the sites and techniques for self-administered acupressure. Additionally, each participant will receive a demonstration DVD and a laminated handout detailing the locations of each acupoint.
Participants will be asked to perform daily acupressure sessions using the assigned sites. Each site is stimulated for 3 minutes, and the entire session can be completed in approximately 30 minutes.</description>
