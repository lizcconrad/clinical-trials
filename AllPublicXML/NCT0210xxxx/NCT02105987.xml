    <textblock>
      This study is a 48-week, Phase IIIb, randomly assigned, open-label, active-controlled,
      multicenter, parallel group, non-inferiority study. This study is designed to demonstrate the
      non-inferior antiviral activity of switching to the Abacavir (ABC) 600 milligrams
      (mg)/Dolutegravir(DTG) 50 mg/Lamivudine (3TC) 300 mg fixed-dose combination (FDC) compared
      with continuing the subject's current suppressive regimen through 24 weeks. The study will be
      conducted in approximately 538 Human Immunodeficiency Virus -1 (HIV-1) infected individuals
      who are on stable suppressive combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with 2 Nucleoside
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus either a protease inhibitor (PI), an
      non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or an integrase inhibitor (INI).
      Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned 1:1 to continue their current regimen
      (approximately 269 subjects) or be switched to ABC/DTG/3TC FDC (approximately 269 subjects)
      once daily for 24 weeks. At Week 24, individuals originally randomly assigned to continue
      their current regimen will switch to ABC/DTG/3TC FDC and be followed for an additional 24
      weeks. Individuals initially randomly assigned to ABC/DTG/3TC FDC will continue on that
      treatment arm for an additional 24 weeks. A pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy will be conducted
      at a small number of sites (approximately 10) to evaluate predose DTG concentrations as well
      as residual drug concentrations of efavirenz (EFV), nevaripine (NVP), amprenavir (APV) and
      tipranavir (TPV) in a subgroup of subjects who switch from EFV, NVP, fosamprenavir/ritonavir
      (FPV/r) or tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV/r).

    <measure>Number of Participants With Plasma HIV-1 Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) &lt;50 Copies Per Milliliter (c/mL) at Week 24 Using the Snapshot Algorithm</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) snapshot (Missing, Switch or Discontinuation = Failure) algorithm is intended to be primarily a virologic assessment of the endpoint, and as such follows a &quot;virology first&quot; hierarchy. Virologic Success (e.g., &lt;50 c/mL) or virologic failure within an analysis window is typically determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA measurement in that window and in the treatment phase of interest (e.g., Week 24 snapshot outcomes of the early switch phase will not use HIV-1 RNA data from the late switch phase, even if such data is within the Week 24 analysis window). A virologic failure occurs when a participant changes to their ART regimen (e.g., addition of other ARTs to the study-specified regimens, or switches in components of the current ART regimen).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) up to 24 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, based on medical or scientific judgment and all events of possible drug-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinemia. The DAIDS table for grading the severity of adult and pediatric AEs was utilized for AE reporting. The DAIDS estimates the severity grade as Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe) and Grade 4 (potentially life threatening) for each parameter.</description>

    <description>The number of participants with maximum post-Baseline emergent chemistry toxicities for each grade were summarized by parameter. A toxicity is considered emergent if it develops or increases in intensity from Baseline. For participants who were originally randomized to current ART regimen on Day 1 and then switched to ABC/DTG/3TC on Week 24, Baseline is defined as the last non-missing value from the early switch phase and maximum post-Baseline emergent during the late switch phase was determined relative to this Baseline. The DAIDS table for grading the severity of adult and pediatric AEs was utilized for AE reporting. The DAIDS defined the severity grade as Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe) and Grade 4 (potentially life threatening) for each parameter.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Treatment Satisfaction at Week 4 and Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The HIV treatment satisfaction questionnaire (TSQ) is a 10 item self-reported scale. Individual item scores range from 6 (very satisfied) to 0 (very dissatisfied). The treatment satisfaction total score (range 0-60) is the sum of all the 10 individual items. The general satisfaction/Clinical subscale (range 0-30) is the sum of the 5 clinical items and the lifestyle/ease subscale (range 0-30) is the sum of the remaining 5 lifestyle items. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) were used for the analysis. If a participant had a missing value at Week 24, his previous non-missing available value while on the same treatment was carried forward (ie the Week 4 or withdrawal value is used in the Week 24 summary for participants in the ABC/DTG3TC with missing Week 24 value). Data were analyzed using an ANCOVA model with factors including treatment, Baseline score and stratification factor. Treatment group difference (ABC/DTG/3TC-cART) estimate and 95% CI were presented.</description>

          -  Documentation that the subject is negative for the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
             B*5701 allele;

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusionary Medical Conditions

          -  Women who are breastfeeding;

          -  Any evidence of an active (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] Category
             C) disease. Exceptions include cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma not requiring systemic
             therapy and historic CD4+ cell counts of &lt;200 cells/cubic millimeter (mm).

          -  Subjects with any degree of hepatic impairment;

          -  Subjects positive for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (+HBsAg) at Screening or with
             an anticipated need for hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy during the study;

          -  History or presence of allergy to the study drugs or their components or drugs of
             their class;

          -  Ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, or
             resected, non-invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or cervical intraepithelial
             neoplasia; other localized malignancies require agreement between the investigator and
             the study medical monitor for inclusion of the subject;

          -  Subjects who, in the investigator's judgment, pose a significant suicidality risk.
             Recent history of suicidal behavior and/or suicidal ideation may be considered as
             evidence of serious suicide risk;

        Exclusionary Treatments Prior to Screening or Day 1

          -  Treatment with an HIV-1 immunotherapeutic vaccine within 90 days of Screening;

          -  Treatment with any of the following agents within 28 days of Screening: radiation
             therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, any immunomodulators that alter immune
             responses;

          -  Exposure to an experimental drug or experimental vaccine within either 28 days, 5
             half-lives of the test agent, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             test agent, whichever is longer, prior to the first dose of study drug;

          -  A history of use of only mono or dual NRTI therapy prior to starting cART;

          -  Use of etravirine at time of switch;

          -  Use of DTG at time of switch;

          -  Subjects receiving any prohibited medication listed in the protocol and who are
             unwilling or unable to switch to an alternate medication

        Exclusionary Laboratory Values or Clinical Assessments at Screening

          -  Evidence of primary viral resistance based on the presence of any
             resistance-associated major PI or any NRTI, NNRTI, or INI mutation in any prior
             resistance genotype assay result;

          -  Any verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality, with the exception of Grade 4
             triglyceride abnormalities. A single repeat test is allowed during the screening
             period to verify a result;

          -  Any acute laboratory abnormality at Screening, which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would preclude the subject's participation in the study of an
             investigational compound;

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;=5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), or ALT &gt;=3 ×
             ULN and bilirubin &gt;=1.5 × ULN (with &gt;35% direct bilirubin);

          -  Subject has CrCl of &lt;50 mL/min using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD);

          -  QTc (Bazett) &gt;=450 msec or QTc (Bazett) &gt;=480 msec for subjects with bundle branch
             block. The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Bazett's
             formula (QTcB). The QTc should be based on a single QTc value electrocardiogram (ECG)
             obtained.

          -  Eligibility of subjects for study participation will be decided by the investigators
             after taking into consideration various country specific guidelines, and
             notwithstanding the above mentioned minimum inclusion and exclusion criteria.

        <title>Number of Participants With Plasma HIV-1 Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) &lt;50 Copies Per Milliliter (c/mL) at Week 24 Using the Snapshot Algorithm</title>
        <description>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) snapshot (Missing, Switch or Discontinuation = Failure) algorithm is intended to be primarily a virologic assessment of the endpoint, and as such follows a “virology first” hierarchy. Virologic Success (e.g., &lt;50 c/mL) or virologic failure within an analysis window is typically determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA measurement in that window and in the treatment phase of interest (e.g., Week 24 snapshot outcomes of the early switch phase will not use HIV-1 RNA data from the late switch phase, even if such data is within the Week 24 analysis window). A virologic failure occurs when a participant changes to their ART regimen (e.g., addition of other ARTs to the study-specified regimens, or switches in components of the current ART regimen).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) up to 24 Weeks</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, based on medical or scientific judgment and all events of possible drug-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinemia. The DAIDS table for grading the severity of adult and pediatric AEs was utilized for AE reporting. The DAIDS estimates the severity grade as Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe) and Grade 4 (potentially life threatening) for each parameter.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With AEs Leading to Withdrawal Over 24 Weeks</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, based on medical or scientific judgment and all events of possible drug-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinemia.</description>

        <description>Change from Baseline for each fasting lipid parameters included cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. Adjusted mean is the estimated mean change from Baseline in each parameter at Week 24 in each arm calculated from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model which includes the following covariates: treatment, original ART third agent class, interaction of treatment and original ART 3rd agent, use of lipid modifying agent and Baseline lipid level. Difference is calculated as ABC/DTG/3TC - Current ART regimen. For fasting lipid assessments, an overnight fast is preferred; however, a minimum of a 6-hour fast was acceptable for participants with afternoon appointments.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Treatment Satisfaction at Week 4 and Week 24</title>
        <description>The HIV treatment satisfaction questionnaire (TSQ) is a 10 item self-reported scale. Individual item scores range from 6 (very satisfied) to 0 (very dissatisfied). The treatment satisfaction total score (range 0-60) is the sum of all the 10 individual items. The general satisfaction/Clinical subscale (range 0-30) is the sum of the 5 clinical items and the lifestyle/ease subscale (range 0-30) is the sum of the remaining 5 lifestyle items. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) were used for the analysis. If a participant had a missing value at Week 24, his previous non-missing available value while on the same treatment was carried forward (ie the Week 4 or withdrawal value is used in the Week 24 summary for participants in the ABC/DTG3TC with missing Week 24 value). Data were analyzed using an ANCOVA model with factors including treatment, Baseline score and stratification factor. Treatment group difference (ABC/DTG/3TC-cART) estimate and 95% CI were presented.</description>

        <description>Renal markers included urea and summarized based on an OC data set at Week 24. Adjusted mean is the estimated mean change from Baseline in each biomarker at Week 24 in each arm calculated from an ANCOVA analysis of covariance model including the following covariates: treatment, original ART third agent class, interaction of treatment and original ART third agent class, and Baseline biomarker level. Differences are calculated as ABC/DTG/3TC - Current ART regimen.</description>
