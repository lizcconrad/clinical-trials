      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of upper airway
      muscle physical therapy utilizing negative airway pressure (NAP) breathing training in
      patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) in reducing both signs (apnea hypopnea
      index) and symptoms (i.e., daytime sleepiness).The key to the proposed therapy is the use of
      Negative Air Pressure when awake so that the increased reflex phasic drive to the muscles
      will result in muscle conditioning. Interestingly, other studies have indicated that upper
      airway muscle training may be useful in treating OSAS, but these studies used techniques that
      were not scientifically designed{Puhan, 2006 8195 /id} or used a technique (electrical
      stimulation) that was not well tolerated.{Lequeux, 2005 7514 /id}

      Overview: Subjects with OSAS (but not using continuous positive airway pressure CPAP) will
      undergo NAP physical therapy of the upper airway, utilizing a physiologically determined
      training pressure and protocol, three days a week (approximately 30 minute sessions each) for
      a period of three months. Overnight sleep studies (PSGs) will be performed pre- and
      post-study. Primary outcome measurements include the pre- and post-study Apnea/Hypopnea index
      (AHI) and daytime hypersomnolence symptom scores. Each subject's total study time is
      approximately a 3-4 month period which includes screening visit, pre and post study overnight
      polysomnography, and therapy sessions of 3-4 a week for three months.

    <description>The pre-study AHI (before the NAP treatment was applied) was measured and quantified and compared to the post study AHI (after three months of NAP treatment) and the difference between pre and post therapy is reported. The AHI is an hourly rate of breathing disturbance (apneas and hypopneas per hour) that is calculated while subjects are evaluated during an overnight sleep study, with polysomnography applied (PSG). For example, while a subject is spending the night in the PSG laboratory sleeping, his/her breathing is evaluated for evidence of apneas and hypopneas during various stages of sleep. Sleep is measured with electroencephalography. And breathing is measure with respiratory excursions via chest/abdominal plethysmography recordings and airflow from the nose/mouth.</description>
