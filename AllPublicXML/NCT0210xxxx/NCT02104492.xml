  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common inflammatory demyelinating chronic disease of the
      central nervous system and the second leading cause of disability in young adults. Motor
      deficits also involve respiratory muscles. This involvement is present from early stages of
      disease and is frequently dismissed by professionals until advanced stages of disease. The
      effect of a training program of respiratory muscles is not sufficiently studied. The aim of
      this research is to assess the clinical and functional response of a 12-week respiratory
      muscles training program (RMTP) for persons with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis
      (RRMS).

      This study is consisted with two sub research:

      Firstly, a single-blind randomized clinical trial will be carried out in 40 persons with
      RRMS. Participants either will be received (n = 20) peripheric resistive muscle training
      program which will be supplemented by a 12-week Respiratory Muscles Training Program (RMTP)
      with ORYGEN Dual速 device for 50 minutes, twice a week during three months or (n = 20) they
      will be received peripheric resistive muscle training program and health education program.
      Main outcomes will be strength of the respiratory muscles assessed by maximal inspiratory and
      expiratory pressure measurements (MIP and MEP). The secondary outcomes will be assessed the
      quality of life (MSQOL-54), walking speed (T25-FW, MSWS-12 and Hauser ambulatory index),
      fatigue (MFIS), endurance of the respiratory muscles (10RM) manoeuvre and peripherical muscle
      strength (Multiple-Sit-to-Stand Test and handgrip strength).

      Secondly, the qualitative research where researchers will interview participants about their
      interest in carrying out the intervention (difficulties and advantages) and identify themes
      of interest about changes in quality of life.

    <description>Every session will be lasted 50 minutes and performed under supervision of a physiotherapist. It will be comprised of 30 minutes of progressive aerobic training program followed by peripheric resistive muscle training program which will be supplemented by a 12-week Respiratory Muscles Training Program (RMTP) with ORYGEN Dual速 device for 20 minutes. Patients will be instructed to maintain adequate inspiration and expiration while using the Origen-Dual速 valve at a rate of 15-20 breaths/minute. Participants will be performed five sets of 10 repetitions followed by 1-2 minutes of unloaded recovery breathing off the device, once a day, 2 days per week, for 12 weeks. The respiratory muscles training will be begun at 30% of MIP achieved at baseline and increased by 5% each week to reach 60% of the baseline assessment MIP.</description>
