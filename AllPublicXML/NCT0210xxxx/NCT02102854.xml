    <textblock>
      Rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) is approved for the treatment of acute rejection
      following kidney transplantation and is routinely administered as a series of 5-7 consecutive
      daily doses via central intravenous catheter.Single large-doses of rATG have been shown to
      have equivalent safety and efficacy profile compared to the standard daily protocol when used
      as an induction agent but there are no reported experiences of its use for rejection
      treatment. Plan to study a single-dose rATG infusion compared to standard rATG administration
      including correlation to length of hospital stay and hospital costs.

    <textblock>
      Rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) is approved for the treatment of acute rejection
      following kidney transplantation and is routinely administered as a series of 5-7 consecutive
      daily doses via central intravenous catheter. This prolonged course is not consistent with
      the Medicare diagnosis-related group (DRG) for acute rejection which limits rejection
      admission to 3 days. The prolonged hospitalization results in increased medical costs and
      uniform financial loss to the hospital for patients admitted under this DRG. In addition
      there is a patient related toll of the prolonged hospitalization and a potential for
      additional hospital acquired complications. Single large-doses of rATG have been shown to
      have equivalent safety and efficacy profile compared to the standard daily protocol when used
      as an induction agent but there are no reported experiences of its use for rejection
      treatment. The investigators hypothesize that single-dose rATG infusion will be as safe and
      efficacious as standard rATG administration when used for rejection treatment and would
      result in significant reduction in the length of hospital stay (LOS) and hospital costs for
      rejection treatment.
