      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, safety and efficacy study of ataluren in patients
      with nonsense mutation cystic fibrosis who participated in the previous Phase 3 study with
      ataluren (PTC124-GD-009-CF; Study 009). The primary objective of this study is to determine
      the long-term safety and tolerability of ataluren in patients with nmCF, as assessed by
      adverse events and laboratory abnormalities. The secondary objective of this study includes
      the assessment of the efficacy of ataluren, as measured by FEV1 and pulmonary exacerbation
      rate, and change from baseline in other safety parameters (eg, 12-lead ECG measurements,
      vital signs). Study subjects will be enrolled at approximately 17 sites in the United States,
      Europe and Israel that previously participated in Study PTC124-GD-009-CF. All study subjects
      will receive 10-, 10-, and 20-mg/kg ataluren (PTC124) 3 times per day (morning, midday and
      evening, respectively) for 192 weeks. Subjects will be evaluated at clinic visits every 16
      weeks and supplemented with interim phone calls in between onsite visits. A final 4-week
      post-treatment follow-up visit will also be conducted.
