  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of the study are to better understand how upper extremity injury and immobilization
      influences a patient's steering ability. Patients with acute distal radius fractures treated
      with surgery will be recruited for study in a driving simulator. The results will hopefully
      assist physicians to better counsel patients with upper extremity injuries on when it is safe
      to return to driving.

      The ability of an injured person to safely drive an automobile while immobilized in an upper
      extremity cast or splint is not well defined.

      The aims of the study are to better understand how upper extremity injury and immobilization
      influences a patient's steering ability. The secondary aim is to further evaluate the
      effectiveness of a steering wheel spinner-knob to assist with one-handed driving. A steering
      wheel spinner knob may be a surrogate to assist with one handed driving while immobilized.
