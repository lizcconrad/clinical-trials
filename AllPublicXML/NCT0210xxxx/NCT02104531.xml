      The investigators purpose is to determine the ability of a low cost, currently available
      imaging technique to predict shoulder movement disorders and the location of shoulder disease
      based on motion analysis of subjects with known shoulder disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder disorders account for the second largest number of musculoskeletal cases in the
      United States with a large health care burden. The current standard for diagnosis of shoulder
      disorders is a clinical exam, visual motion assessment and in some cases, costly magnetic
      resonance (MR) imaging. However, specific tissue pathologies are not always accurately
      identified, and often not directly linked to the magnitude of dysfunction. There is a need
      for categorizing or sub-grouping patients based on the underlying movement dysfunctions with
      which they present. Video fluoroscopy is a common clinical tool that can improve the accuracy
      of motion analysis. The investigators are using 2-D fluoroscopy, combined with 3-D MR imaging
      to measure shoulder motion. From the motion analysis we can predict areas of potential soft
      tissue disease, and compare these to disease locations from MR imaging. The investigators
      hypotheses is that our motion based predicted disease locations will be significantly
      associated with disease locations from MR imaging.

    <description>Measures will predict presence/absence of rotator cuff disease in each of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis muscles (rotator cuff).
Subjects are not followed, there is no intervention. The assessment timeframe is dependent on subjects volunteering for the study and can range from 1 month to 10 years from initial onset of their condition.</description>

    <description>Shoulder joint motion will be assessed as within normal limits, increased or decreased for both rotational and translational motion of the humerus.
One cross sectional timepoint assessed, subjects are not followed. Timeframe may be 1 month to 10 years from initial symptom onset.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Normal subjects with normal normal shoulder movement and function will be included,
             age and gender matched to symptomatic subjects.

          -  Symptomatic subjects will be included if visual shoulder movement deviates from what
             might be considered normal; they are experiencing shoulder pain with movement, and
             clinical examination is consistent with soft tissue cumulative trauma to the soft
             tissues (rotator cuff disease).

          -  Clinical MR imaging will be used to confirm rotator cuff disease, subacromial
             bursitis, and/or bicipital tendinitis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age outside the accepted range. Contraindications to radiation exposure (pregnancy or
             possible pregnancy, other recent substantive radiation exposures (CT scanning,
             treatments involving radiation). Subjects unable to move through at least 90 degrees
             of shoulder motion will also be excluded.
