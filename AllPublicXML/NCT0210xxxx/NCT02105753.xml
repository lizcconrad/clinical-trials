  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary axillary hyperhidrosis is a common idiopathic disorder of the eccrine sweat glands
      that interferes with daily activities and causes significant social distress. This pilot
      study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and histologic effects of the 1210nm diode laser
      for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis. Initial results may inform the design of an
      anticipated larger prospective controlled trial. Study participants will receive one laser
      treatment to one randomly-assigned axilla using the 1210 nm diode laser, and two treatments
      to the opposite axilla. Changes in sweating will be measured both by quantitative gravimetric
      analysis of sweat production and by expert panel evaluation of photographs of the
      starch-iodine test performed on each axilla. Participants will also be asked to subjectively
      classify the severity of their axillary sweating. These measures will be performed at
      pretreatment and at one, three, and six months following treatment. Biopsies of both axillae
      will be done before and two weeks after treatment to assess histologic changes to the eccrine
      gland and surrounding structures. Treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis with the 1210nm diode
      laser is a novel approach based on the unique absorption characteristics of this wavelength.
      We hypothesize that selective heating of lipids at the appropriate tissue level will impact
      adjacent eccrine glands typically seated at the dermo-hypodermal junction, leading to
      subjective and/or objective decreases in eccrine secretions. This type of treatment may offer
      an effective, non-invasive and safe alternative to current treatment modalities.

Changes in sweat production from a single and double treatment using treatment parameters designed to deliver heat to the dermo-hypodermal junction will be measured. Subjective assessment of outcome will also be measured. The objective and subjective measurement instruments are detailed in the methods section below.Prior to any treatment, baseline level of sweat production will be evaluated with three instruments: A subjective global assessment questionnaire, gravimetric analysis, and the modified starch-iodine test.</description>
