             systemic therapy.

          -  Had a PASI of ≥12

          -  At least 10% of body surface area that is affected by plaque psoriasis.

          -  Willing to avoid tanning devices or sun bathing.

          -  Willing to forgo systemic and topical treatments for psoriasis during the course of
             the study.

             during the study and for 1 month after the termination of the study.

          -  Willing to complete all study measurements and assessments in compliance with the
             protocol.
