      This study will look at two new technologies being developed for measuring cancer in bones.
      One of these technologies is a substance called Sodium Fluoride (NaF). Fluoride is a normal
      body substance. The amount that patients will receive has been shown to be very safe. One
      study of over 400 patients showed no adverse reactions after receiving the recommended
      dosage.

      NaF (known as a radiotracer) is taken up into the bones under a normal process and
      researchers can measure the amount within patient's bones through an imaging system called a
      Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PET/MRI). This system combines
      aspects of both a PET study as part of the regular standard of care and an MRI study. The
      belief is that the combination of these two studies will be better than either study
      alone.People who have enrolled in this study will receive their clinically requested PET/CT
      scan as part of their normal diagnostic care and will follow all the said recommendations for
      this study such as not being pregnant, having fasted overnight, etc. Subjects will return
      within 7 days for a 10 mCi NaF PET/MRI study. The patients' imaging time will be up to 120
      minutes depending on the MRI sequences acquired. Imaging for the PET portion of the study
      will take approximately 20-30 minutes with the rest of the time devoted to MRI sequences.

      The primary aim of this study is to assess NaF PET/MRI compared to NaF PET/CT and standard of
      care imaging made available for assessment of bone metastases in all cancers as well as other
      standard of care indications for MDP bone scintigraphy. The study will use both the currently
      available and approved MRI sequences for attenuation correction and localization as well as
      non FDA approved sequences to assess the ability of the modality to identify bone metastases.

      Study Goals:

        1. Assess the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy of NaF PET/MRI vs. Naf PET/CT vs. current
           standard of care imaging. This will be done on a lesion by lesion basis based on a prior
           study looking at NaF PET/CT (14). Lesions that are positive on NaF PET/MRI but not on
           other imaging will be followed up on future imaging to see if they eventually become
           positive given that physiology changes before anatomy. Follow up will include both
           repeat NaF PET/CT (PET/MRI) studies (as per standard of care MDP bone scintigraphy
           indications) as well as review of other surveillance standard of care imaging up to 6
           months after the NaF PET/CT (PET/MRI) was done.

        2. Assess various NaF MRI sequences for attenuation correction and localization both from
           approved and developmental sequences compared to NaF CT attenuation corrected images
           through software.

        3. Assess the ability of MRI sequences acquired for attenuation correction and localization
           to evaluate bone metastases in comparison to other modalities.

        4. Assess the image quality of various NaF MRI sequences acquired for attenuation
           correction and localization using both approved and developmental sequences.

        5. Ascertain, if there are lesions identified on the NaF PET/MRI study but not seen on the
           NaF PET/CT study (or other standard of care imaging) or vice versa.
