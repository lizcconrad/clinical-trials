  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patients with sepsis are in high risk of malnutrition, which could contribute to
      infection, difficulty in weaning from ventilators. The investigators speculate whether
      nutrition therapy with high nitrogen could attenuate the malnutrition status and improve the
      outcome in these sepsis patients. In this prospective Randomized Controlled Trial, the
      investigators aim to compare high nitrogen intake with conventional nitrogen supply which
      were recommended in guidelines.
