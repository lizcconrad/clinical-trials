  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that this Phase 2 cellular and adoptive immunotherapy study
      using human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)
      followed by an early, post-transplant infusion of donor natural killer (NK) cells on Day +7
      will not only be well-tolerated in this heavily-treated population (safety), but will also
      provide a mechanism to treat high-risk solid tumors, leading to improved disease control rate
      (efficacy). Disease control rate is defined as the combination of complete (CR) and partial
      (PR) response and stable disease (SD). The investigators further propose that this infusion
      of donor NK cells will influence the development of particular NK and T cell subtypes which
      will provide immediate/long-term tumor surveillance, infectious monitoring, and durable
      engraftment.

      Patients with high-risk solid tumors (Ewings Sarcoma, Neuroblastoma and Rhabdomyosarcoma) who
      have either measurable or unmeasurable disease and have met eligibility will be enrolled on
      this trial for a goal enrollment of 20 patients over 4 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen for 6 days that consists of
      Fludarabine 150 mg/m2, Cyclophosphamide 29 mg/kg, and 3 Gy total body irradiation (TBI),
      followed by HLA-haploidentical marrow from a family member on Day 0. On Days +3 and +4,
      Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg will be infused for selective in vivo T cell depletion. Additional
      post-grafting immune suppression will consist of mycophenolate mofetil and either tacrolimus
      or sirolimus.

      Non-mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be collected from donors on Day +6,
      from which NK cells will be selected and infused into patients on Day +7.

      Patients will be monitored for any transplant-related complications and will undergo disease
      monitoring every three months for the first two years post-transplant. Research studies will
      be conducted to follow the patient's immune status and quality of life post-transplant.

        DONOR SELECTION An Unrelated Donor Search is not required for entry on this trial. Lack of

        A. Inclusion Criteria

          1. Related, HLA-haploidentical donors who are identical for one HLA haplotype and
             mismatched for any number of HLA-A, -B, -C, DRB1 or DQB1 loci of the unshared
             haplotype.

          2. Marrow will be prioritized as the hematopoietic stem cell source of choice. In cases
             where adequate stem cells cannot be collected, fresh (preferred) or cryopreserved
             donor PBSC may be substituted. In the case that PBSC are used, the donor must be 18
             years of age or older.

          3. HLA-haploidentical donor selection will be based on standard institutional criteria;
             otherwise no specific prioritization will be made amongst the suitable available
             donors.

        B. Exclusion Criteria

          1. Children less than 12 years of age (marrow) or less than 18 years of age (PBSC).

             the recipient's care team

          3. Children greater than or equal to 12-17.9 years of age who have inadequate peripheral
             vein access to safely undergo apheresis

          5. Donors who are not expected to meet the minimum target dose of marrow cells (1 x 108
             total nucleated cells/kg recipient weight) for the initial marrow HCT or PBSC
             transplant (5.0 x 106 CD34/kg recipient weight). The average nucleated cell content of
             harvested marrow is 22 x 106 nucleated cells/mL or 220 x 108 total nucleated
             cells/Liter
