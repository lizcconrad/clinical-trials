  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is a routinely performed procedure in children and adolescents. Proper
      visualization of the intestinal mucosa is highly dependent on the quality of the bowel
      preparation. European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) emphasizes that the timing
      of bowel preparation is the key factor and recommends that the delay between the last dose of
      bowel preparation and colonoscopy should be minimized. Timing of bowel preparation prior to
      colonoscopy has not been studied in children population, yet. The diet regimen before
      colonoscopy is likely less important than the timing of bowel preparation, however may
      influence the well-being of children.
