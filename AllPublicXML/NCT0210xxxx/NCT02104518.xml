      In this study we propose to evaluate the performance of several G6PD testing platforms. We
      will also determine the concordance between point-of-care G6PD tests and the
      spectrophotometric gold standard. This study will also access the sensitivity and specificity
      between the point-of-care G6PD tests. This study will take place in Indonesia, specifically
      in the SW Sumba region. We will enroll 700 volunteers.

        We will enroll up to 700 volunteers from the SW Sumba region in Indonesia. The SW Sumba
        region is inland, and isolated from other nearby villages. The general population of SW
        Sumba are substance farmers.
