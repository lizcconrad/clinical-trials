  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine the abuse liability of a single 40mg dose of 2
      controlled release oxycodone formulations (Apo-Oxycodone CR® and OxyNEO®) in non-dependent
      recreational opioid users by assessing the self-reported acute effects of the drugs and
      taking blood samples to measure drug concentrations. The investigators think there may be
      differences in how well these drugs are liked when swallowed whole due to differences in how
      the products are formulated.

      This is a single-center, single-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized,
      crossover, abuse liability study conducted in healthy subjects who are non-dependent
      recreational opioid users. The study consists of 3 study days during which each subject will
      take one tablet of either 40mg OxyNEO®, 40mg Apo-Oxycodone CR®, or placebo. The participants
      will be assessed for both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic outcomes.
