  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advanced heart failure (when the heart pump fails) is associated with symptoms such as
      shortness of breath and extreme fatigue. Some of these symptoms are simply due to failure of
      the pump, however abnormal regulation of blood flow to the muscles of the body is also a
      potential mechanism. Left ventricular assist devices are mechanical pumps used to compensate
      for patients with failing hearts either as a bridge to heart transplant or as long term
      therapy. Whether or not these pumps improve muscle flow and whether this is a determinant in
      the improvement of symptoms is unknown. Understanding how skeletal muscle and heart perfusion
      is altered in heart failure patients before and after implantation of an LVAD could provide
      further insight into the beneficial effects of this therapy.

      Specific Aims:

        1. To evaluate skeletal muscle and heart perfusion studies before and after LVAD
           implantation

        2. To compare functional status with degree of skeletal muscle perfusion.

      Methods:

      Thirty patients deemed to be candidates for LVAD from either outpatient heart failure clinic
      or inpatient cardiology service will be studies. Skeletal muscle perfusion imaging using
      standard of care ultrasound technology will be performed prior to LVAD implant and then 3
      months post implant. Functional status by six minute walk test and specialized stress test
      will be assessed at 3 months post implant.
