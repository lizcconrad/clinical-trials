      The purpose of this study is to: (a) adapt existing vaginal USPE items/instruments for
      evaluation of similar elements of rectal compartment use; (b) develop these scales using 3
      distinct semi-solid formulations that represent a range of physicochemical and rheological
      properties of microbicides that are currently being designed for dual compartment use; and
      (c) develop novel USPE instruments to capture the experience of product use in the context of
      receptive anal intercourse (RAI) in both male and female cohorts.

      HIV prevention is a global public health priority. Providing efficacious prevention methods
      that have the greatest likelihood of use will have a profound impact on the public's health.
      Critical to their use is &quot;acceptability.&quot; However, current conceptualizations of adherence
      and acceptability fail to fully articulate and account for patterns of use and non-use.
      Formulation properties are critically important to both drug delivery and the user
      experience. Microbicide developers thus have the opportunity to directly control a
      formulation's impact on acceptability and adherence to product use, as well as biological
      product performance. Microbicide products can and should be developed such that they achieve
      performance standards for both these behavioral (user experience) and biological (efficacy)
      functions. By incorporating the user experience early on in the product development process,
      developers will have the greatest chance of providing at-risk individuals with the best
      prevention methods science can provide. Developing prevention products that can be used in
      the vagina and/or the rectum and that optimize the user experience in both compartments
      increases the likelihood that these products will be used consistently and correctly. The
      impact on global public health has the potential to be far-reaching, decreasing HIV and
      sexually transmitted infections (STI) incidence and prevalence in both women and men.

      Methodology and Data Collection: This is a formative mixed methods design in which volunteers
      (N~20-30; ~8-20 males; ~8-20 Females) will first be prescreened for basic study eligibility
      using a brief questionnaire. Those who are interested in the study and are eligible based on
      their responses to the prescreen will then complete a STI/HIV screening and pregnancy test
      (for females).

      During the course of the study, participants will evaluate 3 study products (i.e., distinct
      semi-solid formulations that represent a range of physicochemical and rheological
      properties). Each participant will be randomly assigned to the order in which they will
      evaluate the 3 products. Participants will be required to complete a brief phone survey (&lt;5
      minutes) every day, beginning the day after they start their first product evaluation period
      and continuing until they complete their final study visit (approximately 12-24 weeks). The
      phone survey includes a short set of questions about sexual behavior and product use during
      the time since the last phone survey (about 24 hours). After a sexual encounter that includes
      RAI and study product use, participants will be required to complete a web survey about their
      experience with the study product. After a participant has evaluated all three products,
      participants complete an individual in-depth interview and a cognitive interview with study
      staff about their experiences with the study product and the USPE scale items being
      developed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All participants must meet all of the inclusion criteria to participate in this study.
