  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Progress in developing new effective therapies in advanced and relapsing urothelial cancer
      has been stagnant in the last few decades and a paradigm shift is desperately needed. Aurora
      kinase-A overexpression has been previously described in bladder cancer and spindle
      checkpoint dysregulation is a common feature of human urothelial carcinoma (UC).

      Alisertib (Millennium Inc.) is an orally available, selective small molecule inhibitor of
      Aurora A kinase. Single agent and combination treatment of MLN8237 with either paclitaxel
      (TXL) or gemcitabine synergistically reduced UC cell viability compared with either drug
      alone. Hence, sequential application of MLN8237 and TXL warrants clinical investigation.
      Phase 1 trials of both single agent and the combination with TXL defined the recommended
      doses for phase 2 trials.

      Methods:

      A multistep approach will be adopted for this Phase 2 trial. A single-group run-in phase will
      be conducted first with Alisertib 50 mg orally BID for 7 days, followed by 14d rest until
      disease progression. In case of activity, a confirmatory randomized (1:1) trial of weekly TXL
      plus either Alisertib or Placebo will follow, incorporating efficacy and futility boundaries
      for early stopping. In a single-blind design, TXL will be given on days 1,8,15 q4wks at the
      dose of 60 mg/m2 with alisertib and 80 mg/m2 with placebo. Alisertib dose will be 40 mg BID
      days 1-3, 8-10 and 15-17, q4wks.

      In the single-arm phase, primary endpoint (EP) will be Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 response-rate. 20 pts will be accrued, â‰¥3 responses will be required (10%
      type I and 20% type II error constraints). An accrual of 110 pts is foreseen in the
      randomized phase. Primary EP: progression-free survival (PFS), assuming an improvement in PFS
      from a median of 2.5 months (H0) to a median of 4.5 months (H1) (44% hazard rate reduction,
      10% drop out rate).

      Eligibility will include diagnosis of metastatic UC and failure of 1-2 CT regimens
      (single-arm) or 1 prior CT only (randomized phase). A relapse within 6 months of a
      peri-operative CT will be counted as 1 line. Computed tomography and PET will be done every 2
      cycles (2 months). Additional pharmacodynamic and translational analyses are planned on pre-
      post- blood and tissue samples.

    <description>Randomized Phase:
Progression free survival will be the primary endpoint. It is foreseen in this phase an accrual of 110 patients, equally balanced in the two arms, in about 36 months and an overall study duration of 40 months, over which we expect to observe 101 disease progressions or deaths. This is the number of events necessary to yield 90% power of a one sided logrank test at the 5% significance level in case of an improvement in PFS from a median of 2.5 months (H0) to a median of 4.5 months (H1), corresponding to a 44% hazard rate reduction in the experimental arm compared to control.</description>
