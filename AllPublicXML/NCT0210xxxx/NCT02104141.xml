      The purpose of this combination retrospective and prospective post market study is to examine
      the short term safety and efficacy of the ROI-A® interbody fusion device with VerteBRIDGE®
      plates to treat single and two-level degenerative disc disease between L2 and S1, with a
      focus on fusion rates and patient outcomes.
