  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy (RT) is one of the primary treatments for bone cancer pain due to
      metastatic cancer disease. About 6 of 10 patients obtain pain relief from RT. There are no
      established predictors that can be used to select patients that respond to RT. This raises
      the need to identify potential clinical characteristics and biomarkers that may better select
      patients for RT. A similar argument can be stated for the development of cachexia; there are
      currently no predictors that can identify patients who will develop cachexia later in the
      cancer disease trajectory. Cancer symptoms can be related to inflammation. Both pain,
      cachexia and depression are associated with inflammation in experimental and preclinical
      studies . Still, the clinical data on the relationship between inflammation and pain or
      cachexia are sparse. This is especially true for longitudinal follow-up studies.

      This study will include 1000 adult patients in a multicenter, multinational longitudinal
      observation study of patients who receive radiation therapy for bone cancer pain. Demographic
      data, clinical variables, genetic biomarkers and inflammatory substances will be assessed
      before start of RT. The primary analysis in the study is to identify potential predictors for
      pain relief from RT. During follow up the study will also explore for predictors for
      development of cachexia and which inflammatory substances that are associated with changes in
      pain intensity, depression and development of cachexia.

    <description>Complete response implies a numeric rate scale (NRS) worst pain of zero at the treated site on an 11-point rating scale, with no concomitant increase in analgesic intake.
Partial response is defined as either i) pain reduction of two or more at the treated site on the 11-point NRS worst pain rating scale together with no increase in analgesic intake, or ii) reduction in analgesic intake of at least 25 per cent from baseline without an increase in pain score at the treated site.
An &quot;intermediate response&quot; category represents any response other than complete or partial response or pain progression</description>
