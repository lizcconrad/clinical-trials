      The purpose of this study is to characterize the natural history of HPP in patients with
      Juvenile-onset HPP.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a life-threatening, genetic, and ultra-rare metabolic disease
      characterized by defective bone mineralization and impaired phosphate and calcium regulation
      that can lead to progressive damage to multiple vital organs, including destruction and
      deformity of bones, profound muscle weakness, seizures, impaired renal function, and
      respiratory failure. There are no approved disease-modifying treatments for patients with
      this disease. There is also limited data available on the natural course of this disease over
      time, particularly in patients with the juvenile-onset form.

    <measure>Radiographic Global Impression of Change - RGI-C</measure>
    <time_frame>Between Baseline (earliest available, complete, and readable x-ray set) and all available, readable post-Baseline x-ray sets during the period of patients' aged 5 to 15 years, inclusive.</time_frame>
    <description>The RGI-C scale is a 7-point ordinal scale that is used to evaluate musculoskeletal characteristics of HPP (eg, metaphyseal fraying, demineralization of distal metaphyses). The scores range from -3 (severe worsening) to +3 (complete or near-complete healing).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Height Z-score From Baseline to Last Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Any available growth data during the period of patients' aged 5 to 15 years, inclusive. Baseline is the earliest available assessment while post baselines are time points after Baseline during the defined age period.</time_frame>
    <description>Height measurements were assigned to Z-scores which were calculated using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2000 growth charts and methodology. The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean. A Z-score of 0 is equal to the mean with negative numbers indicating values lower than the mean and positive values higher. Higher Z-scores indicate a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Weight Z-score From Baseline to Last Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Any available growth data during the period of patients' aged 5 to 15 years, inclusive. Baseline is the earliest available assessment while Post baselines are time points after Baseline during the defined age period.</time_frame>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Rickets Severity Sale - RSS</measure>
    <time_frame>Any available data during the period of patients' aged 5 to 15 years, inclusive. Baseline is the earliest available assessment value during the period.</time_frame>
    <description>The RSS is a 10-point scale, developed for nutritional rickets, that evaluates the degree of metaphyseal cupping and fraying and the proportion of growth plate affected (10 points = severe cupping/fraying, 0 points = absence of cupping/fraying).</description>
