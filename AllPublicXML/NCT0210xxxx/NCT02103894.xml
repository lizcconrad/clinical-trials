    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess [18F]MNI-777 PET imaging as a tool to detect tau
      pathology in the brain of individuals who carry a clinical diagnosis of a tauopathy,
      including: Alzheimer's Disease (AD),Parkinson's disease (PD) Progressive Supranuclear Palsy
      (PSP), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and Frontal Temporal Dementia (FTD) and age-
      and gender-matched healthy subjects.

    <description>To quantitatively assess the brain uptake of [18F]MNI-777 ([18F]T807), an imaging biomarker for tau pathology in brain, using positron emission tomography (PET) in individuals with clinically diagnosed tauopathies including: Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and frontal temporal dementia/Pick's disease (FTD) and healthy controls (HC).</description>

    <description>All enrolled subjects will undergo an [18F]MNI-777 PET imaging visit. For individuals with AD or CTE, [18F]florbetapir imaging may also be performed to serve as a means of correlating disease severity by evaluating the relationship of β-amyloid uptake (measured by [18F]florbetapir imaging) and tau protein uptake (measured by [18F]MNI-777 PET imaging). For individuals with Parkinsonian symptoms, [123I]β-CIT SPECT imaging may be performed to evaluate for a reduction in dopamine transporter uptake.</description>

        All subjects will be excluded from participation for the following reasons:

          -  The subject has a clinically significant abnormal laboratory value and/or clinically
             significant unstable medical or psychiatric illness.

          -  The subject has any disorder that may interfere with drug absorption distribution,
             metabolism, or excretion (including gastrointestinal surgery).

          -  The subject has evidence of a structural lesion on MRI that may interfere with
             interpretation of PET imaging.

          -  The subject has evidence of clinically significant gastrointestinal, cardiovascular,
             hepatic, renal, hematological, neoplastic, endocrine, neurological, immunodeficiency,
             pulmonary, or other disorder or disease.
