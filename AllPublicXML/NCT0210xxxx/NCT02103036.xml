  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is determine whether the Core Stability Exercise is more effective
      than the traditional Back School for low back pain (LBP) in women.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to check what kind of exercises are the best to treat LBP with
      regard to clinical improvements. The secondary objectives are: to determine which treatment
      is more effective in improving pain in the fewest sessions possible, to determine the
      involvement of inflammatory biomarkers in the development of pain and revalue the results
      after one month of having finishing treatment.

      The project is a longitudinal, single-blind and randomized study with two treatment groups:

      GROUP 1: Infrared light+ Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) + Core Stability
      Exercises.

      GROUP 2: Infrared light + Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) + Traditional
      Back School.

      Duration of treatment: 4 weeks. The participants will performe the exercises in 20 daily
      sessions (Monday to Friday) guided by a physiotherapist. Following treatment with the
      physiotherapist, the participants should perform the exercises at home for 4 weeks at a rate
      of three times per week.

    <measure>Changes in Visual Scale Analogue (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pain was measured at the beginning of the study (session 0), and changes are evaluated again at sessions 10, 20, and 1 month later.</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS scale represents the pain intensity on a line of 10 cm, and one end there are the words &quot;no pain&quot; and the other end &quot;the worst imaginable pain&quot; written the distance in centimetres from the &quot;no pain&quot; point to the place marked by the patient represents the intensity of pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the Roland- Morris Disability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Disability was measured at the beginning of the study (session 0), and changes are evaluated again at sessions 10, 20, and 1 month later.</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 24 items, which reflect limitation in different activities of daily living attributed by the patient to LBP. The patient must mark each item that applies to her current status. Scoring is also simple and fast; each checked item receives a score of 1, so scores range between 0 (no disability caused by LBP) and 24 (the maximum possible disability).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Questionnaire of Physical Activity (ClassAF)</measure>
    <time_frame>The physical activity will be measured at the beginning of the study (session 0).</time_frame>
    <description>Is a method developed by the Health Department of the Catalan Government. The ClassAF is a comprehensive questionnaire which contains a few items (1-4) to measure the general level of Physical Activity, it is calculated in METS (basal metabolic expenditure: mlO2/kg.min) and it allows to classify people into physically active or physically inactive.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the biomarkers: Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-Alpha) and Interleukin 10 (IL-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>The concentrations of these biomarkers will be measured at the beginning (session 0) and changes will be evaluated again at the end of the treatment (session 20).</time_frame>
    <description>These two cytokines are parameters to indicate the inflammation levels. Their concentrations are measured using commercial ELISA kits.</description>

    <description>Core Stability Exercises:
20 sessions, distributed daily, from Monday to Friday. The first 5 sessions are common in all patients in the study, and involves the application of infrared light (IR) (10 minutes) and TENS (20 minutes) to treat acute pain. From session number 6 to session 20, the patients will receive IR + TENS 2 days a week, and the other 3 days IR+TENS+Core Stability Exercises (25-30 minutes).</description>

    <intervention_name>Core Stability Exercises (CSE)</intervention_name>
    <description>The increase in intra-abdominal pressure stiffens and strengthens the relevant structural support around the spine, compacts the arthrogenic structures and in combination with abdominal contraction, it can encourage a rigid cylinder and stiffness to occur around the spine. The relevant anatomy in these type of exercises are deep muscles like transversus abdominous, multifidus or pelvic floor. The participants will have to do 10 different exercises. They will have to perform from 8 to 10 repetitions of every exercise, guided by a physical therapist. They will be recommended about making some series more at home, three days a week, when the treatment was finished.</description>

    <description>The back school exercises are based in the traditional activity used for improve the back pain symptoms using the breathing with the stretching of the trunk muscles, the erector spinae reinforcement, the abdominal reinforcement or the postural movements. The participants will have to do 10 different exercises. They will have to perform from 8 to 10 repetitions of every exercise, guided by a physical therapist. They will be recommended about making some series more at home, three days a week, when the treatment was finished.</description>
