        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, PR or ECG) deviating from normal
             and judged clinically relevant by the investigator

          2. Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg and &gt;= 140 mmHg at screening
             in supine position

             supine position

          4. Repeated measurement of pulse rate &lt; 40 bpm and &gt; 90 bpm at screening

          5. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          6. Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged clinically relevant by the investigator

          7. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          8. Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with kinetics of the trial
             drug

             demonstration of a QTcF interval &gt;450 ms) or any other relevant ECG finding

         26. A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

         27. Abnormal parameters for thyroid hormones (T3, T4, TSH), coagulation parameters

             prior inclusion are allowed))

         28. Subject is assessed by the investigator as unsuitable for inclusion, for instance,
             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a
             condition that would not allow safe participation in the study
