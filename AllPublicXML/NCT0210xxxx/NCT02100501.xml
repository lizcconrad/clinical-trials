      The Ketogenic diet is a now proven, evidence based treatment of refractory epilepsy. the
      classic ketogenic diet (KD) is based on a ratio of fat to carbohydrate and protein, usually
      3:1 or 4:1. Fat is proven long-chain triglycerides. The efficacy of the KD has been proven by
      many multicenter trials. But, side effects of ketogenic diet therapy is severe. The modified
      atkins diet (MAD) was designed and investigated at Johns Hopkins Hospital, which aimed to
      propose a less restrictive dietary treatment that would be more palatable to children and
      adolescents with less side effects. The MAD consist of a nearly balance diet (60% fat, 30%
      protein, and 10% carbohydrates by weight), without any restriction on the recommended daily
      calories. Some literature suggested that the MAD is an effective treatment for refractory
      epilepsy. But, no randomised controlled study has been tried. the investigators aimed in this
      prospective study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of MAD comparing to KD.
      The patients were recruited between age 3 to 18 years old with intractable epilepsy. Enrolled
      patients were randomly assigned to either one of two groups; the KD group and MAD group. The
      patients were required to attend outpatient clinic after 1, 3month to record their seizure
      frequency and severity, while their dietary treatment.

        the patients were recriuted from the Pediatric Neurology Outpatient Clinic, Severance
        Children's Hospital. This study conducted on 104 (Ketogenic diet - 51, Atkin's diet - 53)
        patients diagnosed with intractable epilepsy which shows frequency with more than 1 per
        week, 4 per month even though at least more than 2 antiepileptic drug treatment.
