  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial hopes to demonstrate the effect of 4 weeks of outpatient exercise rehabilitation
      on COPD patients. In particular the effect on:

        -  the amount of daily physical activity

        -  Quality of life

        -  The 6-minute walk distance

        -  Time to exacerbation

      and compare it to the effect of 4 weeks of outpatients rehabilitation with Noninvasive
      Ventilation as an adjunct therapy.
