      This is a multi-center, cross-sectional, non-interventional, observational study——an
      investigation carried out in 816 pregnant (pregnant week 17±2 group and pregnant week 39±2
      group; 408 cases in each group) and 408 lactating women (post-natal lactation day 42±7 group)
      from a total of 4 sites in 3 typical areas (1 coastal regions, 2 inland regions and 1 lake
      regions) in China to study the correlation between DHA intake and DHA concentrations in blood
      and breast milk.

      This is a multi-center, cross-sectional, non-interventional, observational study in 816
      pregnant (gestation week 17±2 group and gestation week 39±2 group 408 cases in each group)
      and 408 lactating women (post-natal lactation day 42±7 group) from a total of 4 sites in 3
      typical areas (1 coastal regions, 2 inland regions and 1 lake regions) in China to study the
      correlation between DHA intake and DHA concentrations in blood and breast milk. Investigators
      are mainly physicians majoring in gynaecology and obstetrics, etc. During visits, the study
      physician will record the patient's social demographic data, disease and relevant medication
      history, review her medical records, assess DHA intake by the DHA Screener, and determine DHA
      concentrations in erythrocyte membrane, plasma and breast milk, so as to validate the
      feasibility of DHA Screener as DHA intake assessment tool for determining DHA concentrations
      in the body.

      Subjects meeting inclusion criteria and non of the exclusion criteria will be informed of
      relevant information of the study. Subjects should be voluntarily consent to participate in
      the study and sign the informed consent form.

      Screening of the study is scheduled for as long as 5 months. In this study, additional
      examinations or other interventions are not required.
