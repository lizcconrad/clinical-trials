  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a high prevalence of falls in those with knee osteoarthritis (OA) compared to
      healthy older adults. Balance is a key element of function that allows individuals to
      maintain posture and respond to perturbations, and poor balance control, a risk factor for
      falls, has been noted in those with knee OA. There is a lack of research guiding treatment
      for balance deficits in knee OA, with interventions aimed at improving balance deficits in
      those with knee OA having mixed results. Targeted dynamic balance interventions in other
      patient populations have been shown to significantly improve dynamic balance control and
      physical function. If results similar to such populations can be achieved, such a program may
      produce a significant reduction in functional disability in the knee OA population and
      improve quality of life. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of a 10-week
      targeted dynamic balance intervention on dynamic balance and physical function in people with
      knee OA. This will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT).

    <time_frame>0, 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Community Balance and Mobility Scale (CB&amp;M) will be used to assess dynamic balance and mobility. The CB&amp;M is a scale designed to assess dynamic balance and mobility and is administered by a trained assessor. The scale consists of 13 items including bending, walking, turning, and stair descent, with a maximum possible score of 96 and minimum score of 0. The scale has been validated and deemed reliable for use in the knee osteoarthritis population.</description>

    <description>The Western Ontario &amp; McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) will be used to assess self-reported physical function. The WOMAC physical function subscale consists of 17 questions assessing physical function capabilities during activities of daily living.</description>

    <description>The Brief Fear of Movement Scale will be used to assess fear of pain. This scale is based on the widely used Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia and contains 6 questions that evaluate fear of pain, movement and re-injury. The scale has been validated in individuals with OA.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in knee joint proprioception from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Knee joint proprioception will be measured using a knee joint repositioning task, previously used in those with OA to assess joint proprioception. Proprioception will be assessed in three randomly chosen target positions (15°, 30°, and 60° of knee flexion) while the participant is seated on an isokinetic dynamometer.</description>

    <description>Targeted dynamic balance training. Dynamic balance training will consist of progressive exercise training over three phases, with exercises emphasising dynamic balance control, muscle strength and proprioception. Exercises will be performed four times per week for ten weeks. Exercises will be taught and supervised by a trained kinesiologist. Difficulty of exercises will be increased progressively over time by increasing resistance, time of timed exercises, and distance of walking exercises. Exercises will be progressed to different exercises in each new phase (total 3 phases). Participants will complete six treatment sessions at the university (during weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9) that will be included in the total number of sessions per week. All other sessions will be performed at home.</description>

    <description>Participants in this study group will complete dynamic balance training exercises four times per week, for ten weeks. Exercise sessions at the university will last approximately one hour, and home exercise sessions will take approximately 30 minutes to complete. Exercises will emphasize dynamic balance control, muscle strength and proprioception and will be progressed over three phases during the ten weeks (with more difficult exercises phased in, and exercises that have been mastered phased out).</description>
