    <description>Participants will be asked to weigh individuals who they have been told are completing either the treatment or control condition of a weight loss trial (individuals will actually be paid actors playing the role of a study participant). Participants will weigh individuals on calibrated balance-beam scales, and the discrepancy between weights recorded when individuals are thought to be a treatment or control participant will be calculated, which is the primary outcome for this study.</description>
