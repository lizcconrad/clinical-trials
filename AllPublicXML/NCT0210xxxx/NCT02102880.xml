  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is a multifactorial disease with a strong genetic
      component. Given that it is known that impaired regulation of choroidal vascular tone is
      present in patients with AMD, the current study seeks to investigate whether genetic
      polymorphisms in risk alleles for AMD are associated with altered choroidal blood flow
      regulation in healthy subjects. For this purpose a total of 220 healthy volunteers will be
      included. Choroidal blood flow regulation will be evaluated by measuring choroidal blood flow
      during isometric exercise. In addition, flicker induced vasodilatation will be studied and
      retinal vessel calibers will assessed, as well as retinal thickness and macular pigment
      optical density.
