  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.
      Long-term glycemic control is important to prevent or delay the onset of DM related
      complications. Patients often fail to achieve optimal glycemic control from pharmacotherapy
      due to non-adherence. With the high prevalence of smartphone usage locally and among the
      developed countries, there has been a growing interest to deliver interventions through
      mobile applications. In this study, a mobile application targeted at improving medication
      adherence among people with Type 2 DM will be developed and evaluated.

      Aims: This study aims to (i) design a smartphone application to improve medication adherence
      and (ii) evaluate its impact on clinical outcomes, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and
      health status among patients with Type 2 DM.

      Hypothesis: The use of a smartphone application can improve medication adherence among
      patients with Type 2 DM, as well as clinical outcomes, HRQoL and health status.

      Methods: This is a randomized, open-label controlled trial involving patients with Type 2 DM
      managed at Singapore General Hospital. Patients seen at the institution's Diabetes Centre and
      those referred to the pharmacist-led Medication Therapy Management service are eligible to
      participate. Patients in the intervention group will have the mobile application downloaded
      onto their smartphones, while those in the control group will receive the usual standard of
      care. The primary outcome will be change in self-reported medication adherence, determined
      using the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. Secondary outcomes include change in
      HbA1c, blood glucose, frequency of dose titrations, addition or removal of oral hypoglycemic
      agents, HRQoL (measured using the Audit of Diabetes Dependent Quality of Life) and health
      status (measured using the EuroQol-5D-5L and EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale). All outcomes
      will be measured at baseline and at the end of the 6-month study period (± 4 weeks).

      Significance: The development and evaluation of a mobile application to improve adherence
      among patients with Type 2 DM in Singapore is the first of its kind, and the findings of this
      study will provide the much-needed evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of this
      intervention.
