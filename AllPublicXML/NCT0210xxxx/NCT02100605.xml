    <textblock>
      Phytosun decongestant nasal spray is a class I medical device registered in the European
      Union for the treatment of nasal congestion. The spray contains hypertonic seawater and
      essential oils. The objective of the study is to investigate the effects of a nasal spray,
      registered as a medical device under the name Phytosun Decongestant in the European Union, on
      speed of onset of relief of nasal congestion in 50 subjects suffering from nasal congestion
      associated with common cold.

      The study will also include an exploratory assessement of any objective changes in nasal
      patency by measuring nasal peak inspiratory flow before and after treatment.

    <description>Subjects will be instructed that the investigator will administer one spray of the treatment into each nasal passage and then start a stop clock. The subject will be asked to stop the clock immediately when they feel any relief of nasal congestion. A sign with the following wording will be placed near the stop-clock.
STOP THE CLOCK IMMEDIATELY YOU FEEL RELIEF OF NASAL CONGESTION The clock will be stopped after 600 seconds even if the subject does not respond</description>

    <description>Any adverse events (AE) will be documented by asking the subjects to record in the CRF any signs and symptoms after the dose in clinic, Adverse events may also be elicited at the end of the study when the subject is interviewed about their experiences during the study. Adverse events will be recorded in the case report form (CRF) at the final study visit.</description>

          3. Subject considers they are suffering from a common cold of no more than 7 days
             duration (common cold will be self-diagnosed but all patients will be screened by a
             doctor and nasal examinations will be performed as needed to establish eligibility of
             patients for study).

          4. Subject on entry to the study has a symptom score of 1 or greater for blocked nose on
             four point ordinal scale

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a known hypersensitivity or are allergic to any component of the test product

          2. The subject has a clinically significant cardiovascular, endocrinological,
             neurological, respiratory, gastrointestinal disease or a history or any current
             disease that is considered by the investigator as a reason for exclusion e.g. current
             allergic rhinitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

          3. The subject has a severe nasal septal deviation or other condition that could cause
             nasal obstruction such as the presence of nasal polyps.

          4. The subject has had nasal or sinus surgery in the past that in the opinion of the
             investigator may influence symptom scores

          5. The subject has a history of alcohol or other substance abuse in previous year

          6. The subject is taking any prescribed medication other than for contraception, that is
             considered by the investigator as a reason for exclusion e.g. systemic steroids,
             intranasal medicines, antibiotics.

          7. The subject has had common cold or flu like symptoms for more than seven days

          8. The subject has recently taken a common cold medicine that in the opinion of the
             investigator may influence baseline symptom scores (such as nasal decongestants)

          9. The subject is a current smoker (more than 2 cigarettes, pipes, cigars a day)

         10. The subject is related to any study personnel

         11. The subject has received any investigational drug or participated in a clinical trial
             within 4 weeks of entry to this study

         12. The subject is pregnant or lactating -
