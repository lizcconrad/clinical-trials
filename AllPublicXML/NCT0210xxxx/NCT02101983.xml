  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) is considered a standard chemotherapy treatment for patients
      with acute myeloid leukemia. However, most patients receiving this therapy are required to be
      admitted to the hospital during their treatment course.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and cost of high-dose cytarabine treatment
      given in an in-patient setting versus an out-patient setting.

      The primary objective of this study is to:

      • To determine the incidence of grade 3 to 5 non-hematologic toxicity of high-dose cytarabine
      (HiDAC) for AML consolidation administered in an outpatient setting.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to:

        -  To determine cost effectiveness of outpatient HiDAC consolidation versus the standard of
           care inpatient HiDAC consolidation.

        -  Evaluate patient quality of life (QOL) with this outpatient regimen in comparison to
           that with the standard inpatient regimen.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria for Outpatient Administration of HiDAC

          -  Unequivocal diagnosis of AML (&gt;20% blasts in the bone marrow based on the WHO
             classification), excluding M3 (acute promyelocytic leukemia).

          -  Documented complete remission (CR) following induction chemotherapy as defined as
             (18):

          -  Bone marrow with &lt;5% blasts; absence of blasts with Auer rods

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1000/mcL

          -  Platelets &gt;100,000/mcL

          -  Independence of red cell transfusions

          -  Absence of extramedullary disease

          -  Age ≥ 55 years.

          -  Relapsed AML patients are eligible as long as they meet other inclusion and exclusion
             criteria.

          -  Good performance status of (ECOG 0-2), see appendix 15.3.

          -  Adequate renal and hepatic function (Cr ≤ 1.2, alkaline phosphatase &lt;3.0 x upper limit
             of normal, total bilirubin &lt;1.5 x upper limit of normal unless there is a history of
             Gilbert's disease).

        Inclusion Criteria for Quality of Life Comparison Group

          -  All patients decline to participate as an out-patient or who are not eligible for
             participation in the out-patient portion of the study will be approached to
             participate in the QOL comparison.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion Criteria for All Patients
