  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to study the effects of increased iron intake by home fortification
      of complementary foods on the gastrointestinal microbial development, inflammatory responses,
      and zinc (Zn) absorption. The proposed subjects are 9 month olds living in a malaria endemic
      area of rural Kenya who are randomized at 6 months of age to one of three fortificant groups:
      1) Sprinkles™ with 12mg Iron(Fe)/day + other micronutrients, including 5mg/d Zn (test);
      Sprinkles™ with 0 mg/d Fe + other micronutrients, including 5mg/d Zn (control); Sprinkles™
      with no micronutrients (placebo). The investigators hypothesize that the microbiome will be
      significantly different in the three groups and that Zn absorption and status, in addition to
      immune and oxidant status will be improved in the non-Fe fortified groups when compared to
      the Fe-fortified group.

      Specific aims include exploration of possible mechanisms of adverse events that have been
      observed in iron supplementation trials in infants in malaria endemic regions by:

        1. Characterizing the impact of enteral iron administration on the evolution of the
           intestinal microbiome in infants from 6 to 9 months of age.

        2. Characterizing iron administration-associated inflammatory responses and correlate these
           with changes in the intestinal microbiome in infants from 6 to 9 months of age.
           Specifically, changes in the microbiome will be correlated with biomarkers reflecting:

             1. Intestinal inflammation;

             2. Systemic inflammation, bacterial translocation, and oxidant stress;

             3. Iron status and homeostasis

        3. Quantify to what degree Fe interferes with Zn absorption (TAZ) and how it affects the
           size of the infant's exchangeable zinc pool (EZP).
