    <textblock>
      An adjusted dosing algorithm for the dosing of the anticancer drug carboplatin has been
      developed, that accounts for high BMI, low serum creatinine values and maximal calculated
      renal function. The hypothesis is that this new dosing algorithm provides a more accurate and
      safe dose than dosing according to the old standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carboplatin is an alkylating anticancer drug that is used for the treatment of various types
      of cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC),
      malignant mesothelioma, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer. It is mostly given in combination
      with other chemotherapeutic drugs, but it can also be given as single agent.

      Since carboplatin is highly eliminated by the kidneys, the dose needs to be adjusted for
      renal dysfunction. Furthermore, as there is clear correlation between the area under the
      concentration-time curve (AUC) of carboplatin and haematological toxicity and response rate,
      carboplatin is dosed per target AUC. For this, the standard pharmacokinetic formula [dose =
      clearance carboplatin x target AUC] is used.

      the clearance is typically calculated using the cockcroft and gault (C-G) formula. In
      patients with high weight, or very low serum creatinine values the C-G-formula may
      overestimate the renal function, resulting in a potential overdose of carboplatin. the new
      developed dosing algorithm to be studied adjusts for high BMI and low serum creatinine
      values, in order to provide a more safe dose of carboplatin

    <description>Treatment with carboplatin is associated with adverse drug reactions. As an oncolytic drug, treatment with carboplatin may for example result in myelosupression, infections and/or gastro-intestinal toxicity, that may require hospitalization for treatment of toxicity.
With the new dosing algorithm we hope to provide a better calculation of the appropriate dose for the individual patient, and thereby a safer treatment. Therefore, adverse events of treatment is an important secondary outcome measure that will be assessed.</description>
