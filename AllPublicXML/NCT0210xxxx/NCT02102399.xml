  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to verify the effects of two speech-pathology interventions:
      vocal warm-up and respiratory training in teachers who work in a public school of the city of
      Salvador-Bahia, with or without complaints of vocal disorders. It is a preventive study and
      the hypothesis is that both approaches can produce positive voice changes, but the Vocal
      Warm-up will produce the most significant changes.

      Randomized Clinical Trial where participants were allocated into groups: Vocal Warm-up (to
      perform exercises of resistance and flexibility for 13 minutes before teaching, during six
      weeks) and Respiratory Muscle Training (to perform exercises to strengthen the respiratory
      muscles through the use of incentive respiratory equipment. Five repetitions of exhales with
      an interval of thirty seconds between each one were performed. It was requested rest for two
      minutes, repeating the procedure four times with the total of five series. These exercises
      were performed for 13 minutes before teaching, during six weeks).

      Outcomes analyzed: demographics and teaching activity characteristics; symptoms, habits and
      factors associated with voice disorders; self-reported voice handicap (Voice Handicap
      Index-VHI-10); vocal severity rating (Vocal Severity Scale); and acoustic parameters through
      the computerized acoustic voice analysis program VoxMetria (CTS Informatics).

    <measure>Voice Handicap Index (VHI-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The voice handicap index (VHI) is a self-assessment questionnaire which quantifies the functional, physical and emotional impacts of a voice disorder on the quality of life. The VHI-10 is a reduced version and it consists of 10 questions about the severity of the voice problem perceived by the subject. It is presented as an ordinal scale (range 0-4) that indicates how frequently the subject has experienced the same situation (0 = never; 1 = almost never; 2 = sometimes; 3= almost always; 4 = always). Total VHI Score ranges from 0 (never) to 40 (always). Higher scores indicate greater voice handicap. Abnormal values &gt; 11.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acoustic Analysis (Fundamental Frequency)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The measurement of fundamental frequency directly reflects the rate of vibration of the vocal folds. The fundamental frequency term refers to the frequency of more occurrence of vocal fold vibration, featuring a certain production.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acoustic Analysis (Jitter)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Jitter is the perturbation cycle-to-cycle of the fundamental frequency. High levels of jitter are normally associated with pathological voice. The instability of the fundamental frequency can be attributed to changes in size, shape or firmness of the vocal folds.
Normal values must be &lt; 0.6%.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acoustic Analysis (Shimmer)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The shimmer measures the amplitude's disturbance, e. g. how fast the amplitude changes on a sustained vowel for a few seconds. Shimmer high levels are normally associated with pathological voice. This can be attributed due to changes in size, shape or firmness of the vocal folds.
Normal values &lt; 6.5%.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acoustic Analysis (Noise)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Noise is the analysis of aperiodic components of the sound's signal. It is an important correlate of that the human ear considers voice disorders. Normal levels &lt; 2.5 dB</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acoustic Analysis (GNE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Glottal to Noise Excitation ratio (GNE) is an acoustic measurement to calculate the noise in a series of pulses produced by the oscillation of the vocal folds. This parameter is based on the hypothesis that resulting pulses of vocal fold collision generate a synchronous excitation of different frequency bands. Moreover, the noise produced by the vocal folds compressed generates uncorrelated excitations.
Normal levels &gt; 0.5 dB</description>

    <time_frame>After 6 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The post-treatment questionnaire was based on the original designed by Roy (2003) for assessing the teachers' perception of voice improvement and compliance with the intervention. Participants rated their extent of improvement on a 3-point Likert scale (&quot;not at all/somewhat&quot;; &quot;moderate&quot;; &quot;a lot&quot;). The questionnaire was applied only after the intervention. The answers were dichotomized in two categories (&quot;moderate/a lot&quot; and &quot;not at all/somewhat&quot;). The results were presented in frequency/percentage of subjects that answered &quot;moderate/a lot&quot; in each intervention.</description>

        <title>Voice Handicap Index (VHI-10)</title>
        <description>The voice handicap index (VHI) is a self-assessment questionnaire which quantifies the functional, physical and emotional impacts of a voice disorder on the quality of life. The VHI-10 is a reduced version and it consists of 10 questions about the severity of the voice problem perceived by the subject. It is presented as an ordinal scale (range 0-4) that indicates how frequently the subject has experienced the same situation (0 = never; 1 = almost never; 2 = sometimes; 3= almost always; 4 = always). Total VHI Score ranges from 0 (never) to 40 (always). Higher scores indicate greater voice handicap. Abnormal values &gt; 11.</description>

        <description>The post-treatment questionnaire was based on the original designed by Roy (2003) for assessing the teachers' perception of voice improvement and compliance with the intervention. Participants rated their extent of improvement on a 3-point Likert scale (&quot;not at all/somewhat&quot;; &quot;moderate&quot;; &quot;a lot&quot;). The questionnaire was applied only after the intervention. The answers were dichotomized in two categories (&quot;moderate/a lot&quot; and &quot;not at all/somewhat&quot;). The results were presented in frequency/percentage of subjects that answered &quot;moderate/a lot&quot; in each intervention.</description>

        <description>Glottal to Noise Excitation ratio (GNE) is an acoustic measurement to calculate the noise in a series of pulses produced by the oscillation of the vocal folds. This parameter is based on the hypothesis that resulting pulses of vocal fold collision generate a synchronous excitation of different frequency bands. Moreover, the noise produced by the vocal folds compressed generates uncorrelated excitations.

        <description>The voice handicap index (VHI) is a self-assessment questionnaire which quantifies the functional, physical and emotional impacts of a voice disorder on the quality of life. The VHI-10 is a reduced version and it consists of 10 questions about the severity of the voice problem perceived by the subject. It is presented as an ordinal scale (range 0-4) that indicates how frequently the subject has experienced the same situation (0 = never; 1 = almost never; 2 = sometimes; 3= almost always; 4 = always). Total VHI Score ranges from 0 (never) to 40 (always). Higher scores indicate greater voice handicap. Abnormal values &gt; 11.</description>

        <title>Acoustic Analysis (GNE) 2</title>
        <description>Glottal to Noise Excitation ratio (GNE) is an acoustic measurement to calculate the noise in a series of pulses produced by the oscillation of the vocal folds. This parameter is based on the hypothesis that resulting pulses of vocal fold collision generate a synchronous excitation of different frequency bands. Moreover, the noise produced by the vocal folds compressed generates uncorrelated excitations.

        <description>The voice handicap index (VHI) is a self-assessment questionnaire which quantifies the functional, physical and emotional impacts of a voice disorder on the quality of life. The VHI-10 is a reduced version and it consists of 10 questions about the severity of the voice problem perceived by the subject. It is presented as an ordinal scale (range 0-4) that indicates how frequently the subject has experienced the same situation (0 = never; 1 = almost never; 2 = sometimes; 3= almost always; 4 = always). Total VHI Score ranges from 0 (never) to 40 (always). Higher scores indicate greater voice handicap. Abnormal values &gt; 11.</description>

        <title>Change in GNE</title>
        <description>Glottal to Noise Excitation ratio (GNE) is an acoustic measurement to calculate the noise in a series of pulses produced by the oscillation of the vocal folds. This parameter is based on the hypothesis that resulting pulses of vocal fold collision generate a synchronous excitation of different frequency bands. Moreover, the noise produced by the vocal folds compressed generates uncorrelated excitations.

Participants rated their extent of improvement on a 3-point Likert scale (&quot;not at all/somewhat&quot;; &quot;moderate&quot;; &quot;a lot&quot;). The questionnaire was applied only after the intervention. The answers were dichotomized in two categories (&quot;moderate/a lot&quot; and &quot;not at all/somewhat&quot;). The results were presented in frequency/percentage of subjects that answered &quot;moderate/a lot&quot; in each intervention.</description>
