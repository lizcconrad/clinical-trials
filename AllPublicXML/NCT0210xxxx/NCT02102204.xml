    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single-arm, extension study to characterize the long-term safety and
      tolerability of etelcalcetide in the treatment of Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in
      adults with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) on hemodialysis.

      This is a multicenter, single-arm, extension study in which adults with secondary
      hyperparathyroidism currently receiving hemodialysis and previously treated in Amgen studies
      20120231 (NCT01785875), 20120334 (NCT01576146), or 20120360 (NCT01896232) will continue to be
      treated with etelcalcetide until approximately 2.5 years after the first participant was
      enrolled.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of first dose of etelcalcetide (in the current study) and up to 30 days after the last dose; median duration of treatment was 563 days.</time_frame>
    <description>A serious adverse event is an AE that met at least 1 of the following criteria:
fatal
life threatening
required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
congenital anomaly/birth defect
other medically important serious event.
The relationship of each AE to study treatment was assessed by the investigator.
The following AE grading scale was used:
Mild: Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical intervention/therapy required Moderate: Mild to moderate limitation in activity-some assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required Severe: Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization possible Life-threatening: Extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance required, significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization probable.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Parathyroid Hormone Levels Between Two to Nine-times the Upper Limit of Normal</measure>
    <time_frame>Months 6, 12, and 18</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants who maintained plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels within the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) recommended range of not less than 2x the upper limit of normal (ULN) and not greater than 9x the ULN at months 6, 12, and 18, with the ULN based on the reference range of the assay used at the individual clinical site.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Serum Phosphorus ≤ the ULN</measure>

    <description>Percentage of participants with serum phosphorus less than or equal to the upper limit of normal for the assay used.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Serum Corrected Calcium &lt; 7.5 mg/dL</measure>
    <time_frame>From day 1 to months 6, 12, and 18</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with serum corrected calcium (cCa) reported for cumulative time intervals from day 1 through months 6, 12, and 18, using the participant's lowest recorded corrected calcium value during the time interval.
If serum albumin was less than 4.0 g/dL, serum calcium was corrected according to the following formula:
cCa (mg/dL) = total calcium (mg/dL) + (4 - albumin [g/dL])*0.8. If serum albumin was &gt; 4.0 g/dL no correction was made.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to end of treatment; median duration of treatment was 563 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grades for laboratory parameter values were defined based on the upper/lower limit of normal from the local laboratories contracted by the study centers.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Developed Positive Binding Anti-Etelcalcetide Antibodies</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and every 6 months (up to 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who were binding antibody positive post-baseline with a negative or no result at baseline (where baseline for participants previously treated with etelcalcetide is Day 1 of the first study in which they were exposed to etelcalcetide and for participants previously treated with cinacalcet is the ending time point for study 20120360).</description>

    <description>Participants received etelcalcetide three times a week (TIW) by bolus injection at the end of hemodialysis. The minimum etelcalcetide dose in this study was 2.5 mg and the maximum dose was 15 mg. Etelcalcetide dose was titrated to maintain parathyroid hormone levels within 2x to 9x the upper limit of normal based on the reference range of the assay used at the individual study center.</description>

          <title>Etelcalcetide</title>
          <description>Participants received etelcalcetide three times a week (TIW) by bolus injection at the end of hemodialysis. The minimum etelcalcetide dose in this study was 2.5 mg and the maximum dose was 15 mg. Etelcalcetide dose was titrated to maintain parathyroid hormone levels within 2x to 9x the upper limit of normal based on the reference range of the assay used at the individual study center.</description>

        <description>A serious adverse event is an AE that met at least 1 of the following criteria:
fatal
life threatening
required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
congenital anomaly/birth defect
other medically important serious event.
The relationship of each AE to study treatment was assessed by the investigator.
The following AE grading scale was used:
Mild: Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical intervention/therapy required Moderate: Mild to moderate limitation in activity-some assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required Severe: Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization possible Life-threatening: Extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance required, significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization probable.</description>

The minimum etelcalcetide dose in this study was 2.5 mg and the maximum dose was 15 mg. Etelcalcetide dose was titrated to maintain parathyroid hormone levels within 2x to 9x the upper limit of normal based on the reference range of the assay used at the individual study center.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Serum Corrected Calcium &lt; 7.5 mg/dL</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants with serum corrected calcium (cCa) reported for cumulative time intervals from day 1 through months 6, 12, and 18, using the participant's lowest recorded corrected calcium value during the time interval.
If serum albumin was less than 4.0 g/dL, serum calcium was corrected according to the following formula:
cCa (mg/dL) = total calcium (mg/dL) + (4 – albumin [g/dL])*0.8. If serum albumin was &gt; 4.0 g/dL no correction was made.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
