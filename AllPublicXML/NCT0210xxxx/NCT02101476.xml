    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the analgesic efficacy of Xartemis 15mg/650mg by
      mouth every 12 hours for the management of acute moderate to severe post operative pain to
      generic Oxycodone/APAP(acetaminophen) (Percocet) 10mg/650mg by mouth every 6 hours.

    <description>To demonstrate the non inferiority of Xartemis 15mg/650mg by mouth every 12 hours for the management of acute post operative pain when compared to generic Oxycodone/APAP (acetaminophen) 10mg/650mg by mouth every 6 hours. The statistical comparison of interest will be the patient global assessment of analgesic effect administered at 48 hours after treatment initiation.</description>
