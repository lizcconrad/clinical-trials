  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the effects of various types of simulation
      preparation methods on novice nurses' competence and self-efficacy. Participants will be
      recruited from an academic course (N424 Integrated Practicum). Participants will be
      randomized to three intervention groups (i.e. expert modeling video, voice over PowerPoint,
      and traditional readings). All participants will complete self-efficacy surveys and two
      simulations. During simulation, participants will be scored based on their competence
      according to a performance rubric. The hypothesis is that participants in the expert modeling
      group will demonstrate more change in competence and report more change in self-efficacy
      scores than participants in other groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will compare self-confidence and competence scores between the three groups
      after the pre-test and posttest simulations. The self-efficacy survey is an 7-item scale that
      involves participants rating their self-efficacy about providing care for multiple patients.
      Participants rate their self-efficacy on a 1 to 5 (not confident to very confident scale).
      The survey takes 5 minutes to complete. The self-efficacy survey has been used in many
      simulation research studies previously with novice nurses. Competence will be measured with a
      rater-observation measure which has previously been used in simulation research.

    <description>Participants will have access to 70 minutes of expert modeling videos available over 5 weeks on an online learning management system. The investigator will be the expert model in the videos. Expert modeling videos will address content related to seven concepts: Taking report with a graphic organizer worksheet, prioritizing patient care, delegating to unlicensed assistive personnel, safety checks in patient rooms, focused physical assessments, safe medication administration, and using a standardized healthcare provider communication tool on the telephone.</description>

    <description>Participants will have access to 60 minutes of voice over PowerPoint slides, available over 5 weeks on an online learning management system, specifically to match exposure and content with the expert modeling video group. The script for PowerPoint will contain content related to the aforementioned seven concepts. There will be static photos, but no expert modeling videos, on PowerPoint slides. The investigator will narrate the voice over PowerPoint.</description>
