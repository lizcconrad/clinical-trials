  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimum caffeine dose for apnea of prematurity has not been well investigated so the
      objective of the study is to compare high versus low dose of caffeine citrate to facilitate
      successful extubation in mechanically ventilated preterm infants.

      A randomized, double blind, clinical trial which will be conducted in Neonatal Intensive Care
      Unit, Mansoura University Children Hospital, Egypt on preterm infants born less than 32 weeks
      gestation mechanically ventilated within the first 10 days of life to study the optimum
      caffeine dose for apnea of prematurity and compare High dose (loading 40 mg/kg/day equivalent
      to 20 mg /kg/day of caffeine base and maintenance of 20 mg/kg/day equivalent to 10 mg /kg/day
      of caffeine base) versus low dose (loading 20 mg/kg/day equivalent to 10 mg /kg/day of
      caffeine base and maintenance of 10 mg/kg/day equivalent to 5 mg /kg/day of caffeine base)
      caffeine citrate started within the first 10 days of life and its effect on need of
      re-intubation within 72 hours of extubation from mechanical ventilation as primary outcome
      and frequency and duration of apnea, duration of mechanical ventilation and oxygen support,
      length of hospital stay, neonatal mortality, chronic lung disease, necrotising enterocolitis,
      intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, hydrocephalus, retinopathy of
      prematurity, and caffeine side effects as secondary outcomes.
