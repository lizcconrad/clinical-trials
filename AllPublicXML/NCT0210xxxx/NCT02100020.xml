  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will evaluate two methods of implementation of the new Physical Activity
      Guidelines (PAGs) for Adults with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) living in two Ontario communities.
      The investigators will also determine if following the PAGs will improve aspects of fitness,
      function, quality of life and risk for cardiometabolic disease in this population. The
      investigators hypothesize that adherence to the PAGs will be higher in people who have been
      referred directly to a community-based exercise program, and that this greater adherence to
      physical activity will be associated with greater improvements in fitness, function and
      quality of life.

      This randomized controlled trial will provide important information on how best to implement
      physical activity recommendations within the community setting; this information will be
      translated to key stakeholders during the final stages of the project.
