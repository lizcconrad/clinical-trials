  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare (~ 1/6000) but ubiquitous genetic
      disease. It is associated with abnormal angiogenesis and autosomal dominant inheritance,
      leading to telangiectasias and arteriovenous fistulae. More than 95% of patients are
      concerned by epistaxis (nosebleeds). These events are spontaneous, repeated, irregular, both
      diurnal and nocturnal, a source of anemia, disabling and very socially embarrassing.

      Anti-angiogenic treatments, including bevacizumab, are a new therapeutic option in HHT.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate 3 months after the end of the treatment the efficacy on
      the duration of the nosebleeds with 3 different doses (25, 50 and 75 mg) of bevacizumab
      administered as a nasal spray in a repeated manner (3 administrations) in patients with
      Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia complicated by nosebleeds.

      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, seamless phase II/III study is to be
      carried out on 4 groups of 20 patients for first step and 2 groups of 20 to 40 patients for
      second step
