  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 60% of crops in Israel are grown in recycled treated waste water. This study aims to
      determine whether minute quantities of drugs such as Carbamazepine can be found in
      individuals who ingest vegetables grown in waste water.

      40 healthy volunteers will undergo a food frequency questionnaire and ask to undergo a daily
      food diary.They will also be asked about drug exposure.

      At baseline they will provide a urine and hair sample to determine presence of
      pharmaceuticals.

      They will then undergo a crossover trial wih one week exposure to vegetables grown in
      recycled waste water or fresh water, with a three day wash out period. Participants will be
      asked to ingest a minimal amount of lettuce, carrots, peppers, tomatoes and lettuce during
      the study period.

      During this period questionnaires will continue and urine samples will be collected every
      three days. The first compound to be tested will be carbamazepine, as it is stable in water.

      It is important to note that vegetables provided to the participants are available in regular
      grocery stores.

      Participants will be asked to drink bottled water throughout the study period . A sample of
      their home drinking water will also be tested for Carbamazepine as will a sample of the
      vegetables they consume.
