    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies narrative or fact-based videos in increasing
      colorectal cancer screenings in African American communities. Informational videotapes may
      help increase the number of participants who engage in colonoscopy screenings. It is not yet
      known whether narrative videos may be more effective than fact-based videos in increasing
      colorectal cancer screenings.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess both individual and environmental factors that guide decisions and behaviors to
      engage or not engage in colonoscopy screenings for African Americans in the two communities.

      II. Using a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach, develop and pilot a
      peer-led, narrative-based colorectal cancer behavioral intervention for increasing
      colonoscopy screening behaviors in African Americans.

      III. Examine the efficacy of a narrative communication-style group intervention compared to a
      didactic intervention to influence African Americans' engagement in colorectal cancer
      screening, including examining the degree to which the community interventions impact
      cognitive and affective decision making factors about health care seeking.

      IV. Examine and explore contextual factors that may influence the process of behavior change
      to better understand colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and health care seeking behaviors.

      OUTLINE: Program locations are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants view videos with information about CRC and screening delivered by
      personal narrative.

      ARM II: Participants view videos with information about CRC and screening delivered by
      informative fact-based message.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.

    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months post-presentation</time_frame>
    <description>A change score (post-presentation minus pre-presentation) will be created and summarized. In addition, the change score will be further dichotomized (e.g. increase versus no increase in the likelihood of screening) and the percent of those who experienced an increased likelihood, denoted by pi, will be computed. A corresponding 95% confidence interval will be calculated. To test for differences in variables collected pre- and post-presentation, generalized mixed linear models will be used. Testing will be done at the 0.0.5 nominal significance level and using the approximate t-test method.</description>
