  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity is steadily growing in many parts of the world in order to reach
      epidemic proportions. Changes in signaling pathways state of hunger and satiety contribute to
      the increase in obesity and metabolic syndrome. Currently, the white adipose tissue, also is
      considered a secretory tissue by producing numerous adipokines involved in a chronic state of
      inflammation, which may interfere with the neuroendocrine regulation of energy balance that
      affect the weight loss process. The bariatric surgery is recommended as the most effective
      tool in the treatment and control of morbid obesity. The study population will consist of
      patients undergoing bariatric surgery of type Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The study was
      performed in Clinical Hospital of the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR). This is a
      prospective cohort study with follow up of 6 and 24 months. The aim of this study is to
      assess the effects of weight loss after bariatric surgery associated anthropometric
      characteristic, metabolic changes (glucose, cholesterol profile,hepatic enzymes, Fibroblast
      growth factor- 21(FGF-21), blood pressure), the profile of adipokines pro/anti-inflammatory
      (adiponectin, interleukin-6 (IL-6),interleukin-10 (IL-10), C reactive protein (CRP),
      plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), intercellular
      adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), resistin, frizzled-related protein 5 (SFrp5) and neuroendocrine
      regulation of energy balance (leptin, neuropeptide Y (NPY) , alpha-melanocyte stimulating
      hormone (α-MSH), melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP), as
      well as the quality of life in obese adults.
