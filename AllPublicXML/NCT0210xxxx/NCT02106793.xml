      Primary objective

        -  To compare the incidence of postoperative nasal synerchia between Mitomicin C and
           placebo in patients at 6 months after endoscopic sinus surgery

        -  To validate the Thai version of disease-specific quality of life tool SNOT-22

      Secondary objectives

        -  To compare the clinical signs and symptoms of CRS in patients who receive Mitomicin C
           with those who receive placebo

        -  To compare the disease-specific quality of life in patients who receive Mitomicin C with
           those who receive placebo

        -  To compare the side effects of Mitomicin C versus placebo

    <description>The primary outcome of interest is time to event, with the event as the occurrence of nasal synechia. The date of surgery will be used as the beginning date, and the last date will be the date that patient was defined as synechia, or the end of the study period if that patient does not have synechia on follow up.</description>

    <description>Mitomicin C (0.4 mg/ml) will be provided in a sterile vial and prepared by pharmacist at the Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital.The treatment solution will be drawn and soaked ono two one inch neurosurgical cotton pledgets. Each pledget will be placed on each side of the nose for 5 minutes. The nurse will set the alarm for removal of the cotton pledgets, then normal saline will be used to irrigate both sides of the nose, using 100 ml on each side.</description>
