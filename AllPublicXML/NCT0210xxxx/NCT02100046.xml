  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, it is established that the voltage-gated calcium channels modulate pain perception
      due to an influence on the neuronal transmission and excitability. In the past, attention has
      focused on the modulation of high voltage activated calcium channel. More recently,
      scientific interest has proven to the low voltage activated calcium channel, also called
      T-type channels. The data from the literature show significant involvement of these channels
      in the physiology of nociception and pathophysiology of acute and chronic pain. Moreover, in
      several animal pain models (acute, neuropathic, inflammatory), T-type channels inhibition
      alleviates painful behaviours.

      Analgesics treatments available in clinic are ineffective in some patients with chronic pain
      (neuropathic, inflammatory) and often induce deleterious side effects. Thus, the clinical use
      of selective inhibitors of T-type channels could not only help the development of new
      therapies for the treatment of neuropathic pain (prevalence = 5-8 %), but also have a
      pharmaco-economic impact due to the low selling price of their inhibitor currently available:
      Zarontin®.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of ethosuximide (Zarontin®) on the
      pain symptoms and quality of life in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain compared to a
      control group.

      This is a multicentre, parallel-group, double-blind, randomised clinical trial comparing
      ethosuximide and inactive control for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain, assessed
      by numerical rating scale and quality of life questionnaire.
