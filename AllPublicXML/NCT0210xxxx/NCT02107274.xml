  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is a chronic lung condition characterised primarily by dilatation of the
      airways. Only a small number of clinical studies have been conducted investigating the use of
      macrolides to treat non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the efficacy of 12 weeks treatment with azithromycin in adult patients with
      non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies of various macrolides with small sample sizes have reported some benefit
      with the reduction of sputum volume in bronchiectasis patients. However, macrolide therapy
      could not yet be confidently used to treat bronchiectasis, given the diffuse nature of these
      findings. These studies have had a wide range of hypotheses, and have not necessarily focused
      on the anti-inflammatory effects of macrolides. Furthermore, these studies are few in number,
      and not all have been placebo-controlled or double-blinded. This, combined with the small
      sample sizes used, limits the reliability of these results. This study aims to expand on
      these limited published findings by investigating a larger sample population with different
      endpoints. Sputum volume and quality of life have been selected as important variables to aid
      in assessing efficacy.

      This study aims to be independent of previous studies in a number of ways. This is the only
      study of bronchiectasis patients to formally investigate quality of life after treatment with
      a macrolide, and the potential carryover effect of azithromycin therapy. This study will also
      expand on the findings of previous studies of macrolides in bronchiectasis by incorporating a
      larger sample size into the trial.

    <time_frame>Visit 3 (Baseline); Visit 6 (Week 12); Visit 8 (Week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant must be instructed and enabled to collect 24 hour sputum volumes over the 24 hours prior to visits 3, 6 and 8, inclusive. As this is the primary endpoint of the study, it is critical that 24 hour sputum volumes are measured and recorded accurately, observing the following protocol: The subject should be given a sterile jar to collect the sputum, which has been weighed previously for convenience. Each jar will be labelled with subject name, start and finish time/date The collection should commence on rising in the morning and complete 24 hours later. Ensure that the sputum sample has minimal saliva in the collection Instruct subject to collect all sputum produced spontaneously or after coughing over a single daytime 24 hour period. The sample should come from the lungs and should not be salivary. Encourage subject not to swallow sputum, but to collect. Each 24 hour collection period should be as similar as possible in terms of physiotherapy and exercise regimens</description>

Subjects should avoid the following prior to lung function testing: Smoking within 1 hour of testing Consuming alcohol within 4 hours of testing Performing vigorous exercise within 30 minutes of testing Wearing restrictive clothing around the chest or abdomen Eating a large meal within 2 hours of testing The following medications must be withheld prior to testing, with the minimum time from last dose indicated- short acting beta agonists (6 hours), long acting beta agonists (12 hours), ipratropium bromide (12 hours), antihistamines (12 hours), long acting bronchodilator combinations (12 hours)</description>

Lower scores are associated with good quality of life and the higher scores indicates poor quality of life. Total score is a product of summation of individual scores per question.</description>

        <title>24 Hour Sputum Volume</title>
        <description>Each participant must be instructed and enabled to collect 24 hour sputum volumes over the 24 hours prior to visits 3, 6 and 8, inclusive. As this is the primary endpoint of the study, it is critical that 24 hour sputum volumes are measured and recorded accurately, observing the following protocol: The subject should be given a sterile jar to collect the sputum, which has been weighed previously for convenience. Each jar will be labelled with subject name, start and finish time/date The collection should commence on rising in the morning and complete 24 hours later. Ensure that the sputum sample has minimal saliva in the collection Instruct subject to collect all sputum produced spontaneously or after coughing over a single daytime 24 hour period. The sample should come from the lungs and should not be salivary. Encourage subject not to swallow sputum, but to collect. Each 24 hour collection period should be as similar as possible in terms of physiotherapy and exercise regimens</description>

        <description>Pulmonary function testing using a spirometer will be carried out at visits 3, 6 and 8 inclusive. All testing should be done in the sitting position, except for obese patients, who commonly obtain deeper inspiration when tested in the standing position. Subjects should avoid the following prior to lung function testing: Smoking within 1 hour of testing Consuming alcohol within 4 hours of testing Performing vigorous exercise within 30 minutes of testing Wearing restrictive clothing around the chest or abdomen Eating a large meal within 2 hours of testing The following medications must be withheld prior to testing, with the minimum time from last dose indicated- short acting beta agonists (6 hours), long acting beta agonists (12 hours), ipratropium bromide (12 hours), antihistamines (12 hours), long acting bronchodilator combinations (12 hours)</description>
