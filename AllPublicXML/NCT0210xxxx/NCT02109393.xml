  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators evaluate whether an aerobic, intensive, goal based and multidisciplinary
      rehabilitation treatment, previously conceived for Parkinson's disease, is effective for
      patients with progressive supranuclear palsy and whether a driven gait orthosis (Lokomat) can
      provide further benefits.

    <description>This group underwent a 4-weeks MIRT exploiting the use of a treadmill-plus (treadmill associated with visual cues and auditory feedbacks).
Inclusion criteria: a) diagnosis of idiopathic PSP in accordance to the NINDS-SPSP International Criteria (Litvan et al., 1996), b) age between 55 and 85 c) ability to walk unassisted for at least 6 meters, d) stable dopaminergic drugs dosage in the month preceding the admission to the study. Exclusion criteria: a) any others significant neurological or orthopedic disorders, b) osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, cutaneous lesions and/or other pressure wounds, c) body weight exceeding 135 kg (the weight limit for the use of Lokomat®), respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.</description>

    <intervention_name>MIRT</intervention_name>
    <description>It consists of a 4-weeks physical therapy which entails four daily sessions for five days. All treatments are performed in aerobic condition. The duration of each session, including recovery periods, is about one hour. The first session consists of a one-to-one session with physical therapist. The second session includes aerobic and repetitive exercises to improve balance and gait using different devices: a posturographic platform with visual cues, cycloergometer, treadmill-plus. The third is a session of occupational therapy. The last session includes one hour of speech therapy.
All patients undergo 20-minutes treadmill-plus training per day, 5 times a week, for 4 weeks.</description>
