  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional magnetic resonance cholangiography (fMRC) with gadoxetate disodium (Eovist) is an
      accurate method of diagnosing acute cholecystitis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To determine the accuracy of fMRC in evaluating patients with suspected cholecystitis.

      Secondary Objective:

      To compare the results of fMRC with conventional hepatobiliary scintigraphy.
