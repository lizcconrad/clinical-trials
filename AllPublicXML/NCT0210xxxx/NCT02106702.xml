  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, there are over 600 unduplicated HIV-infected persons incarcerated in the San
      Francisco jail. Two thirds of those released with HIV-focused discharge planning are
      reincarcerated within one year. More than half of HIV-infected jail inmates are diagnosed
      with mental health conditions severe enough to require medication and a similar proportion
      report substance use disorders at the time of detention. While some community-based services
      exist, there remains a critical need to improve linkages to care and adherence to care plans
      for HIV-infected adults as they move between community and jail. The Navigator Project is a
      five-year randomized study that will test the effectiveness of an intensive enhanced case
      management intervention to reduce sex and drug-related HIV transmission risk; increase HIV
      medication adherence; reduce drug dependence; and reduce reincarceration.
