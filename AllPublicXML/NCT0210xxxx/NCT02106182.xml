    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine safety and efficacy of silodosin, which is a
      treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia with high selectivity to α1A-receptor, on patients
      with benign prostatic hyperplasia accompanied by nocturia.

      This study is designed as a multi-center, prospective, open-label and single-arm study.
      Subjects who are willing to provide written informed consent will be enrolled after screening
      for eligibility criteria. The subjects will be administered with investigational product for
      12 weeks and visit as outpatients for evaluation of safety and efficacy at baseline (visit 2)
      and 4 weeks (visit 3) and 12 weeks (visit 4) after baseline.
