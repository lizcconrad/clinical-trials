    <description>Dose: Subjects weighing 3.0 kg received 3.15 mg (1 spray/1 nostril), subjects weighing 5.1 - 10.0 kg received 5.25 mg (1 spray/1 nostril), subjects weighing 10.1 - 15.4 kg received 10.5 mg (1 spray/1 nostril), subjects weighing 15.5 - 31.7 kg received 15.75 mg (1 spray/1 nostril), and subjects weighing &gt;=31.8 kg received 31.5 mg (1 spray/2 nostrils).
Duration of Treatment: Subjects received a dose of SPRIX every 6 hours from the day of surgery until the morning of post-operative Day 2. Dosing may have resumed after final PK assessment of the morning of post-operative Day 3 until post-operative Day 4. A follow-up phone interview took place 14 days after the final dose of study drug.</description>

             based on an age appropriate scale.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) â‰¤ 95th percentile of age.

          -  Surgical procedures that would allow the subject to likely remain in the hospital
             until the morning of post-operative day 3 (to complete PK sample collection).

          -  With parental assistance, willing and able to complete the study procedures and pain
             scales and to communicate meaningfully with the study personnel.

          -  The patient requires regular use (daily use in at least 25 days per month) in the 3
             months prior to surgery of NSAID's , COX2 inhibitors, tramadol, or acetaminophen at
             daily dose of more than 2 g for the management of pain.

          -  Contraindication to the use of morphine, general anesthetics, bupivacaine,
             ropivacaine, lidocaine, other local anesthetics, muscle relaxants, hydrocodone,
