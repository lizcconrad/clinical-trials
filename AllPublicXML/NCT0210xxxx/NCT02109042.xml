    <textblock>
      The purpose(s) of this study is to measure how much of the study drug gets into the blood
      stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it when given in multiple doses,
      subcutaneously (SQ) (by inserting a needle just under the surface of the skin in the lower
      abdominal area), to post-menopausal female participants. Information about any side effects
      that may occur will also be collected.

      This study will also be looking for special markers called &quot;biomarkers&quot; that can be used to
      study osteoporosis and/or the effects of the study drug.

      There will be 2 parts to this study. The first part will last approximately 6 weeks and the
      second part will last approximately 7 weeks.
