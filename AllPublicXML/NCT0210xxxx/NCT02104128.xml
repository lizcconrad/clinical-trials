    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the role of dopaminergic neural systems in the symptoms and
      treatment of depression. 40 patients who meet DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of depression
      will be compared to a matched sample of healthy controls. The depressed group will receive
      open label treatment with Bupropion MR (150mg bd) for 6 weeks. The control group will receive
      no treatment. All participants will be assessed before treatment, after 2 weeks treatment and
      at 6 weeks treatment. The outcomes assessed will be 1) fMRI estimates of neural response to
      reward to emotionally valenced stimuli (1st and 2nd assessments), 2) computer based measures
      of emotional processing (all assessments) and 3) standardised questionnaire measures of
      depressive symptoms (all assessments). The primary study hypothesis is that altering central
      dopamine using Bupropion will lead to altered neural responses to rewarding stimuli in the
      depressed patients (i.e. comparing fMRI outcomes between assessment visits 1 and 2). A
      secondary hypothesis is that this neural change will predict subsequent symptom response to
      the bupropion (i.e. comparing symptom scores between assessment visits 1 and 3), Lastly, the
      study will test the hypothesis that baseline differences in reward circuitry will be
      particularly associated with symptoms of anhedonia (the inability to experience pleasure).

    <description>Bupropion MR will be given open label to all participants in the depression group. Participants will receive 150mg od for one week. The dose will then be increased to 150mg bd for the following 5 weeks. Participants in the control group will recieve no drug. Note that the study is not assessing the safety or efficacy of buprion-- it is using bupropion to assess the neural effects of altering central dopaminergic function in depressed patients.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have signed an informed consent document indicating they understand
             the purpose of the study and the procedures required for the study and are willing to
             participate by complying with the study procedures and restrictions

          -  Participants will be male or female and aged between 18 and 50

          -  Participants will have a Body Mass Index (BMI) 18 to 36 kg/m2 (inclusive) at the
             Screening Visit.

          -  The MDD participants must satisfy a diagnosis of MDD as determined by structured
             clinical interview for DSM-V (SCID) conducted by a psychiatrist. The MDD subtypes
             characterized under DSM-V also will be determined for use during post hoc tests aimed
             at characterizing further the heterogeneity extant within the MDD population.

          -  Participants must be sufficiently fluent in English to complete the emotional and
             reward tasks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current use of psychotropic medication or electroconvulsive therapy (within three
             weeks of the baseline assessments) or psychological treatment (within 3 months of the
             baseline assessments)

          -  They are left handed (the site of brain activations vary depending on handedness)

          -  They are not fluent in English

          -  History of stimulant abuse (lifetime; e.g., amphetamine, cocaine), or of alcohol abuse
             within one year or of alcohol dependence within the lifetime.

          -  History of, or current medical conditions which in the opinion of the investigator may
             interfere with the scientific assessments or safety of the participant, including
             brain injury, epilepsy/seizures, severe hepatic cirrhosis and CNS tumour.

          -  Clinically significant abnormal values for liver function tests, clinical chemistry,
             urine drug screen, blood pressure measurement and ECG. It is expected that laboratory
             values will generally be within the normal range for the laboratory. NB clinical
             significance will be determined by a qualified study medic who will review the results
             and the participant.

          -  Current pregnancy or breastfeeding

          -  Smoker &gt; 10 cigarettes per day or similar levels of tobacco consumption in other
             forms. History of smoking within 8 weeks of becoming abstinent.

          -  Any contraindication to MRI scanning, for example any metal implants in the body that
             include ferromagnetic objects in their bodies (e.g., metal implants, vessel clips,
             shrapnel injuries) or with implanted devices which may be damaged by the magnet (e.g.,
             heart pacemakers).

          -  Participation in a psychological or medical study involving the use of medication
             within the last 3 months. Previous participation in any study involving the emotional
             test battery.

          -  Has clinically significant risk of suicidal behaviour.

          -  Medical conditions that may alter the hemodynamic parameters underlying the BOLD
             signal (e.g., inadequately treated hypertension, diabetes mellitus).

        The following exclusion criteria apply specifically to the participants in the MDD group:

          -  Any known allergy, hypersensitivity or intolerance to bupropion or its excipients.

          -  Has any contraindication to the use of bupropion.

          -  Any medical contraindication, for example conditions or treatments that may alter the
             absorption of bupropion such as surgical treatments involving the gut.

          -  History of or current Axis 1 DSM-V psychiatric disorder (except depression or anxiety
             disorders such as specific phobia or social anxiety disorder for the MDD group and
             drug abuse subject to the criteria outlined below).The presence of co-morbid anxiety
             disorders will be recorded for potential use in post hoc exploratory analyses of the
             influence of such conditions on the outcome measures
