  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is increasing rapidly all over the world not only in adults but also among children.
      As a modifiable component of total energy expenditure (TEE) ,the amount of energy expended
      during physical activity plays an important role in preventing weight gain. Decreased
      physical activity, coupled with an over-consumption of calories, lead to the change of body
      composition by storing energy as fat.Although several studies have simultaneously examined
      body composition with energy expenditure the independent roles of body composition with
      activity energy expenditure (AEE) are less firmly established. It's suspected shrewdly that
      energy expenditure is partly influenced by the body composition. The aim of the study is to
      examine the relation of AEE with body composition in a population of school-age children.

      Body composition (ie. FAT% and FFM) will be evaluated by means of bioelectrical impedance
      analysis (BIA) with Inbody 720 (Biospace, Seoul, South Korea). Anthropometric dimensions will
      be recorded for all participants according to standard procedures. Height will be recorded to
      the nearest 1.0mm by using a field stadiometer (Seca Corporation, Germany). FitMate metabolic
      system (Cosmed, Rome, Italy) will be used to estimate AEE. Subjects will be tested in a
      10-minute submaximal exercise test using the FitMate systems while taking cycling test at 50
      Watts on an electrically braked bicycle ergometer. Each subject will be connected to a
      calibrated respiratory gas analyzer, a portable metabolic analyzer designed for measurement
      of oxygen consumption during exercise via a face mask. Heart rate will be simultaneously
      measured with the use of a Cosmed wireless HR monitor to track the participant's heart rate
      level.

    <description>Each participant will be weighted while wearing light clothing, after fasting for at least 4 hours and emptying the bladder. Body composition, such as body weight, fat mass(FM), fat percentage (FAT%) and free fat mass (FFM) will be measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis(BIA) with Inbody 720 (Biospace, Seoul, South Korea).Body composition measurement will be compared between the normal weight group and overweight/obesity group.</description>

    <time_frame>up to 30 days after participating in the study</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant will be asked to perform a cycling test to measure the AEE. Measurements will be recorded in the early afternoon. Total AEE (kcal) will be measured in the test. The exercise time will be adjusted by using the AEE (kcal/min), which was calculated as Total AEE/min. The weight-adjusted AEE (kcal/kg/min) will be calculated to facilitate comparisons between persons. AEE will be compared between the overweight/obesity group and normal weight group.</description>
