  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well lapatinib ditosylate before surgery works in
      treating patients with high-grade glioma that has come back after a period of time during
      which the tumor could not be detected. Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To achieve an intratumoral lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate) concentration of at least 1.5
      uM in at least 70% of patients 3 hours after the last dose of pulsatile lapatinib. (Group A)
      II. To determine the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of pulsatile lapatinib (at pulsatile maximum
      tolerated dose [MTD]) on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation (using
      Mesoscale Discovery enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] assay for total and
      phospho-EGFR). (Group A and Reference Group)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety profile of pulsatile lapatinib in pre-operative patients with EGFR
      amplified recurrent high-grade glioma. (Group A and Reference Group) II. To evaluate acute
      and late toxicities associated with pulsatile lapatinib. (Group A and Reference Group) III.
      To determine the effect of lapatinib on tumor cell proliferation (marker of proliferation
      Ki-67 [KI-67] staining). (Group A compared to Reference Group) IV. To determine the ex-vivo
      sensitivity of tumor sphere cultures to lapatinib. (Group A and Reference Group) V. To assess
      tumor objective response rate (ORR). (Group A and Reference Group) VI. To estimate overall
      survival (OS). (Group A and Reference Group) VII. To estimate progression-free survival.
      (Group A and Reference Group)

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      GROUP A: Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -2 to 0.
      Within 3-5 hours after last dose of lapatinib ditosylate, patients undergo surgical resection
      of tumor on day 0. Within 30 days of surgical resection of tumor, patients receive lapatinib
      ditosylate BID for 2 days every 7 days. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      REFERENCE GROUP: Patients undergo surgical resection of tumor on day 0. Within 30 days of
      surgical resection of tumor, patients receive lapatinib ditosylate BID for 2 days every 7
      days. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at 30 days, every 2 months
      for 2 years, and every 6 months thereafter.
