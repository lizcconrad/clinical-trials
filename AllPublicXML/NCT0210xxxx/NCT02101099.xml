  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine if more force is used during colonoscopy when patients
      receive monitored anesthesia with propofol versus conscious sedation. Force measurements will
      be performed using the colonoscopy force monitor (CFM). This device measures the magnitude
      and direction of force applied to the insertion tube of a standard colonoscope during
      colonoscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized factorial design of colonoscopy with either propofol administered anesthesia or
      conscious sedation. Twelve experienced endoscopists from community and academic centers will
      perform colonoscopy using either propofol or conscious sedation on a group of 12 patients for
      each endoscopist for a study total of 144 patients. An equal number of male and female
      patients will be included in each group.
