    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether systemic chemotherapy combined
      with hepatic arterial infusion with floxuridine and dexamethasone can increase the complete
      resection rate (R0) and improve the overall survival in patients with initially unresectable
      colorectal liver metastasis.

    <textblock>
      Recent studies and our experience have proved the efficacy and safety of systemic
      chemotherapy combined with hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) with floxuridine and dexamethasone
      in patients with initially unresectable colorectal liver metastasis. However, most of them
      are retrospective studies, phase I or II clinical researches, which could not provide
      high-level evidence. Therefore, we designed this study to determine whether systemic
      chemotherapy combined with HAI can increase the complete resection rate (R0) and improve the
      overall survival in patients with initially unresectable colorectal liver metastasis.
