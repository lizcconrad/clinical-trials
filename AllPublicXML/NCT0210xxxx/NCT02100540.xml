  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hot flashes are the most common symptom of menopause and affect almost 75% of menopausal
      women. Clinical evidence indicates potent antagonists of 5-HT2A are more likely to cause
      hypothermia. Risperidone is a potent 5-HT2A and a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist and is
      proposed to have effect on reduciton of hot flashes through its dopaminergic and serotonergic
      antagonism. The primary purpose of this study is to determine if RCN3028 is effective and
      safe in the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated. In accordance with
      the latest FDA guidance study participants will have a minimum of 7 moderate to sever hot
      flashes per day, or 50 per week at baseline.

          -  Menopausal (postmenopausal or perimenopausal) adult women who are suffering from
             vasomotor symptom or women who are suffering from drug (tamoxifen or aromatase
             inhibitors) induced vasomotor symptoms. Women have received postsurgical bilateral
             oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy will be eligible for the study;

             - Women who are on tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, it has to be for at least 8

          -  Must average 7 or more moderate to severe hot flashes per day or 50 per week, based
             upon data obtained from a completed VMS episode event log for a 1 week period prior to
             randomization where moderate is defined as a sensation of heat with sweating, able to
             continue activity, and severe is defined as a sensation of heat with sweating, causing
             cessation of activity. Awake at night due to sweats will be recorded separately and
             will be considered as severe;

          -  Ability to understand and follow the instructions of the investigator, including
             completion of the VMS episode event logs (patient diary) as described in the protocol;
