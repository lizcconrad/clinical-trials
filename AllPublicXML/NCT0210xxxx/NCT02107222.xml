      A Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled Trial to Determine Safety and Efficacy of Pump Assisted
      Lung Protection (PALP™) for Low Flow Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Removal in Conjunction with
      Liberation from Mechanical Ventilation Compared to Mechanical Ventilation Alone in Patients
      with COPD Exacerbation and Respiratory Failure

      Primary Study Objectives

      • To evaluate the clinical effect of PALP™ in reducing the time on invasive ventilation in
      patients with an exacerbation of COPD requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.

      Secondary Study Objectives

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PALP™ in patients with an exacerbation of
           COPD requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.

        -  To determine if rates of adverse events (AEs) are reduced in patients who receive PALP™
           and invasive mechanical ventilation vs invasive mechanical ventilation alone.

        -  To determine mortality rates in patients who receive PALP™ and invasive mechanical
           ventilation vs invasive mechanical ventilation alone.

        -  To determine if PALP™ will effectively reduce the number of subsequent acute
           decompensations requiring hospital admission for ventilatory support (invasive or
           noninvasive).

          5. Currently endotracheally intubated and requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (must
             have been on invasive mechanical ventilation for 24-48 hours)

          6. Able to tolerate large bore intravenous (IV) cannulation required for proper operation
             of study device

          7. For female patients of child-bearing potential, a negative urine or serum pregnancy
             test at screening; all female patients will be considered of child-bearing potential
