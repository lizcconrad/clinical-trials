  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare the safety and efficacy of a generic mometasone nasal spray to the
      reference listed drugs in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Additionally both the
      test and the reference formulations will be tested for superiority against a placebo nasal
      spray.

    <textblock>
      The study is to compare the safety, efficacy, and superiority of generic mometasone nasal
      spray to reference products and to placebo in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.
      This protocol describes randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4- treatment group
      parallel study of 14 days duration preceded by a single blind 7-day placebo run-in period to
      investigate the clinical equivalence of Mylan's Mometasone Furoate Monohydrate Nasal Spray,
      50 ug per actuation to Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme's (MSD) Nasonex® Nasal Spray, 50 ug per actuation
      or MSD EU's Nasonex® Nasal Spray Suspension, 50 ug per actuation. In addition, the
      superiority of the test and reference products to placebo will be assessed. Prior to
      randomization to one of 4 study groups, each subject will have a 7-day placebo run-in period.
      Each subject will then receive one of the following treatments: Mylan's Mometasone Furoate
      Nasal Spray 50 μg/actuation (2 actuations per nostril per day); Merck-US Nasonex® Nasal Spray
      50 μg/actuation (2 actuations per nostril per day); Merck-EU's Nasonex® and Nasal Spray
      Suspension 50 μg/actuation (2 actuations per nostril per day); or Mylan's Placebo Nasal Spray
      50 μL/actuation (2 actuations per nostril per day). Active treatment is for 14 days duration.
      Reflective total nasal scores (rTNSS) will be collected every 12 hours for 21 days.

    <description>The statistical analysis for both clinical equivalence and superiority of the active treatments over placebo will involve Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), respectively.
The Per-Protocol Population (PPP) will be used for the primary analysis of bioequivalence.
The Intent-to-Treat Population (ITT) will be used for the primary analysis of superiority.</description>

             allowed (e.g. over-the-counter 1% hydrocortisone).

             *Use of chronic medication that could affect the course of seasonal allergic rhinitis.

          6. Diseases
