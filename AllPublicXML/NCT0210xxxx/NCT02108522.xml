  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients enrolled on this study will have received a stem cell transplant. After a
      transplant, while the immune system grows back the patient is at risk for infection. Some
      viruses can stay in the body for life and if the immune system is weakened, like after a
      transplant, they can cause life threatening infections.

      Patients enrolled on this study will have had an infection with one or more of the following
      viruses - Epstein Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), BK virus, JC virus, adenovirus or
      HHV6 (Human Herpes Virus 6).

      Investigators want to see if they can use a kind of white blood cell called T cells to treat
      infections of these viruses after a transplant. Investigators have observed in other studies
      that treatment with specially trained T cells has been successful when the cells are made
      from the transplant donor. However as it takes 1-2 months to make the cells, that approach is
      not practical when a patient already has an infection.

      Investigators have now generated multivirus-specific T cells (VSTs) from the blood of healthy
      donors and created a bank of these cells. Investigators have previously successfully used
      frozen multivirus-specific T cells from healthy donors to treat virus infections after bone
      marrow transplant and now have improved the production method to make it safer and target
      more viruses.

      In this study, investigators want to find out if they can use these banked VSTs to fight
      infections caused by the viruses mentioned above.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      These VST lines have been made at Baylor College of Medicine from donors for other transplant
      patients or other normal donors some of whom were from the National Marrow Donor Program. All
      donors have been screened with the standard blood bank donor questionnaire, medical history
      and testing for infectious disease by a doctor who is experienced in screening transplant
      donors. Only donors who have cleared this process and were deemed to be eligible provided
      blood for VST generation.

      The lines were made using a special process. To make the VSTs investigators mixed donor cells
      with small pieces of proteins, called peptides that come from adenovirus, CMV, EBV, BKV and
      HHV6. These peptides stimulate donor T cells that react against the viruses to grow and train
      the donor T cells to kill cells that are infected with CMV, EBV, adenovirus, BKV and HHV6.

      Once the investigators made sufficient numbers of VSTs, they tested them to make sure they
      would target cells infected with these virusesbut not normal cells. Then the cells were
      frozen.

      For patients treated on this study, the VSTs will be thawed and injected into their
      intravenous line. The patient will remain in the clinic for at least one hour after the
      infusion. After the patient receives the cells, their transplant doctor will monitor the
      levels of the virus the patient is infected with in their blood. The investigators will also
      take blood to see how long the VSTs given to the patient last in their body.

      The patient will continue to be followed by their doctors after the injection. The patient
      will either be seen in the clinic or will be contacted by a research nurse to follow up for
      this study every week for 6 weeks then at 3, 6 and 12 months. The patient may have other
      visits for their standard care.

      The patient will also have regular blood tests done to follow their counts and the viral
      infection, but most of these will be done as part of their standard medical care. To learn
      more about the way the VSTs are working in the patient's body, up to an extra 30-40 ml (6-8
      teaspoons) of blood will be taken before the infusion and then at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 weeks and 3
      months. Blood should come from the central intravenous line, and should not require extra
      needle sticks.

      All participants on this study will be infused with the same number (dose) of cells. If after
      the first treatment the patient has a persistent infection, we would discuss this with
      him/her and allow an option to receive more treatments. These additional treatments might be
      with cells from the same donor or if we feel that there is another donor's whose cells might
      be better for the patient, we would use cells from a different donor. This second product
      will be administered at the same dose level 28 days after the initial infusion, and
      subsequent infusions should be at least 14 days apart. After each VST infusion, the patient
      will be monitored as described above.

                  standard therapy. Standard therapy is defined as antiviral therapy with cidofovir
                  or an alternative antiviral agent if patient will not tolerate cidofovir therapy
                  because of poor renal function.

                    -  Adenovirus infection: defined as the presence of adenoviral positivity as
                       detected by PCR or culture from ONE site such as stool or blood or urine or
                       nasopharynx.

                    -  Adenovirus disease: defined as the presence of adenoviral positivity as

               3. EBV: For treatment of persistent EBV infection despite standard therapy. For EBV
                  infection, standard therapy is defined as rituximab given at 375mg/m2 in patients
                  for 1-4 doses with a CD20+ve tumor.

                    -  EBV infection: defined as Biopsy proven lymphoma with EBV genomes detected
                       in tumor cells by immunocytochemistry or in situ PCR,Or clinical or imaging

                       peripheral blood.

                    -  Failure of therapy is defined as: Increase or less than 50% response at
                       sites of disease for EBV lymphoma OR, Increase or a fall of less than 50% in
                       EBV viral load in peripheral blood or any site of disease after 1st dose of
                       rituximab.

               4. BK virus: Treatment of persistent BK virus infection or BK virus disease despite
                  antiviral treatment with cidofovir or leflunomide. No clear standard treatment is
                  defined. Cidofovir has been administered in low doses as well as high doses to
                  HSCT patients with BK infections but no randomized trials are available proving
                  its clinical efficacy. In small trials leflunomide had activity against BK virus,
                  therefore we will consider this agent an acceptable alternative to cidofovir,
                  given the absence of a clear first line option.

                    -  BK virus infection is defined as the presence of BK virus positivity as
                       detected by PCR or culture in one site such as blood or urine.

                    -  BK virus disease is defined as the presence of BK virus detectable by
                       culture or PCR in blood or urine or other body fluids and symptoms of
                       disease including, but not limited to persistent microscopic or macroscopic
                       hematuria or detectable BK virus in more than one site.

                    -  Failure of therapy is defined as a rise or a fall of less than 50% in viral
                       load in peripheral blood or any site of disease as measured by PCR or any
                       other quantitative assay) or worsening hematuria after 7 days of antiviral
                       therapy.

               5. HHV6: Treatment of persistent HHV6 infection or disease despite antiviral
                  treatment with ganciclovir, cidofovir and foscarnet. No clear standard treatment
                  is defined. Ganciclovir, cidofovir and foscarnet all have variable in vitro
                  activity against HHV-6, and may have a role in treating HHV-6-associated disease
                  - therefore antiviral treatment with one or more of these agents will we
                  acceptable initial therapy.

                    -  HHV6 virus infection is defined as the presence of elevated HHV-6 levels as
                       detected by PCR or positive culture in one site such as CSF or blood.

                    -  HHV6 disease is defined as defined as the presence of HHV6 detectable by
                       culture or PCR in one or more sites such as blood or CSF and symptoms of
                       disease including symptoms of HHV6 encephalitis OR detectable HHV6 by PCR or
                       culture in more than one site.

                    -  Failure of therapy is defined as a rise or a fall of less than 50% in viral
                       load in peripheral blood or any site of disease (as measured by PCR or any
                       other quantitative assay) after 7 days of antiviral therapy.

               6. JC virus: Treatment of progressive or persistent JC virus infection or disease
                  without suitable alternative treatment option. Pepmixes specific for antigens on
                  adenovirus, EBV, CMV, HHV6 and BK virus are used to generate our
                  multivirus-specific VSTs. No pepmix specific for the rare JC virus is used for
                  generation of these CTLs, however given the high homology (&gt;90%) between JC and
                  BK and the fact that BK virus-specific T cells targeting VP1 and Large T (as
                  targeted in our multivirus VSTs) have been administered to treat JCV-PML,
                  resulting in viral clearance from the cerebrospinal fluid it is likely that our
                  VSTs are efficacious against JC virus. Given the current lack of treatment
                  options for JC virus infection or reactivation after HSCT and the risk of
                  progression to JML, which is almost uniformly fatal, and the apparent activity of
                  BK virus-directed T cells against JC virus infected cells, we propose including
                  patients with progressive or persistent JC virus on this study, unless a suitable
                  alternative therapy is available.

                    -  JC virus infection is defined as the presence of elevated JC virus levels as
                       detected by PCR or positive culture in one site such as CSF or blood.

                    -  JC virus disease is defined as defined as the presence of JC virus
                       detectable by culture or PCR in one or more sites such as blood or CSF and
                       symptoms of disease including symptoms of PML OR detectable JC virus by PCR
                       or culture in more than one site.

          3. Patients with multiple CMV, EBV, Adenovirus, HHV6 and BK virus infections are eligible
             given that each infection is persistent despite standard therapy as defined above.
             Patients with multiple infections with one or more reactivation and one or more
             controlled infection are eligible to enroll.

          4. Clinical status at enrollment to allow tapering of steroids to equal or less than 0.5
             mg/kg/day prednisone (or equivalent).

          5. HgB&gt;8.0

          6. Pulse oximetry of &gt; 90% on room air

          7. Available multivirus-specific VSTs

          8. Negative pregnancy test in female patients if applicable (childbearing potential who
             have received a reduced intensity conditioning regimen).

          9. Written informed consent and/or signed assent line from patient, parent or guardian.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients receiving ATG, Campath or other immunosuppressive T cell monoclonal
             antibodies within 28 days of screening for enrollment.

          2. Patients with other uncontrolled infections. For bacterial infections, patients must
             be receiving definitive therapy and have no signs of progressing infection for 72
             hours prior to enrollment. For fungal infections patients must be receiving definitive
             systemic anti-fungal therapy and have no signs of progressing infection for 1 week
             prior to enrollment.

             Progressing infection is defined as hemodynamic instability attributable to sepsis or
             new symptoms, worsening physical signs or radiographic findings attributable to
             infection. Persisting fever without other signs or symptoms will not be interpreted as
             progressing infection.

          3. Patients who are less than 28 days removed from their allogeneic hematopoieteic stem
             cell transplant or who have received donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) within 28 days.
