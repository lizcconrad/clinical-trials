    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to record and compare the inhalation profiles of non pregnant
      women and those who are in the third stage of labour. The inhalation profiles will be
      recorded from consenting women as they inhale with maximal effort through an inhalation
      profile recorder [Glaxosmithkline (GSK), Ware]. The recorder will simulate resistance to
      airflow and will be representative of a dry powder inhaler of moderate resistivity. The
      inhalation endpoints will include Peak Pressure Drop, Peak Inspiratory Flow Rate, Inhaled
      Volume, Inhalation time, Average Inhalation Flow Rate and Acceleration rate which will be
      compared between the two female cohorts. Inhalation profiles recorded in this way may
      subsequently be used to study the in-vitro performance of investigational materials across
      inhalation parameters representative of the target patient population.

      An appropriate number of subjects will be consented so that approximately 40 subjects (20
      non-pregnant females and 20 stage three labour subjects) complete assessments. The inhalation
      profiles will be recorded on the same day of screening or at another time within a span of 50
      days
