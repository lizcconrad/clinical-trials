      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of autologous cord blood
      transfusions in very-low-birth-weight premature infants, and to evaluate the developmental
      outcomes of the infants who received autologous transfusions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood transfusions have many risks including transfusion reactions and infections. Cord blood
      is accepted as an alternative method for red cell transfusions in low-birth weight (LBW)
      premature newborns. However, experience and scientific evidence concerning in-vivo efficacy
      and safety of red blood cell (RBC) concentrates derived from cord blood in very LBW premature
      newborns is still insufficient.

      A total of 50 umbilical cord blood (UCB) collected from infants born before 32 weeks'
      gestational age and processed into autologous RBC products. Infants requiring blood
      transfusion were randomly assigned to an autologous or allogeneic product. Two randomized
      groups were compared on the 14th, 28th, 35th days and &gt;35th days with respect to hemoglobin
      levels, transfusion numbers, transfusion and phlebotomy volumes, and hemoglobin, reticulocyte
      counts and erythropoietin levels in the postconceptional 36th and 40th weeks' gestation, and
      hemoglobin levels at postnatal 6-months age. All transfused infants were developmentally
      assessed by the end of the postnatal first year.
