      The aim of this study is to compare two type of ablation catheters for pulmonary veins
      isolation (PVI) in subjects with atrial fibrillation.

      Currently, two technologies of irrigated ablation catheters are available for PVI.

      One of the two, the &quot;conventional&quot; catheter is widely used for atrial fibrillation (AF)
      treatment but has not been specifically created for pulmonary veins isolation, therefore,
      point by point encircling lesions are cumbersome and time consuming.

      The second is a new ablation catheter with a circular shape provided with 10 irrigated
      electrodes designed to create encircling lesions, necessary to obtain pulmonary veins
      isolation, could allow an easier and faster isolation compared to the conventional way.

      These two types of catheters have never been compared for atrial fibrillation. If one of the
      two catheters appears to be more efficient or causes fewer complications, the use of this
      catheter could be favored to conduct AF ablation.

    <description>In this arm the circular ablation catheter will be used for a quick mapping of left atrium with Carto system. The catheter will be positioned to pulmonary veins ostium to deliver radiofrequency on 1 to 10 electrodes simultaneous. The same catheter will be used to document pulmonary veins isolation (PVI).
A waiting period of 30 minutes will be observed after PVI to document possible reconnection(s). Adenosine will be injected (except in case of adenosine contraindication) and reconnection(s) site(s) will be noted.</description>

    <description>In this arm the conventional catheter will be used. It will be used for a left atrium quick mapping on Carto system. Radiofrequency will be delivered in a sequential manner in pulmonary veins for point by point ablation. Isolation will be guided and confirmed with the Lasso decapolar diagnostic catheter (Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, USA).
A waiting period of 30 minutes will be observed after PVI to document possible reconnection(s). Adenosine will be injected (except in case of adenosine contraindication) and reconnection(s) sites will be noted.</description>
