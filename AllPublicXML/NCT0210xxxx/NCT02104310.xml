  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For most brain tumors, radiation treatment is guided by a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
      scan. In this study, information from a special scan, called a Positron Emission Tomography/
      Computed Tomography (PET/CT) scan using an amino acid called
      Fluorine-18-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-DOPA) will also be used to image the tumor and
      guide your radiation oncologist in determining locations to treat with radiation. This type
      of scan has shown promise in being able to better distinguish tumor from normal brain tissue
      and may help to more accurately plan radiation treatment. This type of scan can also assist
      the radiation oncologist in identifying the most aggressive regions of the tumor. The goal of
      this study is to use the 18F-DOPA PET/CT scan to help determine where the disease is that
      needs to be treated with radiation, in order to improve the effectiveness of radiation in
      this tumor.
