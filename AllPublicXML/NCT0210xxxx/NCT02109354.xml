  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) is doing a study to test 2 experimental HIV vaccines in
      combination with 2 licensed vaccines for tetanus and hepatitis B. HIV is the virus that
      causes AIDS. Tetanus is an infection that causes muscular spasms. Hepatitis B is a virus that
      can cause liver failure.

      About 100 people will take part in this study at multiple sites. The US National Institutes
      of Health (NIH) is paying for the study.

      We are doing this study to answer several questions.

        -  Are the HIV study vaccines safe to give to people?

        -  Are people able to take the HIV study vaccines without becoming too uncomfortable?

        -  How do people's immune systems respond to the HIV study vaccines? (Your immune system
           protects you from disease.)

        -  Can people's immune responses to a tetanus or hepatitis B vaccines help us understand
           how their immune systems might respond to the HIV study vaccines?

        -  Is there a common immune response to licensed vaccines like the tetanus and hepatitis B
           vaccines?

          -  If a person has been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension during
             screening or previously, exclude for blood pressure that is not well controlled.
             Well-controlled blood pressure is defined as consistently ≤ 140 mm Hg systolic and ≤
             90 mm Hg diastolic, with or without medication, with only isolated, brief instances of
             higher readings, which must be ≤ 150 mm Hg systolic and ≤ 100 mm Hg diastolic. For
             these volunteers, blood pressure must be ≤ 140 mm Hg systolic and ≤ 90 mm Hg diastolic
             at enrollment.

          -  If a person has NOT been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension during
             screening or previously, exclude for systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mm Hg at enrollment
             or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mm Hg at enrollment.

               -  Bleeding disorder diagnosed by a doctor (eg, factor deficiency, coagulopathy, or
                  platelet disorder requiring special precautions)

               -  Malignancy (Not excluded: Volunteer who has had malignancy excised surgically and
                  who, in the investigator's estimation, has a reasonable assurance of sustained
                  cure. or who is unlikely to experience recurrence of malignancy during the period
                  of the study)

               -  Seizure disorder: History of seizure(s) within past three years. Also exclude if
                  volunteer has used medications in order to prevent or treat seizure(s) at any
                  time within the past 3 years.

               -  Asplenia: any condition resulting in the absence of a functional spleen

               -  History of hereditary angioedema, acquired angioedema, or idiopathic angioedema.
