  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research is needed to determine safe and effective exercise rehabilitation programs to
      prevent and improve physical disability in older adults living with HIV. This problem is of
      great importance to the VA. The majority of the 25 thousand HIV-infected veterans are over 50
      years of age (64%). The combined effect of aging and inflammation increase the risk for
      physical disability in older HIV-infected veterans. This translational exercise training
      trial will examine the cardiac and skeletal muscle effects of combined aerobic exercise and
      resistance training to attenuate the functional declines of aging with HIV by reducing the
      deleterious consequences of chronic inflammation. Findings will guide future rehabilitation
      research on cardiac remodeling and inflammation of skeletal muscle. The proposed research
      will advance the goal to develop effective rehabilitation strategies that improve the health
      of older HIV-infected veterans.

      The objective of this study is to determine the effect of exercise training on the central
      (cardiovascular) and peripheral (muscular) impairments underlying poor physical function by
      comparing older HIV-infected veterans randomized to combine aerobic and resistance exercise
      training versus usual care. The study hypothesis is that a progressive aerobic and resistance
      rehabilitation program will increase aerobic capacity and muscle strength, which will be
      mediated by improved diastolic function, increased muscle mass, and decreased systemic
      inflammation. To test this hypothesis, investigators will conduct a randomized 16-week trial
      of progressive aerobic and resistance training versus usual care control in 40 sedentary
      older (50+ years) HIV-infected veterans. The study will determine the effects of exercise
      training on aerobic capacity and diastolic function, and their relationship to changes in
      biomarkers of systemic inflammation and cardiac fibrosis (AIM 1). The study will also
      determine the effect of exercise training on strength and muscle mass, and their relationship
      to changes in biomarkers of systemic inflammation (AIM 2).
