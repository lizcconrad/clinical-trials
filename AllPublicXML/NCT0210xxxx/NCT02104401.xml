  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will help us to understand whether transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) can safely improve recovery of speech and language abilities, gait , and mood in
      people with Parkinson's disease and related disorders. Some of the disorders that will be
      studied to understand if tDCS can be useful include Parkinson's Disease, Multi-System Atrophy
      (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).

    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will perform an assessment of motor function using Part III of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), timed test of gait, and patient self-assessment. Speech functions will be assessed with sentence repetition,evaluation of spontaneous speech, and other standard language tests. The assessment will also include other measures and questionnaires (e.g. Bech Depression Inventory) to be filled out by the patient and his/her family.</description>

    <description>tDCS will be applied with a Soterix CT tDCS Device with a HD-tDCS 4x1 Multi-Channel Stimulation Interface. During stimulation, a low level of constant DC electrical current (1-2 mA) will be applied via the electrodes. Current will be ramped up over 10-60 seconds, and typically causes very mild tingling and itching sensations. The current will be applied for no more than 20 minutes per session, at which time the current is ramped down over 10-60 seconds. Subjects will be seated in a chair throughout tDCS administration. Subjects will receive tDCS 5 days/week for 4 weeks.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Parkinson's disease or a related disorder (e.g. Multiple Systems Atrophy) as diagnosed
             by a neurologist specializing in Movement Disorders

          -  Age &gt;= 18 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Skull defect at or near site of tDCS delivery.

          -  History of a significant stroke or traumatic brain injury.

          -  History of other brain conditions that could impact interpretation of results (such as
             MS, brain tumor, encephalitis).

          -  Presence of implanted electrical or metallic devices in the head or body (examples
             include cardiac pacemakers or defibrillators, Baclofen pumps, deep brain stimulators,
             ventricular shunts with metallic parts, vagus nerve stimulators)

          -  Presence of ferrous metal in the head (except titanium; for instance shrapnel)

          -  History of psychiatric disease requiring hospitalization, electroconvulsive therapy,
             or ongoing medication use (other than common antidepressants)
