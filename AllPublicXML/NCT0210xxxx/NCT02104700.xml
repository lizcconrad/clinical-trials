      The study will be an open-label, pilot study in virologically suppressed patients comparing
      the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two Antiretroviral regimen strategies:

      Arm A: &quot;Immediate switch&quot; Rilpivirine/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir (single tablet formulation
      (STF))at randomization

      Arm B: &quot;Delayed switch&quot; Continue Nevirapine/Lamivudine/other Nucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor (NRTI)through 24 weeks then switch to STF of Rilpivirine/emtrictabine/tenofovir and
      followed through 48 weeks.

      The current study is designed to be the first study to compare a continued nevirapine-based
      regimen to a switch to the FDC of rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir. Rwanda is a model
      country for implementation of newer approaches to more innovative ART strategies with an
      excellent National HIV Treatment program in place but has limited experience with clinical
      trials and as with most African countries has no clinical experience with Rilpivirine in
      treating HIV infected adults.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection, as documented by any licensed ELISA test kit and confirmed by Western
             blot at any time prior to study entry. A second antibody test by a method other than
             ELISA is acceptable as an alternative confirmatory test or a previous detectable HIV
             RNA level

          -  HIV RNA level below the limit of quantification of the viral load assay in use
             in-country within the last 12 months

          -  Screening HIV RNA level below the limit of quantification as defined by the local
             assay
