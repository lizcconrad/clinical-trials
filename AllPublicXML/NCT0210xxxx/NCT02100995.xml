  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an integrated behavioral treatment approach
      can help overweight or obese individuals who also have chronic pain reduce their weight and
      manage their pain symptoms. The goal of this research is to develop better treatments for
      individuals with chronic pain and overweight or obesity. All participants in this study will
      receive treatment for weight management and/or pain symptoms. Participants will be assigned
      at random (like we picked it blindly out of a hat) to receive either: (1) Standard behavioral
      treatment for weight loss; or (2) Standard behavioral treatment for pain management; or (3)
      Integrated behavioral treatment for weight loss and pain.
