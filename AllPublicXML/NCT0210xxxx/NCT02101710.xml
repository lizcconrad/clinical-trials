      This study is to evaluate the bioequivalence of Elantan SR 60 mg compared to Imdur SR 60 mg
      in sixty healthy Korean male subjects. Thirty subjects will be participating in a fasted
      state and other thirty subjects will be in a fed state. Elantan SR 60 mg and Imdur 60 mg are
      two formulations of Isosorbide 5-mononitrate.
