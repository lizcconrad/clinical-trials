      When people are tested on a previously learned material, they will later remember it better
      even when compared to a condition where they can re-study it. This phenomenon is called
      retrieval practice and is supported by an extensive research literature mostly carried out in
      normal students. This paradigm begins to be used in cognitive remediation programs in
      patients suffering from memory difficulties.

      The objective of this study is to investigate whether retrieval practice is spared in
      patients with schizophrenia.

      If effective, this method could be used in cognitive remediation programs.

      Since episodic memory difficulties are supposed to be secondary to deficits in the
      initiation/elaboration of efficient encoding and retrieval strategies our hypothesis is that
      retrieval practice is spared in schizophrenia.

    <time_frame>Final test : 2 days after the first experimental session</time_frame>
    <description>- The aim is to investigate the retrieval practice effect using descriptive stories and free-recall tests without feedback in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls.
In the first phase (encoding), people study 2 short prose passages covering general scientific topics.
In the second phase (initial test), they recall one text (&quot;test&quot; condition) or restudy the other one (&quot;re-study&quot; condition).
In the third phase (final test) which takes place 2 days later, they recall both texts.
- We will compare in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls final performance recall (number of items properly recalled) for information studied and recalled (&quot;test&quot; condition) to those for information studied and then re-studied (&quot;re-study&quot; condition).</description>
