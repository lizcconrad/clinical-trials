    <textblock>
      The pilot study objective is to evaluate the potential benefits of LipiFlow® System treatment
      of contact lens wearers with meibomian gland dysfunction and evaporative dry eye by assessing
      for improvement in meibomian gland function and reduction of dry eye symptoms in comparison
      to an untreated control.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-significant risk, open-label, randomized clinical trial of
      LipiFlow® treatment of contact lens wearers with meibomian gland dysfunction and evaporative
      dry eye. All subjects undergo examination to determine study eligibility and to capture the
      Baseline status. Subjects are randomized to receive LipiFlow® treatment (Treatment Group) or
      no LipiFlow® treatment (Untreated Control Group). The Treatment group is evaluated one month
      after receiving LipiFlow® treatment. Study endpoints are evaluated at 3 Months by comparing
      the Treatment Group to the Untreated Group. To facilitate subject recruitment, the Untreated
      Control group receives Crossover LipiFlow® treatment (Crossover Treatment Group) at 3 Months.
      The Crossover Treatment group is evaluated one month after receiving LipiFlow® treatment (4
      Months visit).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Meibomian Gland Score From Baseline at 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Primary Endpoint was intended to assess for improvement in meibomian gland function in symptomatic contact lens wearers after LipiFlow treatment in comparison to an untreated control.The Primary Endpoint was defined as the mean change in meibomian gland score in the LipiFlow Treatment group compared to Untreated Control group from Baseline to 3 Months. To determine the meibomian gland score, secretion characteristics of 15 meibomian glands along the lower eyelid were evaluated including five glands each in the temporal, central and nasal regions of the lower eyelid. For each gland, secretion characteristics were graded as 3 (clear liquid), 2 (cloudy liquid), 1 (inspissated/ toothpaste consistency) and 0 (no secretion). The total meibomian gland score is the sum of the grades for all 15 glands with a range between 0 and 45. A higher score reflects less meibomian gland dysfunction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Dry Eye Questionnaire Score From Baseline at 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Secondary Endpoint was intended to assess for reduction in dry eye symptoms in symptomatic contact lens after LipiFlow treatment in comparison to an untreated control using the Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED) questionnaire. The Secondary Endpoint was defined as the mean change in SPEED score in the LipiFlow Treatment group compared to Untreated Control group from Baseline to 3 Months. Dry eye symptoms evaluated were dryness, grittiness or scratchiness; soreness or irritation; burning or watering; and eye fatigue. Symptom frequency and severity were assessed. The SPEED score is the sum of frequency and severity scores with a range from 0 to 28. A lower SPEED score represents less frequent and/or less severe symptoms.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Comfortable Contact Lens Wear Time From Baseline at 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects reported how long they wore their contact lenses per day (total contact lens wear time) and how long the contact lenses were comfortable (comfortable contact lens wear time). A pre-specified exploratory analysis was to compare the mean change in comfortable contact lens wear time between Baseline and 3 Months for the LipiFlow group vs. untreated control.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Meibomian Gland Score From Baseline at 1 Month</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>The mean change in meibomian gland score from Baseline was also evaluated at 1 Month post-LipiFlow treatment for the LipiFlow and Crossover LipiFlow Groups. The LipiFlow Group was assessed at the 1-Month visit. The Crossover LipiFlow Group was assessed at the 4-Month visit (one month after receiving crossover LipiFlow treatment). There was no planned statistical analysis comparison between the LipiFlow and Crossover LipiFlow groups at 1 Month. To determine the meibomian gland score, secretion characteristics of 15 meibomian glands along the lower eyelid were evaluated including five glands each in the temporal, central and nasal regions of the lower eyelid. For each gland, secretion characteristics were graded as 3 (clear liquid), 2 (cloudy liquid), 1 (inspissated/ toothpaste consistency) and 0 (no secretion).

    <measure>Mean Change in Dry Eye Questionnaire From Baseline at 1 Month</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>The mean change in dry eye symptoms from Baseline based on the SPEED questionnaire score was also evaluated at 1 Month post-LipiFlow treatment for the LipiFlow and Crossover LipiFlow Groups. The LipiFlow Group was assessed at the 1-Month visit. The Crossover LipiFlow Group was assessed at the 4-Month visit (one month after receiving cossover LipiFlow treatment). There was no planned statistical analysis comparison between the LipiFlow and Crossover LipiFlow groups at 1 Month. Dry eye symptoms evaluated were dryness, grittiness or scratchiness; soreness or irritation; burning or watering; and eye fatigue. Symptom frequency and severity were assessed. The SPEED score is the sum of frequency and severity scores with a range from 0 to 28. A lower SPEED score represents less frequent and/or less severe symptoms.</description>

          <title>Meibomian Gland Score</title>
          <description>Along the lower lid, secretion characteristics of 15 meibomian glands were evaluated including five glands each in the temporal, central and nasal regions of the lower eyelid. For each gland, secretion characteristics were graded as 3 (clear liquid), 2 (cloudy liquid), 1 (inspissated/ toothpaste consistency) and 0 (no secretion). The total meibomian gland score is the sum of the grades for all 15 glands with a range between 0 and 45. A higher score reflects less meibomian gland dysfunction.</description>

Frequency scale: 0 (never), 1 (sometimes), 2 (often) and 3 (constant). Severity scale: 0 (no problems), 1 (tolerable–not perfect but not uncomfortable), 2 (uncomfortable-irritating but does not interfere with my day), 3 (bothersome-irritating and interferes with my day) and 4 (intolerable-unable to perform my daily tasks). SPEED score is the sum of frequency and severity scores (range 0 to 28).</description>

The Secondary Endpoint was defined as the mean change in SPEED score in the LipiFlow Treatment group compared to Untreated Control group from Baseline to 3 Months. Dry eye symptoms evaluated were dryness, grittiness or scratchiness; soreness or irritation; burning or watering; and eye fatigue. Symptom frequency and severity were assessed. The SPEED score is the sum of frequency and severity scores with a range from 0 to 28. A lower SPEED score represents less frequent and/or less severe symptoms.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Meibomian Gland Score From Baseline at 1 Month</title>
        <description>The mean change in meibomian gland score from Baseline was also evaluated at 1 Month post-LipiFlow treatment for the LipiFlow and Crossover LipiFlow Groups. The LipiFlow Group was assessed at the 1-Month visit. The Crossover LipiFlow Group was assessed at the 4-Month visit (one month after receiving crossover LipiFlow treatment). There was no planned statistical analysis comparison between the LipiFlow and Crossover LipiFlow groups at 1 Month. To determine the meibomian gland score, secretion characteristics of 15 meibomian glands along the lower eyelid were evaluated including five glands each in the temporal, central and nasal regions of the lower eyelid. For each gland, secretion characteristics were graded as 3 (clear liquid), 2 (cloudy liquid), 1 (inspissated/ toothpaste consistency) and 0 (no secretion). The total meibomian gland score is the sum of the grades for all 15 glands with a range between 0 and 45. A higher score reflects less meibomian gland dysfunction.</description>
