  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study was to examine the effect of a supervised physical exercise
      program on the prevention of childhood obesity and its impact on the motor development of the
      offspring.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The environment where the fetus growths up is essential for the risk of developing some
      diseases in later life, such as obesity. Exercise has showed being useful in the prevention
      on excessive maternal weight gain which is linked to fetus weight.
