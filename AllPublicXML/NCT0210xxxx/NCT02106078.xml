  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine if there is a benefit of an online intervention for persons with
      bipolar diagnoses, and what components appear to be useful. Specifically, the study will
      examine (1) whether exposure to the MoodSwings 2.0 intervention results in decreased
      depressive symptoms as measured by the Montgomery Asberg Rating Scale for Depression (MADRS)
      and (2) whether there is an association between graduated levels of involvement (Level I, 2,
      or 3) and resulting improvement? We expect that those participants assigned to the control
      condition (Level 1, peer discussion board only), will have fewer positive outcomes than those
      in Level 2 (discussion board and psychoeducation) or 3 (discussion board, psychoeducation,
      and interactive psychosocial tools) conditions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Montgomery Asberg Rating Scale (MADRS) for Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a 10-item scale, completed by the clinician to assess symptoms of depression. It is particularly sensitive to changes in depression over time. Joint reliability for the total score across several studies ranged from 0.76 to 0.95, and it is viewed as a reliable and valid measure of depression symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Young Mania Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The YMRS is an 11-item scale, completed by the clinician to assess symptoms of mania. This scale is viewed as a reliable and valid measure of manic symptoms, and is sensitive to changes in mania over time.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Intervention for Mood Episode( TIME)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from Baseline to 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Relapse or time to intervention will be assessed using Time Scale , with intervention defined as initiation, discontinuation, or dose adjustment of a treatment, initiation of psychotherapy or ECT, visit to an emergency provider or hospitalization in response to new mood symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SF-12</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 is a short, multipurpose measure of perceived impairment due to health problems. It is widely used as a short version of the SF-36, and has good validity. The SF-12 yields two risk-adjusted summary scores, impairment perceived as due to physical illness and impairment perceived as due to emotional problems (Ware et al., 1996)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cornell Service Index (CSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Use of general medical and psychiatric health services will be collected via the Cornell Service Index (CSI; Sirey et al., 2005). The CSI is a brief assessment of health service use. It has good inter-rater and test-retest reliability and assesses four types of services: outpatient psychiatric or psychological services (e.g., psychotropic medication visits or psychotherapy), outpatient medical services (e.g., visits to medical providers), professional support services (e.g., home health nurse visits, meal delivery), and intensive services (e.g., emergency department visits or hospitalization).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Life, Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) assesses subjective quality of life(i.e. physical health, subjective feelings, leisure activities and and social relationships). The 16 item short form is designated to measure satisfaction with various areas of daily functioning, such as social relationships, living/housing, physical heath, medication and global satisfaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication Adherence rating Scale( MARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from Baseline to 3 months, 6months, 9 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>When applicable, adherence to prescribed medication will be assessed with the Medication Adherence Rating Scale(MARS). This 10-item scale has acceptable reliability, with Cronbach's alpha.75, and test re-test reliability 0.72. It is seen as a valid measure with significant correlations with other measures of medication adherence(p&lt;.01) and with serum blood levels at p&lt; .05.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction Questionnaire 18( PSQ-18)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from Baseline to 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient satisfaction Questionnaire 18 assesses the overall satisfaction of each participant with their current medical care. This 18-item scale is a short form version of the 50-item Patient satisfaction Questionnaire. The PSQ sub-scales show acceptable internal consistency reliability. Furthermore, corresponding PSQ 18 and PSQIII subscales are substantially correlated with one another.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire- Modified</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from Baseline to 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>For the purposes of this study, the Treatment satisfaction Questionnaire- Modified was revised to suit the bipolar disorder and the MoodSwings 2.0 Program. This questionnaire was originally a modified version of the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey( MOS-SSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from Baseline to 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Social support will be assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey. This 18-item scale has acceptable reliability( alpha &gt; 0.91) and construct validity, and was specifically developed for people with chronic conditions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Inventory Of Stigma Experiences</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from Baseline to 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale will be used to measure both the self reported experiences of stigma and the impact of stigma</description>
  </other_outcome>

    <description>All groups will have access to asynchronous, moderated discussion boards. Assignment to discussion board will be stratified by randomization group (Level 1, 2 or 3). Level 1 access to the discussion board will serve as our &quot;peer support&quot; control condition, although we do expect some modest benefit from this intervention alone (Mead et al., 2010).
The discussion boards will be moderated by trained clinicians (masters level or higher). Discussion boards will be asynchronous, with all posts screened by the moderator(s) before appearing to the group.</description>

    <description>Online psychosocial tools are only available to those randomized to Level 3. They include structured mood monitoring, medication monitoring, and life charting visual tools. There are also interactive worksheets that encourage awareness of negative thoughts and strategies to challenge them, help participants weight the costs and benefits of different behaviors, problem solving and goal setting, and reinforcing self-affirmation. Participants have the opportunity to build a record of personal triggers of illness and illness profile - including early warning signs, and symptoms typically experienced during an episode of illness, as well as a personal &quot;relapse prevention plan.&quot;</description>
