      Background

      GD2 is a well-characterized tumor antigen in neuroblastoma, which is also expressed on
      osteosarcomas and some other sarcomas. T cells expressing 1st generation anti-GD2 chimeric
      antigen receptors (CARs) were safe and mediated modest antitumor activity in some patients
      with refractory neuroblastoma.

      A 3rd generation anti-GD2-CAR (GD2-CAR.OX40.28.z.ICD9) has been produced and holds promise
      for increased activity compared to the 1st generation GD2-CAR already studied in clinical
      trials. As an added safety measure, the vector includes a suicide switch comprising a caspase
      dimerization domain (ICD9) that can be activated by a small molecule to induce death of the
      genetically engineered cells if they were induce untoward toxicity.

      Objectives

      Primary:Determine the feasibility of producing anti GD2-CAR cells meeting the established
      release criteria and to assess the safety of administering escalating doses of anti-GD2-CAR
      engineered T cells in children and young adults with GD2+ solid tumors, including
      neuroblastoma, following cyclophosphamide-based lymphodepletion.

      Secondary:

        1. Determine if administration anti-GD2-CAR engineered T cells mediate antitumor effects in
           children and young adults with GD2+ solid tumors;

        2. Measure persistence of adoptively transferred anti-GD2-CAR T cells and correlate this
           with antitumor effects;

        3. Extend information regarding the prevalence and intensity of GD2 expression in
           non-neuroblastoma, non-osteosarcoma solid tumors in children and young adults;

        4. If unacceptable toxicity occurs that is possibly, probably or likely related to
           anti-GD2-CAR T cells, assess the capacity for AP1903, a dimerizing agent, to mediate
           clearance of the genetically engineered cells and resolve toxicity; and

        5. Assess toxicity of AP1903 if administered to mediate clearance of anti-GD2-CAR T cells.

      Eligibility

      Patients 1-35 years of age, at least 15 kg, with osteosarcoma or a GD2+ solid tumor
      (including neuroblastoma) that has recurred after or not responded to standard therapy and is
      deemed incurable by standard therapy.

      Design

      After apheresis to collect T cells for transduction, patients receive cyclophosphamide
      1800mg/m(2)/d as a lymphodepleting regimen. A phase I cell dose escalation scheme will used
      at 4 dose levels (1 x 10(5) transduced T cells/kg; 1 x 10(6) transduced T cells/kg; 3 x 10(6)
      transduced T cells/kg; and 1 x 10(7) transduced T cells/kg), using a standard 3 plus 3 dose
      escalation design. An expanded group of a total of 12 patients will be treated at the highest
      dose, comprising at least 6 osteosarcoma patients.

      Patients will be monitored for toxicity, antitumor effects and persistence of anti-GD2-CAR T
      cells.

      Patients with a PR, SD may receive a 2nd cycle at the next higher dose level a minimum of 60
      days following completion of the first cycle if eligibility criteria are met.

      A maximum of 36 patients may be treated on this study. Given that there is likelihood that
      some patients with non-osteosarcoma will not meet the criteria for GD2 expression to be
      eligible for enrollment, up to 72 subjects will be screened to enroll a maximum of 36
      patients for treatment. Up to 2-3 patients will be accrued per month, and therefore this
      study may require up to 2-3 years to complete enrollment and treatment.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Diagnosis

                  (a) Osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma and melanoma that have been treated with standard
                  frontline therapy and are judged to be incurable with standard therapy, based
                  upon the fact that they are unresectable, metastatic, progressive/persistent or
                  recurrent.

                  Evaluable disease must be present.

                  i) For all histologies except osteosarcoma and neuroblastoma, pathologic review
                  of frozen tissue must document GD2+ expression. Positive expression is defined as
                  at least 2+ expression (0-4+ scale) in &gt;50 percent of the tumor cells using
                  anti-GD2 mAb 14G2a. If adequate archived frozen tissue is available, this may be
                  utilized, or if not, patients may undergo biopsy following enrollment to obtain
                  tissue to assess GD2 expression, with the following restrictions.

                  ii) Patients with histologies other than osteosarcoma or neuroblastoma must have
                  adequate accessible tumor for biopsy (at least 1 cm diameter).

                  iii) Procedures employed to acquire biopsies for tumor lysates will be limited to
                  percutaneous needle or core biopsies, thoracoscopic excision or open biopsies of
                  readily accessible lesions. Pulmonary lesions may be biopsied but extensive
                  surgery such as thoracotomy or laparotomy should not be employed.

                  iv) Patients who will require biopsy should not be enrolled if in the opinion of
                  the principal investigator, the tumor site places the patient at substantial risk
                  from the biopsy procedure.

               2. Weight greater than or equal to 15 kg

               4. Prior Therapy:

                    1. The patient s malignancy must have relapsed after or failed to respond to
                       frontline curative therapy and/or there must not be any curative treatment
                       options available at the time of study entry.

                    2. There is no limit to the number of prior treatment regimens. However,
                       patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of prior
                       chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to study enrollment. Any
                       grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity of any previous therapy must have
                       resolved to grade 2 or less.

                    3. Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: Patients must not have received
                       myelosuppressive chemotherapy within 3 weeks of enrollment (6 weeks if prior
                       nitrosourea).

                    4. Hematopoietic growth factors: At least 7 days must have elapsed since the
                       completion of therapy with a growth factor. At least 14 days must have

                  greater than or equal to 60.

               6. Cardiac function:

                  Left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 40 percent or

                  upper limit of normal. Patients with Gilbert s syndrome are excluded from the
                  requirement of a normal bilirubin and patients will not be excluded if liver
                  enzyme elevation is due to tumor involvement. (Gilbert s syndrome is found in
                  3-10% of the general population, and is characterized by mild, chronic
                  unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the absence of liver disease or overt
                  hemolysis). NOTE: Adult values will be used for calculating hepatic toxicity and
                  determining eligibility, as is standard on POB phase I trials.

               8. Renal function:

                  Age-adjusted normal serum creatinine according to the following table or a

                  For patients &lt;18 years of age, their legal guardian must give informed consent.
                  Pediatric patients will be included in age-appropriate discussion in order to
                  obtain verbal assent.

        birth control (including abstinence) during and for two months after treatment, if of
        childbearing potential.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Concurrent Illnesses

             Clinically significant systemic illness (e.g. serious active infections or significant
             cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction), that in the judgment of the
             PI would compromise the patient s ability to tolerate protocol therapy or
             significantly increase the risk of complications.

             Peripheral nerve symptoms from prior therapies or from tumor compression &gt; grade 1.

          2. Untreated CNS metastasis

             Extradural masses that have not invaded the brain parenchyma or parameningeal tumors
             without evidence for leptomeningeal spread will not render the patient ineligible.
             Patients with previous CNS tumor involvement that has been treated and is stable for
             at least 6 weeks following completion of therapy are eligible.

          3. Prior Therapy

             Previous treatment with genetically engineered GD2-CAR T cells. Previous vaccine
             therapy, anti-GD2 mAb therapy or therapy with other genetically engineered T cells is
             not an exclusion criteria.

          4. Lactating or pregnant females (due to risk to fetus or newborn).

          5. Active HIV, HBV or HCV infection.

          6. Immune Therapies

        Patients who require systemic corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy.
        Immunosuppressive therapy must be stopped at least 14 days prior to cell infusion.
