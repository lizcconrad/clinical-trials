  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to test whether curcumin nanoparticles will improve behavioral
      measures and biomarkers of cognition and neuroplasticity in patients with schizophrenia who
      are already receiving a stable dose of antipsychotic.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will use a formulation of curcumin with high bioavailability that possesses
      a pharmacokinetic profile expected to exert biological effects. Specifically, 36 subjects
      will be enrolled in the double-blind randomized controlled trial. They will be randomized to
      curcumin or placebo for 8 weeks. At baseline, and 4 and 8 weeks, subjects will receive
      assessments of neurocognition (e.g., processing speed, attention and vigilance, working
      memory, learning, reasoning and problem solving), social cognition, EEG biomarkers (e.g.,
      visual cortical plasticity and mismatch negativity), a serum marker of neurogenesis (BDNF
      levels), and clinical symptoms (positive and negative symptoms). At weeks 2 and 6 subjects
      will return for additional safety (e.g., vitals, side effects, akathisia) and medication
      adherence assessments. Improvement on the primary outcome measure (MATRICS Consensus
      Cognitive Battery), as well as secondary outcome measures, will be compared between
      participants randomized to placebo versus curcumin. The results of this study will establish
      whether curcumin is a viable adjunctive agent for future larger clinical trials.

    <measure>MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This battery was developed as part of the NIMH sponsored MATRICS Initiative to assess cognition in clinical trials of cognition enhancing drugs. The MCCB comprises 10 tests that assess 7 cognitive domains (speed of processing, verbal memory, visual memory, working memory, reasoning and problem solving, attention/vigilance, and social cognition). The MCCB takes approximately 65 minutes to administer and provides age and gender-corrected normed T-scores, including a global composite score and cognitive domain scores.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Empathic Accuracy Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In this task, participants will watch 12 (6 positive and 6 negative) video clips, each lasting for 2.0-2.5 min. Each clip shows an individual (referred to as a &quot;target&quot;) while he/she discusses a positive or negative autobiographical event. For each clip, participants will use a 9-point scale to rate how positive or negative they believe the target is feeling. The primary dependent measure will be the correlations between participant ratings of the targets' emotions and the targets' ratings of their own emotions, calculated in 2-sec time epochs throughout the clip. The mean correlation across clips provides an &quot;empathic accuracy&quot; score for each participant. This measure takes approximately 25 minutes to administer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EEG Mismatch Negativity Paradigm (MMN)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A passive attention auditory oddball paradigm will be used to assess MMN. For MMN, difference waves generated by subtracting the standard from deviant ERP will be analyzed. The specific electrodes used to examine each component will be chosen based on maximal activity seen by inspection of the topographical maps.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EEG Visual Cortical Plasticity Paradigm</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This EEG measure involves assessing visual evoked potentials (VEPs) before and after exposure to tetanizing visual high-frequency stimulation (HFS). Briefly, two 2-minute baseline blocks will be presented to measure basic visual event-related potentials (ERPs), including the P100 and N100 responses. A two minute HFS period will be presented where the stimulus will flash at a rate of ~8 Hz. Three post-HFS blocks will be assessed at 2 minutes, 4 minutes, and 20 minutes after HFS presentation. The MMN procedure described above will be administered between the second and third post-HFS block. Post-HFS visual ERPs will be compared to pre-HFS ERPs to determine if HFS increased neural responses.</description>

    <measure>Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>

    <measure>The Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CAINS will be used to assess negative symptoms. This scale is comprised of 7 items that rate experience symptoms and 4 items that rate expression symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Baseline/Screening version of the scale will be administered at Visit 1, and includes items related to recent/lifetime suicidal ideation, behavior, actual attempts. The Since Last Visit version of the scale will be administered at Visits 2-5 and includes the same items in the interval time period since the last study visit.</description>
