  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a simeprevir-containing
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment regimen as measured by sustained virologic response (SVR).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, observational (a study in which the investigators/ physicians observe
      the patients and measure their outcomes), prospective study (a study in which the patients
      are identified and then followed forward in time for the outcome of the study) designed to
      reflect routine clinical practice. Approximately 300 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected
      patients who are prescribed simeprevir by their health care provider as part of their routine
      HCV treatment regimen, inclusive of patients who have been treated with a simeprevir-based
      therapy for less than or equal to (&lt;=) 28 days will be enrolled in this and observed to
      evaluate the effectiveness of a simeprevir. Practice setting features will be documented at
      the initiation of the study by each participating site. The decision of patients to
      participate in this study will in no way impact upon the standard of care that they are
      receiving. All treatment decisions will be made at the discretion of the health care
      provider. Safety assessments will include assessment of adverse events, and clinical
      laboratory parameters (hematology, clotting tests, human immunodeficiency virus tests,
      chemistry, and liver function tests). The maximum study duration for each patient will be
      approximately 2 years.
