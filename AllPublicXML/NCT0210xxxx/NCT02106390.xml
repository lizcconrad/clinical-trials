    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the immunogenicity, the safety and the tolerability
      of rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY vaccines in healthy infants, when concomitantly administered at
      3, 5, 7 and 13 months of age, compared to either alone.

                  since birth (3 months prior). (For corticosteroids, this means prednisone, or
                  equivalent, ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day or ≥ 10 mcg/day for children below 2 years. Inhaled
                  and topical steroids are allowed),

               -  Immune deficiency disorder, or known HIV infection.

          6. Receipt of blood, blood products and/or plasma derivatives or any parenteral
             immunoglobulin preparation since birth.

          7. History of any progressive or severe neurologic disorder, or seizure disorder or
             Guillan Barré syndrome (exception: one self-limited febrile seizure is acceptable).

             injection or blood draw.

          9. Child's parent(s) or legal guardian(s) are not able to comprehend and to follow all
             required study procedures for the whole period of the study.

             or are expected to receive during the study period.

         11. Family members or household members of site research staff.

         12. Any clinically-significant chronic or progressive disease according to judgment of the
             investigator (pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic or endocrine functional
             abnormality) or a congenital anomaly/known cytogenic disorder (e.g., Down's syndrome).

         13. History or any illness/condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might
             interfere with the results of the study or pose additional risk to the subjects due to
