    <textblock>
      This study will address questions of fundamental clinical significance including: (1) whether
      OCD patients maintained on long term SRIs can be discontinued without symptom exacerbation,
      (2) whether trans-diagnostic cognitive-behavioral treatment will reduce worsening following
      discontinuation compared to Taper and Monitoring, and (3) whether predictors of successful
      SRI discontinuation can be identified.

    <description>Unified Protocol (UP) for Discontinuation is delivered in 14 weekly individual sessions of 45-60 minutes followed by 3 booster sessions scheduled at two, four and eight weeks thereafter. The UP is a cognitive behavioral treatment that focuses on increasing emotional awareness and cognitive flexibility, preventing behavioral and emotional avoidance, and situational and interoceptive emotion-focused exposure. Participants will also receive 7 biweekly medication management sessions over 14 weeks with a study psychiatrist to facilitate gradual taper of SRI medication.</description>

    <description>Taper and Monitoring (TAP-M) is delivered in biweekly individual sessions over 14 weeks, with booster sessions at two, four, and eight weeks thereafter. TAP-M consists of assessment and monitoring. Participants will also receive 7 biweekly medication management sessions over 14 weeks with a study psychiatrist to facilitate gradual taper of SRI medication.</description>
