  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the bioavailability of apixaban crushed
      tablets suspended in water or mixed with applesauce is similar to the bioavailability of
      apixaban whole tablets administered orally.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the bioavailability of apixaban administered as crushed tablets
      suspended in water and as crushed tablets mixed with applesauce compared with that of whole
      tablets. The study results may allow enhancement of the apixaban label to include alternative
      methods of apixaban administration, which may be of benefit to patients who have difficulty
      swallowing.

          <description>This was a 3-period, 3-treatment crossover study. Each participant received (orally) a single-dose of apixaban 10 mg (two 5-mg tablets) crushed and suspended in 30 mL water and a single-dose of apixaban 10 mg (two 5-mg tablets) crushed and mixed with 30 g applesauce according to a randomization schedule. Each participant underwent a washout of at least 4 days before receiving the next scheduled treatment.</description>
