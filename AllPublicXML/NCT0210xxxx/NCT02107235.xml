    <textblock>
      The working hypothesis is that oral rigosertib treatment when added to platinum-based
      Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) will improve progression-free survival for first-line patients with
      intermediate- or high-risk human papillomavirus negative positive (HPV (+)) Head and Neck
      Squamous Cell Carcinoma. This study will determine the highest safe dose of oral rigosertib
      that can be used with cisplatin and CRT. This study will also record any side effects that
      may occur and measure tumor sizes and how long patients live.

      This is a multicenter, dose-escalating study of oral rigosertib administered with concurrent
      cisplatin and Radiotherapy in patients with intermediate- and high-risk Head and Neck
      Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

      Three rigosertib escalating cohorts (up to 6 patients per cohort) will be sequentially
      evaluated: 70 mg 3 times a day (TID), 140 mg TID and 280 mg TID. The total treatment course
      will be 8 weeks: 1 week of oral rigosertib alone (70 mg TID, 140 mg TID or 280 mg TID)
      followed by 7 weeks of concurrent administration of rigosertib, cisplatin and radiation
      therapy.

      After completion of treatment, patients will be followed for up to 36 months to document
      Progression-free Survival and Overall Survival.

    <description>The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral rigosertib when administered with platinum-based chemoradiotherapy to patients with intermediate- and high-risk Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma. The MTD is defined as the dose level immediately below that at which 2 or more patients experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT).</description>

    <description>Oral rigosertib will be started 7 days before initiation of concurrent treatment with cisplatin and radiation therapy and will be administered on a continuous basis for a fixed duration of 8 weeks. Three oral rigosertib escalating doses will be sequentially evaluated: 70 mg 3 times a day (TID), 140 mg TID and 280 mg TID.
Cisplatin will be administered intravenously at a dose of 40 mg/m^2 on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43 of the 7-week concurrent treatment course.
The prescribed radiotherapy dose will be 70 Gray (Gy) in 2 Gy once-daily fraction size (total of 35 fractions) over the 7-week concurrent treatment course. The initial target volume encompassing the gross and subclinical disease sites will receive 2.0 Gy per fraction, 5 fractions per week.</description>
