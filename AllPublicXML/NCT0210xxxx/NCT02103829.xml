  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most individuals who smoke want to quit smoking. Most individuals who want to quit, quit on
      their own. The purpose of this study is to determine whether very brief suggestions provided
      online are comparatively more effective than others in increasing motivation to quit
      immediately after the suggestions are implemented and actual quit rates one month later.

      There are no costs associated with participating in this study and participants will not be
      compensated for their participation.

      Participants will be recruited online using search engine ads (e.g., Google), online
      association list serves, community websites designed to reach individuals interested in
      participating in research studies, and social media sites related to smoking cessation
      efforts.

      The entire study will be administered online. Participants may complete it at a time and
      place of their convenience.

      To join the study paste the following link into your browser:

      https://www.i4health-pau.org/quit-smoking-on-your-own

      The website will automatically obtain consent, ask 16 brief questions as a pre-test,
      randomize to 4 very brief interventions, ask 4 post-test questions, and at 1-month follow-up,
      send an email with a link to a 6-question survey. The initial online session is expected to
      take between 3 and 8 minutes and the 1-month follow-up survey less than 2 minutes.
