  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of grazoprevir (MK-5172) 100
      mg in combination with elbasvir (MK-8742) 50 mg in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) in participants who are co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The
      primary hypothesis is that the percentage of participants who receive grazoprevir + elbasvir
      and achieve Sustained Virologic Response after 12 weeks of therapy (SVR12) will be greater
      than 70%.

    <description>Blood was drawn from each participant to assess Hepatitis C Virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) plasma levels using the Roche COBAS™ Taqman™ HCV Test, v2.0 (High Pure System). The Roche COBAS Taqman HCV Test, v2.0 assay (High Pure System) had a lower limit of quantification of 15 IU/mL and a limit of detection of 9.3 IU/mL (in plasma). SVR12 was defined as undetectable (&lt;9.3 IU/mL) HCV RNA at 12 weeks after the end of all study therapy.</description>

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol -specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol -specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor’s product, is also an AE.</description>
