  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes, and one of the strongest
      determinants of reduced health-related quality of life among people with diabetes. Neuropathy
      frequently presents with painful symptoms, activity limitation, insomnia, fatigue, and
      depressive symptoms. Anti-convulsants and tricyclic anti-depressants provide at least
      moderate pain relief for 25-50% of patients with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), but often
      decrease other domains of quality of life through adverse effects, such as dry mouth,
      dizziness, nausea, drowsiness, and urinary problems. Effective, non-pharmaceutical approaches
      for PDN are needed, particularly for low income and racial/ethnic minorities who are at
      highest risk of diabetes and related complications. Acupuncture is a promising treatment for
      PDN, but evidence is limited. To address the significant public health need related to pain
      management among underserved people with diabetes, this study proposes an innovative,
      group-based model of acupuncture for PDN at an urban safety net hospital. Sixty patients who
      have PDN will be enrolled and randomized to one of three arms: (a) usual care combined with
      12 weeks of group acupuncture twice weekly, (b) usual care combined with 12 weeks of group
      acupuncture once weekly, or (c) usual care alone (20 in each group). The aims of the study
      are to determine the feasibility of group acupuncture for PDN among underserved patients with
      diabetes; to evaluate the preliminary treatment effects of group acupuncture on pain,
      health-related quality of life, depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance, nerve conduction
      velocity, and protective sensation; and to determine the optimal frequency of acupuncture
      treatments.

      The investigators hypothesize that compared to patients receiving usual care alone, patients
      who undergo weekly group acupuncture treatments will have:

        1. decreased pain intensity

        2. improved health-related quality of life

        3. improved sural nerve conduction velocity

    <description>Acupuncture will be delivered in a group setting, in a common space with multiple reclining chairs. The initial acupuncture treatment will include a one-on-one diagnostic interview with one of the study acupuncturists for up to 30 minutes, followed by administration of acupuncture needles retained for 20-40 minutes. For subsequent group acupuncture treatments, participants will have a 10-15 minute diagnostic intake with the acupuncturist, followed by administration of acupuncture needles retained for 20-40 minutes. Eight to twelve needles will be administered in acupuncture points selected based on a treatment manual developed for the study. All treatments will be administered using sterile, disposable, surgical stainless steel acupuncture needles.</description>
