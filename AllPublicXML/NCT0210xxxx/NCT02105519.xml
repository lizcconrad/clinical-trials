  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, several studies revealed that the current influenza vaccine strategy might
      be of minimal vaccine effectiveness and had a smaller effect on reducing morbidity and
      mortality in the end-stage renal disease population than previously thought. Thus, this also
      raised the question about the effectiveness of administration of influenza vaccination in
      chronic kidney disease patients not on dialysis. In this study, the investigators aim to
      evaluate the effectiveness of seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine, formulation 2013-2014, in
      patients with different stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) not on dialysis.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antibody response to each of the three influenza
      vaccine strains included in the licensed seasonal flu vaccine, as measured by the method of
      hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and ELISA-based microneutralization (microNT-ELISA) assays.
      All participants will be divided into 3 groups: participants refused to receive vaccination,
      those receive either one (week 0) or one more booster vaccination (week 0 and week 4). The
      investigators will collect serum of participants at the 5th weeks, 9th weeks, and 21th week
      post vaccination and evaluate the difference of immune response in these 3 groups.

    <time_frame>The seroprotection rate will be assessed at 4, 8, 20 weeks after the initiation of the study.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint will be the seroprotection rate which is defined as the proportion of subjects with HI titer ≥ 1:40. MicroNT-ELISA assay might also be used to evaluate the seroprotection post vaccination, which will be defined as micro-NT titer ≥1: 40 or ≥ 1:160 .</description>

    <time_frame>the safety issue related to the vaccination will be assessed in each visit during the whole study period (20 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who received influenza vaccination would be asked to record any local or systemic side effect during the first week after vaccination. Besides, the investigators would also monitor any possible adverse effect during the whole study period.</description>

    <time_frame>The seroconversion rate will be assessed at 4, 8, 20 weeks after the initiation of the study.</time_frame>
    <description>The seroconversion is defined as the HI titer of the post-vaccination serum is at least 1:40 for those who had a negative pre-vaccination HI serum titer or a four-fold or greater increase in HI titers in subjects who had a positive pre-vaccination HAI serum titer. The seropositive is defined as the HI titer ≥ 1:10, and the seronegative is defined as HI titer &lt; 1:10.</description>
