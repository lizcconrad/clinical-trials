  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people with spinal cord injury are no longer able to walk and must use wheelchairs for
      mobility. These individuals experience greater rates of depression and lower quality of life.
      Many of these individuals express a strong desire to walk again, and report many psychosocial
      benefits to being eye to eye with peers in social interactions. Additionally, wheelchairs
      allow only limited community access, creating an additional obstacle to seeking out
      meaningful social roles in the community. Currently, there is new technology called robotic
      exoskeletons that would allow people with spinal cord injury to walk. These robotic
      exoskeletons also allow for curb, ramp, and stair negotiation, which are critical to
      community access. Current research has examined training with robotic exoskeletons indoors
      over level surfaces in clinical settings. This study will examine the potential for everyday
      use, including ramps, stairs, curbs and indoor and outdoor use.

    <time_frame>Session 1 (pre test, initial visit) and Session 20 (post test, between 6-8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The goal is to cover as much ground as possible over 6 minutes, the distance is measured with a measuring wheel. The instructions are &quot;Walk continuously if possible, but do not be concerned if you need to slow down or stop to rest.&quot; At the end of 6 minutes the participant is asked to rate their exertion level on a Borg Scale of 6 - 20 points. The VO2 MAX data is collected during the test every 10 seconds</description>

    <time_frame>Session 1 (pre test, initial visit) and Session 20 (post test, between 6-8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Measure the time in second for and individual to walk 10 meters. The test is Performed using a &quot;flying start,&quot; patient walks 10 meters (33 ft) and the time is measured when the leading foot crosses the start line and the finish line. The instructions are: &quot; Please walk this distance as fast as you safely can when I say go.&quot;</description>

    <measure>The Patient Health Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Session 1 (pre test, initial visit) and Session 20 (post test, between 6-8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>PHQ-9 is a 9-item self-report questionnaire designed to diagnose both the presence of depressive symptoms as well as to characterize the severity of depression. A single question rates how difficult problems have made it to do work, take care of things at home or get along with other people using a 4 level scale (not difficult at all to extremely difficult).</description>

    <measure>The Psychosocial Impact of Assistive Devices Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Session 1 (pre test, initial visit) and Session 20 (post test, between 6-8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The PIADS is a 26-item, self-report questionnaire designed to assess the effects of an assistive device on functional independence, well-being, and quality of life. The PIADS can be used to assess the impact of any assistive device (AD), prosthesis or medical procedure. It can be used to evaluate the impact of ADs over time and to match the devices with consumers. With its excellent psychometric properties, the PIADS fills a missing link in the assessment of ADs as well as in the examination of their acceptance and abandonment.</description>
