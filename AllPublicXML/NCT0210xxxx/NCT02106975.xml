    <textblock>
      Hypothesis 1A: Vitamin C infusion will significantly attenuate sepsis-induced systemic organ
      failure as measured by Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score,

      Hypothesis 1B: Vitamin C infusion will attenuate sepsis-induced lung injury as assessed by
      the oxygenation index and the VE40

      Hypothesis 1C: Vitamin C infusion will attenuate biomarkers of inflammation (C-Reactive
      Protein, Procalcitonin), vascular injury (Thrombomodulin, Angiopoietin-2), alveolar
      epithelial injury (Receptor for Advanced Glycation Products), while inducing the onset of a
      fibrinolytic state (Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor).
