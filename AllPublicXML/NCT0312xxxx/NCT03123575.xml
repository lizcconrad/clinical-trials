    <textblock>
      This will be a cross-sectional population-based study carried out in the region of Madrid
      (6,468,322 inhabitants according to current census) to quantify the number of Co-meds in
      HIV-infected individuals on ART in the region of Madrid, categorized by age and gender, and
      to compare the number of Co-meds between the ART-treated population and HIV-uninfected
      population in the region of Madrid, categorized by age and gender.
