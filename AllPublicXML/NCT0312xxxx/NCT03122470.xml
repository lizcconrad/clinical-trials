  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MRI is being increasingly relied upon for detection, staging and management of prostate
      cancer. In this study patients with risk of prostate cancer will be recommended to have a
      pelvic MRI prior to the standard biopsy of the prostate and standard treatment of any
      detected prostate cancer. The results of the MRI will be compared to standard diagnosis
      techniques to see if cancer can be more accurately detected.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study team hypothesizes that strategic use of advanced MRI methods will provide a more
      accurate and less invasive approach for diagnosis and management of prostate cancer. The
      primary objectives are:

        1. To develop advanced MRI methods and optimal MRI protocols for detection, staging, and
           follow-up of prostate cancer.

        2. To evaluate the diagnostic performance of MRI-guided biopsy methods and correlate MRI
           findings with the pathological grade of cancer.

        3. To correlate prostate MRI findings and biopsy results with patient progress and
           outcomes.

        4. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of MRI in disease re-classification in patients on
           active surveillance.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To apply computer-aided advanced image analytic techniques (Computer-assisted
           diagnostics- CAD) to extract MRI features of patient clinical scans that correlate with
           diagnosis and grade of prostate cancer.

        2. To study MRI features of lesions that mimic prostate cancer on imaging eg - chronic
           prostatitis, post treatment changes.

        3. To evaluate the impact of MRI in decision making and choice of treatment by physicians
           and patients.

    <description>The diagnostic performance of MRI guided biopsy techniques will be compared with standard TRUS biopsy using a single sample of patients undergoing both biopsy techniques. It has been reported that MRI consistently detects a larger number of clinically significant prostate cancers (sensitivity - 0.91 for MRI-guided biopsy vs 0.76 for TRUS biopsy), while avoiding the detection of cancers that are clinically insignificant, as compared to TRUS biopsy.</description>

The multiparametric MRI exam will consist of T1-, T2- and diffusion weighted imaging with or without post-contrast perfusion studies. magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) will be performed before contrast injection. The MRI will be interpreted by two specified radiologists from the research team.</description>

             risk to the patient.

          -  Implanted medical device not described above that is not MRI-compatible;

          -  Known history of severe claustrophobia;

             contrast material or abnormal kidney function (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 30
             mL/min), a contrast enhanced exam will not be performed; however, a non-contrast exam
             may be performed;
