  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial tests a cognitive reorientation intervention to prevent
      delirium in the intensive care unit using scripted audio messages, recorded by the patient's
      family and played at hourly intervals during daytime hours, to provide information about the
      ICU environment to the patient (the Family Automated Voice Reorientation intervention,
      FAVoR). The investigators hypothesize that providing ongoing orientation to the ICU
      environment through recorded audio messages in a voice familiar to the patient will enable
      the patient to more accurately interpret the environment and reduce risk of delirium.
      Increasing awareness of daytime by cuing patients during waking hours may also improve
      day/night orientation, nighttime sleep/rest, and further reduce risk of delirium.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial will test the effectiveness of a nonpharmacologic intervention
      to prevent delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU), which affects as many as 80% of
      critically ill, mechanically ventilated adults.. The Family Automated Voice Reorientation
      (FAVoR) intervention uses scripted audio messages, recorded by the patient's family and
      played at hourly intervals during daytime hours, to provide information about the ICU
      environment to the patient; this ongoing orientation to the ICU environment through recorded
      messages in a voice familiar to the patient may enable the patient to more accurately
      interpret the environment and thus reduce risk of delirium. Increasing awareness of daytime
      by cuing patients during waking hours may also improve day/night orientation and nighttime
      sleep, further reducing risk of delirium. The primary specific aim of the project is to test
      the effect of the FAVoR intervention on delirium in critically ill, mechanically ventilated
      adults during hospitalization in the ICU. Secondary aims are to: (1) explore if the effect of
      FAVoR on delirium is mediated by sleep, (2) explore if selected biobehavioral factors may
      potentially moderate the effects of FAVoR on delirium, and (3) examine the effects of FAVoR
      on short term (immediately after ICU discharge) and long term (1 and 6 months after hospital
      discharge) outcomes, including cognitive function and patient-reported health status.

    <description>In the intervention group, scripted audio messages recorded by the patient's family (FAVoR intervention) will be played for the patient at hourly intervals during daytime hours. These messages will be personalized, delivered automatically, and provide information about the ICU environment. The FAVoR intervention, a standardized protocol developed and tested in preliminary work, will be delivered by audio recording for 5 consecutive days (120 hours), or until ICU discharge if discharge occurs within the first 5 days. The number of episodes of delirium during ICU stay is the primary outcome measure. Data will also be collected at 1 month and 6 months following hospital discharge for secondary aim 3.</description>

    <description>The FAVoR intervention includes a set of 8 scripted recorded messages, no longer than 2 minutes long, includes subject's name, uses simple terms, and is written at a 5th grade reading level. Messages include information about the critical care environment, the visual and auditory stimuli to be expected, and the availability of providers and family.</description>
