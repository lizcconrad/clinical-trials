      Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) represents a clinically feasible way to restore the
      gut microbial ecology, and has proven to be a breakthrough for the treatment of recurrent
      Clostridium difficile infection. Furthermore, clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate
      its use for other conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome,
      diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatic encephalopathy. Early results in
      human have shown that FMT from lean donor when transplanted into subjects with metabolic
      syndrome resulted in a significant improvement in insulin sensitivity and an increased in
      intestinal microbial diversity, including a distinct increase in butyrate-producing bacterial
      strains. The therapy is generally well tolerated and appeared safe. No clinical studies have
      assessed the efficacy of FMT in obese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a worldwide epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The prevalence of
      obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus continues to rise at an alarming rate. In China, more
      than 100 million people are estimated to suffer from diabetes. Similarly, the prevalence of
      overweight and obese individuals in China has increased by four-fold from 3.7% to 19.0% over
      two decades 1. Weight loss is associated with reductions in risk of morbidity and mortality
      from obesity. Conventional non-pharmacological interventions based on diet and exercise
      showed limited long-term success in producing sustained weight loss. Although obese patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus may be treated by medications or by bariatric surgery, these
      alternatives are limited by incomplete resolution of the diseases, high cost or potential
      surgical-related morbidity. Further research focusing on increasing effectiveness of
      interventions and new ways to achieve weight loss in these individuals are needed.

      Recently, accumulating evidence supports a role of the enteric microbiota in the pathogenesis
      of obesity-related insulin resistance. Obesity is associated with changes in the composition
      of the intestinal microbiota, and the obese microbiome appears to be more efficient in
      harvesting energy from the diet. Colonization of germ-free mice with an 'obese microbiota'
      results in a significantly greater increase in total body fat than colonization with a 'lean
      microbiota', suggesting gut microbiota as an additional contributing factor to the
      pathophysiology of obesity. Obese and lean phenotypes can also be induced in germ-free mice
      by transfer of fecal microbiota from human donors. These data have led to the use of
      microbiota therapeutics as a potential treatment for metabolic syndrome and obesity.
