  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to measure the effects of both oral and vaporized cannabis
      (marijuana), at different doses, on the ability to perform certain tasks such as balancing,
      eye tracking, and computerized measures of memory and attention. The investigators will
      collect biological fluids (urine, blood, saliva/spit) after cannabis is eaten or vaporized to
      see if there are markers in those fluids that can predict performance on the tasks. The
      results of this study will help us better understand the effects of using cannabis, and to
      help identify behaviors and/or substances in the body that relate to cannabis impairment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be in good general health based on a physical examination, medical history, vital
             signs, 12-lead ECG and screening urine and blood tests

          -  Test negative for recent cannabis use in urine at the screening visit (confirmed by
             Gas Chromatography (GC)/ Mass Spectrometry (MS) laboratory test) and at clinic
             admission

          -  Test negative for other drugs of abuse, including alcohol at the screening visit and
             at clinic admission

          -  Demonstrate ability to expectorate 3-5 mL of &quot;native&quot; oral fluid over a 5-minute
             period

          -  Not be pregnant or nursing (if female). All females must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test at the screening visit and a negative urine pregnancy test at clinic
             admission.

          -  Have a body mass index (BMI) in the range of 19 to 36 kg/m2

          -  Blood pressure at Screening Visit does not exceed a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of
             150 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 90 mmHg

          -  Have no allergies to any of the ingredients used to prepare cannabis brownies
             (chocolate, eggs, wheat, etc.).

          -  Report prior experience inhaling cannabis (either via smoking or vaporization).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of or current evidence of significant medical or psychiatric illness judged by

             event due to exposure or completion of other study procedures.

          -  Use of an Over-the-Counter (OTC), systemic or topical drug(s), herbal supplement(s),
             or vitamin(s) within 14 days of experimental sessions; which, in the opinion of the
             investigator or sponsor, will interfere with the study result or the safety of the
             subject.

          -  Use of a prescription medication (with the exception of birth control prescriptions)
             within 14 days of experimental sessions; which, in the opinion of the investigator or
             sponsor, will interfere with the study result or the safety of the subject.

          -  Use of hemp seeds or hemp oil in any form in the past 3 months.

          -  Use of dronabinol (Marinol) within the past 6 months.

          -  History of xerostomia (dry mouth), or the presence of mucositis, gum infection or
             bleeding, or other significant oral cavity disease or disorder that in the
             investigator's opinion may affect the collection of oral fluid samples.

          -  History of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias or vasospastic disease (e.g.,
             Prinzmetal's angina).

          -  Abnormal EKG result that in the investigator's opinion is clinically significant.

          -  Epilepsy or a history of seizures.

          -  Enrolled in another clinical trial or have received any drug as part of a research
             study within 30 days prior to dosing
