  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims at evaluating the effects of a CBT intervention, a cultural adaptation
      of the Unified Protocol for the Trans-diagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) in
      victims of the Colombian armed conflict.

      A randomized clinical trial aimed at evaluating the effects of the UP in a group of 100
      internally displaced victims of armed conflict living in Bogotá is being implemented.
      Participants are recruited from several governmental, non-governmental agencies as well as
      community organizations of victims. Participants are being randomly assigned to treatment
      condition (N=50) or to waiting-list control (N=50). Treatment consists in 12 biweekly
      sessions covering the 8 modules of the original UP. The effects of the UP is evaluated
      through Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) and several measures of co-morbid emotional
      disorders, Anxiety, Depression, PTSD as well as level of functioning and quality of life.

      Specific objectives

        -  To translate and adapt the UP, taking into account the cultural, social, economic and
           political context of individuals exposed to political violence in Colombia.

        -  Develop and adapt a set of assessment tools to identify victim's symptoms of anxiety,
           depression, and related disorders.

        -  Conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing outcomes of 12 biweekly sessions of the
           culturally adapted UP in a group participants randomized to immediate treatment to a
           waiting list control receiving delayed (6-week) treatment.

        -  To identify potential variables that mediate or moderate the effects of treatment with
           the UP.

      Methodology Design. Allocation randomized Participants. 100 individuals presenting emotional
      sequelae of exposure to violent events of armed conflict in Colombia, 50 of which are being
      randomly assigned to treatment group and 50 to control group (waiting list).

    <description>Immediately following randomization, participants in this condition attend 12-13 biweekly face-to face individual sessions that last approximately 1.5 hrs each of the cultural adaptation of the Unified Protocol trans diagnostic treatment comprising the following modules: motivation enhancement, psycho-education of emotion, emotion awareness training, cognitive reappraisal, emotion avoidance and emotion-driven behavior, tolerance training for physical sensations, emotion exposure, and relapse prevention. Treatment is provided by graduate students in clinical psychology who have been trained in the UP and receive weekly supervision by experienced clinicians and use a Workbook for homework assigned between sessions.</description>
