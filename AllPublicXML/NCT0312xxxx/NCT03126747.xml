  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Japanese post-marketing surveillance (PMS) which is required by the
      regulatory authorities. General objective of PMS is to confirm the clinical usefulness,
      especially the safety profile of a drug under the routine clinical practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a local, non-interventional, multi-center, single-cohort study using primary data of
      patients treated with YazFlex in endometriosis or dysmenorrhea indication.

      A total of 600 patients (300 for endometriosis and 300 for dysmenorrhea) is planned to be
      enrolled in 2 years.

      The treatment should be performed in Japan based on the product label. The patients will be
      observed for up to 2 years (1 year at the earliest) during their YazFlex treatment.

      The outcome variables for the primary objective are treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs)
      and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The outcome variables for the secondary objective include
      newly developed haemorrhagic ovarian cyst, genital bleeding, severity of dysmenorrhea, pelvic
      pain and compliance status in the new flexible regimen.
