  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well physical activity works in reducing metabolic
      dysregulation in obese Latina breast cancer survivors. Physical activity may improve fitness
      and lessen metabolic disease (such as coronary artery disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes)
      risk factors in patients who have breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of a 6-month progressive combined training (PCT) program on
      metabolic dysregulation (MetD) in centrally obese latina breast cancer survivors (LBCS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether improved physical fitness and health-related measures from a 6-month
      PCT program are associated with reductions in MetD in centrally obese LBCS.

      II. To determine whether MetD status and physical fitness can be maintained following a
      6-month follow-up period and to establish predictors of exercise behavior in LBCS.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.

      GROUP I (PROGRESSIVE COMBINED TRAINING [PCT]): Patients undergo supervised exercise sessions
      comprising of aerobic exercise (AE) over 30 minutes and resistance exercise (RE) over 25
      minutes 3 days per week for 24 weeks. Patients are encouraged to complete AE at home over 20
      minutes 1 day per week. Patients receive a Polar heart rate monitor to monitor heart rate
      during the AE sessions.

      GROUP II (PROGRESSIVE AEROBIC TRAINING [PAT]): Patients undergo supervised exercise sessions
      comprising of AE over 45-60 minutes 3 days per week for 24 weeks. Patients are encouraged to
      complete AE at home over 20 minutes 1 day per week. Patients receive a Polar heart rate
      monitor to monitor heart rate during the AE sessions.

      GROUP III (USUAL CARE): Patients undergo usual care. Beginning 24 weeks, patients may undergo
      supervised exercise sessions comprising of AE and RE as in Group I.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 37 and 49 weeks.

    <description>1). Hand grip strength: Grip strength will be measured using a hand-held dynamometer on the participant's dominant hand. The subject will be asked to grip the handle of the dynamometer with one hand using as much grip pressure as possible while holding for 2 seconds; 2). Y Balance Test: All subjects will be required to complete the Y Balance by standing on a single limb and reach as far as possible with the opposite limb; 3). Modified Margaria-Kalamen Step Test will be used to test leg muscle power. Subjects will climb a flight of 10 stairs as quickly as possible, without missing a stair and will be evaluated based on time-to-completion and accuracy of completing all steps, given a total of 3 chances to complete the test as quickly as possible.</description>
