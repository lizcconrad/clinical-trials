  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is intended to evaluate changes in arch dimensions and incisor inclination as well as
      changes in the WALA Ridge in no extraction patients treated with interactive self-ligating
      brackets (Empower®) and passive (Carriere SLX®) at the end of the phase of alignment and
      leveling. For this, study models and profile radiographs taken before the start of treatment
      and at the end of the alignment and leveling phase will be evaluated. The parameters to be
      measured are: intercanine distance, arch depth, upper and lower incisor inclination, and WALA
      ridge analysis
