  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corneal haze, in which the cornea becomes cloudy, is a well-known and a potentially
      vision-threatening postoperative complication of PRK. Topical ophthalmic corticosteroids are
      routinely prescribed by most surgeons postoperatively to help prevent this complication.

      Goals of topical steroids use after PRK include effective modulation of the healing response
      to prevent corneal haze while at the same time minimizing side effects, such as intraocular
      pressure elevation or cataract formation. Loteprednol etabonate is a corticosteroid that
      exerts its therapeutic effects and is then quickly changed into inactive metabolites. This
      relatively fast metabolism of loteprednol gives it a lower side effect profile than other
      steroids, including a smaller effect on intraocular pressure. In the ophthalmic literature,
      there is currently no consensus on a standard regimen or which type of corticosteroid should
      be used after PRK.

      Investigators are conducting a prospective, randomized trial to compare the incidence of
      intraocular pressure rise and visually significant postoperative corneal haze after PRK with
      the use of loteprednol 0.5% gel compared to the use of earlier generation steroids,
      prednisolone acetate 1% suspension and fluorometholone 0.1% suspension.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects who are deemed suitable candidates for PRK after routine refractive
             surgery screening will be considered eligible for participation in this study.

          -  Subjects must be at least 21 years of age and not pregnant or nursing (due to
             fluctuations in visual parameters during pregnancy).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Selection will be consistent with the current standard of care for PRK. Any patient
             that is not a suitable candidate for PRK will not be included.
