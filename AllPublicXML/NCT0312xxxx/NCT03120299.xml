  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a multicenter randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial, evaluating the effects and change of lipid metabolism,
      especially of triglyceride after omega-3 administration in type 2 diabetes patients with
      hypertriglyceride.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, about 350 type 2 diabetes patients with hypertriglyceride will be
      enrolled from multiple centers in China. Randomization was computer generated and stratified
      by center. After screening, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned into one of the
      following two groups: Omega-3 fatty acids capsules ( 2pills bid) and placebo capsules (2pills
      bid).

      Blood, feces and urine samples will be collected before and after treatment. Triglycerides
      (TG), total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, HDL-C, HbA1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial
      plasma glucose (PPG) will be measured. Blood metabolomics profiles of lipids, amino acids,
      bile acids, the change of gut microbiota, and pharmacogenomic components and parameters will
      be evaluated too.
