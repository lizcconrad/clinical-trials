    <textblock>
      Evaluation of drug eluting peripheral vascular stent system for the treatment of superficial
      femoral artery stenosis and / or occlusion, there is better in effectiveness and clinical
      performance compared with similar products already on the market.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized study designed to enroll 138 patients with
      superficial femoral artery stenosis and /or occlusion who will be randomized 1:1 to be
      treated with the Drug eluting peripheral vascular stent system versus the commercially
      available Nitinol Stent System (Cordis Corporation). Patients will receive Color Doppler
      Ultrasonography (CDU) imaging and Dual Fluoroscopic Imaging at 6th month and 12th month post
      procedure. Clinical visits are scheduled at 0~30 days, 6 months, 12 months, and telephone
      visits are scheduled at 1 month, 3months, and 9 months. Furthermore, CDU will also be
      performed at baseline in all participants of the study.
