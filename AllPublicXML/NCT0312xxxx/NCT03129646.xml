    <textblock>
      This is an open label, Phase III, randomized, controlled, parallel arm multicentre
      non-inferiority clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of two combination regimens
      of Miltefosine and Paromomycin with the standard SSG-PM for the treatment of primary adult
      and children VL patients in Eastern Africa.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 2 treatment regimens to be tested are:

        -  Arm 1: Paromomycin 20 mg/kg/d IM for 14 days combined with oral miltefosine allometric
           dosing for 14 days

        -  Arm 2: Paromomycin 20 mg/kg/d IM for 14 days combined with oral miltefosine allometric
           dosing for 28 days

      The reference arm is the current standard treatment for VL:

      • Arm 3: Sodium Stibogluconate 20 mg/kg/day IM/IV combined with Paromomycin 15 mg/kg/day IM
      for 17 days

      The target population will be VL patients from 4 to 50 years old in order to cover both
      paediatric and adult population.

      Patients will be hospitalized for 14 days of PM and MF treatment for both arm 1 and arm 2. MF
      treatment will start at the same time as PM treatment and for arm 2 it will continue on an
      out-patient basis until completion of the 28 days treatment.

      SSG&amp;PM combination therapy will be administered for 17 days according to routine VL treatment
      guidelines and patients will remain hospitalized for the entire duration of the treatment.

      All patients will be asked to return to the hospital for a full assessment on day 28, and for
      followup visits on day 56 and at six months.

      To respond to the objectives, study assessments will be carried out at screening and on days
      1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 56 (one-month post-treatment) and 210 (six-month post-treatment). These
      assessments will include clinical, parasitological, haematological, biochemistry, safety,
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics assessments.
