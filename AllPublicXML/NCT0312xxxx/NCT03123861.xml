      Purpose: To assess the impact of gabapentin versus placebo on overall postoperative pain and
      gluteal pain at 1 week post vaginal sacrospinous ligament suspension for apical pelvic organ
      prolapse.

      Participants: English-speaking women planning to undergo a vaginal SSLF. Concurrent
      procedures can be performed except total vaginal hysterectomy, colpocleisis, anal
      sphincteroplasty, fistula surgery, or urethral diverticulectomy

      Procedures (methods): Patients will be randomized to receive either 2 weeks of gabapentin or
      placebo for 2 weeks post-operatively. Standard of care pain medications will be given to both
      groups. Patients will be followed for 6 weeks post-operatively.

    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ prolapse (POP), the herniation of the bladder, uterus, or rectum, into and often
      beyond, the vaginal opening, affects 40% of postmenopausal women, and significantly impairs
      quality of life. POP is often managed surgically, and currently, one in every eight women
      will undergo POP surgery during her lifetime.

      A commonly performed procedure for POP is a sacrospinous ligament fixation (SSLF), which is a
      vaginal surgery that involves suspending the vaginal apex to the sacrospinous ligament
      suspension with sutures. Beyond routine postoperative pain, a SSLF may result in significant
      gluteal pain as a result of the vaginal sutures affecting/impinging on the sacral nerve
      roots. Unfortunately, postoperative gluteal pain is not uncommon with 12% of patients
      reporting significant gluteal pain and 4% having persistent pain 6 weeks after surgery.

      The aim of this study is to compare the impact of gabapentin versus placebo on postoperative
      pain after SSLF. The rationale is that studies have shown that preoperative gabapentin, a
      non-opioid analgesic, resulted in a lower narcotic use postoperatively. Decreasing use of
      standard of care postoperative narcotic pain medications would also decrease adverse events
      due to narcotics such as nausea, vomiting and constipation, and potentially decrease the
      long-term risk of opioid dependence. As an additional benefit, a careful assessment of actual
      opioid will help to inform best practices for prescribing, as it is possible that we are
      overprescribing narcotic medications for this type of surgery. This study will evaluate a
      longer two-week course of gabapentin because it is currently standard of care to use
      gabapentin to treat neuropathic pain after SSLF; thus, gabapentin may help to address overall
      pain as well as neuropathic gluteal pain that can occur after SSLF. Furthermore, gabapentin
      is a relatively safe medication with the primary adverse events being dizziness and sedation.

      An exploratory component of this study will be a pharmacogenetics aim for narcotic use. It is
      known that genetic variability in drug metabolizing enzymes may impact the response to
      opioids. For example, poor metabolizers may not convert opioids to their active forms
      resulting in less pain relief and potentially higher doses of medications. Conversely those
      who are fast metabolizers may have higher levels of active forms and thus require lower doses
      of narcotics. One well-characterized cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme is CYP2D6, which
      metabolizes commonly used opioids such as codeine, tramadol, hydrocodone and oxycodone. The
      CYP2D6 gene has several genetic variants, which result in different metabolizer statuses
      ranging from poor metabolizers (PM), intermediate metabolizers (IM), extensive metabolizers
      (EM), to ultrarapid metabolizers (UM). These different CYP2D6 profiles may be clinically
      important for opioid use, as they may contribute to the variability in efficacy and adverse
      events to these drugs. Because this study will provide detailed information about narcotic
      use, this will be an ideal study for this exploratory pharmacogenetics analysis.

      Given the risk of overall postoperative pain and neuropathic gluteal pain after a SSLF for
      POP and the evidence that perioperative gabapentin may decrease acute pain and neuropathic
      pain, this study proposes a novel randomized trial to compare perioperative gabapentin versus
      placebo on postoperative pain after a vaginal SSLF surgery.
