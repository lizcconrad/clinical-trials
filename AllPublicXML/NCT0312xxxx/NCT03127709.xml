  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to try to understand how histopcytosis can cause symptoms or
      problems in the brain. The tests being done in the study will look at memory and thinking as
      well as brain function via MRI scan.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Neurocognitive tests will yield raw scores that are converted to z-scores, normalized for participant's age, sex and educational level.The proportion of participants demonstrating cognitive impairment (as defined by 2 or more z-scores less than -1.5) will be summarized. Also, the proportion of participants with impairment (z &lt; -1.5) for each cognitive test will be summarized. In this way the cognitive assessment yields a dichotomous outcome of impaired versus not impaired for each participant but also allow for more granular assessment of impairment in specific cognitive domains.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>questionnaires will yield raw scores (total score for HADS and McGill QOL, as well as anxiety and depression subscores for the HADS). QOL scores will be analyzed as raw scores. Cognitive test scores will be transformed into z-sores (based on score distributions from established normative samples with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1) to define the presence/severity of cognitive dysfunction. Scores will be normalized for age, sex and education.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>comparing of grey matter volume</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>In a whole-brain analysis, first, cortical thickness will be compared between participants and controls and regions of statistically significant grey matter loss will be identified. This is done computionally with a whole-brain, vertex-by-vertex approach, as stated above. Also, as stated above (Section 7), statistical significance thresholding is at p&lt;0.001, correcting for multiple comparisons using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) method and clustering thresholds, methods used in various high-throughput contexts, including MRI analysis.</description>

    <description>Scanning will be performed on a 3 Tesla General Electric scanner (Optima 750W) with a GEM HNU 24-channel head coil. rsFMRI matching the FLAIR and T1 post-contrast images will be obtained. For resting state fMRI, T2*-weighted images will be acquired with a single-shot gradient echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence in the axial orientation (TR = 2500 ms, TE = 30 ms, FA = 80°, slice thickness = 4 mm, FOV= 240mm2, matrix=64×64) covering whole brain. For the resting state fMRI portion of the scan, patients will be instructed by the technologist or research staff to leave eyes open, focus on looking at a crosshair, and not think about anything during the scan.</description>
