      This study will be an open-label, randomized, 4-period, 4-treatment, cross-over,
      single-center, single-dose study to assess the relative bioavailability of different
      formulations of ticagrelor in approximately 44 healthy adult subjects. Eligible subjects will
      be healthy male and female aged 18 to 55 years, with a body weight of 55 to 100 kg and a body
      mass index (BMI) of 18 to 30 kg/m2. Of the 44 randomized subjects, at least 36 evaluable
      subjects should be at the end of the last treatment period. Subjects will be randomized to 1
      of 4 treatment sequences and will receive single oral doses of 4 different formulations of
      ticagrelor under fasted conditions. Subjects will fast for at least 10 hours prior to
      administration of Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs). No fluids will be allowed apart
      from water which can be given until 1 hour prior to administration of the IMP and then from 2
      hours after administration of the IMP. A meal can be given 4 hours after administration of
      the IMP.
