  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ImbruVeRCHOP-Trials is an Investigator-initiated, single-arm, multi-center, prospective,
      open phase I/II trial to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of Ibrutinib and Bortezomib in
      the therapy of higher-risk DLBCL patients of different molecular subtypes and to correlate
      outcome with clinical, molecular and imaging-guided response parameters. The protocol
      includes a safety run-in phase, i.e. the phase I part of the study, to uncover unexpected
      toxicities that may arise in the context of Ibrutinib and Bortezomib co-administered with the
      R-CHOP backbone. The safety run-in phase is followed by the phase II part of the trial. About
      60 patients will be included over 3 years. Additional 8-11 German university centers will
      participate in this trial. The study treatment includes a pre-phase therapy with Prednisone
      and 6 cycles of a combined immuno-chemotherapy with the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab together
      with 6 cycles of a chemotherapy consisting of Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine and
      Prednisone plus Bortezomib and Ibrutinib followed by two additional 3-week cycles of
      Rituximab. Secondary endpoints are the predictive power of subtypes (such as
      GCB/ABC-&quot;cell-of-origin&quot;), markers of minimal residual disease over time and
      during-the-study-determined markers (e.g. gene signatures) to identify patients who benefit
      from this treatment addition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cycle 1 (C1): At C1/day d2, there will be a CT- or ultrasound-guided re-biopsy of a lymphoma
      lesion that is accessible for biopsy without considerable risk for the patient.

      Cycle 2 (C2): After C2, a post-Interim CT will be performed (eventually FDG and FLT PET-CT
      imaging added to the protocol by amendment).

      Cycle 3 (C3): At C3/d0 (prior to therapy), there will also be another bone marrow aspirate
      for MRD follow-up. At C3/d2, there will be a re-biopsy of a lymphoma site in case of a
      residual lesion by CT that is accessible for biopsy without considerable risk for the
      patient. Biopsies can be obtained CT- or ultrasound-guided.

      End of treatment/post-therapy: The end-of-treatment visit is required for all subjects,
      irrespective of a completion of all 8 cycles of therapy or exit of the study protocol. It has
      to be scheduled approximately 4 to 6 weeks after the last cycle. A total of 7 Follow up
      visits is planned over 30 months of follow up.
