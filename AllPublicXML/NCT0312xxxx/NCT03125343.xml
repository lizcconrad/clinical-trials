      A national cohort study with all patients scheduled for neoadjuvant treatment with
      (chemo)radiotherapy or short course radiotherapy with delayed surgery 6-8 weeks) for rectal
      cancer staged as cT4bNX/anycTanycN and cMRF+/anycTanycN and lateral lymph nodes on MRI (and
      patients that have been offered short course raditotherapy with delayed surgery due to
      various reasons). The tumours are positioned midrectal or low and are palpable with the
      finger. The patients offered this treatment after recommendations on their local
      multidisciplinary tumour board will be will be informed and offered to participate in the
      study. Patients scheduled for short course radiotherapy with immediate surgery cannot be
      included.

      â€¢ Biopsies and blood from patients with rectal cancer subject to neoadjuvant treatment with
      (chemo)radiotherapy or radiotherapy 5x5 Gy with at least 6-8 weeks wait until surgery. All
      patients will be asked to answer a QoL questionnaire (appendix C) to cover their experiences
      of the neaodajvuant treatment. (Answered at diagnosis and at evaluation of treatment and
      decision of surgery or inclusion in the Watch and Wait part of the study).

      All patients will undergo scheduled (chemo)radiotherapy according to national guidelines. The
      patients with chemoradiotherapy will be evaluated at 8-10 weeks after completed treatment
      (25) with pelvic MRI. After this evaluation at 8-10 weeks patients with suspected complete
      response or near complete response will examined according to the protocol below.

      All patients that are considered to have complete response will be offered a &quot;Watch and wait&quot;
      approach with follow-up according to the protocol. They will then be followed at one of the
      Regional University Hospitals within their catchment are.

      All patients with a palpable rectal cancer staged as cT4bNX/anycTanycN and cMRF+/anycTanycN
      and lateral lymph nodes on MRI (and patients that have been offered short course
      raditotherapy with delayed surgery due to various reasons) that does not achieve complete
      response will serve as control and will be treated with surgery as planned prior to
      initiation of (chemo)radiotherapy.

      Patients with indication of complete response on follow-up MRI will undergo endoscopy, and
      digital rectal examination to ascertain complete response. MRI together with documentation
      from endoscopy will be reviewed at the Regional University Hospital to extablish agreement
      regarding interpretation. All the below mentioned criteria must be fullfilled to be
      considered complete response:

        1. No suspicious metastatic lymph nodes or evidence of remaining tumour on MRI. In the
           majority of cases a complete response on MRI will be seen as areas of homogeneous
           fibrosis. Absence of any remaining pathological tissue is seen in a minority of cases.

        2. Endoscopic examination with light/white mucosa or scar, telangiectasies. Prescence of
           fibrosis and oedema.

        3. No palpable tumour on clinical examination (26).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients in Sweden with a palpable rectal cancer staged as cT4bNX/anycTanycN and
        cMRF+/anycTanycN and lateral lymph nodes on MRI considered appropriate for 5x5 Gy and 6-8
        weeks of wait prior to surgery according to Stockholm III (28) or a palpable rectal cancer
        staged as cT4bNX/anycTanycN and cMRF+/anycTanycN and lateral lymph nodes on MRI a planned
        schedule for CRT according to the Swedish National Program for rectal cancer scheduled for
        neoadjuvant therapy are possible to include.

        The study includes two parts, where part one is optional in including hospitals. The aim of
        the biopsy substudy to identify tumour and plasma markers for complete response, thus all
        patients that will receive (chemo)radiotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting are included to
        provide a control for the biopsies.

        For the WoW part of the study all patients that achieve complete response after neoadjuvant
        treatment according to the specified criteria above can be included in the Watch and Wait
        protocol. In detail this includes patients with:

        Midrectal or low rectal cancers that are palpable and considered with an indication of 5x5
        Gy and long wait (6-8 weeks) (the indication for waiting may be logistics, co-morbidity,
        advanced age):

          -  cT4bNX

          -  anycTanycN and cMRF+ anycTanycN and lateral lymph nodes on MRI

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No informed consent received for participation.

          -  Patients with rectal cancer that is scheduled for (chemo) radiotherapy but is not
             palpable during rectal examination (10-15 cm) as this cannot be examined by digital
             examination and followed as scheduled.

          -  Contraindication for MRI such as presence of non compatible metallic implants or
             claustrophobia.
