  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown children who sustain a concussion are susceptible to having chronic
      symptoms (post-concussion syndrome). This chronicity can lead to delays in returning to learn
      and returning to play. Blurry vision, double vision, eye strain and eye tracking problems are
      some of the reported chronic symptoms that can affect patients' daily activities. Concussion
      awareness has increased recently and there is a surge of interest to better understand and
      treat the symptoms of post-concussion syndrome. Currently, ocular treatment for patients are
      often empirically determined. Common treatments are vision therapy and/or bifocal glasses.
      There has yet to be any standardization or prospective studies looking into treatment for
      these concussed patients with ocular symptoms and findings. The objective of this protocol is
      to compare three different types of glasses (typical prescription glasses for kids, typical
      glasses for kids with anti-glare coating, and progressive addition lenses with anti-glare
      coating) as treatment options for participants who are still symptomatic four weeks out from
      their concussion. The main outcome is the effectiveness of these three different options in
      reducing patients' symptoms and improving the participants' visual findings.
