  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators would like to determine if early administration of oral Midodrine in
      participants diagnosed with sepsis will impact blood pressures and decrease the need for
      and/or doses of intravenous pressor agents.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three doses of either placebo or midodrine every 8 hours will be administered in addition to
      usual care for sepsis. The goal will be to administer the first dose approximately within 24
      hours of diagnosis. The first dose will be administered only after the patient has been
      admitted to the ICU. Subjects will receive treatment for a total of 16 hours starting from
      the first dose. The medical provider, nursing staff and patient will be blinded to
      randomization, only research pharmacist will be aware of randomization. Blood pressure will
      be recorded at least on a 4 hourly basis for 24 hours from the time of administration of the
      first dose, and also just prior to administration of each dose. Subsequent doses will be held
      if systolic blood pressure, SBP, is greater than 130 mmHg. If a subject requires initiation
      of intravenous vasopressor agents following study enrollment, subsequent doses will be
      continued. There will be no further intervention after all 3 doses have been administered;
      however clinical outcomes and adverse events will be monitored.
