  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study aims to research whether there is a relationship between omentin and
      ischemic stroke on the aspects of incidence, severity, and recovery etc.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To study the possible relationship between omentin and ischemic stroke, we intend to recruit
      the newly found acute ischemic stroke patients and patients without any stroke history and
      analysis the difference of plasma omentin level and the ITLN, which is the gene symbol of
      omentin.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>the odds ratio of omentin plasma concentration between cases and controls</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The circulation level of omentin will be assessed in cases and controls. Then the odds ratio will be statically analysed to detect whether omentin is asociated with ischemic stroke on protein level.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>the frequency difference of single nucleotide polymorphism(SNP) of omentin in the enrolled subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The SNP will be analysed in the recruited subjects. And the the frequency difference will be calculated to explore if any SNP is related to ischemic stroke.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the NIHSS assessed for functional outcome of stroke</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>NIHSS wil be used to assess neurological status at baseline or the point of stroke, the point of out-patient, 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 year and the 3 year.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the modified Rankin Scale assessed for functional disability</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Th functional disability will be assessed using the modified Rankin Scale at the time of baseline, out-patient, 3rd month, 6th month, 1st year, 2nd year and the 3rd year after enrollment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the Barthel index assessed for functional independence in activities</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel index at the point of baseline, out-patient, 3rd month, 6th month, 1st year, 2nd year and the 3rd year after enrollment will be assessed for the functional independence in activities.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the number of all cause death</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The number of all cause of death will be recorded in both groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the number of re-stroke in case group</measure>
