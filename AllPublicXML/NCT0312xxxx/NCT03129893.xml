    <textblock>
      Ventilator associated pneumoniae (VAP) occurs in 9-27% of all intubated patients and is
      associated to an important morbidity and mortality. It is a serious complication among
      neonates and pediatric patients after cardiac surgery accounting for 6.8 - 32.2 % of
      health-care associated infections. It has a large impact on morbidity, survival, hospital
      costs and duration of neonatal and pediatric intensive care unit stay (PICU). Ventilator
      associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) is common in adults and it has been described as a risk
      factor for the development of VAP. Studies have shown that treatment of VAT is associated
      with a lower rate of VAP and a lower mortality in adult critically ill patients. VAT has also
      been described in premature infants and children but it has been less studied than in adults.

      Recently the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) rolled out new surveillance
      definitions for patients receiving mechanical ventilation that promise to dramatically
      improve hospital's capacity to track clinically significant complications in this population.
      These new surveillance definitions were designed to be more objective and to render the data
      easier to collect and verify. The terms include ventilator-associated condition (VAC) and
      infection-related, ventilator-associated complication (IVAC). Studies in adults demonstrated
      that the VAC assessment was faster, more objective, and a superior predictor of outcomes.
      However, this approach has not yet been applied systematically to infants and children.

      For more than 50 years, uncuffed tracheal tubes have been commonly used for intubation in
      children under 8 years of age because of the anatomy of the pediatric larynx and the fear
      (based on case reports and scruples) that the cuff will cause airway mucosal injury, leading
      to subglottic stenosis. However, since 2009, it is registered and available a new cuffed
      tracheal tube (TT) (Microcuffw PET; Kimberly Clark, Health Care, Atlanta, GA, USA) with an
      anatomically designed high volume - low pressure tube cuff, with a recommendation chart for
      tube size selection has recently become available for pediatric anesthesia.

      Weiss and colleagues enrolled 2246 patients in a randomized multi-centre trial and reported
      no increase of risk for post-extubation stridor with the use of the new microcuffed.

      Considering that microaspiration of contaminated oral secretions is one of the mechanisms
      leading to VAP and VAT, the use of cuffed TTs may be beneficial in VAP prevention as the
      superior tracheal seal may decrease the incidence of micro-aspiration. However, no study
      evaluated the incidence of VAP with the use of cuffed tracheal tubes is published since now.

      Despite of these new evidence, the use of uncuffed tube in neonatal and pediatric critical
      care still remain very common to minimize minor complications (i.e. mucosal damage due to the
      cuff), and consequently the use of cuffed or uncuffed tubes is equally recommended.

      The management of anesthesia according to standards procedures of the Bergamo anesthesia
      department is shifting from the uncuffed tubes only to microcuffed tubes, and it is aim of
      the present study to monitor this transition measuring the performance of the two TTs in
      terms of incidence of VAP and VAT (according to the CDC old definition) and in term of
      incidence of VAC and IVAC (according to CDC new definition).

      The CDC definition was used to identify patients with VAP and VAT. The CDC definition of VAP
      for infants &lt; 1 y.o. and children &gt; 1 or &lt; 12 y.o. are based on clinical and X-ray criteria.
      The CDC definition of Tracheitis are based on absence of clinical and radiographic evidence
      of pneumonia and the following criteria: positive culture obtained by deep tracheal aspirate
      and 2 signs of symptoms with no recognizable cause [such as fever (&gt;38.5°C), cough, new or
      increased sputum production, rhonchi, or wheezing].

      The new CDC definition is used to identify patients with VAC and IVAC. The new definitions
      includes all associated complications (infection included) related to mechanical ventilation
      and exclude X-ray criteria.

      VAP, VAT, VAC, IVAC rate, expressed as the number of VAP/VAT/VAC/IVAC episodes per 1000
      mechanical ventilator days (VAP/1000 MV days), were calculated for phase 1 and phase 2.
