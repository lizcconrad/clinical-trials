    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare treatment efficacy of focused and radial
      extracorporeal shock waves on spasticity in chronic stroke patient

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective and double-blinded randomized control trial. Thirty-two stroke
      patients with spastic equinus were randomly assigned to receive three sessions of either
      focused shockwave therapy or radial shockwave therapy at 1-week intervals. The intensities
      that were used during FSWT (0.1 mJ/mm2) and RSWT (2 bar) were comparable. Patients were
      evaluated at baseline and at 1, 4, 8 weeks after the final shockwave treatment. The primary
      outcome measure was modified Ashworth scale (MAS) score. Secondary outcome measures were
      Tardieu scale, ankle passive range of motion, plantar contact area during gait, and gait
      speed. A linear mixed model with repeated measures was used to compare each outcome measure
      between the two groups.

    <description>Treatment was administered directly to the middle of muscle bellies of the spastic triceps surae muscle in three sessions, with one week interval. During each session, 3000 pulses (1500 shots in the gastrocnemius and 1500 shots in the soleus muscle) were delivered at 5 Hz. The intensities of FSWT were 0.10 mJ/mm2.</description>
