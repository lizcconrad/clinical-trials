      This study evaluates the effect of a physical exercise + caregiver skills training on
      feelings of burden, mood, and biological markers of inflammation in persons who provide care
      for Veterans with a TBI or dementia. Half of the caregivers will participate in a balance and
      flexibility + caregiver skills training program, while the other half will participate in a
      moderate/high intensity aerobic and resistance + caregiver skills training program.

    <description>The combined moderate to high intensity combined aerobic and resistance exercise training + skills training group consists of six months of physical exercise + caregiver skills training followed by an additional six months of follow-up for a total study duration of twelve months. All aspects of these combined interventions will be delivered through mobile technology thus obviating some of the obstacles to caregivers face in meeting their own needs. Caregivers will be provided with study issued equipment (e.g., exercise equipment, activity monitoring devices, and tablets) to complete all elements of the intervention.</description>
