  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditional models of smoking cessation focus on delivering advice and counseling to quit and
      providing assistance to patients ready to quit smoking, but do not actively intervene with
      patients who are not ready to quit (NRTQ). This abrupt cessation approach is often not an
      appealing option to those not ready to quit, however, a reduction approach can seem more
      attainable and engaging. In response to this need, this smoking cessation intervention has
      been developed.

      This research is part of a pilot study to assess the feasibility of introducing a NRTQ
      intervention in a primary care setting. This study will also assess the effectiveness of
      increasing the number of smoking reduction interventions delivered, provider confidence and
      satisfaction, relative to control practice. Outcomes will be assessed by a pre-survey and a
      three-month follow-up survey, administered to all study participants. All study participants
      will also be asked to fill out brief NRTQ consult forms for each NRTQ patient they encounter
      for a two-week period. Additionally, participants randomized to the intervention arm will
      receive training, and access to tools and resources.

    <description>The feasibility of introducing a not ready to quit (NRTQ) intervention in a primary care setting by measuring the participation rate (i.e. Practitioner recruitment).

    <description>Provider confidence will be measured in a pre and post intervention surveys completed by participating health care providers in both the intervention and control groups. This will evaluate if providing a 2-hour Continuing Medical Education(CME)/Group Learning (GLS) training session along with resources on the smoking reduction intervention model will alter provider confidence in intervening with the NRTQ population and help inform a larger study.</description>
