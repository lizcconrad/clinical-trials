  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access program (EAP) for eligible participants. This program is designed
      to provide access to Venetoclax prior to approval by the local regulatory agency.
      Availability will depend on territory eligibility. Participating sites will be added as they
      apply for and are approved for the EAP. A medical doctor must decide whether the potential
      benefit outweighs the risk of receiving an investigational therapy based on the individual
      patient's medical history and program eligibility criteria.
