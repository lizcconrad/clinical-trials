  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of gluten-free diets on symptoms and
      inflammatory markers in individuals with previous diagnosis of fibromyalgia (FM), as well as
      to identify the presence of non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCSG) in individuals with FM.
      Patients with FM diagnosis will be kept on a gluten-free diet for a 10 weeks. In the 7th
      week, they will receive placebo capsules for 7 days and after washout, capsules containing
      gluten for another 7 days. A questionnaire based on Salerno protocol will be applied to
      evaluate the presence of NCGS in the beginning, 8th week and 10 week.

    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic and widespread pain condition, usually accompanied by several
      associated symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disorder, headache, irritable bowel syndrome and
      mood disorders. Recent studies point to the possibility of gluten protein having a role in
      the development of FM symptoms in a subgroup of patients. Fourteen patients with FM diagnosis
      will be kept on a diet restrict in gluten-free foods for a period 10 weeks. At the 7th week
      they received rice protein isolate capsules (placebo) for 7 days, followed by a 3-day
      wash-out and a new challenge with capsules containing 8 g/day of gluten (corresponding to
      6,3g gluten protein) for another 7 days. In the initial period, at 8th week (final of placebo
      period) and after challenge with gluten (10th week), blood will be collected for analysis of
      inflammatory markers. Questionnaires will be carried out to evaluate the quantity and
      severity of FM symptoms and the impact of FM on daily routine. Inflammatory markers
      (IL-1bera, IL-6 and IL-10) will be evaluated in the blood. In the challenger period (gluten
      or placebo) questionnaires will be carried out to evaluate the quantity and severity of
      symptoms related to fibromyalgia and the impact of fibromyalgia on a daily basis. In
      addition, a questionnaire based on Salerno protocol was applied to evaluate the presence of
      NCGS.
