      The aim of the study is to evaluate in clinical practice the efficacy and safety of
      ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ ritonavir and dasabuvir administered for 8 weeks in treatment-naïve
      participants with genotype 1b hepatitis C virus (HCV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HCV chronic infection affects 200 million people worldwide. HCV antiviral treatment has
      evolved rapidly since 2011. The introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) achieve great
      effectiveness with minimum SAEs and short treatment duration. However, studies evaluating
      efficacy and safety of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ ritonavir and dasabuvir during 8 weeks are
      limited in real clinical practice. The aim of the study is to evaluate in clinical practice
      the efficacy and safety of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ ritonavir and dasabuvir administered for
      8 weeks in treatment-naïve participants with genotype 1b hepatitis C virus (HCV).
