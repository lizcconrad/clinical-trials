    <textblock>
      Amblyomin-X is an inhibitor of Factor Xa that also acts as an apoptotic agent for tumor
      cells. In the case of in vitro assays, Amblyomin-X induces tumor cells to death and does not
      affect the viability of normal cells. When in vivo assays were performed on mice bearing
      tumors, treatment with Amblyomin-X caused a significant reduction in tumor mass and number of
      metastases.

      This trial will be the first clinical study in humans with the product, which until then has
      been studied only in experimental models. Given the current epidemiological impact of cancer
      and the need to improve its systemic treatment, making it available to a larger portion of
      the Brazilian population, it is proposed to conduct the first Amblyomin-X study in cancer
      patients, more specifically those with advanced solid tumors For which there is no
      contraindicated or inaccessible therapeutic option established as the standard at the time of
      inclusion in the study.

    <description>This cohort will include 3 patients with the first calculated dose of Amblyomin-X drug. The patient will receive the intravenous drug. If no Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in this group the study continues including the next cohort. However, if If only one patient in a given cohort develops DLT, three more patients will be included at that dose level, up to a maximum total of six patients per dose level. If two or more of the three patients of a certain dose level develop DLT, this dose level is considered very toxic, and the study does not proceed. If this occurs at the first dose level, the study will be finalized. If only one in six patients at a dose level develops DLTs, escalation proceeds until Tolerated Maximum Dose.</description>
