      The purpose of this study is to determine if the Optune NovoTTF-200A device can be safely
      used in pediatric patients with high-grade glioma, both alone and in combination with
      standard chemotherapy medications.

    <textblock>
      This phase I trial will utilize a standard 3+3 design to determine the safety and
      tolerability of the Optune NovoTTF-200A System in pediatric high-grade glioma patients. The
      initial cohort of patients will receive treatment with the Optune NovoTTF-200A System alone
      and will consist of children with recurrent high-grade gliomas. Newly-diagnosed patients will
      be excluded from this initial cohort as withholding more proven initial therapies may be
      considered unethical.

      Patients enrolled to the Optune NovoTTF-200A System monotherapy cohort will receive treatment
      with 200kHz for a minimum of 18 hours per day in 28 day cycles. Phase I safety evaluation
      will take place over the initial two cycles (56 days) of treatment. Following the completion
      of the safety evaluation period, patients will continue to receive treatment in 28 day
      cycles, which may be repeated continuously without therapy interruption until any criterion
      for discontinuation is met.

      If the Optune NovoTTF-200A System is found to be well-tolerated in pediatric patients with
      recurrent high-grade gliomas, then the study will proceed to determine the safety and
      tolerability of the device when used in combination with chemotherapy agents, temozolomide
      and bevacizumab.This second cohort of patients will include children with both newly
      diagnosed and recurrent high-grade gliomas. Children with recurrent tumors will only be
      eligible if they have not previously received therapy with temozolomide and/or bevacizumab.
      (The lone exception to this rule is temozolomide and/or bevacizumab administered solely
      during radiation therapy.) Patients enrolled to the Optune NovoTTF-200A System plus
      temozolomide and bevacizumab cohort will receive TTField treatment with 200kHz for a minimum
      of 18 hours per day in 28 day cycles. Patients will also receive temozolomide 200mg/m2/dose
      orally on Days 1-5, as well as bevacizumab 10mg/kg/dose intravenously on Days 1 and 15 of
      each 28 day cycle. Phase I safety evaluation will take place over the initial two cycles (56
      days) of treatment. Following the completion of the safety evaluation period, patients will
      continue to receive treatment in 28 day cycles, which may be repeated continuously without
      therapy interruption until any criterion for discontinuation is met.

      Once a patient is assigned to a treatment cohort, it is planned that they will continue to
      receive treatment in cycles of 28 days (4 weeks), which may be repeated continuously without
      therapy interruption until any criterion for discontinuation (clinical or radiological
      progression of disease, clinically unacceptable toxicity, completion of treatment, etc.) is
      met.
