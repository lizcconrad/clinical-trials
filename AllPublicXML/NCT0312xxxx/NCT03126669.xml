  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Brain uses 20% of the total oxygen supply consumed by the entire body. Even though, less
      than 10% of the brain is active at every given time, the brain utilizes almost all the oxygen
      delivered. In order to perform different tasks or more than one task (multi-tasking), the
      oxygen supply is shifted from one brain region to another, via modulation of blood perfusion.

      The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) environment,
      with increased oxygen supply to the brain, will enable better performance of complex and/or
      multiple activities.

      Methods: a prospective, double blind randomized control, cross over trial including healthy
      volunteers. Participants were asked to perform a cognitive task, a motor task and a
      simultaneous cognitive-motor task (multi-tasking). Participants were randomized to perform
      the tasks at 2 environments: (a) normobaric air (1ATA 21% oxygen) (b) HBO (2ATA 100% oxygen).
      Two weeks later participants were crossed to the alternative environment. Blinding of the
      normobaric environment was achieved in the same chamber with masks on while hyperbaric
      sensation was simulated by increasing pressure in the first minute and gradually decreasing
      to normobaric environment prior to tasks performance.

    <time_frame>45 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Three different forms of the SDMT were used in each evaluation session. The first was a try-out for the test, ensuring understanding of the task. The second tests the ability to per-form an individual task. The third form was used together with the motor test for examin-ing dual task performance. Standard administration procedures were followed as indicat-ed in the test manual. The score of the test is the number of correct substitutions during 90-second interval.</description>
