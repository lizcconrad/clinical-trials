  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conventional complete overdenture will be made to ectodermal dysplasia patients, a week after
      delivery and after 3 months Patient satisfaction, retention and periodontal condition will be
      assessed. the denture will be taken from the patient for 2 weeks.Acrylic telescopes will be
      replaced with soft liner and again Patient satisfaction, retention and periodontal condition
      will be assessed a week after delivery and 3 months later.

      Upper and Lower Primary impressions will be carried out by using irreversible hydrocolloid
      (Alginate, Tropicalgin, Normal setting, Zhermack, Italy) according to manufacturer's
      instructions using stainless steel stock trays.

      Secondary upper impression is done with an acrylic special tray. Border molding is done with
      putty consistency rubber base impression material, Final impression with medium consistency
      rubber-base impression material (Silicone impression material, Elite P&amp;P, Regular Body-Normal
      set, Zhermack, Italy) Maxilla-mandibular relationship will be recorded using check bite
      technique. Setting of artificial teeth will be performed and trial dentures will be tried in
      inside patients' mouth.

      The finished and polished dentures will be delivered immediately after the necessary occlusal
      adjustments and instructions regarding hygiene and maintenance.

      The patient will use the upper overdenture for 3 months. The overdenture is taken from the
      patient for two weeks, after which the maxillary overdenture will be adjusted by relieving
      acrylic opposite to the abutment about 2 mm using a metal stone. The relieved areas will be
      painted with an adhesive and the rest of the fitting surface of the denture will be painted
      with a separating medium.

      The soft liner (Silicone based soft liner, mollosil, chairside soft relining-long term,
      DETAX, Germany) will then be applied in the relieved areas to act as a secondary coping The
      base and catalyst will be mixed according to the manufacturer's instructions on a glass slab.
      The mix will be placed on the relieved area, seated in the patient's mouth, the patient is
      asked to bite in centric relation and the excess liner is removed with a lancet.
