  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm babies have immature lungs and frequent pauses in their breathing which often
      necessitates breathing support. Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (nCPAP) is one of
      the most commonly used tools, but the standard interfaces (prongs or mask) may cause
      nasal-septal injury and discomfort.

      The RAM cannula is another interface that consists in soft and curved prongs to avoid this
      nasal injury, but as the seal is not 100%, suboptimal delivery of airway distending pressure
      could result if they are used to deliver CPAP, as compared to standard interfaces.

      The investigators plan to study very low birth weight preterm babies who are generally well
      but require some support with their breathing. By inserting a special feeding tube with
      sensors into the stomach, the investigators can measure the electrical activity of the
      diaphragm (EAdi), which is an important muscle for breathing. By analyzing EAdi in babies
      receiving nCPAP either with prongs or ram cannula, the investigators will be able to measure
      and compare how each method of support affects a baby's breathing. This important study will
      help us determine the most appropriate breathing support for preterm babies.

      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure is one of the most researched and accepted methods of
      delivering NIV to term and preterm infants. Different interfaces have been used, most
      frequently binasal prongs or mask. The RAM cannula is a relatively new interface for
      delivering CPAP in preterm infants, specially to avoid nasal injury and discomfort. However,
      there are few studies in artificial models with different results in term of the percentage
      of pressure that is really delivered when we use the RAM cannula. The objective of this study
      is to to investigate in VLBW preterm infants who require respiratory support by nasal CPAP,
      whether or not using the RAM cannula as the interface will allow to provide the level of
      respiratory support equivalent to that with the traditional binasal prongs, measured by
      diaphragm electrical activity (Edi). The investigators hypothesize that in VLBW preterm
      infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), the use of CPAP with RAM cannula as the
      interface may provide lower PEEP (positive end expiratory pressure) than set and increased
      resistance to gas flow, leading to increased respiratory effort for the patient as reflected
      by an increase in Edi.

      This study will help Neonatologist determine if the amount of support provided with the RAM
      cannula as interface is equivalent to the support we achieve with the standard interfaces, to
      select the patients that could benefit from using this interface. The investigators will be
      able to utilize this information to decide on the most appropriate respiratory support
      modality for preterm patients.

    <intervention_model_description>Randomization will be done by sealed envelopes, ready for use once consent is obtained.Each envelope will contain a card with the assigned treatment group: protocol 1 or protocol 2.
Protocol 1: we start the study on CPAP with binasal prongs. Edi will be recorded while the infant is on nasal CPAP with the binasal prongs, with a PEEP of 5-8 cm H2O, for 2 hours. Then, the infant will be switched the interface to the RAM cannula, with a PEEP 2 cmH2O higher, during 2 hours.
Protocol 2: we start the study on CPAP with RAM cannula. Edi will be recorded while the infant is on nasal CPAP with the RAM cannula with a PEEP 2 cmH20 higher than the levels the infant was receiving before starting the study protocol, for 2 hours. Then, the infant will be switched the interface to the binasal prongs with a PEEP between 5-8 cmH2O, during 2 hours.</intervention_model_description>
