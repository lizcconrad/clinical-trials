  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to estimate the efficacy and toxicity of familial HLA mismatched bone
      marrow transplants in patients with non-malignant disease who are less than 21 years of age
      and could benefit from the procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients &lt; 21 years of age with a non-malignant disorder benefited by hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant will receive a reduced intensity conditioning regimen consisting of hydroxyurea,
      alemtuzumab, fludarabine, thiotepa, and melphalan.

      This will be followed by a familial HLA-mismatched bone marrow transplant. The primary
      objective is to establish safety and donor cell engraftment at 100 days and 1 year
      post-transplant.
