  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this Bayesian Adaptive trial is to compare a control group versus a
      comprehensive ulcer healing protocol. The latter involves a combination of compressive
      therapy, miokinetic drainage and muscle strengthening for the entire lower extremity pump
      among patients with lower extremity venous ulcers. The investigators hypothesized that the
      combined therapy will have a higher closure rate as well as lower time to closure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Bayesian adaptive, randomized, controlled, parallel, two-armed Bayesian adaptive
      trial. Patients diagnosed with varicose ulcers through Doppler ultrasonography will be
      recruited at the Pro Circulation Clinic of Angiology and Vascular Surgery, Brazil. The active
      group will be the Vein Fitness system, a multimodal intervention comprising exercise,
      lymphatic drainage, and compressive therapy, while the control group will be standard
      compressive therapy and regular wound care. The researchers will measure closure of the
      wounds and the closure rate as the primary outcomes. The study was designed in accordance
      with the CONSORT statement.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A ratio of the ulcer area and the time that it takes to close. Ulcer size will be measured using a standard protocol: First, we will photograph the wounds at a standard one meter distance having a ruler besides the lower extremity. The area of each wound will then be estimated through the Imagej software (National Institutes of Health) using a freehand drawing surrounding its border, with software calibration based on the pre-established dimensions of the background image. We will also assess a subset of 20 images by two independent observers to estimate inter-observer reliability.</description>

    <measure>Ankle range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The angle that the ankle can reach as it moves. We will measure ankle range of motion through a goniometer. Specifically, passive ankle motion will be performed, with the fixed arm of the goniometer located on the leg axis, aligning the movable arm with the foot axis. We will perform all procedures in an office setting by trained physical therapists. A random group of patients will have the goniometry procedure performed twice by two independent physical therapists to assess the inter-observer reliability of these metrics.</description>

    <measure>Leg perimetry</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Perimetry will be conducted at two different levels of the foot, and at five distinct levels of the leg, using a regular commercial tape. No pressure will be applied to these measurements to avoid affecting their precision. We will conduct the first-foot measurement five centimeters proximal to the base of the first proximal phalanx of the second toe, and the second measurement five centimeters proximal to the first measure. The first leg measurement will be performed five centimeters above the inferior border of the lateral malleolus, and then followed at every five centimeters to a total of six to eight measurements depending on the leg height.</description>

    <description>Lymphomiokinetic exercises will be performed during a 1 hour period, with the patients in a supine position, legs elevated and properly positioned on a carpet; the knees will be mildly flexed to a comfortable point. The patients will put feet on the pedals of ankle extension/flexion device. The frequency will be around 15 to 20 cycles/minute, while the amplitude will be individually adjusted according to the range of movement of each patient. During the exercises, study personnel will manually drain the lower members.
Compressive therapy will be applied as described in the control group arm.
Care of the wound will be delivered as described in the control group arm.</description>

    <description>Compressive therapy will be applied to both groups by properly trained personnel. Each layer of the compressive boot will have a 50% overlap, from the base to of the fingers to 3 cm bellow the popliteal fossa. The interface pressure used will be of at least 50mmHg in supine position.
Wound care will be delivered to every individual in both groups, 1 or 2 times each week by a nurse certified in wound management, following the principles of maintenance of a moisturized surface between the wound and its cover. The nurse will also carry out mechanical wound debriding and biofilm removal.</description>

             from the examined area. Reflux will be considered pathological if: &gt;0.5 seconds (s) in
             the superficial venous system, or &gt; 1.0 s in the deep system, or &gt; 0.35 s in a
             perforator vein.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Investigators will exclude patients with ulcers from any other cause, including
             arterial insufficiency, with ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) &lt; 0.8. Infected
