  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (2: 1), multicenter clinical phase II
      clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Endostar combined with chemotherapy for
      stage IV soft tissue sarcoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of sarcoma patients in stage IV is poor. For STS, the response rate of
      chemotherapy is only 20-35% and the median survival time is about 12 months. The 5 year
      survival rate is lower than 10% reported in several large-scale studies. Although
      chemotherapy plays a major role in the treatment of advanced STS, the classic chemotherapy
      agents are not curative. Combination chemotherapy or dose-dense regimens have largely failed
      to improve the response rates. Long-term using of cytotoxic drugs increased the risk of
      toxicity in patients. Endostatin is the strongest endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor, which
      inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and then inhibits tumor
      angiogenesis . Endostar, is a novel recombinant human endostatin, with advantages of long
      half-life, stable and low cost. Recently, a study of Endostar combined with chemotherapy in
      the treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma indicated resulted in a higher clinical benefit
      response (CBR) and longer progression-free survival (PFS), with tolerable side effects.
      However this study included the patients with stage IIB-IV soft tissue sarcomas and did not
      include specific pathologic information. Thus this clinical trial is designed to compare the
      efficacy and safety of endostar combined with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in stage
      IV patients with soft tissue sarcomas.
