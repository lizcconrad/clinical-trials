      To determine whether the implantation of an intrastromal corneal ring is an effective
      treatment for a homogeneous group of mild keratoconus patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A group of 65 patients with mild keratoconus were implanted with a Ferrara ring in a single
      eye. Six months after surgery, the aberrations were measured and the visual function was
      determined using clinical indices. The aberrations, especially comatic aberration (coma),
      were measured independently.

    <description>A group of 65 patients with keratoconus who were implanted with an intrastromal corneal ring; the group was composed of 40 males (61.50%) and 25 females (38.50%), with a mean age of 27.88 ± 7.38 years (range, 17-47 years). The patients were fully informed about the study and signed a consent form previously approved by the ethics committee of our institution.
We used the Amsler-Krumeich classification and included only patients classified as grade I or II. The investigators performed the intraestromal corneal ring surgery in the selected group.</description>

    <description>The patients underwent surgery to implant the intrastromal corneal ring (Ferrara Ophthalmics, Belo Horizonte, Brazil) using a manual technique. The procedures were performed by a single surgeon with extensive training in corneal surgery. All patients received the same ring, and the number (1 or 2 segments), thickness, and arc size were calculated using the nomogram provided by the manufacturer.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Investigators used the Amsler-Krumeich classification and included only patients
             classified as grade I or II.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Investigators excluded patients with central corneal scarring, with other eye
             disorders, or with previous ocular surgery. We also excluded patients with a history
             of herpes infection, keratitis, corneal dystrophies, diagnoses of autoimmune diseases,
             systemic connective tissue disorders, or acute keratoconus.
