    <textblock>
      This study will compare the glaucoma day-ward patients' efficacy with inpatients by
      evaluating the glaucoma knowledge, psychology, effect of surgery and complications , and will
      analysis the reasons of the differences. Half of participants will receive treatment in
      day-ward, while the other half will receive treatment in hospital.

      Ophthalmic surgery has short operative time, quick recovery, and small anesthesia risk,
      making day case surgery the main management mode of ophthalmic surgery. This study will
      explore the whole effect of the glaucoma day-ward patients by comparing to the inpatients.
      The whole effect will be assessed by the following indexes, intraocular pressure, mean
      defect, complications, psychology, glaucoma knowledge. The metal status will be assessed by
      The hospital anxiety and depression scale.
