  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to demonstrate that the Simplify® Cervical Artificial Disc (Simplify®
      Disc) is at least as safe and effective as conventional anterior cervical discectomy and
      fusion (ACDF) when used to treat two contiguous discs from C3 to C7 following discectomy at
      two contiguous levels for intractable radiculopathy (arm pain and/or a neurological deficit)
      with neck pain or myelopathy due to abnormalities localized to the levels of the two
      contiguous disc spaces in subjects who are unresponsive to conservative management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the
      two-level Simplify® Disc compared to conventional two-level ACDF in skeletally mature
      patients for reconstruction of two contiguous discs from C3 to C7 following discectomy at two
      contiguous levels for intractable radiculopathy (arm pain and/or a neurological deficit) with
      neck pain or myelopathy due to abnormalities localized to the levels of the two contiguous
      disc spaces that are unresponsive to conservative management.
