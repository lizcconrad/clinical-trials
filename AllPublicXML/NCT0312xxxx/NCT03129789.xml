  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monitoring fluid balance is crucial in the care of critically ill children. There are several
      reasons urine output could be decreased. For example, the bladder could be empty because the
      patient isn't making urine due to dehydration, or the bladder could be full but the patient
      unable to urinate due to obstruction of the bladder outlet. It is prudent to distinguish this
      difference in the care of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit patients as the potential
      interventions vary and none is without potential drawbacks if used inappropriately. At
      present, there is no standard way to determine whether an oliguric patient has a bladder that
      is under- or over-filled. Bedside ultrasound is safe, non-invasive, painless, and relatively
      quick and can help assess bladder volume at the time of noted oliguria. Several studies in
      pediatrics endorse the use of ultrasound to approximately measure urine volume. Pediatric
      residents are frequently asked to manage patients' oliguria in the Pediatric Intensive Care
      Unit, however, they are not currently being trained how to use ultrasound to measure bladder
      volume. The investigators hypothesize that following a structured learning plan, by the end
      of their one-month Pediatric Intensive Care Unit rotations, pediatric residents will be able
      to independently and accurately measure bladder volume by ultrasound. Volumetric bladder
      ultrasound is an easily mastered bedside imaging technique. Its implementation could
      positively affect care of the critically ill infant or child.
