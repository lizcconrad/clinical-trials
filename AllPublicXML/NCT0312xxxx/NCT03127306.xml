  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Between 40 to 70% of patients with critical illness experience moderate to severe pain.
      Diagnosing pain and assessing its severity is difficult in non-verbal patients both in an
      Intensive Care Unit and in Postoperative Unit after a major surgery such as cardiac surgery).
      In patients who are unable to self-report pain, we use behavioural pain scales, namely BPS -
      Behavioural Pain Scale.

      Aim: The aim of this study was to validate the Polish version of a behavioural pain
      assessment method - BPS in intubated, sedated patients after cardiac surgery versus self
      assessment of pain using Numeric rating scale (NRS) in both delirious and non-delirious
      patients (assessed using Confusion Assessment Method for ICU, CAM-ICU).

      Method: A prospective observational cohort study will include 60 patients. The patients will
      be observed by two trained observers during a nociceptive procedure (position change), both
      during analgosedation and analgesia. Patients will be observed 5 minutes before, during, and
      15 min after the two sets of interventions (six assessments in total). Each BPS assessment
      will be carried out by two observers blinded to each other. To validate the Polish BPS
      translation we will use the following methods: calculations of interrater reliability,
      criterion validity and discriminant validity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients after major surgery, namely cardiac surgery frequently suffer pain during their
      postoperative stay in the intensive care unit. Nearly 30% of those patients experience pain
      at rest and up to 50% experience pain during nursing procedures. Pain experienced by
      critically ill patients falls into four categories that coexist and overlap: pre-existing
      chronic pain, acute illness-related pain, continuous ICU treatment-related pain or discomfort
      and intermittent procedural pain. Moreover, acute pain experienced in the ICU may become a
      chronic problem after discharge from the unit, as a lifelong ICU footprint. Everyday nursing
      procedures, including position changing performed in the ICU may be a potential source of
      pain, therefore there is a clinical need for a simple and easy behavioural pain scale to
      evaluate this condition in patients unable to self assess pain.

      Assessment of pain in patients treated in the ICU becomes a daily clinical challenge for the
      ICU team, also in those units where minimal sedation environment based on analgesia are used.
      Various guidelines and recommendations exist to guide the ICU care team in the pain
      management and assessment process. Nevertheless, the gold standard for pain assessment is
      patient's self-report of pain (using numeric raing scale - NRS), which can be aided with
      behavioural scales only when the self-report is unreliable or impossible to obtain.
      Observational pain scales include the Behavioural Pain Scale (BPS) and have been recommended
      for clinical use in the critically ill adults. However, their validation in a given patient
      population (cardiac, burn, different languages) is strongly recommended and required.

      The need to equip critical care teams (intensive care units - ICUs, high dependency unit -
      HDUs, Post-Operative Units) with dedicated monitoring tools is clear. The BPS has been
      developed by critical care professionals and validated in various situations, but it has not
      been translated or validated in Polish until now.
