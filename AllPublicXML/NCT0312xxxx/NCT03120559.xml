  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to evaluate the effects of using a new floss holder (GumChuck) and the
      use of text messages during supportive periodontal therapy, on the psychological, behavioral
      and clinical parameters of patients with gingivitis, outlined by evidence and a theory-based
      framework.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite evidence on the benefits of controlling dental biofilm for preventing gingivitis,
      patients have difficulty complying. Floss holder devices and SMS may be useful in enhancing
      both the frequency and effectiveness of dental hygiene behaviors, by increasing patients'
      motivation and self-regulation efforts, but scarce scientific literature supporting their
      worth in controlling gingivitis and the underlying psychological processes is currently
      available.

- Examination and diagnosis (15 min).
- Motivation, discussion about desired outcomes and treatment needs followed by instrumentation (scaling, polishing) (30 min).
- Therapeutic goals, therapeutic strategies, teaching skills (brushing and interproximal control with regular waxed floss at the Control group) and scheduling of the follow-up appointment (15 min).
They were properly organized in accordance with the features of each patient, such as their gingival condition, gingivitis perception, habits and expectancies concerning the treatment. The consultation time was 60 minutes and also included specific behavior change techniques, such as reinforcement, goal-setting, and feedback.</description>
