    <textblock>
      This study is an observational study that uses daily activity and environmental sensing
      techniques to establish behavioral models of early dementia patients and cognitive healthy
      function to assess their daily behavior and determine their activities. Specifically, the
      team will collect information on a number of wireless sensors for dementia, mild cognitive
      impairment and healthy elderly residents, and use special mathematical models to establish
      the behavior of the two groups of subjects Model. The model will be developed a reliable
      algorithm to assess health risk of the subjects.

      With the help of intelligent home environment and Pervasive Computing, it is possible to
      bring information about the behavior of the patients to the caregivers and their relatives.
      In this study, non-invasive wireless sensors such as infrared motion sensor the switch sensor
      will be built in the home of the subjects. The wireless sensor data collected by the input to
      the team's &quot;activity identification system&quot; in order to assess the mathematical model of the
      subjects &quot;capacity&quot; and immediate judgment of their activities. In the identification of
      activities can be divided into two categories of behavior, risk behavior (harmful to the
      subjects) and protective behavior (beneficial to the subjects), real-time activity detection,
      can avoid dangerous behavior, such as water and gas off, roaming , Repetitive behavior
      (over-eating), forgetting to eat and day-night reversal (sleep disturbance), etc., the
      protection of behavior can be observed through a long time to help patients conduct
      beneficial behavior, such as regular quantitative diet.

        The age of the subject is over 65. The education level is junior high school degree or
        above. The healthy elders will be selected by the MMSE score (over 24), AD-8 score (under
        2) and the Mini-Cog (over 4).

        The MMSE score of the subjects with cognitive impairment or dementia is 10 to 23.
