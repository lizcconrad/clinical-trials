      A study to determine glucose and insulin responses to 50g and 100 g of carbohydrate with and
      without Gelesis200.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre, open-label, randomized, single-administration, 4-period, 4-way,
      crossover, pilot study with glycemic and insulin assessments. There is also an option for 2
      additional single-administration periods based on the results of an interim analysis.

      The study includes 2 treatments arms with Gelesis200 (4.20 g 10 minutes before a 50 g
      carbohydrate breakfast and 4.20 g 10 minutes before a 100 g carbohydrate breakfast) plus 2
      control arms consisting of consumption of the breakfasts with water only.

      The optional periods consist of 1 treatment arm with Gelesis200 and 1 control arm with
      breakfast and water only. Either only one or both the optional periods may be conducted. The
      number of additional period(s) to conduct, the amount of Gelesis200 in the treatment arm, as
      well as the meal composition will be based on interim analysis results.
