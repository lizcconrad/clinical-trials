  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Escitalopram has been approved by FDA in the treatment of adolescents with major depressive
      disorder since March 2009. To date, there are only 3 clinical trials assessing the effect and
      validity of escitalopram on major depressive disorder, which of them has resulted in
      inconsistent findings. In the present study, the authors aimed to assess the effect and
      validity of this drug in the treatment of adolescents with major depressive disorder and or
      anxiety disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Escitalopram has been approved by FDA in the treatment of adolescents with major depressive
      disorder since March 2009. Although Wagner and colleagues reported that escitalopram has a
      tendency toward positive findings for the treatment of pediatric patients with major
      depressive disorder in their study it was found that this effect has not reached a
      statistical significance. Noteworthy the authors reported statistical significance for
      escitalopram when they only included adolescent subgroup into further analysis. However,
      there are also clinical trials in the literature reporting the effectiveness of escitalopram
      on adolescence major depressive disorder (Emslie, Findling). It was indicated that no serious
      adverse effect of escitalopram was reported in these studies comparing escitalopram with
      placebo. In this study the authors aimed to investigate the effect and reliability of the
      drug in the treatment of adolescents with major depressive disorder and/or anxiety disorders.
      Additionally, cognitive behavioral therapy and SSRIs are indicated for the first-line
      treatment of anxiety disorders. The authors included escitalopram for the treatment of
      pediatric anxiety disorders.

The total scores of the relevant assessment tools (Clinical Global Impression scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Anxiety Disorders) at the starting point, 2nd and 6th month of the treatment will be compared.</intervention_model_description>

The first assessment point will be the starting point of the study and the other ones are 2nd and 6th months of the treatment course. Total scores of the CGI scale of the 3-time points will be recorded. Change in the scores of the starting point and 2nd month of the treatment will be compared. A decrease in the CGI score at the 2nd month of the treatment with a percentage of 50% or above will be considered as positive treatment response. The CGI score at the 6th month of the study with a result of 2 points or below will be accepted as remission.</description>
