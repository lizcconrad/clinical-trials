    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether CRS-207 in combination with pembrolizumab
      is safe and effective in adults with recurrent or metastatic gastric, gastroesophageal
      junction, or esophageal cancer who have received one or two prior systemic chemotherapy
      treatment regimens for advanced disease.

    <description>Treatment cycle is once every 3 weeks. Pembrolizumab: 200 mg administered IV over 30 minutes on Day 1 of each 3 week cycle. CRS-207: starting dose 1Ã—10^9 CFU administered IV over 1 hour on Day 2 of Cycle 1, on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4; and every 6 weeks thereafter. Treatment cycles will continue up to 24 months as long as there is adequate safety and potential for clinical benefit.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis with confirmed histology of one or more of the following:

               -  Histologically-confirmed gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma (Siewert type II/III
                  classification) Or

               -  Histologically-confirmed inoperable superior, medial, or distal third esophageal
                  adenocarcinoma (Siewert type I classification may be included, provided there is
                  no mixed histology)

          2. Confirmed recurrent or metastatic disease

          3. Received and experienced disease progression on, or following one or two prior
             chemotherapy regimens for advanced disease.

          4. HER-2/neu negative or, if HER-2/neu positive, disease must have previously progressed
             on treatment with trastuzumab

          5. Measurable/assessable disease, as defined by RECIST v1.1.

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

          7. Can provide tissue for PD-L1 and mesothelin biomarker analysis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of squamous or undifferentiated gastric cancer

          2. Individuals with inaccessible tumors or for whom biopsy is contraindicated

          3. Participated in any other study in which receipt of an investigational new drug or
             investigational device occurred within 28 days of first dose of study drug

          4. Receiving TNF pathway inhibitors, PI3 kinase inhibitors, systemic steroid therapy or
             any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of
             study drug

          5. Clinical evidence of ascites by physical exam

          6. Prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug
             or has not recovered from adverse effects due to agents administered more than 4 weeks
             earlier

          7. Prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2
             weeks prior to first dose of study drug, or has not recovered from adverse effects due
             to a previously-administered agent

          8. Subjects who have implanted medical devices that pose high risks for colonization and
             cannot be easily removed (e.g. artificial heart valves, pacemakers, prosthetic joints,
             orthopedic screw(s), metal plate(s)) if infection occurs. Other common devices such as
             venous access devices (e.g. Port-a-Cath or Mediport) may be permitted as well as
             arterial and venous stents and dental and breast implants that were placed more than 3
             months prior to first dose of study drug.
