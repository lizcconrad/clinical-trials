    <textblock>
      Ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily treatment is recommended for 12 months in patients with acute
      coronary syndrome (ACS) and in patients undergoing coronary revascularization and
      conservative strategies. Recent data from the PEGASUS-TIMI 541 trial have shown that
      long-term treatment with ticagrelor reduced the risk of major cardiovascular adverse events
      (MACE) in stable ambulatory patients with a history of myocardial infarction. Based on these
      data, prolongation over 12 months of ticagrelor therapy could be indicated in selected
      patients; even if with such a prolongation some adverse effects on the treatment could be
      observed. In the PLATO2 trial, where median duration of exposure to the study drug was 277
      days, the suspension of ticagrelor therapy was 7.4% in ticagrelor versus 6% in patients
      receiving clopidogrel ( P &lt;0.001). Ticagrelor treatment interruption was mainly driven by
      non-serious adverse events occurring mainly shortly after randomization. For patients after
      the first year of treatment, the subsequent rate of interruption was low. These data
      demonstrate that adverse events considered &quot;not serious&quot; by traditional trial criteria may
      have an effect on quality of life and, therefore, can cause treatment interruption; The
      phenomenon emphasizes at the same time the importance of patient education and advice on
      timing and the nature of adverse effects in order to improve adherence. Patients in the real
      world may show a premature suspension rate of the drug even higher than in clinical trials.
      However, data from real-world patients is scarce.

    <description>Ticagrelor discontinuation procedures include discontinuation, interruption and disruption. Discontinuation is defined as the definitive suspension recommended by physician for patients who are believed to no longer need ticagrelor. Interruption is defined as the temporary cessation of antiplatelet therapy for surgical needs with ticagrelor resumption after surgery. Disruption of therapy includes cessation of antiplatelet treatment due to bleeding or non-compliance</description>
