      Non-interventional Study to Assess the Tolerability and the Safety Profile of SCIT therapy
      With Acarovac® Hausstaubmilbe
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective open multi-centre non-interventional study was initiated to document the
      tolerability and the safety profile of the subcutaneous allergen-specific immunotherapy with
      Acarovac® in house dust mite allergic patients in routine medical care.

      During the up-dosing phase with Acarovac®, patients will receive 4 injections in 1-2 week
      intervals with increasing allergen amount up to the individual maximum tolerable dose. After
      reaching the individual maximum tolerable dose patients will receive one maintenance dose in
      a 4 - 8 week interval.

      Data on tolerability are documented by the physicians.

    <description>Tolerability and safety will be assessed by the frequency and intensity of local reactions at the injection site (wheal size 5-10 cm, &gt; 10 cm ) and systemic reactions (skin, airways, others) through study completion.
The study covers the four injections of the up-dosing phase and one injection of the maintenance phase of the immunotherapy course.</description>
