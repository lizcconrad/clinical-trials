    <textblock>
      This study is enrolling healthy women ages 18-39yo who are not pregnant or breastfeeding, and
      are not using hormonal birth control. Initial screening visit will include a blood draw to
      assess if the participant has recently ovulated. If hormone test indicates ovulation
      occurred, participant will start the study 8 days after the start of their next menstrual
      period. On this study visit, vaginal ultrasound will be performed to look the ovaries for
      follicles. Vaginal ultrasound is then performed approximately every 2 days until the dominant
      follicle has grown into the size group assigned. When this occurs the participant will place
      the NuvaRing®, inside the vagina and blood will be drawn for hormone levels. Participant will
      then return daily the next 5 days (total of 6 daily visits) for vaginal ultrasound and blood
      draw to assess for signs of ovulation. After the 7th day the ring is in the vagina, the
      participant will remove the ring from her vagina at home. After removal, there will be twice
      weekly clinic visits for ultrasound and blood draw until menstrual bleeding occurs. At this
      point, participation in the study is complete. Participants are compensated for their time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be comprised of healthy, non-pregnant, non-breastfeeding, reproductive age
      women with regular, ovulatory cycles who are protected from unintended pregnancy via the
      concurrent use of non-hormonal methods of contraception. Participants will have a mid-luteal
      screening visit, which will include: informed consent, history, physical, vitals, and
      assessment of mid-luteal serum progesterone to confirm ovulatory status. Each participant
      will be assigned to one of three groups according the size of the leading follicle (12-14mm,
      15-17mm, ≥18mm), which will determine the timing of the placement of the ENG/EE CVR.
      Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) will be performed three times per week, starting on day 8 of
      the menstrual cycle, until the leading follicle is within the assigned group. On that day the
      CVR will be placed and, including day of placement, there will be 6 daily visits with
      hormonal assays (progesterone, luteinizing hormone) and TVUS to assess for signs of
      ovulation. Compliance with CVR placement will be assessed through the measurement of serum
      ENG. After 7 days, participants will remove the CVR at home. Participants will then have
      biweekly visits until onset of menses to obtain serum progesterone levels and TVUS to assess
      for signs of delayed ovulation.
