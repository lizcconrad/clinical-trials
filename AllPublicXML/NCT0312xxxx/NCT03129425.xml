  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of a psychoeducational multidisciplinary
      intervention focusing on improving coping skills, the psychosocial adaptation to Parkinson's
      disease and the quality of life in patents and family carers in a Primary Care setting.

      On the basis of previous research, the hypothesis we propose is that through the development
      of coping skills which will contribute to promoting a positive psychosocial adaptation to
      Parkinson' disease, the quality of life of the people with Parkinson's disease and their
      family carers will be improved. At the same time, it is predicted that, by incorporating this
      psychoeducational intervention into clinical practice, the patients and family caregivers
      will perceive a greater sense of normality in their lives, which will also promote compliance
      with drug treatments and promote healthy lifestyles. In the long-term, such an approach could
      have positive effects on the overall health of patients and their family carers.

      This quasi-experimental study with control group and mixed methods was designed to evaluate
      the ReNACE psychoeducational intervention (ReNACE is the spanish acronym for the Research
      Programme and means Recovery, Normalisation, Acceptance and Living with Chronic illness).
      Based on the relevant study power calculations, 100 people with Parkinson's disease and 100
      family carers will be recruited. Participants will be assigned to two groups. The
      intervention group will receive the ReNACE psychoeducational intervention. The control group
      will be given a general educational program. The study will be carried out in community-based
      health centers. The results obtained from the two groups will be evaluated at three time
      points: at baseline, immediately after the intervention and at 6 months after the
      intervention. The results will be measured with the following instruments: the Quality of
      Life Scale PDQ-39 (The 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire) for patients and the
      Quality of Life Scale for caregivers SQLC (Scale of Quality of Life of Caregivers) for family
      carers, and for patients and family carers the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale
      Self-report (PAIS-SR) and the Brief Cope Inventory. To determine the acceptability of the
      intervention, focus groups will be organized with some patients and family carers who have
      received the ReNACE intervention and also with the healthcare professionals involved in its
      development.

      Registry procedures

        -  Letters will be sent from the centers themselves to the homes of all the people
           diagnosed with Parkinson's disease who meet the inclusion criteria. The letters will
           contain information about the study and how to join the study, a stamped addressed
           envelope and the informed consent form. Those interested may sign up for the study by
           telephone, by sending a letter in a stamped addressed envelope (provided by the research
           team) or in person at the reception of the participating centers. Subsequently, a member
           of the research team will evaluate if the potential participants meet the inclusion
           criteria by means of a brief interview in the health center. Once it has been
           established that participants fulfill the inclusion criteria, they will be given a
           document with the dates of the sessions that they must attend.

        -  The healthcare professionals helping the participants in data collection will be blinded
           to intervention assignment. Two researchers will be in charge of data monitoring.

        -  Data will be compared with findings from papers.

        -  The sample size necessary to detect medium to large differences in the primary outcome
           of the project, quality of life, was calculated. The parameters used for the calculation
           of the sample size by group will be published in a paper.

        -  Analysis of quantitative data will be performed on an intention to treat basis and for
           that SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 23.0 will be used. A
           descriptive analysis of the sociodemographic data will be made. For the quantitative
           variables, the means of central tendency and standard deviations will be calculated.
           Non-parametric tests (χ² tests) and parametric tests (paired student t tests) to compare
           patients with family members at each measurement points, unpaired student t tests to
           determine any significant differences between the two groups at baseline (Time 0) and
           the measurements at Time 1 and Time 2 will be used. Also, repeated measures of
           covariance (ANCOVA, analysis of covariance) will be used to compare differences between
           the two groups in the main variables.
