  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Zenker's Diverticulum (ZD) is a sac-like outpouching of the lining of the esophageal wall at
      the upper esophagus. It is a rare disease typically seen in the middle-aged and older adults.
      Common symptoms of the disease include difficulties in swallowing (dysphagia), food reflux
      (regurgitation), unpleasant breath smells (halitosis) and couch, choking and hoarseness etc.
      (respiratory complications). Pills lodging in the sac and thus unable to take effect is also
      a common and yet often overlooked problem.

      Traditional treatment for ZD included open resection done by head and neck surgeons and
      direct septum division done by ENT doctors. Septum division done by endoscopists is a new
      modality of treatment and so far has used the same approach as the ENT doctors-the wall
      between the sac and the normal esophageal lumen (the septum) is cut down directly so that
      food will not be held in the sac.

      A cutting-edge endoscopic treatment for ZD is now emerging. In this approach, what we call
      submucosal tunneling endoscopic septum division (STESD), the wall is not cut directly, but
      inside a tunnel created by lifting the wallpaper (the mucosa lining the esophageal wall).
      After the muscle septum is completely cut, the mucosa is then sealed by clips, restoring
      integrity of the esophageal lining.

      The advantage of STESD is twofold. First, the esophageal mucosa will be sealed after the
      operation, so that the chance of extravasation of luminal content with its relevant
      complications will be smaller. Second, under the protection of the tunnel, the endoscopist
      will be able to cut the septum completely down to its bottom, ensuring a more satisfactory
      symptom resolution. In short, our hypothesis is that treating Zenker's diverticulum by the
      tunneling endoscopic technique should be both safer and more effective than traditional
      methods.

      Patients with symptomatic Zenker's diverticulum are considered for STESD. The diagnosis is
      based on clinical presentation, barium swallow, EGD and a swallow test to rule out other
      possible disorders causing cervical dysphagia. A scoring system (Costamagna, GIE, 2016) is
      used to evaluate severity of the symptoms. Four symptoms are evaluated: 1) dysphagia, 2)
      regurgitation, 3) daytime respiratory symptoms and 4) nighttime respiratory symptoms. These
      are scored based on a solid food diet according to the symptom frequency calculated within 2
      consecutive weeks: 0—never, 1—1day/ week, 2—2~4days/ week, 3—≥5 days/ week. Under EGD and
      barium swallow test, configuration of the diverticulum is documented in detail (Shou-Jiang
      Tang, Laryngoscope, 2008). Quality of life is assessed using the SF-36 form. The pre- and
      post-STESD symptom score, quality of life score, and diverticulum configuration are compared.

      Adverse events are recorded and graded according to the system suggested by the ASGE workshop
      (Cotton, GIE, 2010).

    <description>STESD includes 4 steps:
Mucosal incision: submucosal injection of normal saline-indigo carmine solution is performed 2-3cm proximal to the diverticular septum and a 1.5-2cm longitudinal mucosal incision is made using the endoscopic knife.
Submucosal tunneling: a submucosal tunnel is created using the same technique as applied by Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM) at both sides of the septum until 1-2cm distal to the bottom of the diverticulum.
Septum Division: cricopharyngeal myotomy is performed longitudinally along the mid-line of the septum and ends in the normal esophageal muscle.
Mucosal Closure: the mucosa incision, as well as any accidental mucosotomy if present, is closed with hemostatic clips.</description>
