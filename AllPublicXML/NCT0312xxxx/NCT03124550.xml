  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study goal is to design and build an exergame to increase physical activity and social
      connections for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) caregivers using participatory design methods. AD
      caregivers will contribute extensively to the design and development of the content and
      motivational components of the exergame. The investigators will evaluate user experience with
      the exergame and the feasibility of using it to increase physical activity, exercise
      self-efficacy, and social connections among AD caregivers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) caregivers providing informal care for family members
      is rising dramatically, and supportive programs are vitally needed. Caregivers of AD patients
      have relatively high levels of stress and depression and limited physical activity and social
      engagement. Technology-driven programs can offer engaging, sustainable, and scalable
      opportunities to give caregivers critically-needed supports for health and well- being. This
      pilot study uses cognitive behavioral methods to develop an innovative social exergame to
      increase physical and social activity among AD caregivers. Leveraging wearable activity
      monitors, physical activity data collected throughout the day and in varied settings will
      serve as input to the game experience. Caregivers will assess the suitability of alternative
      prototypes with an array of features including (1) instructional exercise modules, (2)
      feedback from activity data, (3) digital rewards for physical activity that can be used to
      create virtual gardens and artwork galleries, and (4) opportunities to connect virtually with
      other caregivers to share and comment on their creative products. Aim one is to develop and
      build the exergame, with the AD caregivers providing extensive input into the features.
      Twenty AD caregivers will participate in the design and development phase. The second aim is
      to evaluate enjoyment of the exergame and its feasibility to increase moderate and vigorous
      physical activity, virtual social contact, and exercise self-efficacy. A new group of 20
      caregivers will test the program on a computer, tablet, or smart phone for four weeks. The
      findings will be used to develop larger-scale intervention studies to test the efficacy of
      the exergame in the future. Tailoring an exergame for caregivers of AD has the potential to
      increase physical activity and to improve overall health and well-being in this vulnerable
      population, which in turn can benefit the Alzheimer's patients for whom they provide care.

    <description>Participants will use the exergame for 4 weeks, during which time game telemetry data (all interactions with the software) will be automatically logged by the system. The participants will be asked to use the game at least every other day. Caregivers will be sent an email or automated text message (through the Twilio platform) to remind them to use the system if they have not done so within three days. The Twilio platform will be used to support an experience sampling protocol via automated, two-way text messaging: once per week, participants will be sent brief questions probing their level of satisfaction with the exergame and their level of perceived connectedness to the community of other caregivers using the exergame.</description>

    <description>Fitbit Charge HR will be used to measure physical activity and sedentary behavior during waking hours. Each participant will wear a Fitbit for a period of one week at baseline and during the entire 4-week pilot study. Data on step counts, heart rate, and moderate/vigorous activity from the Fitbits will be transmitted wirelessly to our secure research server and will be used to assess changes in physical activity and sedentary behavior over the course of the study. Participants will be instructed to wear the monitor continuously on the wrist and will be provided with a log to document the exact times of day when they wore the monitor and took it off. Data will be analyzed using previously validated accelerometer count cut-points for adults after accounting for invalid data and wear time.</description>
