  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Follicular lymphoma (FL) has a number of effective standard of care therapies; however, FL is
      not currently considered curable. Therefore, designing well tolerated therapies without
      cumulative and long-term toxicity is critical. This is a pilot safety and feasibility study
      that combines a personalized synthetic long peptide vaccine with nivolumab for the treatment
      of FL. Patients who demonstrate progression on this study will be treated with rituximab (or
      another monoclonal antibody against CD20) in addition to vaccine therapy with nivolumab.

    <description>-Unacceptable toxicity will be described as inability to receive further therapy due to toxicities of therapy as defined by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 or the occurrence of other toxicities deemed to be at sufficiently high risk to patients by the principal investigator</description>

    <time_frame>Through 5 years after completion of treatment (approximately 111 months)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR = number of participants with complete response + number of participants with partial response
Overall response rates will be compared between participants who received anti-CD20 mAb treatment (rituximab) versus those participants who did not receive anti-CD20 mAb treatment</description>

CR:
Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy.
London Deauville score of 1 and 2 in lymph nodes and extra lymphatic sites is considered to represent complete metabolic response. A London Deauville score 3 in the post treatment PET scan may be considered to represent complete metabolic response especially if it is not higher than the surrounding normal physiologic uptake.
No evidence of FDG avid disease in the bone marrow
No new lesions
If the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma before treatment, the infiltrate must have cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy.</description>

After 6 cycles, restaging will be performed again, and patients with CR, PR, or SD will continue nivolumab + vaccine.
