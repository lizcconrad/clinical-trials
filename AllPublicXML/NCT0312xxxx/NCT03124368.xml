        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have a clinical diagnosis of C3G (C3 glomerulonephritis [C3GN] or dense deposit
             disease [DDD], the 2 types of C3G) or idiopathic immune-complex membranoproliferative
             glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN) by renal biopsy for at least 3 months prior to dosing,
             with the pathologic diagnosis verified by review of the renal biopsy by the study
             central pathologist

          -  C3 must be &lt;50% of the lower limit of normal

          -  C4 must be &gt;90% of the lower limit of normal

          -  Must be willing to comply with study-specific vaccination requirements for Haemophilus
             influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis strains A, C, W, and
             Y

          -  Negative pregnancy test for females prior to dosing and throughout the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of a major organ transplant (e.g., heart, lung, kidney, liver) or
             hematopoietic stem cell/marrow transplant. Individuals receiving renal replacement
             therapy are also excluded

          -  Evidence of monoclonal gammopathy of unclear significance (MGUS), infections,
             malignancy, autoimmune diseases, or other conditions to which C3 glomerulopathy or
             IC-MPGN may be secondary

          -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; using MDRD equation) &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m2 at
             the time of screening or at any time over the preceding four-weeks

          -  Receipt of eculizumab at any dose or interval within the past 75 days prior to dosing

          -  Use of tacrolimus or cyclosporine within 2 weeks of the first dose of ACH-0144471

          -  History of febrile illness, a body temperature &gt;38Â°C, or other evidence of a
             clinically significant active infection, within 14 days prior to study drug
             administration

          -  History of meningococcal infection, or a first-degree relative or household contact
             with a history of meningococcal infection

          -  Females who are pregnant, nursing, or planning to become pregnant during the study or
             within 90 days of study drug administration or patients with a female partner who is
             pregnant, nursing, or planning to become pregnant during the study or within 90 days
             of study drug administration

        NOTE: Additional inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply, per protocol.
