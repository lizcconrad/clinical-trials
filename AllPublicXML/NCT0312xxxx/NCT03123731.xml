  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV is associated with a pattern of neurocognitive deficits, metabolic dysfunction, and an
      elevated risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), phenomena that remain untreated despite the
      use of medications to control the disease. This proposal will examine the effect of a
      personalized, automated, interactive mobile phone text message intervention (iSTEP) designed
      to increase moderate physical activity (PA), decrease sedentary behavior (SB), and promote a
      healthy Mediterranean-style diet (MedDiet) in persons living with HIV (PLWH). The
      investigators propose that participants who receive the iSTEP intervention will increase the
      amount of physical activity, improve their diet, show a reduction in risk factors for CVD,
      and exhibit improved neurocognitive performance.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ability to provide informed consent

          -  HIV infection documented at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) HIV
             Neurobehavioral Research Program (HNRP) or assessed by an HIV test at screening

          -  proficient in English

          -  physically capable of participating in moderate PA as screened by the Physical
             Activity Readiness Questionnaire

          -  consent from primary care physician to participate in the study

          -  able to consume walnuts - no nut allergies

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  any physical conditions that would prevent moderate physical activity or where
             moderate physical activity would represent a health risk for the individual, including
             a history of myocardial infarction or stroke

          -  unwillingness or inability to participate in daily text messaging

          -  tree nut allergy that would prevent walnut consumption or other food restrictions that
             would prevent participation in the Mediterranean-style diet intervention (e.g., unable
             to eat fish or use olive oil for cooking).
