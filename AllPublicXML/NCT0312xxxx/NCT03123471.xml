  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of the
      efficacy and safety of apremilast (CC-10004) in subjects with moderate to severe plaque
      psoriasis of the scalp.

      Approximately 300 subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp will be
      randomized 2:1 to receive either apremilast 30 mg twice daily (BID) or placebo for the first
      16 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of four phases:

        -  Screening Phase - up to 35 days

        -  Double-blind Placebo-controlled Phase- Weeks 0 to 16 Subjects will receive treatment
           with one of the following:

             -  apremilast 30 mg tablets orally BID or

             -  placebo tablets (identical in appearance to apremilast 30 mg tablets) orally BID

        -  Apremilast Extension Phase - Weeks 16 to 32

             -  All subjects will be switched to (or continue with) apremilast 30 mg BID at Week
                16. All subjects will maintain this dosing through Week 32.

        -  Observational Follow-up Phase

             -  Four-week Post-Treatment Observational Follow-up Phase for all subjects who
                complete the study or discontinue from the study early.

    <measure>Change from baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index total score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>DLQI is a simple, compact, and practical questionnaire for use in a dermatology clinical setting to assess limitations related to the impact of skin disease. The instrument contains ten items dealing with the participant's skin. With the exception of Item Number 7, the participant responds on a four-point scale, ranging from &quot;Very Much&quot; (score 3) to &quot;Not at All&quot; or &quot;Not relevant&quot; (score 0). Item Number 7 is a multi-part item, the first part of which ascertains whether the participant's skin prevented them from working or studying (Yes or No, scores 3 or 0 respectively), and if &quot;No,&quot; then the subject is asked how much of a problem the skin has been at work or study over the past week, with response alternatives being &quot;A lot,&quot; &quot;A little,&quot; or &quot;Not at all&quot; (scores 2, 1, or 0 respectively). The DLQI total score was derived by summing all item scores, which has a possible range of 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best.</description>
