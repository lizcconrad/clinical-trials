  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI's) and Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB's)
      are commonly used anti-hypertensive medications that may have implications on the management
      of a patient undergoing surgery. Limited research has looked at the effects of these
      medications on perioperative complications and mortality. Some studies conducted on small
      groups of inpatients with advanced vascular disease undergoing vascular surgery or coronary
      artery bypass grafting (CABG), suggest exacerbation of hypotension (low blood pressure) in
      patients who continued taking ACEI's or ARB's on the morning of their procedure. In addition,
      cases of low blood pressure (BP) that were refractory to standard treatment were reported.
      One recent retrospective study reported no difference in severe hypotension and only a modest
      difference in moderate hypotension managed by conventional treatment, but did not adequately
      address the risk of preoperative hypertension. A study recently published by the
      investigators (Twersky et al., 2014) in over 600 patients demonstrated no difference in
      preoperative hypertension in ambulatory surgery and same day admission patients. There has
      been limited data stratifying the degree of low BP based on severity but these were not done
      in ambulatory patients, and neither was the degree of high BP from discontinuing these
      medications addressed. As such, no uniform consensus has been reached and clinicians are
      unclear as to whether the reported inpatient findings are applicable to the outpatients,
      since they differ in many respects. The investigators propose to evaluate whether ACEI's and
      ARB's discontinued preoperatively have a negative impact on perioperative hemodynamics and
      patient outcome in a group of ambulatory and same day surgical patients. Similar to studies
      done on inpatients, the investigators will also evaluate patients receiving a standardized
      general anesthetic for hemodynamics following induction of anesthesia until surgical
      incision.

      The investigators hypothesize that continuing ACEI's and ARB's in the preoperative period
      does not result in an increased risk of severe hypotension (low blood pressure) following
      induction of general anesthesia.
