  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of this study is to investigate the effects of treadmill versus cycling endurance
      training on Balance, gait performance and exercise capacity in patients with severe chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients will be recruited during a 3-week inpatient pulmonary
      rehabilitation program and will be randomized into one of two intervention groups. Walking
      intensity in the treadmill group will be set at 80 percent of the average speed of the
      6-minute walking test. The cycling group will exercise at an intensity of 60 percent
      according to an Initial incremental cycling test.

      Patients will perform 5 to 6 training sessions per week. The total exercise duration will be
      progressively increased from 10 to 30 minutes. Walking or cycling intensity will also be
      progressively increased if perceived exertion during exercise is rated below 3 on the
      modified 10-point Borg scale.
