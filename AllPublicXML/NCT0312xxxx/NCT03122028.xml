  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study LA-EU-01 was to examine the safety and the feasibility of the LAmbreTM
      Left Atrial Appendage Closure System in patients with non-valvular paroxymal, persistent or
      permanent atrial fibrillation, by using imaging approaches, i.e. combined trans-esophageal
      and transthoracic echocardiography.

      The conducted LA-EU-01 study was a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, open-label,
      non-comparative, interventional clinical investigation with the participation of two clinical
      centers in Germany and the inclusion of 61 subjects.

      Participating subjects were patients with non-valvular paroxymal, persistent or permanent
      atrial fibrillation with long-term sustainability and scheduled for interventional closure of
      the left atrial appendage who could not be treated with anticoagulation.

      After the procedure of implantation of the LAmbreTM Left Atrial Appendage Closure System,
      patients underwent a first follow up assessment prior to hospital discharge then at 30 days,
      6 and 12 months.
