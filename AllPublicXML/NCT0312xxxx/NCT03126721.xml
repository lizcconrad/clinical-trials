      This is a drug interaction study to evaluate the PF-06751979 at steady state on the
      pharmacokinetics of oral midazolam single doses in fixed sequences including single dose
      midazolam alone in period 1 followed by multiple doses of 100 mg PF-06751979 once a day for
      11 days with single dose midazolam co-administered on Day 10 in period 2

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy female subjects of nonchildbearing potential and male subjects who, at the
             time of screening, are between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive. Healthy is
             defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical
             history, full physical examination, including blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate (PR)
             measurement, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), or clinical laboratory tests.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lb).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, (including alcoholic liver
             disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), autoimmune hepatitis, and hereditary
             liver diseases), psychiatric, neurological, or allergic disease (including drug
             allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at the time of
             dosing).

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of investigational product
             (whichever is longer).

          -  Subjects who have previously received PF-06751979.

          -  Fertile male subjects who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of
             contraception as outlined in this protocol for the duration of the study and for at
             least 28 days after the last dose of investigational product.

          -  Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or
             5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of investigational product.
             As an exception, acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at doses of &lt;=1 g/day. Limited
             use of nonprescription medications that are not believed to affect subject safety or
             the overall results of the study may be permitted on a case-by-case basis following
             approval by the sponsor.

          -  Herbal supplements and hormone replacement therapy must have been discontinued at
             least 28 days prior to the first dose of investigational product.

          -  Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more
             within 60 days prior to dosing.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to midazolam or any other benzodiazapine.

          -  Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this
             study.
