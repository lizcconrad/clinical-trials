  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date no prospective trials have been completed that demonstrated whether RFA is an
      effective adjunct to systemic chemotherapy (target therapy) with respect to advantages in
      overall survival compared with chemotherapy (target therapy) alone. The primary objective of
      this trial is to determine overall survival for patients with colorectal cancer liver
      metastasis are treated with radiofrequency ablation plus chemotherapy ± target therapy,
      compared to chemotherapy ± target therapy only.
