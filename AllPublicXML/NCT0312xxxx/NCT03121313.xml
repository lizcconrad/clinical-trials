  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To determine the 2-year distant failure rate of maintenance tegafur-uracil in patients with
      squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity with extracapsular spreading of lymph nodes.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the 2-year locoregional failure rate.

        -  To evaluate the 2-year overall survival (OS) rate.

        -  To evaluate the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate.

        -  To assess the safety profiles.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint will be 2-years distant failure rate which will be estimated by
      Kaplan-Meier method with two-sided 95% confidence interval.

      The secondary endpoints are described as follows:

        -  2-year locoregional failure rate, 2-year PFS rate and 2-year OS rate will be estimated
           by Kaplan-Meier method with two-sided 95% confidence interval.

        -  Safety profile: adverse events will be summarized by CTCAE. Safety parameters will only
           be analyzed on the safety analysis set and be presented in frequency tabulation.

      Determination of sample size:

      The estimated 2-year distant failure rate for squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity with
      extracapsular spreading of lymph nodes is 26%. The 2-year distant failure rate of maintenance
      treatment with tegafur-uracil in this study is expected to be 13%. Using One Proportional
      Test with one-sided alpha 0.05 and power 80%, the sample size of 56 subjects will test an
      effect size of 13% (i.e. 26% vs.13%). With expected dropout rate of 20%, the sample size
      would be 68 subjects.

    <description>Eligible patient will be given maintenance tegafur-uracil for one year.
Dose of tegafur-uracil will be based on patient's body surface area (BSA):
BSA &lt; 1.5 m2: tegafur-uracil 300 mg/day (1 capsule three times a day)
BSA ≥ 1.5 m2: tegafur-uracil 400 mg/day (2 capsules twice a day) Tegafur-uracil will be started after patient has complete the adjuvant radiotherapy and been enrolled into the study.</description>
