  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study proposes to extend transdiagnostic treatment research to adolescents by
      establishing initial pre to post-treatment and follow-up outcomes associated with the use of
      the Spanish Version of the Unified Protocol for the Treatment of Emotional Disorders in
      Adolescents (UP-A; Ehrenreich-May, Bilek, Buzzella, Kennedy, Mash, &amp; Bennett, 2016) as a
      universal school-based preventive intervention.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has the primary aim to examine whether a transdiagnostic CBT intervention adapted
      as a school-based universal preventive intervention and delivered by professionals is more
      effective than the usual school curriculum in: (1) reducing symptoms of anxiety and
      depression and (2) preventing high levels of anxiety and depression from developing in 13-18
      years old adolescents.

      The study has the following secondary aims: (1) Examine the reduction in negative affect,
      anxiety sensitivity, emotional avoidance and emotional symptoms' interference levels at
      post-treatment as compared to pre-treatment levels; (3) Examine the improvement in positive
      affect, self-esteem, satisfaction with life, quality of life, school adjustment, and general
      indiscipline at post-treatment as compared to pre-treatment levels; (4) Examine the
      moderating role of gender, age, social economic status, personality traits, conduct problems,
      hyperactivity/inattention, and peer problems on the effectiveness of the UP-A program; (5)
      Assess the moderating role of home practice, understanding of basic concepts of the program,
      number of sessions attended, practice of specific strategies and behavior during sessions (6)
      Examine if the effects at post-treatment are maintained at the 3 month follow up; (7) Assess
      the feasibility and acceptability of implementing UP-A in a group format and in a school
      setting.

    <measure>Change in Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale—30 (RCADS-30) at pre, post intervention and at 3 months follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>RCADS-30 is a widely-used questionnaire of self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms in children and adolescents. The scale is comprised of six subscales derived from DSM-IV criteria: social phobia (SOC), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), separation anxiety disorder (SAD), and major depressive disorder (MDD). All subscales except for the MDD can be summed to creat a Total Anxiety Disorder Symptoms Score. Each item is scored from 0 (= Never) to 3 (= Always), with higher scores representing more severe symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in Depression Questionnaire for Children [Cuestionario de Depresión para Niños] (CDN) (Sandín, Chorot, &amp; Valiente, 2016) at pre, post intervention and at 3 months follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CDN is a 16-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess symptoms of DSM-IV major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder in children and adolescents. In this study, the two items targeting suicidal ideation were not included because of indications from the school principal and school counseler implicated in the study. The items are rated on a 3-point scale of frequency corresponding to Never or almost never (=0), Sometimes (=1), and Very often (2). The sum of all items provides an overall score with higher scores indicated more elevated depression symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in Anxiety Scale for Children [Escala de Ansiedad para Niños] (EAN) (Sandín et al., 2016) at pre, post intervention and at 3 months follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This 10- item questionnaire targeted to children and adolescents assesses anxiety symptoms during the last few weeks. Participants are instructed to respond to how frequently they have felt or experienced general anxiety symptoms on a four point, Likert-type scale, ranging from 0 (= Never or almost never) to 3 (= A lot of the times or almost always). The sum of all items provides an overall score with higher scores indicating more elevated anxiety symptoms.</description>
