  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested in how time-restricted feeding will impact weight, sleep
      duration and efficacy, and activity levels in obese adults. Significant advances in digital
      mobile technology allow detailed measures of an individual's habits, permitting the
      opportunity for personalized dietary and lifestyle recommendations. This is especially
      relevant as time-restricted feeding appears to promote weight loss independent of calorie
      intake, potentially shifting the paradigm of dietary recommendations from a calorie-based to
      a time-based perspective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the obesity epidemic, there is intense medical and public interest in dietary and
      lifestyle management to mitigate obesity and its associated complications. Although weight
      loss has traditionally focused on restricting calories, it is well described that most people
      are unable to maintain the caloric restriction required to long term weight loss or
      maintenance. This proposal will address whether restricting the timing of food intake, rather
      than restricting calories, may facilitate weight loss and provide metabolic benefits. It has
      been recently shown that the average American eats over the course of 15 hours per day. Such
      an eating cycle dictates that most people are always in a fed metabolic state and likely
      misaligns circadian patterns. Time-restricted feeding (TRF) is the process of limiting food
      consumption to a specific window of time (e.g. 8 hours per day) and is associated with weight
      loss in humans and metabolic improvements in rodent studies. Significant advances in digital
      mobile technology now allow further detailed measures of an individual's habits to facilitate
      this analysis. Thus, the objective of this study is to test the health related effects of 12
      week TRF (8 hour fed and 16 hour fasting cycle) in overweight/obese adults. The investigators
      hypothesize that TRF will 1) improve sleep duration, sleep efficacy, increase activity and
      increase basal metabolic rate, 2) promote weight loss and lower body fat, and 3) improve
      insulin sensitivity and postprandial hyperglycemia. The investigators expect these studies to
      show that TRF is effective and sustainable approach to improving metabolic parameters in
      overweight/obese individuals.
