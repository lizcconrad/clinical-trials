      To evaluate the therapeutic equivalence of the Test formulation, econazole nitrate cream, 1%
      to the Reference product, econazole nitrate cream, 1% in the treatment of tinea pedis.

      To demonstrate the superiority of the Test and Reference (active) treatments over Placebo
      treatment in patients with tinea pedis.

      To compare the safety of Test, Reference and Placebo treatments in patients with tinea pedis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of tinea pedis with lesions localized to the interdigital spaces or
             predominantly interdigital, but may extend to other areas of the foot (the
             non-interdigital lesions should not be hyperkeratotic, i.e., characteristic of tinea
             pedis moccasin).

          -  Provisionally confirmed at baseline by a positive potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount
             preparation

          -  Total score ≥ 4 for the clinical signs and symptoms of tinea pedis in the target area.
             In addition the target area must have a minimum score of at least 2 for erythema and a
             minimum score of at least 2 for either pruritus or scaling.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of any other infection of the foot or other disease process that, in the
             Investigator's opinion, may interfere with the evaluation of the patient's tinea pedis

          -  History of or current psoriasis, Lichen planus or contact dermatitis involving the
             feet within the previous 12 months.

          -  Past history of dermatophyte infections with a lack of response to antifungal therapy

          -  Confluent, diffuse moccasin-type tinea pedis of the entire plantar surface or
             onychomycosis involving ≥ 20% of the area of either great toenail and/or involving
             more than five toenails in total or other concurrent dermatophytoses (e.g., tinea
             cruris) and any other skin disease to an extent that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might interfere with the evaluation of tinea pedis or study results
