Complete remission (CR)
Morphologic CR with CRh (morphologic CR with incomplete hematological recovery) and the response category CRp (morphologic CR with incomplete platelet recovery)
Partial remission (PR)

    <description>Dose escalation:
Various doses of study drug will be tested on a small number of patients/dose with the goal of identifying the most appropriate dose(s) for further evaluation in dose expansion. The MTD of the study drug may or may not be identified. It is anticipated that 3-4 patients will be treated at each dose of study drug to be tested and that 15-20 total patients will be treated in this part of the trial.
Dose expansion:
Up to 2 different doses of study drug will be tested on up to 30 patients/dose with the goal of identifying the most appropriate RP2D for further clinical development. The doses to be evaluated in this part of the trial will be selected based on information obtained during dose escalation.</description>
