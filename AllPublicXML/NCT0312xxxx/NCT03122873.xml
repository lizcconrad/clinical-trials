  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to quantitate McArdle's sign, an increase in measurable weakness with
      neck flexion described in patients with multiple sclerosis, and to determine whether it is or
      is not specific for multiple sclerosis.

      Finger strength will be measure using a torque-measuring device designed to quantitate finger
      extension strength. The device was designed for point of treatment use, patient safety and
      portability. Strength will be measured in 5 paired trials, first with neck extended and then
      with neck flexed. Two protocols will be evaluated, one testing isometric strength against a
      fixed resistance and the second testing strength against dynamic resistance. McArdle's sign
      is the difference between strength with neck extension and strength with neck flexion.

      The data will be digitally registered and dynamic neck position will be recorded
      electronically in real time. Graphs of dynamic changes in torque versus neck position will be
      generated and superimposed. Strength will be quantitated using Matlab software.

      Consecutive patients with myelopathy of any cause with detectable finger extensor weakness
      will be studied, either due to MS or due to other cause of myelopathy (other inflammatory,
      vascular, compressive, neoplastic and other). Additionally, normal controls will be studied
      as will patients with finger extension weakness due to peripheral nerve lesions.

    <description>Comparison of means and medians of the difference in strength in the fully extended and fully flexed positions (&quot;McArdle's sign&quot;) measured using a torque measurement device between multiple sclerosis versus other myelopathy and between multiple sclerosis and normal controls; measurements are done in 5 successive trials of extension and flexion and the mean percentage difference between extension and flexion of the last 4 trials is averaged to calculated the McArdle's sign; the goal is to determine whether there is a specific level of McArdle sign that is diagnostic for MS using receiver operator curve method.</description>
