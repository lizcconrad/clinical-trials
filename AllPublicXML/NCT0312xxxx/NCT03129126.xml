  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of three doses of LP-10
      (intravesical tacrolimus) compared to placebo. Eighteen subjects meeting the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria will be enrolled and treated in a prospective, doubleblind, randomized,
      placebo controlled, and multicenter trial with LP-10. The proposed trial will recruit 18
      subjects in a dose-escalation trial where 6 subjects will be allocated into each one of three
      groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study
      including male and female subjects with refractory moderate to severe hemorrhagic cystitis as
      determined by a physician. A total of up to 18 subjects are anticipated and will be enrolled
      in study sites in the United States. Enrollment is expected to be completed within one year
      of initiating the study. The proposed trial will recruit 18 subjects in a dose-escalation
      trial where 6 subjects will be allocated into each one of three groups.
