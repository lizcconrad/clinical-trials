  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Family doctors can play a critical role in successfully arranging cancer screening tests to
      occur, especially if they know which patients are due for these tests. However, they don't
      always interact with or take advantage of registry data to this end. For example, in Ontario,
      the Screening Activity Report provides exactly this information to family doctors, helping
      them identify their patients who are overdue for screening. Unfortunately, less than half of
      family doctors regularly use the Screening Activity Report even though they get monthly email
      reminders. One possible reason is that the reminders they receive are not designed to compel
      action. They are easy for family doctors to miss or dismiss. This study will compare multiple
      different ways of designing the reminders. The different versions of the email are tested in
      a 2^3 factorial trial testing three behaviour change techniques to see which ones will lead
      to more family physicians interacting with the Screening Activity Report and at increasing
      the number of patients that get all the appropriate screening tests for cervical, breast,
      and/or colon cancer.

    <textblock>
      Screening is an important way to prevent cancer-related death, but many Ontarians do not
      receive guideline-recommended screening for cervical, breast, and colon cancer. Family
      physicians can play a critical role in successfully increasing screening rates. A recent
      evaluation by members of our team suggests that Screening Activity Report (SAR) use is
      associated with improved cancer screening, but there remains substantial room for
      improvement. For the SAR to reach its full potential to decrease cancer-related death by
      improving screening rates, family physicians must regularly access it and take the
      appropriate actions. Currently, family physicians receive monthly email reminders, which
      state that new data are available, but do not describe the benefits of the SAR for physicians
      or their patients. It is easy to imagine how a busy doctor would fail to act upon such
      emails, resulting in suboptimal use of the SAR and leading to avoidable delays in cancer
      screening, and management. Indeed, CCO data show that less than half of recipients attend to
      this email and &lt;7% click through to the SAR. The objectives for this trial are to compare
      different versions of the reminders in a randomized trial to identify the features that most
      increase use of the SAR. This is a pragmatic, 2^3 factorial trial, comparing behaviour change
      techniques incorporated within email reminders to doctors increase their use of the SAR.
      Participants are those who are already sent monthly emails by CCO regarding the SAR. The
      trial will randomly assign participants to one of eight modified emails to determine which
      content is most effective at driving SAR-use over 4 months. With an expected sample size of
      over 5700 family physicians, we anticipate power to see differences of 3% across experimental
      conditions.

    <intervention_model_description>We will test three components of reminders to family physicians that could be embedded independently, in combinations of two, and all together in a reminder email. Family physicians will be randomly allocated to one of 8 experimental conditions. Each experimental condition comprises a different combination of the behaviour change techniques featured in the redesigned email reminder.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The randomization schedule will be generated by a statistician on study IDs. The allocation sequence is applied simultaneously to the full set of eligible family physicians so that each is assigned to one of eight experimental conditions. The assignment to study conditions will be concealed from investigators. The data collection system used for the 4 month outcome assessment will be standardized across all study conditions and conducted by personnel at CCO not already involved in the study trial. No un-blinding is planned or permitted.</masking_description>
