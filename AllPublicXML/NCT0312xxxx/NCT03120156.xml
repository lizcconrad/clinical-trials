  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with weak balance ability or subjective feeling of dizziness and unsure gait are
      separated into 3 training-groups. One Group is getting no insoles, the second group is
      getting modern sensomotoric insoles, and the third group is getting normal standard insoles.
      All are passing a 6 week proprioceptive training.

      Main outcome measurements are posturography at baseline, 3 weeks and 6 weeks. Secondary
      measurements are ABC-Scale, Tinetti Gait and balance test and functional reach test at
      baseline and after 6 weeks.

      People with weak balance ability or subjective feeling of dizziness and unsure gait are
      separated into 3 training-groups. Exclusion criteria are structural neuropathic cause for
      dizziness, severe ocular deficience, cochlear causes for dizziness.

      The 3 Groups differ in following criteria:

      Group 1: Gets basic insoles after 3-D-Scan of the foot Group 2: Gets sensomotoric insoles
      (Jahrling) after 3-D-Scan of the foot. Group 3: Control-Group = no insoles

      Alle groups are doing a 6 weeks proprioceptive training 2 times a week for 45min.
      Balance-Ability is measured by a posturographic plate prior to the training, after 3 weeks
      training and after 6 weeks of training. ABC-Score, Tinetti Gait and Balance test and
      functional reach test are secondary outcome measurements and are evaluated prior the training
      and after 6 weeks of training.

    <description>sensomotoric insoles were published by Jahrling (2007) and have a certain shape that could improve balance abilities. The toes 2-4 are higher that toe 1, so that the tendons of the toe-flectors are pre-stressed.</description>
