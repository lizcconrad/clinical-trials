        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with adductor spasmodic dysphonia (ADSD) by an experienced neurologist and

             at least 2 treatment cycles.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with another neurological disorder that is combined with ADSD (i.e.
             Parkinson's disease and ADSD). Previous history of an additional vocal pathology (i.e.
             vocal polps, vocal nodules, unilateral vocal fold paralysis, etc.)
