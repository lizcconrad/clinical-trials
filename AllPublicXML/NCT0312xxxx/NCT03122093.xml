  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To the investigators' knowledge, no single long-term prospective observational study has
      assessed dietary factors, diabetes clinical variables (metabolic control and associated
      complications), and self -perceived health and wellness in T1D patients (both pediatric and
      adult) with CD identified by screening (positive/weakly positive serology). The aim of the
      current study is to observe the short- and long-term outcomes for Type 1 diabetic patients
      with new serology positive asymptomatic CD.
