  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Alzheimer's disease is a major health problem in our society. To date,
      pharmacological treatments to reduce Alzheimer's disease symptoms have obtained poor results
      and there is a growing interest in finding non-pharmacological treatments for this impactful
      disease. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation is a non-invasive tool which can induce changes in
      brain activity and long term modifications of impaired neural networks, and therefore holds
      promise as a clinical intervention.

      Our overall goal is to study the benefit of targeting Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation based
      on the individual's unique functional connectivity (personalized targeting) instead of
      current non-individualized approaches. Specifically, the intermittent Theta Burst protocol
      will be used and changes in cognitive, functional, and emotional deficits in these patients
      will be evaluated. Functional brain connectivity changes induced by the TMS treatment will be
      also assessed.

      Methods: A double blind randomized controlled trial will be conducted to assess the effects
      of TMS treatment immediately, one month, three months and six months after the end of the
      treatment in comparison to the baseline measurements. Forty-five patients with a diagnosis of
      Alzheimer's disease, will be randomly allocated (1:1:1) into experimental (active
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation), sham control group, or conventional intervention control
      group. Neuropsychological, functional, and emotional assessment will be conducted, as well as
      functional connectivity measures, in order to assess the effectiveness of the treatment.

      Discussion: The investigators expect to demonstrate that personalized Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation intervention has measurable positive impact in cognitive and emotional
      functioning, functionality, and brain connectivity, thus representing a potential treatment
      for Alzheimer's disease.

    <description>The intervention consists of a 2-week treatment during which TMS will be applied for 10 days (every working day). The stimulation protocol will be intermittent TBS (iTBS). 600 pulses in each area will be applied at intervals of 2 seconds of stimulation and 8 seconds of rest; the total number of pulses per session will be 1200. The stimulation duration is 3 minutes and 12 seconds. This protocol allows the induction of long-term potentiation effects, promoting plasticity in the stimulated areas. To perform the stimulation a 70 mm, figure of 8-coil will be used. In order to precisely locate the stimulated areas a stereotactic image guidance will be used during the stimulation (Brainsight™ 2)</description>
