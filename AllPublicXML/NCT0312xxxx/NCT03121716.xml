      This is an open-label, single center, nonrandomized, Phase 1 study to evaluate safety and
      efficacy of using the combination treatment of SHR-1210, gemcitabine and cis-platinum by
      recurrent and metastatic NPC.

      The safety of SHR-1210 will be assessed by ongoing reviews of clinical laboratory tests,
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, physical examination,
      electrocardiogram (ECG), and adverse events. Evaluations of immune safety will also be
      conducted (immune-related adverse events (AEs), or labs of autoimmune sera, inflammatory
      events, and immunogenicity). Safety evaluations (both clinical and laboratory) are performed
      at baseline, before each study treatment, and throughout the study.Tumor response will be
      assessed by radiographic examination in screening visit and every 2 cycles after first dose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female 18-70 years of age.

          2. Subjects diagnosed with pathological confirmed Primary metastatic nasopharyngeal
             carcinoma, or subjects with recurrent NPC that is unfit for local treatment.

          3. Subjects with recurrent and metastatic NPC who did't receive any Systemic
             chemotherapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, concurrent radiochemotherapy and adjuvant
             chemotherapy 6 month before first dose are excepted.

          4. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          5. Life expectancy more than 12 weeks.

          6. Subjects enrolled must have measurable lesion(s) according to response evaluation
             criteria in solid (RECIST) v1.1.

          7. Adequate laboratory parameters during the screening period as evidenced by the
             following:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5*10E9/L;

               -  Platelets ≥100*10E9/L;

               -  Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL;

               -  Total bilirubin (TBIL)≥1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥ 2.5 upper
                  limit of normal(ULN); for subjects with liver metastases, ALT and AST ≥5 ULN;
