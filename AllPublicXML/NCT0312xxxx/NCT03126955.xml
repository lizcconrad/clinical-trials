  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our team recently described a new medical condition called HELPS
      (Hemi-Laryngo-Pharyngeal-Spasm) syndrome(1). HELPS syndrome is a condition caused by a blood
      vessel pinching the nerve rootlets of the Vagus nerve (Xth cranial nerve). It is similar to
      the well recognized hemifacial spasm syndrome but the nerve involved is the Vagus instead of
      the Facial nerve. As a result, the symptoms are episodic throat contractions and cough. The
      throat contractions become stronger and more frequent over the years and can lead to a
      terrifying inability to breath. Patients may end up intubated in the Emergency Department or
      with a tracheostomy because of inability to breath during a severe episode. Some but not all
      of our patients can tell which side of their throat (left or right) contracts during a
      choking episode. In between these choking episodes, patients feel normal. A surgical cure for
      these patients is Microvascular Decompression of the Xth nerve.

      The treatment of HELPS syndrome begins with the correct diagnosis. Some patients are able to
      localize the side of their symptoms in HELPS syndrome while others are unable to. The purpose
      of this study is to prospectively study which of the following is the diagnostic test of
      choice for patients who are unable to localize their HELPS: 1. CISS MRI sequences, 2.
      interictal laryngoscopy, and 3. unilateral and contralateral Botox injections separated
      3-months apart.

      Both neuroradiologist and otolaryngologist will be blinded to the outcome of surgery and be
      asked &quot;based on your diagnostic test, which side do you believe we should perform MVD
      surgery?&quot;
