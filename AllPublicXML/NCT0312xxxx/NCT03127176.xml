  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gut microbiota is a complex community comprising around 10^14 bacteria that live in the
      gut lumen. The imbalance of the normal structure and function of the microbiota, defined as
      dysbiosis, has been related to a wide diversity of pathologies, including mental health
      disorders. However, clinical evidence of the relationship between microbiota and mood
      disorders is lacking. The aim of this project is to examine the possible relationship of gut
      dysbiosis and the diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BD), of gut dysbiosis and mood relapses and
      of gut dysbiosis and cognitive impairment in bipolar patients.

      A prospective longitudinal study will be carried out with three groups of patients: a group
      of euthymic bipolar I or II patients without cognitive impairment (n=50), a second group of
      euthymic bipolar I or II patients with cognitive impairment (n=50) and a control group of
      healthy volunteers (n=50). Cognitive impairment will be defined as performance in any test of
      a domain below 2 standard deviations or more from the mean of normative data of each test
      assessed in the control group. Subjects will be recruited in the Hospital Clinic of
      Barcelona. At baseline clinical variables and diet patterns (ROME III) will be collected and
      neuropsychological performance (WCST, FAS, Stroop Colour-Word Interference test, TMT,
      WAIS-III, CVLT-II) and functionality (FAST) will be assessed. All subjects will be reassessed
      at 12 months follow-up. The mood state and possible affective relapses will be evaluated and
      treatments will be registered. All patients will receive standard psychiatric care according
      to international guidelines on bipolar disorders. Fecal samples will be collected and then
      frozen in the morning pre-prandial after having fasted overnight. DNA will be separated and
      stored at −80°C until assayed. Sequencing will be performed on an Illumina MiSeqTM platform.
      Statistical analysis will be performed with the latest existing version of the SPSS.
