  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to define in detail metabolic pathways at rest and during aerobic exercise in
      normal and healthy men and women under normobaric normoxic and moderate hypoxic conditions,
      using metabolomics technologies based on minimally invasive sampling relying on gas
      chromatography and mass spectrometry.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A drop of capillary blood (20 µl) will be collected from the hyperemic earlobe for metabolomic analysis at the times t = 0 min (before starting), 10 min, 20 min and 30 min during the activity, and t = 50 and 60 min taken in the recovery phase. The oxygen saturation and heart rate will be determined at the same time points by pulse oximetry and heart rate monitoring, as well as blood gas analyses and subjective self-perception of energy availability on a quantitative scale throughout exercise.</description>
