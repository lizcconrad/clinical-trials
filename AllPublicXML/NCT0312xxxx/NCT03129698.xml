  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      52 patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer, who had a best response of complete
      response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) after completing chemotherapy
      will receive apatinib monotherapy as maintenance therapy after chemotherapy to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of maintenance apatinib after chemotherapy for small-cell lung cancer. At
      the same time, we will explore the correlation between efficacy and tumor stem cell markers
      expression by taking peripheral blood to detect tumor stem cell markers. The primary end
      point is progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary end point is overall survival (OS),
      toxicity, and the correlation between efficacy and tumor stem cell markers expression.
