  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test whether a longer meal duration could improve the diet
      quality of children. To answer this question we want to take an experimental approach by
      implementing a longer family meal duration to examine differences in children's eating
      behavior. The family dinner within a laboratory setting will be video taped and the main
      outcome is children's fruit and vegetables consumption.

      Parent-child pairs have two dinner in a laboratory setting. The study design is a
      within-subject design: In the control condition they have as much time as they usual. In the
      intervention condition they have 50% more time than usual. Order of the two condition is
      counter balanced. The lab dinner reflects a typical German dinner which consists of bread,
      cheese, cold meat and fruits and vegetables. Additionally a dessert is served after the main
      meal. The foods served reflect food preferences of the child. All dinners are video taped.
      Key outcome variables are consumption of fruits and vegetables, dessert, eating rate and
      amount time engaged in positive and negative social interaction
