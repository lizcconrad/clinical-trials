  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, phase 2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics
      (PD), efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ACE-083 in patients with CMT1 and CMTX, to be
      conducted in two parts. Part 1 is non-randomized, open-label, dose-escalation and Part 2 is
      randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 (non-randomized, open-label, dose-escalation) Part 1 will consist of up to 3 cohorts
      of 6 patients each and will evaluate multiple ascending dose levels of ACE-083 administered
      bilaterally once every 3 weeks for up to 5 doses in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle.
      Patients in each cohort will be enrolled in a 4-week screening period before beginning
      treatment.

      Part 2 (randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled) Prior to the initiation of Part 2, a
      review of safety and efficacy data from Part 1 will be conducted by the Safety Review Team
      (SRT) to determine the recommended dose level (maximum 250 mg/muscle). A total of up to 24
      new patients may be enrolled and randomized (2:1 randomization) to receive either ACE-083
      (n=16) or placebo (n=8) bilaterally by injection into both TA muscles once every 3 weeks for
      up to 5 doses.

      Study duration for Parts 1 and 2 for each patient will be approximately 24 weeks, including a
      4-week screening period, a 12-week treatment period, and an 8-week follow-up period after the
      last dose.

          7. Females of childbearing potential (defined as sexually mature women who have not
             undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or are not naturally postmenopausal
             ≥ 24 consecutive months) must have negative urine pregnancy test prior to enrollment
             and use highly effective birth control methods (abstinence, oral contraceptives,

             additional 8-week washout period (or 12 weeks total of Study Day 1 if half-life is
             unknown)

         11. Any previous or current exposure to ACE-083

         12. Significant change in physical activity or exercise (e.g., significant increase or
             decrease in intensity or frequency) within 8 weeks before Study Day 1 or inability to
             maintain the baseline level of physical activity throughout the study

         13. Any condition that would prevent MRI scanning or compromise the ability to obtain a
             clear and interpretable scan of the lower leg, as applicable (e.g., knee/hip
             replacement metallic implants)

         14. Known active substance abuse, including alcohol
