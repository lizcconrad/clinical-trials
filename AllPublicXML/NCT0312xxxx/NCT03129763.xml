  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to optimize the expansion pressure by compare different capsule
      pressures' effect, the blood supply of expanded skin is assessed by the Indocyanine Green-SPY
      Angiography.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial that designed to optimize the tissue expander expanding
      method. All the patients were randomly divided into five groups, patients in different groups
      received an expansion weekly with different capsule pressure of 60mmHg, 70mmHg, 80mmHg,
      90mmHg and 100mmHg respectively. Each patient received an expanding once a week, and a
      hemodynamic assessment of SPY-ICG angiography every two weeks. The total follow-up for each
      patient is 8 weeks.
