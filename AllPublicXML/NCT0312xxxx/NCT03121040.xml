  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ATP is generated mainly through anaerobic metabolism during strenuous exercise, which is then
      followed by the generation of lactic acid. However, this process can only be maintained for a
      short time, approximately one minute, because the accumulation of lactic acid in the muscles
      may affect muscle performance. The efficiency of lactic acid metabolism is one of the most
      important reasons for endurance improvement. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
      impacts of the daily ingestion of a commercially available Vespa amino acid mixture (VAAM®)
      beverage on blood parameters that are related to fatigue, muscle damage and immunity in
      healthy, young athletes during middle-distance running exercises. VAAM® contains 17 types of
      amino acids at a certain ratio, and evaluations were completed during 10 weeks of consecutive
      required speed and strength running tests.

      The subjects were instructed to maintain their usual dietary habits in addition to drinking
      VAAM® (two cans every day) for 10 weeks. In detail, on the 6 days/week of supervised running
      tests, participants were instructed to consume one drink before their warm-up exercise and
      the other drink while running. During their sessions and without supervision (1 day/week),
      participants were also instructed to consume one drink in the morning after breakfast and the
      other drink in the evening after dinner.

      The subjects were divided into three groups for the running tests: 3 males were assigned to
      group 1, which involved training for the 1500-meter race; 2 males were assigned to group 2,
      which involved training for the 800-meter race; and 1 male and 3 females were assigned to
      group 3, which involved training for the 400-meter race. The running exercises began with a
      45 min warm-up (including jogging, leg stretching, etc.) followed by running their specific
      races. The experimental procedure was conducted 6 days/week for 10 weeks.
