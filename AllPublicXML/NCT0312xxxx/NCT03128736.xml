  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rapid onset of proton-pump inhibitors to achieve a fast symptom is an unmet need in treating
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) but there was no report on the short-term clinical
      effects and timing to symptom relief comparing dexlansoprazole 60 mg to esomeprazole 40 mg.
      This pilot study aims to compare the one-week clinical effects of single doses of the two
      drugs in treating GERD patients.

      A comparative study to different PPIs in pharmacokinetic change showing that after 12-24
      hours post dose, mean percentage of time with pH &gt; 4 and average of mean pH were greater for
      dexlansoprazole than esomeprazole . However, the study did not report the clinical effect
      after tablets used. There was no report on the short-term clinical effects and timing to
      symptom relief of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) between dexlansoprazole 60 mg and
      esomeprazole 40 mg. Therefore, we conducted a randomized controlled, open-label, study to
      compare the 7-day clinical effects of single doses of dexlansoprazole 60 mg and esomeprazole
      40 mg in for GERD.
