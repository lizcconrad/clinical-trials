  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to compare patient knowledge about the indications of their medications
      between two sites. Regions Hospital has a population of patients that receive the medication
      indication on the label for any new or changed medications at the time of patient discharge.
      Brigham Women's Health follows a standard policy of discharge medication labels including the
      name of the medication and instructions for use without any indication of what the medication
      is intended to treat. Consented patient will receive a phone call where researchers will ask
      about which medications they are taking and other questions about those medications.

      The study population will be patients recently discharged from the hospital with 1 or more
      new or changed medications
