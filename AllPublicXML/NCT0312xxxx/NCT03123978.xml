    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of niclosamide when given together
      with enzalutamide in treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has
      come back or has spread to other places in the body. Androgens can cause the growth of
      prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy using enzalutamide may fight prostate cancer by
      lowering the amount of androgen the body makes and/or blocking the use of androgen by the
      tumor cells. Niclosamide may block signals that enhance prostate cancer cell growth. Giving
      enzalutamide and niclosamide may work better in treating patients with castration-resistant
      prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of niclosamide (PDMX1001/niclosamide) and enzalutamide in patients
      with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

      II. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of PDMX1001/niclosamide and
      enzalutamide for the treatment of patients with CRPC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics of PDMX1001/niclosamide. II. To determine the number of
      patients who have a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response that is a 50% or more reduction
      from the baseline.

      III. To identify overall responses as determined by the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2
      (PCWG2) criteria.

      IV. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) of CRPC patients treated with
      PDMX1001/niclosamide and enzalutamide.

      V. To evaluate molecular correlatives for patient response and outcomes through the analysis
      of patient baseline tumor specimens (diagnostic biopsy) along with serial blood specimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of niclosamide.

      Patients receive niclosamide orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and enzalutamide PO once daily
      (QD) on weeks 1-4. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed carcinoma of the prostate
             (CaP); CaP can be recurrent disease after definitive therapy (radical prostatectomy or
             radiation therapy) for localized CaP, or metastatic CaP

          -  Patients must have CaP deemed to be castration-resistant by one or more of the
             following criteria (despite androgen deprivation when applicable):

               -  Progression of unidimensionally measurable disease assessed within 42 days prior
                  to initial administration of drug

               -  Progression of evaluable but not measurable disease assessed within 42 days prior
                  to initial administration of drug for PSA evaluation and for imaging studies
                  (e.g, bone scans)

               -  Rising PSA, defined as at least two consecutive rises in PSA to be documented
                  over a reference value (measure 1); the first rising PSA (measure 2) should be
                  taken at least 7 days after the reference value; a third confirmatory PSA measure
                  (2nd beyond the reference level) should be greater than the second measure, and
                  it must be obtained at least 7 days after the 2nd measure; if this is not the
                  case, a fourth PSA measurement is required to be taken and be greater than the
                  second measure

          -  Measurable disease is not required:

               -  Patients who have measurable disease must have had X-rays, computed tomography
                  (CT) scans or physical examinations used for tumor measurement completed within
                  28 days prior to initial administration of drug

               -  Patients must have non-measurable disease (such as nuclear medicine bone scans)
                  and non-target lesions (such as PSA level) assessed within 28 days prior to
                  initial administration of drug

               -  Soft tissue disease that has been radiated within two months prior to
                  registration is not assessable as measurable disease; soft tissue disease that
                  has been radiated two or more months prior to registration is assessable as
                  measurable disease provided that the lesion has progressed following radiation;
                  as the biology of previously irradiated tumors may be different from
                  non-irradiated tumors, patients must have at least one measurable lesion outside
                  the previously irradiated region in order to be considered to have measurable
                  disease

               -  If PSA is the only indicator of disease without any evidence of metastasis, PSA
                  value must be 5.0 or higher

          -  Expression of AR-V7 is not required as expression of AR-V7 can occur during
             enzalutamide and contribute to resistance to enzalutamide

          -  Patients must have been surgically or medically castrated; if the method of castration
             was luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists (leuprolide or goserelin) or
             antagonists (degarelix), then the patient must be willing to continue the use of LHRH
             agonists or antagonists; serum testosterone must be at castration levels (&lt; 50 ng/dL)
             within 3 months prior to registration

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)

          -  Life expectancy should be deemed greater than 6 months

          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/mcL

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL

          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])
             =&lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must agree to use adequate contraception
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after
             completion of enzalutamide and PDMX1001/niclosamide administration

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering
             the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier

          -  Patients who have received any other investigational agents within the preceding 4
             weeks

             previous treatment with other hormonal therapy (bicalutamide, flutamide, nilutamide,
             abiraterone and ketoconazole) or chemotherapy (docetaxel, cabazitaxel or mitoxantrone)
             is allowed

          -  Other malignancies within the past 3 years except for adequately treated basal or
             squamous cell carcinomas of the skin or other stage 0 or I cancers

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to enzalutamide or PDMX1001/niclosamide

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible

          -  Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may
             significantly alter the absorption of drugs (e.g., ulcerative disease, uncontrolled
             nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection)

          -  Patients with an active, bleeding diathesis

          -  History of noncompliance to medical regimens

          -  Patients unwilling to or unable to comply with the protocol
