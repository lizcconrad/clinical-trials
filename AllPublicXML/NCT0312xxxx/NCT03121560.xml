  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Menorrhagia is frequent and occur in 11 to 13 % of the general population. It accounts for
      20% of the gynecological consultations and tends to increase with age. It can be the first
      symptom of a mild uterine disease or cancer (cervical or endometrial), especially if the
      patient is older. The most common causes are polyps, adenomyosis, fibroids, hyperplasia and
      cancer.

      Menorrhagia needs to be investigated -especially after menopause, when the prevalence of
      endometrial cancer is higher (10-15%). For premenopausal metrorrhagia, the assessment will be
      made if a pathology is suspected or if there is no response to the medical treatment within 3
      to 6 months.

      The medical check-up consists in the first instance in a questionnaire, a clinical
      examination and an endovaginal ultrasound examination. If the endometrium is thickened, a
      focal pathology is suspected, or if the bleeding persists despite a normal endovaginal
      ultrasound result, further examinations including a possible biopsy are required.

      While hysteroscopy is widely accepted as a standard examination for uterine cavity
      exploration, a meta-analysis showed that the diagnostic performance of hysterosonography was
      equivalent. Both are carried out on an outpatient basis during a gynecological consultation
      and require no special preparation. Several studies seem to show that hysterosonography is
      less painful, causes less discomfort and is therefore more accepted by patients than
      hysteroscopy. This is why many practitioners continue to prefer it to hysteroscopy and
      associate it with the Pipelle of Cornier for the assessment of postmenopausal metrorrhagia.

      However, if endometrial cancer is confirmed, the histological type detected within the biopsy
      is the main predictor of the severity of the disease and the treatment to be given. It is
      therefore essential to have an accurate biopsy sampling prior to therapeutic management. It
      is not the case with blind biopsies (without visual control). Indeed, some studies showed
      that the concordance between the optical aspect of the endometrium under hysteroscopy and the
      histological result was close to 90%, validating the hypothesis of an improved sensitivity
      through visual control.

      The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) currently recommends an
      endovaginal ultrasound assessment followed by an endometrial biopsy in the event of a
      thickened endometrium or when a pathology is suspected. A biopsy can even be taken during the
      consultation, at the onset of the complaints. The last recommendations of December 2010 leave
      the choice to clinicians regarding the histological diagnostic modalities (a blind biopsy
      with the Pipelle of Cornier or a targeted biopsy under hysteroscopy), although the biopsies
      under hysteroscopy are recommended since 2015. However, despite its poor sensitivity, the
      most widely used technique in the world is the blind biopsy by aspiration performed after
      vaginal ultrasound or hysterosonography because it is an easy low cost method.

      The development of hysteroscopes with a smaller diameter and the introduction of the
      vaginoscopy have considerably increased the tolerance of this examination. In addition,
      hysteroscopy allows a simultaneous therapeutic intervention for certain indications, which is
      comfortable and well accepted by the patients. Unfortunately, there are few studies comparing
      the tolerance of the two examinations performed according to the current recommendations of
      good practice of hysteroscopy. Only one comparative randomized study in 2008 showed that
      saline infusion sonography (SIS) was less painful than hysteroscopy with vaginoscopy.
      However, direct comparison was impossible since women only had one of the two examinations.

      The Brugmann University Hospital set up a consultation called &quot;one stop bleeding clinic&quot; in
      which the two examinations are performed for each patient with abnormal bleedings, in order
      to increase diagnostic performance.

      All included patients will thus undergo a saline infusion sonography (SIS) and a hysteroscopy
      (HSC). Each procedure will be evaluated on pain level (EVA scale) and tolerance by the
      patient.

    <description>Hysteroscopy allows a direct visualization of the interior of the uterine cavity in order to invalidate or confirm the presence of uterine pathologies.In the pre-menopausal period, it is preferable to perform a hysteroscopy at the beginning of the follicular phase (just after the menstruations, when the endometrium is atrophic). Use of a rigid hysteroscope comprising a 2.9 mm optics and a 4.3 mm sheath with a 5 - bit operator channel allowing the realization of a biopsy.</description>

    <description>Hysterosonography (SIS) is an endovaginal ultrasound performed along with an injection of saline in order to observe the uterine cavity and detect any endometrial pathology. A 3D image can be associated with it to define the topography of a lesion. It is ideally performed in the first part of the cycle. Use of the GE Voluson E8 Ultrasound System.</description>
