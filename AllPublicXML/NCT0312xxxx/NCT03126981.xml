  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effects of consuming 1.5 oz almonds twice
      daily on insulin sensitivity and markers of cardiometabolic health in men and women with
      prediabetes.

      This is a randomized, controlled, two-period crossover study that includes two screening
      visits, and two 6-week test periods, separated by a 4-week washout. Subjects consume twice
      daily, 1.5 oz whole, natural almonds (Active Condition) or low-fat foods high in refined
      starches and added sugars, matched for energy content to the almonds (Control Condition). The
      assigned study products will be dispensed with instructions to consume 2 servings (Active
      Product) or 3 servings (Control Products) each day, starting on day 1. Subjects will be
      screened for prediabetes at the first screening visits. An intravenous glucose tolerance test
      (IVGTT) will be completed at baseline and the end of each treatment period. Fasting blood
      samples will be collected for lipid profile and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)
      measurements at all visits. Additionally, blood will be drawn for measurement of
      Apolipoprotein B and A1, lipoprotein particles and subfractions, Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and
      Uric acid at the beginning and the end of each test period. Assessments of vital signs, body
      weight, evaluation of inclusion and exclusion criteria, medication/supplement use, and
      adverse effects will be performed throughout the study. Compliance will be assessed through a
      daily log record, and return of unopened study product.
