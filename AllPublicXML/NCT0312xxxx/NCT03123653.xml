      -  Study population:Person with HBeAg negative CHB on TDF/ETV for more than 1 year

        -  Study design:Prospective,Interventional (single arm study)

        -  Study period: 2 year: January 2017 to December 2018

        -  Sample size: All the patients during the study period fulfilling the inclusion criteria
           will be included.

        -  Intervention: Peg IFN 2b 1.5mcg/kg once every week for 48 weeks

        -  Monitoring and assessment: LFT,HBV DNA and HbsAg at baseline,12 weeks,24 weeks,48 weeks
           ,72 weeks and 96 weeks, CBC every month and Thyroid function Test every 3rd month

        -  Adverse effects: The most frequently reported side effects of IFN-based therapy are
           flu-like symptoms, headache, fatigue, myalgia, alopecia, and local reaction at the
           injection site. Peg-IFN have myelosuppressive effects; however, neutropenia\1000/mm3 and
           thrombocytopenia \500,000/ mm3 are not common unless patients already have cirrhosis
