  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done with patients with advanced kidney cancer (also called renal cell
      carcinoma or RCC). This is a research study involving the use of the drug Nivolumab (also
      known as Opdivo®). Nivolumab is an anti-PD-1 antibody. It works by attaching to and blocking
      a molecule called PD-1. PD-1 is a protein that is present on different types of cells in the
      immune system and controls parts of the immune system by shutting it down. Antibodies that
      block PD-1 can potentially prevent PD-1 from shutting down the immune system, thus allowing
      it to recognize and help destroy cancer cells. In many countries (including the United
      States, European Union and Japan) Nivolumab is approved to treat certain cancer types. The
      purpose of the study is to test the safety and effectiveness of nivolumab in patients with
      advanced RCC when given intermittently.

      Nivolumab is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of
      advanced kidney cancer, non small cell lung cancer, classical Hodgkin Lymphoma and Metastatic
      Melanoma. Nivolumab is FDA-approved for advanced RCC because has been shown to shrink RCC
      tumors that have spread outside the kidney.

      Primary Objective:

      - To determine the feasibility of intermittent nivolumab therapy in patients with metastatic
      renal cell carcinoma.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the clinical outcome (overall response rate (ORR), progressive free
           survival (PFS), overall survival (OS)) in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients
           treated with intermittent nivolumab therapy.

        -  To evaluate the toxicity of intermittent nivolumab therapy in patients with metastatic
           renal cell carcinoma.

      Correlative Objective

      - Investigate correlations between baseline and post-treatment immunomodulatory cells
      [specifically, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) regulatory T cells (Treg), cluster of
      differentiation 4 (CD4) and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8), T Cells, T-cell receptor
      (TCR) repertoire and time off therapy.

    <description>The primary goal of this study is to assess the feasibility of an intermittent dosing schedule, where feasibility is defined in terms of the proportion of patients eligible for intermittent therapy who actually receive it. An underlying acceptance rate of &gt;80% is arbitrarily considered necessary in order to accept the intermittent schedule as feasible whereas an acceptance rate &lt;50% is considered evidence that the intermittent schedule is not feasible</description>

    <description>Number of patients with tumor response per the RECIST 1.1 Criteria:
Complete response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.
Partial response (PR) is defined as a greater than or equal to 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions
Progressive disease (PD) is defined as a greater than or equal to 20% increase in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions, or the appearance of one or more new lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
Stable disease (SD) is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD</description>

In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological confirmation of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (any histology)

          -  Advanced or metastatic RCC.

          -  Measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria

          -  Must have received at least one but not more than two prior anti-angiogenic therapy
             regimens (including, but not limited to, sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, axitinib,
             tivozanib, and bevacizumab) in the advanced or metastatic RCC setting. Prior cytokine
             therapy (for example, Interleukin (IL)-2, interferon (IFN)-α), vaccine therapy, or
             treatment with cytotoxics is also allowed.

          -  Patients treated with neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy prior to development of
             metastatic disease may also be included provided that at least 12 months have elapsed
             since last dose. These regimens do not count toward total number of prior therapies
             permitted for trial inclusion.

          -  No more than three total prior systemic treatment regimens in the advanced or
             metastatic RCC setting, and must have evidence of progression on or after the last
             treatment regimen received and within 6 months prior to study enrollment.

             therapy, and must not be breastfeeding. Pregnant women are excluded from this study
             because animal studies have demonstrated that nivolumab can cause fetal harm when
             administered to pregnant women. Breastfeeding women are excluded from this study
             because nivolumab may be excreted in human milk and the potential for serious adverse
             reactions in nursing infants.

          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a
             failure rate of less than 1% per year

                  bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with an anti-programmed death (PD)-1, anti-programmed death ligand 1
             (PD-L1), anti-programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2), anti-Cluster of differentiation
             (CD137), or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) antibody, or any

             prior to the first dose of study drug.

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody.

          -  Patients are excluded if they have active brain metastases or leptomeningeal
             metastases. Subjects with brain metastases are eligible if metastases have been
             treated and there is no imaging evidence of progression for 28 days after treatment is
             complete and within 28 days prior to the first dose of nivolumab administration.

          -  Major surgery (eg, nephrectomy) less than 28 days prior to the first dose of study
             drug.

          -  Any active known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with vitiligo, type I

             infection.

          -  Known medical condition (for example, a condition associated with diarrhea or acute
             diverticulitis) that, in the investigator's opinion, would increase the risk
             associated with study participation or study drug administration or interfere with the
             interpretation of safety results.
