  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is aimed at collecting preliminary safety and efficacy data related to the use of
      Drug Coated Balloon (DCB) technology for the treatment of symptomatic Superficial Femoral
      Artery (SFA) ischemic vascular disease in patients presenting with long lesions.

      The present clinical evaluation is intended as a prospective observational data collection of
      patient treatment in full accordance with institution standard practice and utilizing an
      approved (CE marked) DCB currently available on the market.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is designed as a prospective, open label, observational study.

      The study will collect information about the medical care patients receive during their
      planned procedure. No additional testing or procedures will be done.

      Patients elected for endovascular revascularization with DCB will be asked their written
      consent to the use of their personal data.

      Revascularization will be performed as per standard procedure of the sites. After discharge
      all patients will attend clinic visits at 30 days (±14 days), 6 months (±30 days), 12 months
      (±30 days), 24 and 36 months (±30 days). Angiographic follow-up will be performed in
      symptomatic patients, as clinically indicated.
