  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COPD is the fourth cause of death worldwide and it is expected to be the third in 2020.

      Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has a positive impact in reducing mortality related to chronic
      respiratory failure in stable patients with COPD. Moreover, the addition of home NIV to home
      oxygen therapy reduces hospital admissions and improves patients outcomes.

      Patients monitoring is crucial. It is increasingly recognized the potential of telemedicine
      in reducing morbidity and mortality, as well as healthcare utilisation and its associated
      costs. In particular, home telemonitoring (TM)- a technology measuring patients`clinical
      parameters and symptoms at home and allowing communication between healthcare professionals
      and patients over distance- has gained much attention. However, despite a growing body of
      evidence for TM in the management of COPD and other chronic diseases, the benefit of
      telemonitoring for Home mechanical ventilation concerning clinical and economic outcomes
      remains to be clearly demonstrated.

      The study aims to assess the impact that telemonitoring would have NIV efficacy, patient
      quality of life and satisfaction, through a prospective randomized study.The primary endpoint
      is the time for appropriate adaptation and therapy efficacy, defined as average SatO2 to 90%
      in 24h oximetry.

      A prospective randomized study, with 2 branches.

      The primary endpoint is the time for appropriate adaptation and therapy efficacy, defined as
      average SatO2 to 90% in 24h oximetry.

      Patients with COPD (n=100) based in Gold 2017. Patients with stable COPD and Pa CO2 &gt; 52 mmHg
      in blood gases. These patients might have a polygraph or polysomnographic sleep study AHI/RDI
      &lt; 15/h

        1. 1st hospital visit - D0- Inclusion criteria Confirmation; Randomization to 2 groups (1 -
           telemonitoring group (TM group) with the equipment Lumis 150, Stellar 150 or ventilator
           Astral 150 with AirView system; 2 - conventional monitoring group (CM group); Mode and
           settings titration will be selected according to patients needs and tolerance; Education
           and adaptation of the patient to VNI and optimize ventilation.

        2. 2nd home healthcare professionals visit (D 1M)-

        3. 3th hospital visit- D 3M- Compliance and ventilation effectiveness assessment (24
           oximetry and ventilator data analysis); Settings adjustment if required;

        4. 4th hospital visit - D 6M- Compliance and ventilation effectiveness assessment (24
           oximetry and ventilator data analysis) ; Settings adjustment if required

        5. 5th hospital visit - D 12M- Compliance and ventilation effectiveness assessment (24
           oximetry and ventilator data analysis); Settings adjustment if required
