    <textblock>
      The DxN Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Assay is an in vitro diagnostic assay intended as an aid in
      the management of of HCV-infected individuals undergoing antiviral therapy. The purpose of
      the study is to establish the clinical performance of the DxN HCV Assay for plasma samples in
      the intended use population.
