  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cognitive control of speech is central to human social communication. Two frontal brain
      regions seem to have a critical role: 1) Broca's area (BA) and 2) the mid-cingulate cortex
      (MCC). Current rehabilitation strategy is clearly based on therapies promoting language
      performance. However, there is few evidence that rehabilitation strategies based on
      nonlinguistic aspects of brain function may enhance recovery. Such strategies may benefit
      from knowledge about the primary -nonlinguistic- function of the BA-MCC network. The aim of
      LANGUAGE is to identify this primary function. One hypothesis is that, in non-speaking
      primates, this network is involved in cognitive control of voluntary vocal/orofacial
      production. Specifically, whereas BA may be responsible for the high-level selection of
      orofacial and vocal responses during learning, the face motor representation within the MCC
      may be responsible for performance monitoring, a process inherently required in learning.
      LANGUAGE aims to test this hypothesis by determining in human the anatomo-functional
      organization of the BA-MCC network thanks to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
