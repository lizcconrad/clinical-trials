  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, non-interventional study. Eligible newly diagnosed
      elderly multiple myeloma (MM) patients will receive comprehensive geriatric assessment (cGA)
      including ECOG scale, questionaires of ADL（activities of daily living), IADL(instrumental
      ADL),MNA-SF(mini-nutritional assessment), GDS(geriatric depression scale), MMSE(mini-mental
      state examination), SF-36 and CCI (charlson comorbidity index). Patients will get standard
      care for MM and receive the above assessments at baseline and after cycle 1, 4 and 12 for
      treating MM.Follow-up information and survival data of these MM patients would be collected.
      We would evaluate the cGA status of these newly diagnosed elderly MM patients and investigate
      the association of cGA parameters with patient's survival.

    <description>Description of the cGA (comprehensive geriatric assessment) status of the target population which is currently not known in China. The cGA parameters to be described include baseline ECOG, ADL（activities of daily living), IADL(instrumental ADL),MNA-SF(mini-nutritional assessment), GDS(geriatric depression scale), MMSE(mini-mental state examination), SF-36 and CCI (charlson comorbidity index) which would be carried out by trained physicians. The physicians would receive standard training from geriatricians of Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Moreover, as the treatment for MM (multiple myeloma) patients continues, re-evaluation of the cGA parameters would be done. The status of ECOG, ADL, IADL, GDS, SF-36 would be re-evaluated after cycle 1, 4, 12 of MM treatment. And MNA-SF scale would be re-assessed after cycle 4 and 12 of MM treatment. A description of the changes of the above scales would also be recorded for these MM patients.</description>
