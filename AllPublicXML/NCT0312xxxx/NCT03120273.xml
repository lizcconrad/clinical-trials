  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, multiple-dose phase 1 clinical trial. This study will
      determine the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety and side-effect profile of
      an investigational dexlansoprazole injection after multiple intravenous administration in
      healthy Chinese adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, multiple-dose clinical trial. 5 dosing groups were
      designed, including 15mg q12h,30mg q12h,15mg qd,30mg qd in dexlansoprazole treatment arm for
      5 days, and 30 mg q12h in an active comparator, lansoprazole, treatment arm for 5 days. The
      study will enroll approximately 70 participants with 14 cases in each group. Participants
      will make 3 visits to the clinic including 8-day of confinement to the clinic.
