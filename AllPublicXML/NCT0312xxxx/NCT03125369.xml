  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic progressive illness affecting a substantial
      percentage of the general population. While pharmacotherapy remains the mainstay of
      treatment, around 60% of patients cannot achieve the recommended goals for diabetic control.
      Weight control is a well-known essential component in normalizing blood glucose level in
      T2DM. The term metabolic surgery is recently introduced and it is now increasingly accepted
      as a valid option for obese T2DM patients with poor glycemic control despite optimal medical
      therapy. While laparoscopic roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) is the gold-standard
      bariatric/metabolic procedure in many countries, it is not widely accepted in Asia. Recently,
      a novel bypass technique called single loop duodenojejunal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy
      (SLDJB-SG) has been developed trying to tackle most drawbacks of RYGBP. Realizing there is a
      knowledge gap in applying the new duodenojejunal bypass procedure to obese T2DM patients, we
      propose to investigate and compare the efficacy of glycemic control and functional outcomes
      of SLDJB-SG with conventional RYGBP.

      Aim of study:

      To investigate and compare the safety profile, functional outcomes, efficacy in diabetic
      control and changes of hormonal profile of laparoscopic single loop duodenojejunal bypass
      plus sleeve gastrectomy (SLDJB-SG) versus the conventional standard roux-en-Y gastric bypass
      (RYGBP).

      Hypothesis:

      The efficacy of glycemic control and functional outcomes of SLDJB-SG is better than
      conventional RYGBP, and is a more suitable option for obese Chinese diabetic patients.
