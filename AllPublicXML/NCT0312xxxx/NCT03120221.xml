  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide Data suggest that Iodine deficiency is a concern among healthy pregnant women.
      Thus, screening first trimester healthy pregnant women for iodine status is of clinical value
      for mother and child as iodine deficiency might have implications on thyroid function as well
      as pregnancy outcomes

      New emerging data suggest pregnant women in Israel are iodine deficient in the first
      trimester of pregnancy. This is of major concern as first trimester iodine sufficiency is
      critical for the development of the fetal brain. Our aim is to evaluate iodine consumption in
      first trimester pregnant women in Israel through dietary questioners, Urinary iodine samples
      and thyroid functions test assessed through blood samples. All data will be analyzed in a
      central lab.
