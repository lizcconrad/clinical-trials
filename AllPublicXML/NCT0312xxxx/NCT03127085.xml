  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) who frequently attend the emergency
      department (ED) with symptoms may not require emergency treatment, and may be more
      appropriately managed in an alternative outpatient setting. This may be the result of
      inappropriate or inadequate advice or a lack of patient understanding. The main research
      objective pertains to the reason for seeking medical attention for AF in the ED, ED
      management of the patient, outcomes of ED care and alternative strategies.

      This study is a multi-centre, multi-provincial, patient survey using mixed methods. 778
      patients will be enrolled from 9 centres in 3 provinces from academic, urban, and rural
      centres to achieve geographical and health system heterogeneity. The planned duration of the
      entire study (enrollment through follow-up) is approximately 12 months. Patients presenting
      to the ED with a primary diagnosis of AF and with a prior diagnosis of established AF will be
      approached to participate. Each centre will be responsible for obtaining local consent. Data
      will be stored confidentially and securely at the coordinating centre (Queens University,
      Kingston, Ontario).

      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to take part at the time of
      presentation to the ED or after their ED visit. For all enrolled patients, one follow up
      telephone call will be made within one to four weeks of the ED visit by a social scientist
      with specialised training in questionnaires based in Queens University, Kingston, Ontario.

    <description>A detailed telephone survey will be performed in which patients with a known history of atrial fibrillation and symptoms which they feel are related to their diagnosis and who are agreeable to take part in the study will be called by a social scientist. They will be asked a series of questions and their responses will be recorded either on a Likert scale (symptom severity, satisfaction with treatment, quality of life) or as qualitative data (exact symptoms, fears and concerns relating to their underlying diagnosis)</description>
