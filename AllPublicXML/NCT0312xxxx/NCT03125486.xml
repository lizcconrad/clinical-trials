  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) have submitted a Biologic License Application (BLA) for the
      subcutaneous formulation of belimumab which is currently under review by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA). The goal of this individual patient compassionate use supply is to
      provide a patient with subcutaneous belimumab for the period of 1 year or until the
      subcutaneous formulation of belimumab becomes approved for use by the FDA and is commercially
      available to this patient, whichever is sooner. You can access GSK's Policy on Compassionate
      via http://www.gsk.com/media/3368/compassionate-use.pdf.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        This is a protocol to support an emergency IND for compassionate use in one patient
        requiring use of belimumab subcutaneous for SLE treatment (lacks venous access and cannot
        receive IV belimumab).

        Eligibility criteria is based on the following, as provided within GSK's policy on
        compassionate use:

          -  The illness being treated is life threatening or seriously debilitating.

          -  There are no satisfactory alternative treatments (confirmed by the HCP).

          -  There is sufficient evidence to believe the benefit to the patient justifies the risk
             You can access GSK's Policy on Compassionate via
             http://www.gsk.com/media/3368/compassionate-use.pdf.
