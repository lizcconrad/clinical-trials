      Postoperative pain in pediatrics can usually be well controlled with a combination of
      analgesics including acetaminophen ( paracetamol) ,NSIADS, opioids , and local/regional
      anesthesia.The use of epidural and subarachnoid morphine for analgesia in adults has grown
      almost as quickly as Morton`s discovery of anesthesia in 1846. The application of these
      techniques to the pediatric patients has evolved much more slowly,although significant
      progress is being made by many investigators.

      Advantage of intrathecal morphine as that extremely small doses of opioids are required when
      administrated intrathecally because they have direct access to spinal cord opioid receptors.
      Drug administered epidurally or caudally are required in much higher doses because they must
      first diffuse into the CSF before they reach spinal opioid receptors. As a result, the
      duration of action of intrathecal morphine is greater than that of single shot peridural
      techniques.

      To investigate the safety and efficacy of intrathecal morphine in post operative pain relief
      in pediatric patients undergoing major abdominal cancer surgeries using different doses of
      intrathecal morphine (2 μg/kg , 5 μg/kg ,10μg/kg).
