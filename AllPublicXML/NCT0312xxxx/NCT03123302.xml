  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we aim to investigate the relationship between our anesthesia practice and post
      procedure complications after MRI scanning with sedation. This is a prospective, single
      center observational study. All patients undergoing MRI scan during the study period will be
      included. The only exclusion criteria is the refusal of patients to participate to the study.

    <textblock>
      In this study we aim to investigate the influence of patient characteristics and anesthesia
      choice on possible complications in patients undergoing MRI under sedation.

      After one of the routine sedation protocol used in our department is chosen and applied
      according to the physical status of the patient and the physicians decision, the study
      recruitment will begin in the recovery area. Patient characteristics (age, gender, weight,
      height), ASA (American Society of Anethesiology) classification, associated diseases will be
      recorded . After the procedure is completed all the complications during the 2 hours waiting
      period in the recovery room will be recorded. If any complications (i.e. nause, vomiting,
      itching, urinary retention, headache, agitation, weakness, dizziness, hiccups, bronchospasm,
      bradycardia, abdominal pain) develop the observation period will be extended until the
      patient fully recover. Whether the patient received radiocontrast material or not will also
      be recorded. The patients will be called by phone at the first week after the procedure and
      the status of the complications, any epileptic seizure attack, or increase in the number of
      seizures, any admission to emergency room or any in patient admission to the hospital will be
      recorded.
