  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone age assessment in children is based on the interpretation of hand x-ray scans according
      to Greulich and Pyle (GP) standard atlas and frequently used for evaluating growth and
      puberty in children and adolescents.

      To address the disadvantage of repeated irradiation, the need for specialized radiation
      centers, heavy equipment and subjective reading a new device, SonicBone was developed.
      SonicBone utilizes a quantitative ultrasonographic technology of ultrasonic (US) waves,
      propagating along a measured bone distance. The aim of the study is to evaluate an ultrasound
      based device, SonicBone, compared to the current method in children. The investigators will
      be compared the US assessment to available bone age X-ray that exists in the medical files of
      the patients. The investigators will not do bone age X-ray scans especially for the current
      study.

      Bone age assessment in children is based on the interpretation of hand x-ray scans according
      to Greulich and Pyle standard atlas and frequently used for evaluating growth and puberty in
      children and adolescents.

      To address the disadvantage of repeated irradiation, the need for specialized radiation
      centers, heavy equipment and subjective reading a new device, SonicBone was developed.
      SonicBone utilizes a quantitative ultrasonographic technology of ultrasonic (US) waves,
      propagating along a measured bone distance. The aim of the study is to evaluate the
      ultrasound based device, SonicBone, and to compare it to the current method used in children.

      The SonicBone device (Rishon Lezion, Israel) is a small (50cm X 25cm X 25cm), portable, bone
      sonometer, which measures two parameters:

        1. speed of propagation through bone (speed-of-sound, SOS, m/sec) of inaudible high
           frequency waves of a short ultrasound pulse; and

        2. attenuation (ATN; the decay rate) of the sound wave by the bone as a function of the
           distance it travels between a transmitter probe and a receiver probe15. The hand is
           measured by: 1- wrist (W), measuring SOS and ATN at the distal radius and ulna secondary
           ossification centers of the epiphyses; 2-metacarpals (MC), measuring SOS and ATN at the
           distal metacarpal epiphyses; and 3- phalange (P), measuring SOS and ATN along the bent
           proximal third phalanx shaft, growth plate and epiphysis. The average of those 3
           readings is define as the child's bone age by SonicBone. All ultrasonic examinations
           will be conducted at the Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic, by a trained technician.

      X-ray scans will be evaluated independently by a pediatric endocrinologist according to the
      GP atlas.
