  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is designed to answer the question: How does professional coaching impact
      early career academic emergency medicine physician goal attainment, leadership strengths,
      well-being, and burnout?
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A recent systematic review and meta-analysis found coaching to have significant positive
      effects on goal attainment, well-being, coping skills, work attitudes, and goal-directed
      self-regulation. Randomized controlled studies of professional coaching have found
      significant positive effects in various settings including high school teachers and students,
      postgraduate students in a major university, and executives in the commercial, government,
      and education sectors.

      Coaching provides the participant focused time with a trained professional who facilitates
      that participant's self-determined and self-directed problem-solving and change. Coaching
      helps the participant &quot;get on the balcony&quot; away from the action on the &quot;dance floor&quot; to see
      things from a different and broader perspective and, in doing so, enriches the participant's
      ability to generate options, challenge biases, understand the effects of emotions, and
      consider uncertainty.

      This study also establishes the level of adult development of academic faculty and creates an
      initial qualitative dataset for further longitudinal study and theory generation for
      physician well-being, burnout, leadership strengths, and goal attainment.

    <time_frame>18 months (3 measurements at 6-month intervals)</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant identifies two professional goals at study onset. For each of the goals, participants respond to the question, &quot;Up to today, how successful have you been in achieving this goal?&quot; and rate their goal attainment on a scale from 0% (no attainment) to 100% (complete attainment). To control for differences between participants in perceived goal attainment difficulty, participants also will rate each goal for perceived difficulty on a 4-point scale ( 1=very easy, 2=somewhat easy, 3=somewhat difficult, 4=very difficult). Goal attainment scores are calculated by multiplying the difficulty rating by the degree of success.</description>
