  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is designed to test a primary prevention approach to the problem of prescription
      drug misuse and abuse (PDA) among middle school students. The intervention uses both online
      e-learning and small group facilitator-led intervention modalities. Middle schools will be
      randomized to receive the intervention or serve as controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While there are a number of drug abuse prevention programs for middle school age youth,
      relatively few programs focus on preventing prescription drug abuse. Furthermore, due to
      growing constraints on classroom time, new evidence-based prevention programs are needed that
      flexibly incorporate the use of online digital technology and classroom/small-group
      components. The present study is developing and testing an adaptation of the evidence-based
      substance abuse and violence prevention approach called Life Skills Training (LST). The
      proposed preventive intervention for middle school PDA will (1) utilize both online digital
      and face-to-face intervention modalities to address PDA and concurrent ATOD use; (2)
      positively change social norms and challenge positive expectancies regarding PDA and ATOD
      use; (3) discourage diversion of prescription medications; and (4) enhance protective factors
      by building social and self-regulation skills through interactive learning and behavioral
      rehearsal scenarios. Middle schools will be randomized into either an intervention group that
      will receive the new intervention or a treatment-as-usual control group that will receive
      existing health education programming. At the end of the intervention period, and at a
      12-month follow-up assessments, we will compare both groups with respect to changes in
      behaviors, norms, attitudes, and knowledge regarding PDA and substance use.

These outcomes will be examined and compared in both the intervention group and the control group at a post-test assessment and 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments.</description>
