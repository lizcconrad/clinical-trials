    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well TracelT hydrogel works in localizing bladder
      tumors in patients undergoing radiation therapy for bladder cancer. TracelT hydrogel marks
      the location of a bladder tumor and makes it more visible during imaging tests. Using TracelT
      hydrogel tissue marker may help doctors learn more about tumor location and altering
      radiation dosage for bladder cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To utilize the TraceIT hydrogel tissue marker in localizing bladder tumors during
      transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT).

      II. To improve identification of gross tumor or tumor bed location in patients receiving
      chemoradiation treatment for bladder cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To report adverse events surrounding the placement of the TraceIT tissue marker.

      II. To calculate the actual dose received by the bladder tumor bed, as delineated by the
      hydrogel.

      III. To compare the dosimetric impact to the tumor bed of daily patient alignment to the
      pelvic bones, versus alignment to the whole bladder, versus alignment to the hydrogel
      markers.

      IV. To calculate the amount of normal tissue radiation dose decrease achievable without
      losing tumor coverage, with better tumor targeting with hydrogel placement.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo transurethral resection of bladder tumors and receive TracelT hydrogel via
      injection. Patients undergo standard of care radiation therapy within 8 weeks of TracelT
      hydrogel placement.

    <description>Daily changes will be compared across the patient group as well as within each subjects' treatment course. Independent non-parametric testing of systematic (mean) errors in hydrogel marker position and tumor bed size variation between patients, as well as testing of random (root-mean-square error, pooled deviation) residual errors in hydrogel marker position between patients, will be conducted using Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) (k patient samples). Parametric ANOVA testing will be performed in order to detect differences in hydrogel positioning error in the range of 5-10 mm at 8</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Daily changes will be compared across the patient group as well as within each subjects' treatment course. These changes will be tracked during the entire radiation course (typically 4-8 weeks), yielded a distribution of x/y/z positions for each patient. Independent non-parametric testing of systematic (mean) errors in hydrogel marker position and tumor bed size variation between patients, as well as testing of random (root-mean-square error, pooled deviation) residual errors in hydrogel marker position between patients, will be conducted using Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA (k patient samples).</description>

    <description>Daily pre-radiation imaging will be used to run the radiation treatment plan, to calculate the daily dose to the PTV based on hydrogel location. Total radiation dose to the PTV can then be calculated as the sum of the daily dose.</description>
