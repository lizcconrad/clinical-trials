    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve the safety of surgery to remove a uterus (a
      hysterectomy) by better understanding where a patient's ureters lie.

      Objectives:

      Primary: (While uterus is under tension)

        -  To determine the shortest distance from the ureter to the uterine vessels.

        -  To determine the distances from the ureter to the gonadal vessels in infundibulo-pelvic
           (IP) at the pelvic sidewall. This will be defined at the distance from the IP ligament
           at the level of the pelvic sidewall to the point on the ureter directly below these
           vessels

        -  To determine the distances from the ureter to the gonadal vessels in the
           infundibulo-pelvic (IP) ligament at the point where the gonadal vessels enter in to the
           ovary. This will be defined as the distance from where the vessels in the IP enter the
           ovary to the point on the ureter directly below this.

      Secondary

        -  To determine thermal spread from the Ligasure, and Harmonic device using H&amp;E and Movat
           staining.

        -  To determine the burst pressure of segments of IP ligament that have undergone Ligasure
           or Harmonic electrosurgery.

    <description>To determine the shortest distance from the ureter to the uterine vessels to show the variation of ureteral position to the uterine and gonadal vessels during total laparoscopic hysterectomy prior to and following opening the retroperitoneum. Lighted ureteral stents will be placed cystoscopically. This will be done to clearly delineate the ureter and facilitate measuring the ureter to the infundibulopelvic (IP) and ureter to uterine vessel distances.</description>

    <description>To determine the average distance from the ureter to the right gonadal vessel in infundibulo-pelvic (IP) at the pelvic sidewall.

    <description>As part of this study an additional tool will be used during the hysterectomy. This tool is called a Cook Bush DL™ Ureteral Illuminating Catheter, which is a lighted ureteral stent. This is a very thin tube that goes into the ureter. A urologist, who is an expert at placing these devices, will insert a stent into each ureter during surgery. The lighted stents will help effectively find the ureters and keep track of them during the surgery. This same procedure is already being done in many other forms of abdominal surgery to help find the ureter. The stents will be removed before the surgery is complete and treatment will not differ in any other way.</description>
