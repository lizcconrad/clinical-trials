    <textblock>
      The study is a Phase II clinical trial. Patients will receive intensity modulated total
      marrow irradiation (TMI) at a dose of 9 Gy with standard myeloablative fludarabine/ i.v.
      targeted busulfan (FluBu) conditioning prior to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant
      (HSCT).

    <measure>Relapse free survival of approximately 30% in high-risk patients conditioned with the Fludarabine/ Busulfan regimen</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Using a Simon 2 stage optimal design with α of 0.05 and power of 0.8, 15 patients will be enrolled in the first stage. If greater than 5 patients survive to 1 year without relapse the study will continue into stage 2. Recruitment will then continue to a total of 46 patients. In this expanded cohort, if a total of 18 or more patients survive to 1 year without relapse, the treatment will be judged efficacious and worthy of further study.</description>

        4. DONOR ELIGIBILITY AND SELECTION

        4.1. Donor Selection

        Donor evaluation and selection is by standard for normal clinical practice. No study
        procedures are to be performed on donors. All donors must be willing to donate peripheral
        blood stem cells and meet institutional or NMDP criteria for donation.

        The following prioritization will be used when selecting donors:

          1. When possible, an HLA compatible sibling will be used as a donor.

          2. For patients who do not have an HLA compatible sibling, an unrelated donor will be
             used

          3. 8/8 matched unrelated donors are preferred over single antigen mismatched donors.

        If more than one potential volunteer unrelated donor is considered suitable further
        selection of the most suitable donor is at the discretion of the treating physician. The
        following serves only as a guide for prioritization:

          1. Age of donor (18-24 &gt; 25-34 &gt; 35-44 &gt; 45+)

          2. Sex and parity of donor (male &gt; female, nulliparous female &gt; parous, multiparous
             female)

          3. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) status, if recipient is CMV seronegative (CMV- &gt; CMV+)
