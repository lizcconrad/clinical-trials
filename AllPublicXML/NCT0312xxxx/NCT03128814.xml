  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Humans generally develop a preferred upper and lower extremity. Due to repetitive uneven
      loading, this gradually results in structural (e.g. increased bone and muscle mass) and
      functional (e.g. increased strength) adaptations to the dominant side of the body. The
      corresponding structural and functional asymmetry can be further accentuated by (intensively)
      practicing a unilateral sport such as tennis, which is very popular. Yet, research on this
      particular topic is scarce, especially in (pre)adolescent players. Existing studies, which
      often face methodological shortcomings (e.g. crosssectional designs, small sample sizes, no
      link to field methods), mainly focus on adults and structural asymmetry of the upper
      extremity itself, with very little or no attention to whole body structural as well as
      functional asymmetry. Moreover, the link of both forms of asymmetry with growth and
      maturation, everyday locomotion, technical skill performance and whole body injury is
      currently not (fully) understood. Therefore, the main purpose of this research project is to
      gain comprehensive knowledge on the degree, development and implications of both structural
      and functional asymmetry during a critical period in life using a longitudinal approach. As
      such, this project among youth elite tennis players will provide insights on the extent to
      which structural and/or functional asymmetry is acceptable for being most successful but
      remaining injury free.
