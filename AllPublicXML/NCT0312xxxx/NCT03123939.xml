      This is a single arm, open-label, multi-center, phase II study to determine the safety and
      efficacy of CTL019 in pediatric/young adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL. The study will have
      the following sequential phases: Screening, Pre-Treatment (Cell Product Preparation &amp;amp;
      Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy), Treatment and Follow-up. The total duration of the study is 1
      year from CTL019 cell infusion.
