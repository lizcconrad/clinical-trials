      This is a study of a OTC TFM compliant, capsaicin-based (0.25%) topical analgesic for
      management of osteoarthritis (OA) knee pain (OAKP). Subjects meeting the inclusion criteria
      and not meeting the exclusion criteria will be randomized into one of four groups: once daily
      treatment with active product, once daily treatment with product vehicle (no capsaicin),
      twice daily treatment with active product, and twice daily treatment with product vehicle (no
      capsaicin), all for 7 consecutive days of treatment. The twice daily treatments are spaced
      approximately 12 hrs apart. OAKP is assessed by the 100 mm VAS scale. OAKP assessments are
      done each day for 28 days. Tolerability data are also collected.

      This is a study of a OTC TFM compliant, capsaicin-based (0.25%) topical analgesic for
      management of osteoarthritis (OA) knee pain (OAKP). Subjects meeting the inclusion criteria
      and not meeting the exclusion criteria will be randomized into one of four groups: once daily
      treatment with active product, once daily treatment with product vehicle (no capsaicin),
      twice daily treatment with active product, and twice daily treatment with product vehicle (no
      capsaicin), all for 7 consecutive days of treatment. The twice daily treatments are spaced
      approximately 12 hrs apart. Both knees received study drug treatment but only one knee per
      subject was assigned as the &quot;study knee&quot;.

      OAKP is assessed by the 100 mm VAS scale and the response criterion is a 50% or greater
      reduction in OAKP from baseline. Baseline is defined as the VAS recorded not more than 30
      minutes before the first study drug application (on Study Day 1). For subjects in the once
      daily (QD) groups the OAKP assessments were at 12 hrs after the initial application (during
      Study Day 1) and 24 hrs(Study Day 2) after the initial application and then once in the
      morning on Study Days 3 - 28. For subjects in the twice daily (BID) groups the OAKP
      assessments were at 12 hrs after the initial application (during Study Day 1) and 24
      hrs(Study Day 2) after the initial application and then once in the morning and once 12 hrs
      later on Study Days 3 - 28.

      Tolerability data are also collected as reported burning-stinging pain, erythema and/or
      pruritus at the site of application.
