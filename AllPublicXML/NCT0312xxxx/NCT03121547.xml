  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While the analgesic effects of opioids are well known, evidence suggest that there are
      differences in the adverse dizziness of the different opioid types, which may influence the
      gait function differently. However, this has not been investigated scientifically under
      controlled conditions. Normal gait function is characterized by cyclic movements with a high
      degree of predictability. As such, the amount of kinematic variability can provide important
      information about a condition or an intervention that may affect the gait function .
      Three-dimensional gait analysis is a recognized method to assess changes in stride-to-stride
      variability associated with a medical condition or caused by an intervention. Thus, opioid
      induced changes in gait variability, and possible differences between opioid types, can be
      assessed objectively from differences in the variability of movements obtained from a
      three-dimensional gait analysis.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate differences in gait variability induced by two
      different single-dose opioid formulations and an inert placebo in healthy volunteers and knee
      osteoarthritis patients.

      The study is designed as an experimental single center, double-blind treatment, cross-over
      study with inert placebo, Tapentadol (Palexia Depot), and Tramadolhydrochlorid (Mandolgin
      Retard), with a minimum of 7days wash-out periods.

      At day 1 (Visit 1), baseline measurements are carried out before tablet administration.
      Immediately after baseline measurements one tablet is administered, and hourly measurements
      are performed for 6 hours. Subsequently all participants enter a minimum 7 day washout
      period, after which they return to the facility to repeat the procedures at Visit 2 (day 8+)
      and Visit 3 (day 15+). The order of treatments will be randomized (1:1:1).
