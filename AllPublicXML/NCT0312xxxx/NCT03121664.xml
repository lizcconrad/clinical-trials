    <description>Treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to Y days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Relatedness to Drug X was assessed by the investigator (Yes/No). Participants with multiple occurrences of an AE within a category were counted once within the category.</description>
