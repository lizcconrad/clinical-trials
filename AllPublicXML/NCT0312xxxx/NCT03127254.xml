      The current research aims to:

      A. enlist teens with cancer to produce video narratives about their experiences with their
      illness B. explicitly characterize and investigate the videos' content and C. determine what
      aspects of the production were helpful to the teen making them and predicted to be helpful to
      those watching them.

    <description>Participants' composite scores of the 10 items that make up the emotional and social domains from the PedsQL, 15 items from the PedsQL cancer module, and the two items on the TIPI that measure Extroversion will positively covary with the resilient qualities of their narrative as measured by levels of narrative coherence, subjectivity, and redemption</description>
