  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b/2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NANT-008 in combination
      with 5-fluorouracil, bevacizumab, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      Phase 1b is designed to evaluate the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of NANT-008 and
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of NANT-008 in combination with metronomic 5-FU, bevacizumab,
      leucovorin, and oxaliplatin in subjects with advanced metastatic pancreatic carcinoma. In
      phase 2, subjects will receive the combination of RP2D of NANT-008 from phase 1b in
      combination with metronomic 5-FU, bevacizumab, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin. Phase 2 is
      designed to evaluate the efficacy of the tested regimen as assessed by 1-year survival rate
      in subjects with advanced metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
