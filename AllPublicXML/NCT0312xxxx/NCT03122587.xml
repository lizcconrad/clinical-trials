      Distress tolerance, defined as the ability to persist in goal directed behavior while
      experiencing affective distress (e.g., anxiety, stress, irritability) is implicated in the
      development and maintenance of substance use disorders. Findings suggest that differential
      DLPFC engagement during affective and cognitive processing, and in particular, distress
      tolerance, among substance users may be malleable, providing a promising intervention. More
      specifically, modulating neural oscillations with non-invasive, safe brain stimulation by
      targeting regions such as the DLPFC may provide an avenue to improve distress tolerance among
      substance users. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) may be a particularly
      promising approach as it is a safe and non-invasive method of electric stimulation that has
      the potential to effectively modulate neural network and circuit dynamics, more closely
      aligning with a network-based conceptualization of affective and cognitive processes, such as
      distress tolerance. Despite its potential, limited research to date has examined the
      feasibility and optimization of tACS as a treatment methodology to facilitate cognitive
      function among individuals with substance use disorder. Thus, this study will investigate the
      effects of tACS on distress tolerance among treatment-seeking individuals with substance use
      disorder.

    <description>The computerized Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT-C; Lejuez et al., 2003) is a psychological distress-inducing task. Numbers are presented sequentially on a computer screen and participants are asked to add the currently presented number to the previously presented number before the next number is presented. Participants select the answer using a computer mouse on a number pad displayed on the computer screen below the presented numbers. The speed of the number presentations is individually titrated in order to account for some individual differences in cognitive capacity, but not to secure equal performance among individuals. Incorrect or delayed responses are met with an aversive explosion sound. Accuracy (% correct and % omitted), mean inter-stimulus interval (ISI = ISImean - ISIbaseline), and latency to task termination (i.e., time until quit in seconds and minutes) will be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Change in task performance on the computerized Go/No-Go task</measure>
    <time_frame>Session 1 and Session 2 (approximately 3-5 days between Sessions 1 and 2)</time_frame>
    <description>During the computerized Go/No-Go task, participants view a serial stream of pictures and are instructed to continuously press a button on the computer keyboard, but inhibit responses when stimuli are presented consecutively. Accuracy (% correct non-occurrences/omissions) and mean response time will be recorded. This task will be used as a low demand cognitive task.</description>
