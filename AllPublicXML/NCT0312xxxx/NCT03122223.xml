      A phase 1/2a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of ALVAC-HIV (vCP2438)
      and of MF59®- or AS01B-adjuvanted clade C Env protein, in healthy, HIV-uninfected adult

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ALVAC-HIV
      and bivalent gp120 protein/MF59 or bivalent gp120 protein/AS01(B). This study will also
      compare HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell response rates at the Month 6.5 timepoint (2 weeks after the
      fourth vaccination) of ALVAC-HIV and bivalent gp120 protein/MF59 to each of the bivalent
      gp120 protein/AS01(B) vaccine regimens. Additionally, this study will compare HIV-specific
      Env-gp120 binding antibody response magnitudes at the Month 12 timepoint (6 months after the
      fourth vaccination) of ALVAC-HIV and bivalent gp120 protein/MF59 to each of the bivalent
      gp120 protein/AS01(B) vaccine regimens.

      The study will enroll 320 healthy, HIV-uninfected volunteers aged 18 to 40 years. Groups 1 to
      3 will consist of a total of 300 participants who will receive the vaccines at Months 0, 1,
      3, and 6, while 20 participants in Group 4 will receive placebos at Months 0, 1, 3, 6.

      Study visits will include a physical examination, an interview and/or questionnaire, HIV
      testing and HIV risk-reduction counseling, and urine and blood collection. Participants may
      optionally choose to provide rectal fluid, cervical fluid, semen, and/or stool samples.

             process includes but is not limited to:

               -  A process that would affect the immune response,

               -  A process that would require medication that affects the immune response,

               -  Any contraindication to repeated injections or blood draws,

               -  A condition that requires active medical intervention or monitoring to avert
                  grave danger to the volunteer's health or well-being during the study period,

               -  A condition or process for which signs or symptoms could be confused with
                  reactions to vaccine, or

               -  Any condition specifically listed among the exclusion criteria below.

          -  Any medical, psychiatric, occupational, or other condition that, in the judgment of
             the investigator, would interfere with, or serve as a contraindication to protocol
             adherence, assessment of safety or reactogenicity, or a volunteer's ability to give
             informed consent

          -  Psychiatric condition that precludes compliance with the protocol. Specifically
             excluded are persons with psychoses within the past 3 years, ongoing risk for suicide,

             Expert Panel report). Exclude a volunteer who:

               -  Uses a short-acting rescue inhaler (typically a beta 2 agonist) daily, or

               -  Uses moderate/high dose inhaled corticosteroids, or

          -  In the past year has either of the following:

               -  Greater than 1 exacerbation of symptoms treated with oral/parenteral
                  corticosteroids;

               -  Needed emergency care, urgent care, hospitalization, or intubation for asthma.

          -  Diabetes mellitus type 1 or type 2. (Not excluded: type 2 cases controlled with diet

          -  Hypertension:

               -  If a person has been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension during
                  screening or previously, exclude for blood pressure that is not well controlled.
                  Well-controlled blood pressure is defined as consistently less than or equal to
                  140 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic, with or without
                  medication, with only isolated, brief instances of higher readings, which must be
                  less than or equal to 150 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 100 mm Hg
                  diastolic. For these volunteers, blood pressure must be less than or equal to 140
                  mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic at enrollment.

               -  If a person has NOT been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension
                  during screening or previously, exclude for systolic blood pressure greater than
                  or equal to 150 mm Hg at enrollment or diastolic blood pressure greater than or
                  equal to 100 mm Hg at enrollment.

          -  Malignancy (Not excluded from participation: Volunteer who has had malignancy excised
             surgically and who, in the investigator's estimation, has a reasonable assurance of
             sustained cure, or who is unlikely to experience recurrence of malignancy during the
             period of the study)

          -  Seizure disorder: History of seizure(s) within past 3 years. Also exclude if volunteer
             has used medications in order to prevent or treat seizure(s) at any time within the
             past 3 years.

          -  Asplenia: any condition resulting in the absence of a functional spleen
