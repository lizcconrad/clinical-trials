  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients referred to radiotherapy treatment of primary or secondary malignant
      involvement of the lung parenchyma, who are not meeting the exclusion criteria, will be
      introduced to the study and suggested to participate in it by the radiotherapist, Dr
      Viacheslav Soyfer, M.D. from the Institute of Radiotherapy Tel Aviv (Sourasky) Medical
      Center.

      They will sign an informed consent and the study will be conducted based on the agreement of
      the institutional ethical committee, prior to perfusion study.

      Each patient will be evaluated three times: prior to treatment, a baseline evaluation
      mid-follow-up period 6 weeks post initiation of radiotherapy and a delayed follow up 6 months
      post treatment. Each SPECT/ Low dose CT assessment will take place within two weeks of the
      clinical and PFT assessment.

      The study will take place within a duration of two years, from recruiting the participating
      patients to the completion of the study protocol by the last recruited patient. For the
      individual patient, the duration of participation is six months.

      Perfusion SPECT/ Low dose CT studies with a non-diagnostic low dose chest CT will be
      performed after the I.V. injection of 4 mCi 99m-Tc-MAA. SPECT/ Low dose CT scan will be
      acquired immediately post injection on a GE OPTIMA NM/CT 640 camera. In order to obtain a
      better definition of the irradiated fields, we will co-register the SPECT/ Low dose CT with
      high-resolution CT provided from the Institute of Radiotherapy. In this procedure, the low
      dose chest CT is used as a bridge between high resolution CT and the functional imaging
      SPECT. Using the Q.Lung segmentation tool, individual whole lung function and lung subunits
      will be assessed, and will be correlated to irradiated fields. Calculated data for each study
      step will be compared in order to assess the extent of RT induced lung injury.
