  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been calls from patients, payers, healthcare providers, and policy makers for an
      evaluation of newer, high-cost radiation technologies compared to conventional forms of
      radiation therapy. National attention has focused on the use of intensity modulated radiation
      therapy (IMRT) into routine daily clinical practice for prostate cancer. The goal of the
      present study is to determine whether the type of radiation treatment received by the
      patients can result in a reduction in patient-relevant side effects following prostate
      irradiation. The analysis will be performed by obtaining patient answered surveys looking at
      side effects.

    <description>Investigators will use an anonymous survey and results from multiple focus groups to quantify the relative importance/significance of commonly encountered side effects experienced by patients following external beam radiation therapy. We will complete descriptive statistics as a means of understanding the data obtained by survey responses. Additionally, comparative analyses may be undertaken to evaluate differences between different side effects experienced.</description>
