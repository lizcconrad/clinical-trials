    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying blood and tumor tissue from patients with advanced non-small
      cell lung cancer who are treated with nivolumab to better understand how nivolumab works.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to
      grow and spread by turning on the immune system (T cells). We want to study the effects of
      nivolumab on the immune system (T cells) by collecting blood samples and samples from
      patients' tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study the sustained proliferation of programmed cell death protein (PD)-1+Ki-67+cluster
      of differentiation (CD)8 T cells as a predictive biomarker of response to nivolumab by
      comparing the response rates to nivolumab treatment between two groups of patients (positive
      vs negative) stratified by the status of PD-1+Ki-67+CD8 T cells.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Characterize phenotype of proliferating T cells in peripheral blood in the setting of
      nivolumab therapy.

      II. Perform gene expression profiling of activated T cells from peripheral blood.

      III. Perform T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing of activated T cells from peripheral blood and
      tumor infiltrating T cells (TILs).

      IV. Assess pre-treatment biopsies and biopsies at the time of disease progression for tumor
      infiltrating lymphocytes.

      V. Determine progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every
      2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days and then
      every 3 months for up to 3 years.

             correctly

          -  At a minimum, subjects must agree to the use of two methods of contraception, with one
