  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of combination
      therapy with recombinant human growth hormone (rHGH) and testosterone in adult male patients
      with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) over 24 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label study of daily human growth hormone (Genotropin®, 5.0
      μg/kg via subcutaneous injection) and testosterone (testosterone enanthate, 140mg via
      intramuscular injection every two weeks) for 24 weeks in men with FSHD with a 12 week washout
      period. A total of 20 subjects will be enrolled at the University of Rochester Medical Center
      in Rochester, NY.
