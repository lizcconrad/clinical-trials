    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, randomized (1:1 ratio) clinical trial for non-male factor
      infertility in advanced maternal age with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection(ICSI).
      Qualified 1422 patients are randomized into either of two groups: group A will undergo
      conventional in-vitro fertilization(IVF)(711 cases), Group B will undergo intracytoplasmic
      sperm injection (ICSI) (711 cases). All participants will receive the same protocol for
      ovarian stimulation and standardized luteal phase support.

      The target population will be patients with non-male factor infertility aged ≥38years with
      FSH ≤15. Women with other reasons of infertility (eg. anovulation, endometriosis, and
      premature ovarian failure) are excluded.

      The randomization will take place before controlled ovarian stimulation by a computer
      randomization system. The accumulated live birth rate , pregnancy complications will be
      followed up by checking medical records and telephone calls.
