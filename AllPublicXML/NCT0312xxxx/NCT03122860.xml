  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 study is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group study of four
      concentrations of SM04690 (0.03, 0.07, 0.15, and 0.23 mg per 2 mL injection) injected
      intraarticularly (IA) into the target knee joint of subjects with moderately to severely
      symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA). Based on previous studies of SM04690, key phenotypes of
      laterality (unilateral vs bilateral) as well as chronic pain (as measured by the Widespread
      Pain Index) were identified as confounding variables impacting the overall assessment of both
      radiologic and clinical efficacy outcomes. The design of SM04690-OA-04 is based upon previous
      study designs while assessing strategies to combat the confounding impact of laterality and
      chronic pain. To evaluate the effect of IA vehicle injection on patient-reported outcomes
      (PRO) such as pain, stiffness, and function in OA, this study will also include two placebo
      cohorts-one cohort that receives a 2 mL IA injection of vehicle, and one cohort that receives
      a sham injection (i.e., a needle stick with 0 mL vehicle injected).
