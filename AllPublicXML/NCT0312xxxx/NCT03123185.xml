      Investigation of safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single rising
      doses of BI 705564 and of the food effect on BI 705564 in healthy male subjects
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the single rising dose part under fasting and under fed conditions
      is to investigate safety and tolerability of BI 705564 in healthy male subjects following
      oral administration of single rising doses.

      Secondary objectives are the exploration of pharmacokinetics (PK) including dose
      proportionality, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of BI 705564 after single rising doses.

      The objective of the food effect part is to explore the relative bioavailability of BI 705564
      tablets under fed and fasted conditions following the oral administration of single doses.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood Pressure
             [BP], Pulse Rate [PR]), 12 lead Electrocardiogram [ECG], and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 50 years (incl.)

          -  Body Mass Index [BMI] of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with Good Clinical Practice [GCP] and local legislation

        Exclusion Criteria:

        -- Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood Pressure [BP], Pulse Rate [PR]

          -  Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day)

             at screening

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a
             condition that would not allow safe participation in the study

        In addition, the following trial-specific exclusion criteria apply:

          -  Male subjects with women of childbearing potential [WOCBP] partner who are unwilling
             to use male contraception (condom or sexual abstinence) from the first administration

          -  Repeated absolute B cell (CD19+) counts below 40/μL at screening
