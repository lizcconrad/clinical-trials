  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional bowel disorder of the gastrointestinal
      tract affecting up to 20 percent of the adolescent and adult populations (1). It is
      characterised by abdominal pain, irregular bowel habits, altered stool consistencies and
      bloating (2), and is associated with impaired quality of life. IBS can be categorised into
      diarrhoea predominant type (IBS-D), constipation predominant type (IBS-C), and mixed type
      (IBS-M). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) defined as infusion of feces from healthy
      donors to affected subjects has shown impressive results with high cure rates in patients
      with recurrent clostridium difficile infections (10). In a small retrospective study using
      FMT to treat 13 IBS patients, 70% of patients had symptomatic improvement particularly those
      with abdominal pain, dyspepsia, bloating and flatus. Nearly half of the patients achieved
      improvement in overall well-being. The investigators propose a randomised, placebo-controlled
      trial of FMT in patients with IBS. The investigators will assess the fecal and mucosal
      microbiota before and after FMT. Patients will be randomized to either FMT or placebo over a
      12 weeks period.

      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional bowel disorder of the gastrointestinal
      tract affecting up to 20 percent of the adolescent and adult populations (1). It is
      characterised by abdominal pain, irregular bowel habits, altered stool consistencies and
      bloating (2), and is associated with impaired quality of life. IBS can be categorised into
      diarrhoea predominant type (IBS-D), constipation predominant type (IBS-C), and mixed type
      (IBS-M). Until recently, the development of an effective therapy for this condition has been
      hampered by a poor understanding of the etiology of the disease. Traditionally the underlying
      pathogenesis of IBS has been centered on the brain-gut axis whereby stress and psychological
      conditions alter the perception of IBS symptoms. Emerging evidence however supports the
      observation that at least in a subgroup of patients with IBS, peripheral mechanisms within
      the intestine including low grade mucosal inflammation, abnormal immune activation and
      altered visceral sensitivity may be the main drivers of the manifestations in IBS (3).

      Accumulating data suggest that the intestinal microbiota play an important role in the
      pathophysiology of IBS (4;5). This is derived from early observation that post-infectious IBS
      developed in a subgroup of patients following a bout of gastroenteritis (6;7). Several
      studies have shown that the fecal microbiota was altered in IBS (4) and IBS symptoms can be
      improved by therapeutic interventions that target the microbiota including antibiotics,
      probiotics and prebiotics (8). Rifaximin, an oral, non-systemic broad spectrum antibiotics
      has also been shown to provide significant relief in IBS symptoms in a randomized controlled
      trial (9).

      Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) defined as infusion of feces from healthy donors to
      affected subjects has shown impressive results with high cure rates in patients with
      recurrent clostridium difficile infections (10). In a small retrospective study using FMT to
      treat 13 IBS patients, 70% of patients had symptomatic improvement particularly those with
      abdominal pain, dyspepsia, bloating and flatus. Nearly half of the patients achieved
      improvement in overall well-being. This study showed encouraging results and call for a
      prospective randomized study to further evaluate the role of FMT in IBS (11;12). Furthermore,
      the mechanism of FMT in IBS is not completely clear, and limited data are available on the
      effects of FMT on the microbiota post FMT. The experimental tools required for in depth
      analysis of the intestinal microbiota are now becoming available.

      The investigators propose a randomised, placebo-controlled trial of FMT in patients with IBS.
      The investigators will assess the fecal and mucosal microbiota before and after FMT.

    <description>Patients need to rate 1) worst abdominal pain and 2)stool consistency everyday for 12 weeks after FMT. The proportion of composite responder over the 12 weeks will be assessed. A patient will be defined as a study composite responder if he or she meets the daily composite response criteria for at least 50% of days with diary entry during the interval from Weeks 1-12. A composite response must meet both of the following criteria on a given day:
Pain response: worst abdominal pain scores in the past 24 hours &lt;3, and;
Stool consistency response: Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) score &lt;5 or the absence of a bowel movement if accompanied by worst abdominal pain scores &lt;3
To be an eligible responder, a patient must have a minimum of 60 days (i.e. &gt;70%) of diary entries over the interval from Weeks 1-12 (Total 84 days). Any patient with fewer than 60 days of diary entry will be considered a non-responder.</description>
