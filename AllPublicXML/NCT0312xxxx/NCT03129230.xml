    <textblock>
      This study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of free nonvascularized fibula autograft
      in the treatment of the femoral neck tumor-like lesions before epiphyseal closure in
      pediatric patients, by presenting the clinic-radiological outcome and complications.

    <description>Sixteen pediatric patients before epiphyseal closure were treated with free nonvascularized fibula autograft after resections of tumor-like lesions in the femoral neck between Aug. 2012 and Sep. 2016. All the patients were given supplementary skeletal traction through supracondyle of femur for 4 weeks to 6 weeks after the resections.</description>
