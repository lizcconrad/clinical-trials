  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Controversy surrounds the use of regional cerebral oximetry (rSO2) as a measure of true
      cerebral oxygenation because of extracranial signal contamination and unmeasured confounding
      of cerebral a:v ratio. The measurement of brain tissue oxygen (PbrO2) has been used in
      routine neurosurgery and has been shown to reliably demonstrate cerebral hypoxia following
      severe head injury. It is the most direct measure of cerebral oxygenation. Here, we test the
      hypothesis that there is a correlation between PbrO2 and rSO2 under conditions of varying
      inspired oxygen fraction and the varying partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood
      in uninjured, normal human brain.

      Patients who are scheduled for elective removal of secondary cerebral metastases under
      general anesthesia will be recruited following written informed consent obtained by a study
      team member during their preoperative evaluation. BIS and rSO2 optodes will be applied,
      before induction of anesthesia, by a single researcher on both sides of the patient's
      forehead, as recommended by the manufacturer. General anesthesia will be maintained by total
      intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with a combination of propofol (80-150 mcg/kg/min) and
      remifentanil (0.05-0.1 mcg/kg/min) targeted to a Bispectral Index range 40-60 (BIS; Covidien,
      Boulder, CO). Following craniotomy, the LICOX probe will be placed under direct vision into
      an area of normal brain within the tumor excision canal by the attending neurosurgeon. During
      a pause in surgery FIO2 and minute ventilation will be sequentially adjusted to achieve the
      following pairs of ventilation set points: 1) FIO2 0.3 and paCO2 30mmHg, 2) FIO2 1.0 and
      paCO2 40mmHg. After â‰¥5 minutes at each set point FIO2, PaCO2, rSO2 and PbrO2 will be recorded
      as a &quot;snap-shot&quot;.

      A sample size of 15 achieves an 80% power with a one-sided type I error of 5% to detect a
      positive correlation of 0.6 (from the null hypothesis of no correlation) between changes in
      PbrO2 and changes in rSO2 subsequent on alterations made in ventilation strategy. Correlation
      will be measured using Pearson's Correlation. P values &lt; 0.05 will be considered
      statistically significant.
