  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 open-label pharmacodynamics study in healthy adults. The purpose of the
      study is to determine if the tablet formulation size of VXA-A1.1, an adjuvanted adenoviral
      based influenza vaccine, has an impact on delivery location. The secondary objective is to
      evaluate delivery with fasting versus fed status.

      This is a pharmacodynamics study in healthy adult males. The purpose of the study is to
      determine if the tablet formulation size of VXA-A1.1, an adjuvanted adenoviral based
      influenza vaccine, impacts the location and time of initial and complete disintegration of
      the drug product. The secondary objective is to evaluate delivery with fasting versus fed
      status.
