  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroparesis (GP) is describing a condition when stomach does not empty as fast as it
      should. This fact creates the situation, when food stays in the stomach for a long time and
      it causes symptoms of nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, bloating, inability to finish
      normal size meal and abdominal pain. There are not many drugs available to treat this
      condition and majority of gastroparetic patients are not responding well to them after they
      are on it for some time. Many investigators are able to implant Gastric Stimulator System
      (GES) under FDA approved status of Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) definition. In the
      last few years it became possible to add another surgical procedure, which is called
      pyloroplasty (making bigger opening on the end of stomach), may help even more as it is also
      increasing the rate of the emptying of the stomach. Therefore this study is proposing to
      evaluate if GES in combination with pyloroplasty is much better than pyloroplasty alone. For
      this reason, two of these procedures will be introduced surgically at the same time, but GES
      devices will not be turn ON in half of these participants for 3 months. After that time all
      subjects will have their devices turned ON. All subjects will be asked to evaluate their
      symptoms of gastroparesis and their quality of life during clinical visits, and investigators
      will conduct pathological analyses of tissue obtained during surgery.

      GES system (Enterra Therapy) involves surgical implantation of a pulse generator in the
      abdominal wall and 2 electrodes into the muscularis propria of the stomach. Well established
      procedure, called pyloroplasty, will be performed during the implantation of GES system,
      therefore all participants will have both surgeries done at the same time. Half of them will
      be randomized to keep GES ON after surgery, and other half will have GES turned OFF for 3
      months.

      Both groups will be followed for additional 3 more months. Study related questionnaires and
      diagnostic/ clinical tests will be obtained at all points of interest of this study.

    <masking>Double (Participant, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>Patient and clinical investigators are going to be blinded in regards to the status of GES (if it is ON or OFF) for 3 months after surgery. One non-clinical investigator is assigned to serve as un-blind person , who is going to generate a master list of participants by dividing them into two groups based on their etiologies (diabetic or idiopathic). All effort would be to include similar numbers of idiopathic and diabetic patients in each intervention group based on a block randomization method, allowing for GES to be turned ON at the surgery, or it will stay OFF for the 3 month during the blind portion of the study.</masking_description>

    <description>Gastric Electrical Stimulation (GES) system involves surgical implantation of a pulse generator in the abdominal wall and 2 electrodes into the muscularis propria of the stomach.
After surgery this group of GP patients will have their GES programed and system will be turned ON for 3 months during a double-blind phase of the study. This step will be followed with additional 3 months of active stimulation (GES System will be turned ON) as it is described in the protocol.Therefore all subjects in this arm will receive overall 6 months of intervention, which will be provided by the active stimulation of GES System (GES turned ON for 6 months).</description>
