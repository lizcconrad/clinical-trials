      This non-interventional study is planned with the aim of obtaining information about the
      results of the product use in real clinical practice by means of the evaluation of the
      patients' satisfaction.

      The study will be multicenter, non-interventional, prospective, cohort study in patients for
      whom their physicians have taken a decision about Angeliq Micro treatment, irrespectively of
      the fact of this study inclusion.

      The absence of a control group (patients who receive another menopausal hormonal therapy
      medication, or do not receive menopausal hormonal therapy at all) is based on high risk of
      bias (heterogeneity of exposure in case of comparison of low-dosed and ultralow-doses
      menopausal hormonal therapy regiments, or in case of comparison with a group of patients for
      whom the menopausal hormonal therapy is not indicated).
