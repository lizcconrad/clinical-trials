      To investigate the dynamic relationship between the intestinal microbiota and Inflammation in
      subjects with Parkinson's disease. The current study examines the differential microbiome of
      the gut in subjects with parkinsonism. The current study determines whether certain
      Parkinson's subtypes are prone to pro-inflammatory microbiomes. This study also explores
      whether the intestinal microbiome in post-appendectomy Parkinson's subjects is modified as
      appendix has a role in regulating intestinal microbiome. The current study will examine
      whether microbiome changes influence inflammatory markers in the blood.

    <description>Differences in microbiome abundance will be detected using a Kruskal-Wallis' test generating a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected P value (&lt;0.05 for significance). For the microbiome analysis, in silico community functional predictions will be performed using PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) and significant differences in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) ortholog (KO) abundances between groups will be identified (FDR-corrected P value &lt;0.05 for significance). Putative &quot;proinflammatory&quot; and &quot;anti-inflammatory&quot; bacteria taxa will be classified based on previous reports (and the references therein) (see Keshavarzian et al., 2015). Differences in inflammatory metabolite abundance will be detected using a Kruskal-Wallis' test generating a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected P value (0.05).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals with Parkinson's disease (including multiple system atrophy). Males and
             females are eligible for the study. Appendectomized cohort must have had their
             appendectomy at least 20 years before Parkinson's disease onset

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Body Mass Index greater than or equal to 35 or less than or equal to 18. 2. Vital
             signs outside of acceptable range at Screening Visit, i.e., blood pressure &gt;160/100,
             oral temperature &gt;100°F, pulse &gt;100.

             3. Use of any of the following drugs within the last 6 months:
