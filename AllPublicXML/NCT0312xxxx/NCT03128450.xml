    <textblock>
      This Pilot study will evaluate the safety and Efficacy of an investigational cell
      transplantation therapy, h-NSC, in patients with Parkinson's disease, through nasal drug
      delivery, a new delivery way. All patients will receive the therapy, which consists of human
      neural stem cells,

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      h-NSC is a cellular therapeutic consisting of human fetal neural stem cells (h-NSC). h-NSC
      injection will be delivered through nasal way for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

      The study will enroll 12 moderate to severe PD patients to be treated with the cell injection
      therapy at the same dose. The total therapy course will be four weeks，one dose for one week.
      The follow up will be two times within 24 weeks after finishing the treatment. The main
      objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the cell transplantation by
      this new delivery way.
