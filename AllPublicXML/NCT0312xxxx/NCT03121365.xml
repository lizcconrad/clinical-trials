    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of digital versus standard literacy promotion, as well as
      dialogic language behaviors and reading comprehension among infants when comparing the use of
      e-books to standard board books. Around half of the participants will receive standard board
      books at the 6, 9, and 12 month well visits, while the other half will receive digital
      e-books.

    <textblock>
      This study has three main objectives. The first is to test the effects of digital versus
      standard literacy promotion by way of a randomized controlled trial design. The second aim is
      to explore the reading behaviors and reading activities between parents and their infants
      when comparing the use of e-books to standard board books. The third aim is to identify
      themes regarding dialogical reading behaviors among parents participating in the video
      sub-study.

      Participants will be stratified by clinic site and randomized to receive literacy promotion
      using 1) standard early reader board books or 2) digital electronic early reader e-books. We
      will recruit and consent one hundred eligible parent-infant dyads, with the infant being
      between 5 and 7 months of age at enrollment.

      In this intervention, parent-infant dyads randomized to the digital arm will receive
      developmentally appropriate e-books. Those randomized to the standard arm will receive
      developmentally appropriate board books. Participants will receive either the e-book or board
      book at the time of their 6, 9 and 12 month well visits. In addition to the books,
      parent-infant dyads in both arms will be provided information on the importance of early
      parent-child reading activity by pediatric clinicians using the Reach Out and Read framework.
