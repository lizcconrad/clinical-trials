  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar punctures are implemented for the diagnosis of patients with hematologic symptoms as
      well as for the intrathecal chemotherapy injections. Post lumbar puncture headache is a
      common complication for patients and is characterized by the occurrence of a headache with an
      orthostatic component, with additional symptoms such as nausea. Some studies in neurology,
      anesthesia and gynecology have previously shown a decreased incidence for post lumbar
      puncture headache while using atraumatic needles as compared to standard needles. In this
      context, it is necessary to better document the incidence of post lumbar puncture headache
      with the use of atraumatic needles in hematologic patients.

      Lumbar punctures (LP) are implemented for the diagnosis of patients with hematologic symptoms
      as well as for the intrathecal chemotherapy injections. Post lumbar puncture headache (PLPH)
      is a common complication in around 30% of patients. PLPH is characterized by the occurrence
      of a headache with an orthostatic component within 12-72 hours after LP with additional
      symptoms such as nausea. Even if this phenomenon spontaneously resolves within 3 to 5 days,
      symptoms can immobilize the patient and can interfere with his daily activities. Technical
      procedures largely influence the incidence of PLPH. Indeed, some studies in neurology,
      anesthesia and gynecology have previously shown a decreased incidence for PLHP while using
      atraumatic needles as compared to standard needles. So far, few data are available for
      hematology. In this context, it is necessary to better document the incidence of PLPH with
      the use of atraumatic needles in hematologic patients.
