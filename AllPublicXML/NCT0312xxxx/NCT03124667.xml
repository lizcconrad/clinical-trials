  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this double-blinded, randomized controlled study is to compare CORTEX
      (Cognitive Regulation Training and Exercise), a multi-faceted, center- and home-delivered—
      general and exercise-specific—active and traditional computerized cognitive training (CT)
      program to an attention-control condition involving health and wellness informational videos.
      More specifically, the cognitive training group will emphasize dual-task abilities, working
      memory, and visual-spatial processing, as well as self-as-exerciser priming and
      self-certainty training. It is hypothesized that early intervention cognitive training will
      enhance use of self-regulatory strategies and self-efficacy and in turn, increase exercise
      adherence to and engagement in a 12-month aerobic and resistive exercise program at a local
      fitness facility. More positive improvements in cognitive and psychosocial functioning among
      participants in the CORTEX condition (relative to the Video Attention-Control condition,
      i.e., health educational videos), are also expected immediately following the cognitive
      training, and across time. Expectancies and knowledge of study purpose (blinding integrity)
      will also be measured and used to statistically adjust for any training differences.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Aim: To test the effectiveness of a 1-month CT (randomized group condition) on
      exercise self-regulation, a latent factor representing 12-Month exercise adherence &amp; program
      engagement (i.e., supervised &amp; unsupervised class participation rates,
      electronically-recorded visitations, Fitbit-derived step counts, &amp; self-reported leisure-time
      exercise), the investigators will use a structural equation model with robust maximum
      likelihood estimation. Exercise self-regulation will be regressed on group and known
      covariates (age, gender, education level, training compliance [percentage of completed
      sessions], and injury/illness). It is hypothesized that the CORTEX condition will show
      increased exercise self-regulation (and lower dropout, a categorical outcome variable, tested
      in a parallel model) compared to the Video Attention-Control condition.

      Secondary Aims: A generalized latent variable framework will be used to test the researchers'
      theorized model and exploratory questions to determine if the CT contributes to greater
      cognitive change and enhanced perceptions of memory strategy use, self-efficacy, and
      self-reported physical activity-specific planning and self-regulatory strategy-use; and in
      turn, greater exercise self-regulation/ lower dropout. To evaluate these questions, first and
      second-order latent change scores will be derived representing general &amp; exercise-specific
      cognitive functioning (reaction times and accuracy within training domains), self-efficacy
      and self-reported self-regulatory strategies, and will be added to the latent exercise
      self-regulation measurement model (and adjusted with known covariates, i.e., group, age,
      gender, education, compliance, injury/illness). Positive indirect effects of CT condition on
      12-month exercise self-regulation are expected through the change in theoretical
      constructs—dual task and memory performance, implicit attitudes, memory strategy-use,
      self-efficacy, exercise planning and physical activity-specific self-regulatory strategy-use.
      Researchers also predict that the CT program will demonstrate high feasibility/acceptability,
      as indicated by a thorough process evaluation.

    <description>Exercise self-regulation will be modeled within a latent variable framework. The change factor will be reflected by accumulated supervised and unsupervised class participation rates, total electronically-recorded visitations, averaged monthly Fitbit-derived step counts, and self-reported leisure-time exercise (via Godin Leisure-Time Questionnaire). Measures will be standardized as z-scores. The latent factor model will be adjusted for known covariates (age, gender, education level, training compliance [percentage of completed sessions] and injury/illness) when primary hypothesis of group effects is tested. There is always the possibility that attempts to analyze latent constructs will not converge as planned. In such a case, researchers will attempt to assess change across each behavioral outcome individually with a robust linear regression method, adjusting for multiple comparisons.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dual task functioning (change)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Four separate heterogeneous dual task transfer assessments will involve auditory and/or visual stimuli. The tasks will progress from a focus on response to singularly-presented stimuli to dual task trials involving equally-prioritized responses (accuracy and quickness) to combinations of colors-letters, pictures-arrows, sounds-voices, and animals-planets. The percentage of incorrect response trials, accuracy, and reaction time will be the outcome measures for each of these tasks. Dual-task percent cost will then be calculated by the following equation: (dual task reaction time - single task reaction time) /single reaction time) x 100. Cost scores will be included as latent factor indicators in a structural equation model testing change from baseline to 1-month follow-up (post-intervention). Measures will be standardized as z-scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Memory functioning (change)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Again, from a latent factor perspective, multiple measures will be used to assess the construct of memory functioning, which will reflect overall working memory, spatial and episodic memory. Assessments will be utilized from the iPad-delivered NIH Toolbox, as well computerized assessments developed in E-Prime (e.g., Sternberg). Latent factor memory functioning change from baseline to 1-month follow-up (post-intervention) will be represented by total percent correct for each assessment at each time point. Measures will be standardized as z-scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise self-efficacy (change)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Once again, from a latent factor perspective, multiple measures will be used to assess confidence that one can successfully walk longer distances (Self-Efficacy for Walking Scale), continue an exercise regimen (Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale), accumulate physical activity into one's life (Lifestyle Self-Efficacy Scale) and overcome barriers (Barriers Self-Efficacy Scale). An Exercise Self-Efficacy latent factor will be derived from equally-weighted latent factor indicators from each of the scales, and will be used to assess change in exercise-related efficacy beliefs from baseline to 1-month follow-up (post-intervention). Measures will be standardized as z-scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity self-regulatory strategy-use (change)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' perceived use of exercise-specific self-regulatory strategies will be assessed with the multi-dimensional 12-item Physical Activity Self-Regulation Scale. Each of the 12 items will serve as the latent factor indicators for baseline and 1-month follow-up (post-intervention).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise planning (change)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-item Exercise Planning and Scheduling Scale will be used to assess change in exercise-specific planning behaviors from baseline to 1-month follow-up (post-intervention).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Memory strategy-use (change)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Again, from a latent factor framework, multiple self-report scales assessing memory strategy-use (subscale of Metamemory Questionnaire), memory self-efficacy (10-item Memory Self-Efficacy Scale), behavioral self-control (13-item Brief Self-Control Scale), affective and cognitive self-control (10-item Volitional Components Inventory) will be used to derive a latent factor to assess change in perceived Memory Strategy-Use from baseline to 1-month follow-up (post-intervention). Measures will be standardized as z-scores.</description>
