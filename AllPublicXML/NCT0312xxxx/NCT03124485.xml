  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and its related metabolic disorders are increasingly a heavy health burden to many
      parts of the world. Weight control is a well-known important step in avoiding type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (T2DM). It is also an essential component for normalizing the blood glucose and
      preventing macrovascular and microvascular insults to patients with diagnosed T2DM. However,
      life-style modification, physical exercise and dietary adjustment are ineffective measures
      which are unlikely to confer adequate and sustainable weight loss for the truly obese. On the
      other hand, large scale long-term follow-up studies have confirmed the role of bariatric
      surgery in providing durable weight loss and remarkable improvement on medical comorbidities.
      Among all the bariatric operations, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is currently the
      most widely adopted procedure worldwide because of its simplicity and effectiveness in weight
      reduction. However, LSG is not without risk. Staple-line hemorrhage, leakage and stenosis are
      potentially life-threatening complications. LSG is also costly because of the need for
      expensive laparoscopic staplers.

      A new endoscopic bariatric therapy, namely endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG), has recently
      been proposed as a non-surgical procedure for the management of obesity with or without
      diabetes mellitus. Preliminary data based on single arm series or phase II studies have
      reported promising short and intermediate term weight control effect.

      However, whether ESG is a feasible option comparable to LSG in the intermediate term remains
      an unanswered question. In addition, physical and functional outcomes after ESG were not well
      documented in most of the reported series.

      Realizing there is a knowledge gap in applying ESG to patients with morbid obesity, we
      propose to study and compare the efficacy of weight control and functional outcomes of ESG
      against conventional LSG. Through this prospective randomized trial, the safety profiles,
      quality of life and changes in fasting and post-prandial gut hormone secretion after the two
      procedures will also be assessed and compared. The evidence thus generated shall lay a
      scientific foundation for ESG which may become an alternative choice for patients who have
      concerns about complication and irreversibility of most bariatric surgery.

    <intervention_model_description>This study protocol aims to test the hypothesis that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) IS NOT inferior to conventional laparoscopic surgical sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in terms of weight loss and improvement of glycemic control for Asian obese patients. It also investigates and compares the safety profile, improvement of co-morbidities, functional outcomes and changes in gut hormone profiles between the two bariatric procedures.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>A series of full thickness sutures done with Overstitch in the triangular stitch pattern as mentioned by Lopez-Nava[29] will be placed according to the APC markings. The suturing is initiated from the antrum distally and moved proximally towards the gastric fundus. A total of 6 to 8 plications are placed to reduce the gastric lumen. Five sham dressings would also be applied to patient's abdominal wall during the first week to minimize the bias in pain scoring.</description>

    <description>Sleeve gastrectomy is then performed using lapaorscopic linear staplers, starting from a point 5-6cm proximal to the pylorus up to the angle of His along the left side of the Mid-sleeve tube. Haemostasis of the staple line is secured by suture plication with the Mid-sleeve tube in situ to ensure no compromise of the gastric tube lumen. All the wounds are closed with staples after local anaesthetic infiltration and covered with non-transparent dressings.</description>
