  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol establishes a research oriented psychological treatment clinic within the
      Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology (GSAPP), called the Dialectical
      Behavior Therapy Rutgers University Research Program (DBT-RU). The overall aim of the
      proposed research is to find ways to improve therapist training in existing treatments for
      complex and difficult-to-treat problems (e.g., DBT, prolonged exposure), develop new and more
      effective treatments, and improve understanding of severe psychopathology. Consequently, this
      proposed research will have four branches: (1) training of research clinicians and evaluation
      of training methods; (2) training of clinical evaluators for the research studies and
      evaluation of assessment training methods; (3) assessment of treatment outcome, including
      assessment of mediators and moderators of change (both clinician and client data); (4)
      assessment and analyses of psychopathology of subject populations who participate in the
      DBT-RU.
