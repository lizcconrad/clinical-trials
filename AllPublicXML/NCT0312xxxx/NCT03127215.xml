  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluation of the efficacy of the combination of olaparib and trabectedin in adult patients
      with locally advanced/metastatic solid tumors that failed standard treatment and whose
      molecular sequencing tumor profiles show homologous recombination repair (HRR) defects. The
      primary objective is to show superior disease control rate in patients with HRR-deficient
      tumors treated with olaparib and trabectedin compared to treatment according to current
      guidelines (physician's choice). This trial aims to establish whether the PARP-dependency of
      HRR-deficient tumors across entities can be exploited for therapeutic benefit.
