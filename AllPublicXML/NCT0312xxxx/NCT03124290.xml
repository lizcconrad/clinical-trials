  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to investigate the effect of attention distractor on the quality of
      chest compression during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. For this, a simulated study with
      Manikin is performed and the paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT) is used for
      distracting performer's attention.
