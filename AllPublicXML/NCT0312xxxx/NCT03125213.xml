  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
      evaluating the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of AL-3778 in combination with
      Peg-IFN in subjects with Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive CHB virus infection who are
      treatment-naïve.

      The study will consist of a screening phase , a double-blind treatment phase followed by
      treatment with Peg-IFN alone, and a post-treatment follow-up phase.

      Approximately 30 subjects to complete the study. Eligible subjects will be randomized into 2
      treatment arms in a 2:1 ratio (active:placebo) to receive one of the following treatments:

        -  Arm A: Peg-IFN plus AL-3778 (N=20)

        -  Arm B: Peg-IFN plus matching placebo (N=10)
