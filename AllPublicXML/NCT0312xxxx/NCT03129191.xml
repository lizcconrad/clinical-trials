  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, a new non-invasive bone conduction hearing aid was introduced. The system is
      connected directly to the skin with an adhesive adapter to transmit the sound to the inner
      ear through bone vibrations. The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the
      audiological benefit of the new bone conduction hearing aid and compare it to an existing
      bone conduction hearing aid in normal hearing adults with bilateral simulated conductive
      hearing loss.

      An evaluation of the improvement on speech understanding in noise and sound localization
      allows to estimate the system performance and enables to derive recommendations for clinical
      usage of the novel hearing system. It is hypothesized that in the bilateral condition similar
      speech understanding in noise and sound localization performance can be achieved with the new
      system compared to existing bone conduction hearing aids that are pressed against the skull
      using a soft band.
