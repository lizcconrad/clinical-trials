      This study examines complications, mortality rates, cost-effectiveness and safety of early
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC). Group L
      (n:88) patients treated surgically with laparoscopic cholecystectomy immediately or Group D
      (n:88) patients first treated medically and than treated surgically with delayed (4-8 weeks
      later) laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

      There is only few knowledge about the comparison of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC)
      versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC) for the treatment of acute cholecystitis
      considering the surgeon's work experience. This study examines complications, mortality
      rates, cost-effectiveness and safety of DLC versus ELC. This prospective randomized clinical
      trial was performed between November 2015-2016 in our General Surgery Clinic. Patients
      suffering acute cholecystitis in their first 72 hours of pain were enrolled in one of the two
      study groups: Group L (n:88) patients treated surgically with laparoscopic cholecystectomy
      immediately or Group D (n:88) patients first treated medically and than treated surgically
      with delayed (4-8 weeks later) laparoscopic cholecystectomy. All operations and medical
      treatments were done by surgeons having work experience &lt;2 years.

    <description>First trocar was inserted with Hasson method (Subumbilical 1 cm vertical incision was made and first 10-mm trocar (VersaportTM plus V2, Covidien, USA) inserted under direct vision) and pneumoperitoneum was created with 12 mm Hg pressure. Second 10-mm trocar was inserted from subxyphoid area. Two 5-mm trocars were inserted in the right upper quadrant area. After general intrabdominal exploration, dissection was started to ensure safe-view of Calot triangle. In case of quite tough gallbladder for griping, gallbladder was drained with a gray intravenous cannula. Cystic artery and cystic duct were separately dissected and twice ligated with Endo Clip™ II ML (Covidien, USA). Gallbladder was dissected from liver bed carefully. Gallbladder was taken out from abdomen through the subumbilical incision.</description>
