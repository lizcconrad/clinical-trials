      All women with placenta accreta will be managed by upper segment cesarean section followed by
      cesarean hysterectomy without attempts of placental removal.

      Women were randomized to either bilateral internal iliac artery ligation before hysterectomy
      and after fetal extraction or no additional intervention

      All women with placenta accreta will be managed by upper segment cesarean section followed by
      cesarean hysterectomy without attempts of placental removal.

      Women were randomized to either bilateral internal iliac artery ligation before hysterectomy
      and after fetal extraction or no additional intervention.

      Midline incision in the all patients is preferred. The retroperitoneal space was entered at
      the level of common iliac bifurcation and followed to the point of division into the external
      and internal iliac arteries. The ureter was retracted medially by gentle finger dissection,
      revealing the retroperitoneal anatomy. The fat and loose connective tissue around the IIA and
      vein were removed and a right-angle clamp was passed beneath the IIA from the lateral to the
      medial side approximately 4 cm distal to its origin.

      Using an absorbable suture, the IIA was ligated doubly in all cases . Pulsations of the
      external iliac and femoral arteries were identified after internal iliac ligation. The
      procedure was then repeated on the other side.
