    <textblock>
      Remote patient monitoring is a potential component for the management of chronic conditions
      that may provide reliable and real-time physiological measurements for clinical decision
      support, alerting, and patient self-management. The purpose of this study is to evaluate an
      UHN-built remote monitoring system for patients with complex chronic conditions called Medly.

      Remote patient monitoring is a potential component for the management of chronic conditions
      that may provide reliable and real-time physiological measurements for clinical decision
      support, alerting, and patient self-management. The purpose of this study is to evaluate an
      UHN-built remote monitoring system for patients with complex chronic conditions called Medly.
      Patients with complex chronic conditions will be provided with a mobile phone and commercial
      home medical devices, such as a blood pressure monitor and weight scale. The measurements
      from the medical devices will be automatically sent to the mobile phone, and from there to a
      data server at the hospital for analysis and storage. Both clinicians and patients will be
      able to access these data and will be sent alerts by the system if the measurements are
      outside of the normal range. The system will be evaluated through interviews and comparing
      outcomes between the intervention and control groups.

    <description>The telemonitoring technology will enable patients with complex chronic illnesses, to take clinically relevant physiological measurements with wireless home medical devices and to answer symptom questions on the mobile phone. The measurements will be automatically and wirelessly transmitted to the mobile phone and then to a data server. Automated self-care instructions/messages will be sent to the patient based on the readings and reported symptoms. If there are signs of their status deteriorating, an alert will be sent to a clinician that is responsible for the particular chronic condition of concern. The clinicians will have all the relevant patient data sent to them and will be able to access (through a secure web portal) to view historical and trending data for their patients.</description>
