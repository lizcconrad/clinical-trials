  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to evaluate to what extent a glycocalyx damage measured in the ER in
      patients presenting with sepsis correlates with their clinical course and if it can be used
      as a clinical stratification tool and mortality predictor.

      The study will focus on the changes of the microcirculation and how they correlate with the
      macrocirculation, as well as microbiologic parameters. In the study will participate ca. 300
      patients with sepsis, as well as 30 patients without sepsis and 30 healthy individuals.
