  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to determine if tranexamic acid can help in
      reduction of blood and blood product loss before, during, and after surgery.

      Study Groups:

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, participant will be randomly assigned (as
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study
      group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. Participant will have an equal
      chance of being assigned to either group.

      During surgery, one group will receive the study drug by vein and the other group will not.

      The study staff and surgeons will know if participant is receiving the study drug or not.

      Surgery:

      Participant will have participant's surgery as planned. Participant will sign a separate
      consent for the surgery that explains the procedure and the risks.

      Medical Information Collection:

      Researchers will collect information from participant's medical record before, during, and
      after the surgery for this study.

      Blood Draws:

      Blood (about 2-4 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for routine tests 1 time daily for the 7
      days directly after surgery.

      Length of Study Participation:

      Participation on the study will be over after participant's routine blood draw 7 days after
      surgery.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 80 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
