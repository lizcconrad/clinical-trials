  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of TAK-659 measured by independent
      radiologic review committee (IRC)-assessed overall response rate (ORR) in participants with
      relapsed or refractory DLBCL.

      The drug being tested is TAK-659. This study will look at the OR in participants with
      relapsed or refractory DLBCL who take TAK-659.

      The study will enroll approximately 122 participants. Participants will be assigned to:

      • TAK-659 60 mg to 100 mg

      All participants will be asked to take the tablets of TAK-659 at the same time each day
      throughout the study in 28-day cycle.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy,
      France, Canada, Germany. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 48
      months. Participants will be assessed for disease response and progression during the PFS
      follow-up of every 3 months after end of treatment (for participants who discontinue due to
      reasons other than disease progression) and OS follow-up of every 3 months from the last dose
      of study drug until death or conclusion of the study, whichever occurs first.

          3. Relapsed or refractory to greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 2 prior lines of chemotherapy
             based on standard of care with certain requirements for prior therapy.

          4. Documented investigator-assessed relapse or progression after the last treatment is
             required if the participant responded and then progressed on the prior treatment.

          5. Measurable disease per IWG 2007 criteria.

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than (&lt;) 2.

               2. Hepatic: total bilirubin less than or equal to (&lt;=) 1.5 times the upper limit of

                       of pancreatitis or cholecystitis.

                    -  Blood pressure &lt;=Grade 1 (hypertensive participants are permitted if their
                       blood pressure is controlled to &lt;=Grade 1 by hypertensive medications.

                    -  Glycosylated hemoglobin is &lt;=6.5% hyperglycemic participants permitted if
                       glucose is well controlled by hypoglycemic medication).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma; active brain or leptomeningeal metastases.

          2. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related malignancy.

          3. Systemic anticancer treatment (including investigational agents) less than 3 weeks
             before the first dose of study treatment (&lt;=4 weeks for antibody-based therapy
             including unconjugated antibody, antibody-drug conjugate, and bi-specific T-cell

          6. Prior autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) within 6 months or prior ASCT at any time
             without full hematopoietic recovery before Cycle 1 Day 1, or allogeneic stem cell
             transplant any time.

          7. Participants with certain cardiovascular conditions are excluded.

          8. Major surgery within 14 days before the first dose of study drug or incomplete
             recovery from any complications from surgery.

          9. Systemic infection requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy or other serious infection
             (bacterial, fungal, or viral) within 21 days before the first dose of study drug.

         10. Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids for anticancer purposes within 7 days before
             the first dose of TAK-659.

         11. Participants with another malignancy within 2 years of study start. Participants with
             nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type are not excluded if they have
             undergone complete resection and are considered disease-free at the time of study
             entry.

         12. Known gastrointestinal (GI) disease or GI procedure that could interfere with the oral
             absorption or tolerance of TAK-659.

         13. Received medications, supplements, or food/beverages that are P-glycoprotein (P-gp)
             inhibitors or inducers or strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitors or inducers
             within a certain timeframe prior to the first dose of study drug. Depending on the
             substance, the washout period for P-gp inhibitors or inducers or strong CYP3A
             inhibitors or inducers will be either 7 days or 5 times the half-life (half-life is
             related to the time required for elimination from the body). The washout period for
             grapefruit containing food or beverages is 5 days.
