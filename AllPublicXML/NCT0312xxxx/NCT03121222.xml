  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the present study was to investigate whether N-acetylcysteine
      supplementation in individuals with low glutathione levels would confer ergogenic effects by
      replenishing glutathione levels and by reducing oxidative stress. Towards this aim,
      investigators sought to exploit the large inter-individual variability in redox biomarker
      levels. More specifically, investigators screened 100 male participants for glutathione
      baseline levels in blood and formed three stratified groups according to this value (i.e.,
      low, moderate and high; 12 individuals per group). After by-passing the regression to the
      mean artefact by performing a second glutathione measurement in the three aforementioned
      groups, investigators assessed both aerobic and anaerobic physical performance in order to
      acquire a more comprehensive view about the ergogenic effectiveness of the antioxidant
      treatment. This was accomplished by implementing three different whole-body physical
      performance tests (i.e., VO2max test, time trial and Wingate), as opposed to most in vivo
      studies that either applied isolated body-part exercise tests (e.g., by isokinetic
      dynamometry) or performed a single exercise test (e.g., time-to-fatigue test). It was
      hypothesised, that data of the present investigation will bridge the chasm between the
      scientific (i.e., chronic antioxidant supplementation blunts exercise performance and
      adaptations) and the community-based (i.e., free radicals should anyway be counteracted by
      &quot;protective&quot; exogenous antioxidants) truths about the role of antioxidants as ergogenic aids.
      It was also hypothesised that the results will show that low glutathione levels are linked to
      decreased aerobic and anaerobic physical performance accompanied by increased levels of
      oxidative stress and that N-acetylcysteine supplementation will restore both performance and
      redox homeostasis. Based on the findings of the present investigation, the widespread routine
      practice of consuming antioxidants during exercise training could be changed and the
      consumption of antioxidants would be restricted only for those who are deficient in
      glutathione.

    <time_frame>64 days</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal oxygen consumption was assessed (using incremental cycling test to volitional exhaustion) on cycle ergometers (Monark, Vansbro, Sweden). Briefly, after a 5-min warm-up period at 100W, workload increased by 50W every 2.5 minutes until heart rate reached 160 bpm. Then, workload increased by 25W every 2.5 minutes until exhaustion. Respiratory gas variables were measured using a metabolic cart (Quark b2, Cosmed, Italy), which was calibrated before each test using standard gases of known concentration.
Maximal oxygen consumption along with time trial and wingate test were used for assessing both aerobic and anaerobic physical performance in order to acquire a more comprehensive view about the ergogenic effectiveness of the antioxidant treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of glutathione levels (μmol/g Hb)</measure>
    <time_frame>64 days</time_frame>
    <description>Erythrocyte GSH was determined spectrophotometrically. 20 μL of erythrocyte lysate treated with 5% TCA mixed with 660 μL of67 mMsodium potassium phosphate (pH 8.0) and 330 μL of 1mM 5,5- dithiobis-2 nitrobenzoate. The samples were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 45 min, and the absorbance was read at 412 nm.
The measurement of glutathione was used for assessing the efficacy of NAC supplementation to restore glutathione levels in the low-glutathione group as well as the effects of NAC supplementation in the medium and high glutathione groups.</description>

             3 times per week.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects were excluded from the study, if they reported any musculoskeletal injury
             that would limit their ability to perform the exercise sessions. Participants were
             asked to recall whether they had participated in regular resistance or aerobic
             training or in unaccustomed exercise during the period before the study entry.
             Individuals who reported such activities were precluded from the study. Smoking and
             consumption of antioxidant supplements the days prior to the study were additional
             exclusion criteria.
