    <textblock>
      The effect of small-sided team sport training and protein intake on muscle mass, physical
      function, and adaptations important for health in untrained older adults was examined.
      Forty-eight untrained older (72±6 years) men and women were divided into either a team sport
      group ingesting a drink high in protein (18 g) immediately and 3 h after each training
      session (TS-HP, n=13), a team sport group ingesting an isocaloric drink with low protein
      content (3 g; TS-LP, n=18), and a control group continuing their normal activities (CON,
      n=17).
