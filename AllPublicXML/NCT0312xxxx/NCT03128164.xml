  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label study of HMPL-689 administered orally to patients with lymphoma
      for whom failed of standard care or have no standard of care.This study will consist of a
      dose escalation stage (Stage I) and a dose expansion stage (Stage II).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both Stage I and Stage II include the following periods: screening period, treatment period,
      safety follow-up period, and extended progression free survival (PFS) follow-up period, as
      defined in Dose Escalation Stage (Stage I). Dose escalation will be performed according to a
      modified toxicity probability interval scheme-2 (mTPI-2).To further characterize safety and
      efficacy of HMPL-689 at RP2D, expansion stage of the study will enroll 56 patients with B
      cell lymphoma, including CLL, SLL, FL, MZL, WM, DLBCL, burkitt lymphoma and MCL. Patients
      will be treated with RP2D as starting dose.
