    <intervention_name>clinical examination in neurology</intervention_name>
    <description>This examination is based on the movement of the child in a standing position (forward and backward on a straight line, jumping on a foot ...), seated (visual continuation ...) and elongated (tone, patellar and achillian reflexes, superficial sensitivity ...) . This makes it possible to evaluate all the neurological systems.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All participants :

          -  Informed consent of the child and both parents obtained

          -  Affiliated to Social Security

          -  Participants must be between 6 and 16 years of age.

        Child with high intellectual potential :

          -  Score â‰¥ 130 on an intellectual efficiency scale administered by a psychologist

        Control child :

          -  They will have to be intellectually efficient in the standard. To ensure this, the two
             sub-tests of the Intellectual Efficiency Scale (WISC-V) most closely correlated with
             intelligence (Vocabulary and Matrices) will be administered to them. Thus, the child
             must meet one of the following criteria in order to be included:

          -  Have two standard notes between -1 and +1 DS (between 7 and 13);

          -  Have one of its two notes between -1 and + 1DS (between 7 and 13) and the other
             between -2DS and &lt;+ 2DS (between 5 and 15).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        All participants :

          -  Neurological history (epilepsy, cranial trauma, prematurity ...)

          -  Psychiatric history (Autistic Spectrum Disorder ...),

          -  Known genetic disease,

          -  Motor deficiency (eg hemiplegia),

          -  Elementary sensory disorder (auditory and visual) or insufficient command of French,
             limiting the understanding and participation in the study likely to impact the results
             to the protocol.

          -  Gnosic visual or linguistic deficiency.

          -  Sensory disorder

          -  Psychotropic Intake

        Control child :

          -  High intellectual potential

          -  Known or suspected learning disability (no dyslexia-dysorthography, dysphasia,
             dyspraxia, dyscalculia).
