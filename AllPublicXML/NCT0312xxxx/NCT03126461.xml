        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic diagnosis of metastatic melanoma.

          -  Any number of prior systemic therapeutic regimens including chemotherapy, pathway
             inhibitors, biochemotherapy, investigational agents, and immunotherapies other than
             ipilimumab, nivolumab or other CTLA-4, PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease in at least 2 non-radiated sites as defined by
             RECIST v1.1. All sites must be evaluated within 4 weeks prior to registration.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Eligible for SABR to 1-5 sites of disease (Refer to 3.2.10)

          -  Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  leukocytes ≥ 1,000/mcL

               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mcL

               -  platelets ≥ 75,000/mcl

               -  total bilirubin &lt; 2.5X institutional upper limit of normal or

                    -  3 in subjects with Gilbert's Syndrome

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SPGT) ≤ 4 X institutional upper limit of normal

               -  creatinine &lt; 4X institutional upper limit of normal

               -  hemoglobin &gt;7g/dL

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.

             the duration of protocol treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately. A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual

          -  No concomitant therapy with any of the following: IL2, interferon, or other non-study
             immunotherapy regimens; cytotoxic chemotherapy; immunosuppressive agents; or other

             patient has been disease-free for less than 2 years, with the exception of adequately
             treated (Surgery or radiation) and cured basal or squamous cell skin cancer,

             adenocarcinoma of the cervix.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Patients must not be pregnant or nursing.

          -  Patients are excluded if they have a history of prior treatment with ipilimumab,
             CTLA-4 inhibitor or agonist, nivolumab, PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor.

          -  Subjects who have had major surgery within 2 weeks prior to first dose of drug

          -  Subjects who have had radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to first dose of drug

          -  Uncontrolled adrenal insufficiency or active chronic liver disease

          -  Any history of CNS metastases that is not adequately treated (surgery or radiation )
             &gt;14 days prior to registration.

          -  Any active known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with vitiligo, type I
             diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring
             hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not
             expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll.

          -  Any condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily
             prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days prior to
             the first dose of study drug. Inhaled steroids and adrenal replacement steroid doses
             up to 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent are permitted (although not encouraged) in the
             absence of active autoimmune disease.
