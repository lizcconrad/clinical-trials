  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the trial is to study how a synbiotic treatment will affect weight loss and
      management in individuals enrolled in weight loss diet Profile速. The investigators propose to
      follow up 2 cohorts of Profile速 subjects during 6 months. One group will receive a synbiotic
      treatment supplement (Bifidobacterium spp plus bimuno- galacto-oligosaccharides (B-GOS))
      while the other group will receive placebo capsules. Anthropomorphic and metabolic analysis
      will be performed by-monthly. Fecal samples will be obtained before and after the dietary
      intervention and samples will be sequenced trough next generation DNA sequencing to analyze
      the gut microbiota. Because dietary interventions with high protein and low glycemic index
      have been shown to be effective in reducing weight, but has also been linked to potential
      colon harm due to increased fermentation of undigested protein on the colon, the
      investigators expect supplementation of Profile速 with a synbiotic product will lead to an
      increased overall wellbeing without compromising weight management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to recruit 40 new Profile速 members and to randomly divide them into
      2 groups; Group A will follow the conventional coaching and diet plan, while group B will
      also receive a daily dose of the synbiotic treatment (group A will receive a placebo
      supplement similar in appearance and caloric content to the synbiotic treatment). Volunteers
      will be followed for 6 months, and weight loss, waist circumference, BMI and glucose and
      cholesterol levels will be assessed monthly. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) will be
      used to analyze body composition at the beginning and end of the dietary interventions. Fecal
      samples will be obtained at the beginning and the end of the study. Because both our pre- and
      probiotic supplements have been reported to increase the concentration of satiating
      bacteria-derived metabolites, we expect that the individuals on the group B (synbiotic
      supplement) will experience a higher weight loss as well as more significant drops in glucose
      and cholesterol levels. Because synbiotic treatments have been reported to facilitate GI
      passage, the investigators expect volunteers in group B will also report improved bowels
      movements and general wellbeing.
