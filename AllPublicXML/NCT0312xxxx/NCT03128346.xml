  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The TTP block is a novel regional anesthetic technique that shows promise in providing
      analgesia for anterior chest wall incisions and median sternotomy. The investigators hope to
      show that by providing the TTP block, there will be reduced early postoperative pain, reduced
      sedation and shallow breathing, reduced time on breathing machine, leading to an increase in
      patient comfort and satisfaction. The investigators also hope the decreased need for pain
      medication and reduced time on the breathing machine will translate into decreased nursing
      workload.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In February 2015, Ueshima et al published an article regarding ultrasound guided transversus
      thoracic muscle plane (TTP) block for breast cancer resection. In this article, he showed
      that branches of the intercostal nerves (Th2-6) dominate the region of the internal mammary
      area. By administering local anesthetics between the internal intercostal and transversus
      thoracic muscle, analgesia in the anterior chest and sternum can be obtained. A cadaveric
      study shows injectate spread from the second to fifth intercostal spaces with a single 15mL
      injection between the third and fourth ribs next to the sternum. They further published a
      case series of two patients who successfully underwent median sternotomy for aortic valve
      replacement and thymoma resection using only the TTP block for analgesia. Fast- track cardiac
      surgery is now widely practiced, and evidence for its safety and efficacy has spurred its
      adoption. With the increased demand for health care resources including nursing manpower and
      ICU beds, postoperative patients are returning to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit
      (CSICU) on shorter acting anesthetic agents so that they can be awakened, following commands
      and spontaneously ventilating earlier. The TTP block fits in well with the fast- track
      paradigm. By providing adequate analgesia for median sternotomy, the TTP block may reduce
      narcotic requirements and consequent sedation and respiratory depression, hypercapnia and
      respiratory acidosis, prolonged mechanical ventilation and need for emergency advanced airway
      interventions.

    <description>The investigator (RF or DV) will administer bilateral TTP block under dynamic ultrasound guidance with an echogenic needle using a total of 40mL of 0.5% ropivacaine (200mg), 20mL on each side. If the patient is less than 70kg, the total dose administered will be 40mL of 0.3% ropivacaine (150mg). The patient will not require sedation or analgesia for the performance of the block. The projected time for block completion is 20 minutes after appropriate patient positioning (supine) and exposure (upper chest). After block administration, the patient will be monitored for local anesthetics toxicity, hemodynamic instability, and allergic or unexpected adverse reactions for 20 minutes. Standard intensive care monitors are sufficient.</description>
