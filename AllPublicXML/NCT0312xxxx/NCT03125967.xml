  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of daily morning exposure to
      colored light in patients receiving acute inpatient rehabilitation services for stroke,
      traumatic brain injury, or non-traumatic brain injury with sleep disturbances such as poor
      nighttime sleep and/or excessive daytime sleepiness.In a two-arm randomized
      placebo-controlled study with pre-exposure and post-exposure assessments, we are comparing
      the effects of daily morning exposure to either blue light or red light on objective sleep
      quality, subjective sleep quality, functional rehabilitation outcomes, cognitive symptoms,
      fatigue, and neurological symptoms.
