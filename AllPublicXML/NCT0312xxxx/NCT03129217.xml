  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine whether maximal diaphragm thickening fraction measured by
      ultrasound during volitional maximal inspiratory efforts is a valid measure of diaphragm
      function in mechanically ventilated patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Classically, assessing diaphragm function requires direct measurements of transdaphragmatic
      pressure generation. A critical requirement for valid measurements is a maximal volitional
      patient effort. An alternative is to standardize the stimulus to the diaphragm using magnetic
      twitch stimulation fo the phrenic nerve. This is the gold standard technique for diaphragm
      function measurement in the respiratory physiology laboratory.

      Twitch measurements require technical expertise and expensive equipment; this technique is
      therefore basically limited to the laboratory. Bedside ultrasonography has been proposed as a
      method for measuring diaphragm function by assessing the thickening of the muscle during a
      maximal inspiratory effort. In order to achieve a maximal volitional effort in mechanically
      ventilated patients, several methods may be employed: coached maximal efforts, coached
      sniffing, and transient airway occlusion to stimulate respiratory drive (Marini maneuver).

      The investigators are evaluating the validity of diaphragm functional assessment using
      bedside ultrasound in combination with coached efforts/sniffing/Marini maneuver against the
      gold standard technique: twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure.
