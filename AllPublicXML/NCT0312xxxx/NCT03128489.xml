  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the immunogenicity and safety of DTPa-IPV/Hib when
      administered at 6, 10 and 14 weeks to healthy Indian infants, as per guidance from the Indian
      regulatory authority. The 6, 10 and 14 week schedule reflects the current Indian standard of
      care.

      -  Experimental design: Phase III, open-label, non-randomised, multi-centric,
           single-country study with a single group.

        -  Duration of the study: The intended duration of the study will be approximately 3 months
           per subject.

        -  Treatment group and vaccination schedule: All subjects will receive three doses of the
           vaccine at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age.

             -  DTPa-IPV/Hib Group: Subjects who will receive DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine
                (Infanrix-IPV/Hib).

      Other routine registered childhood vaccinations as part of National Immunisation Programme
      are permitted. Information regarding vaccine administered since birth until study completion
      will be collected and documented.
    </textblock>
  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Withdrawn</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study is cancelled due to reassessment of the medical need for the vaccine in India.
    Cancellation is not related to vaccine's safety and/or efficacy.

             occur at least 30 days prior to first dose of vaccination in the study.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination.

          -  Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.
