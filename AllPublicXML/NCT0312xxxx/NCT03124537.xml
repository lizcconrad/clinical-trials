  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop a smart phone/tablet app to administer a behavior change
      program that helps adults to increase daily steps by planning where, when, and with whom to
      walk. The investigators will test the effectiveness of various components of the walking
      program app for increasing the number of daily steps among sedentary older adults. The
      investigators also will examine the effects on self-efficacy and social integration/support.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is broadly beneficial for physical, psychological, and cognitive aspects of
      health. Yet, only one in five U.S. adults meets the CDC physical activity guidelines. Making
      physical activity accessible and feasible throughout life is an important public health
      policy objective that is within reach with the right kind of behavioral and environmental
      supports. The project aims to provide such supports for an active lifestyle thereby
      contributing to healthy aging.The goal of this project is to increase physical activity
      (i.e., walking) in sedentary older adults by providing the environmental and behavioral
      resources to incorporate additional steps into their daily lives. The investigators will use
      a behavioral approach that fosters a sense of control and facilitates planning by focusing on
      the what, when, where, and with whom. The investigators propose a user-friendly practical way
      to increase steps. With specific tailored information about number of steps and distance as a
      function of time available, participants can plan when, where, and with whom they will be
      able to obtain the desired number of steps, break goals into manageable portions (at
      different times throughout the day or week), and thereby increase the likelihood of goal
      achievement.

      During the App development phase the investigators will demonstrate the App to 5 to 10 older
      adults to get their input. The goal will be to get their feedback about the App features and
      to make sure it is user friendly. The investigators will ask questions about the ease of
      using the App and their understanding of the App features. The interviewer will record their
      answers to share with the research team and App developer. Modifications to the App will be
      made as needed.

      The investigators will test which components of the program are most successful for
      increasing step counts. The four components of the app can be administered together or
      separately. There are two possible designs for this study, depending on the timing and
      resources available. In the first option, 30 participants will be randomly assigned to three
      conditions: the accelerometer program alone,the accelerometer with the schedule and maps, and
      the accelerometer with the schedule and maps along with the social network component. It is
      predicted that the complete four component program will be most effective. In the second
      option, which will be implemented if time and resources do not allow for the three group
      design, 20 older adults will be recruited and all of them will be given the same condition
      that involves all four components of the App. In this case the investigators will look at
      whether there is improvement in steps over time, but the different App conditions will not be
      compared.

    <description>This group will be given the App with the accelerometer to count steps, the daily schedule, and walking maps. It involves setting step goals and the use of an accelerometer to calibrate number of steps to distance and time using an individual's gait, and to provide step counts. (2) There will be an interface with map programs to create walking routes for work, home, and in new locations when traveling, based on how much time is available to walk. (3) They will use a daily planner to determine when they can walk and for how long. They will use the App for 3 months.</description>

    <description>This group will be given the same App as condition 1 with the accelerometer and step counter, daily schedule, and walking maps. In addition, the social contacts component will be added. This feature will link friends, co-workers, or neighbors in one's walk contact list to find out if someone is available to walk at a given time. They will use the App for 3 months.</description>
