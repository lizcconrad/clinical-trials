  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 open-label study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a neoantigen
      DNA vaccine strategy in pancreatic cancer patients following surgical resection and adjuvant
      chemotherapy. The neoantigen DNA vaccines will incorporate prioritized neoantigens and
      personalized mesothelin epitopes and will be administered with an electroporation device. The
      hypothesis of this study is that neoantigen DNA vaccines will be safe and capable of
      generating measurable neoantigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses.

      -Subjects will be enrolled within 12 weeks of surgery and standard of care adjuvant
      chemotherapy will last approximately 12 weeks with an additional 12 weeks of standard of care
      adjuvant chemotherapy or adjuvant chemoradiation. The first vaccine may be administered
      following confirmation of disease-free status and within 60 days following date of repeat
      imaging. From time of enrollment to first vaccine could be up to 45 weeks.

    <description>Vaccines will be weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21. Vaccines will occur within +/- 1 week with at least 3 weeks between vaccines. All study injections will be given intramuscularly using TDS-IM system. At each vaccination time point, patients will receive 2 injections of the neoantigen DNA vaccine, 1 injection into each deltoid or lateralis.
Minimum observation of 30 minutes. Vital signs will be taken at 30-45 minutes post-immunization. The injection sites will be inspected for evidence of local reaction. Follow up on subject well-being will be performed by telephone on the 1st or 2nd day following each injection. -Post-vaccination follow-up visits are at Week 25 ± 7 days and Week 77 ± 14 days. Additional follow-up visits or telephone contact will be scheduled at Week 129 and annually thereafter if the patient is alive and available for follow-up.
At intervals throughout the study (both before and after vaccination) subjects will have blood drawn for immunologic assays.</description>

          -  A psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study

             for eligible injection sites (left and right medial deltoid region) exceeds 40 mm.

          -  Individuals in whom the ability to observe possible local reactions at the eligible
             injection sites (deltoid region) is, in the opinion of the investigator, unacceptably
             obscured due to a physical condition or permanent body art.

             automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator, nerve stimulators, or deep brain
             stimulators.

          -  Prior or currently active autoimmune disease requiring management with
             immunosuppression. This includes inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis,
             Crohn's disease, systemic vasculitis, scleroderma, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis,
             hemolytic anemia, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic
             lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, or other rheumatologic disease
             or any other medical condition or use of medication (e.g., corticosteroids) which
             might make it difficult for the patient to complete the full course of treatments or
             to generate an immune response to vaccines. In the case of asthma or chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease taking inhaled corticosteroids that does not require
             daily systemic corticosteroids is acceptable. Additionally, local acting steroids
             (topical, inhaled, or intraarticular) will be allowed. Patients on intermittent or
             short course steroids will be allow if the dose does not exceed 4 mg of dexamethasone
             (or equivalent) per day for &gt; 7 consecutive days. Any patients receiving steroids
             should be discussed with the PI to determine if eligible.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.

          -  Known HIV-positive status. These patients are ineligible because of the potential
             inability to generate an immune response to vaccines.
