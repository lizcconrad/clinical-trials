  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study was set-up to evaluate clinical efficacy of Pixie® cryogenic pen versus two
      comparator cryogenic products (Wartner® and Wortie®) for the treatment of common and plantar
      warts.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of cryotherapy has been long known to be effective against warts. The indications for
      Pixie® are in line with the indications presented in the collected literature data, as well
      as with the indications of equivalent devices.

      The benefits of warts treatment without the use of chemicals are clearly evidenced. The
      treatment period is much shorter (one treatment compared to daily application of
      keratinolytics or fluorouracil, over a period of a few weeks). The cryogen therapy
      application through a conic tip is much more precise than with chemical substances. Chemical
      substance application is leading to more side effects of the surrounding skin (typical for
      chemical treatment are pain, blistering, ulceration and contact dermatitis).

      The Instructions for Use were developed in line with these data and are therefore covering
      all hazards known up to the date of this report.

      Based on these data the product received its CE-mark approval
