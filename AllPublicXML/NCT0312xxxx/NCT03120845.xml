      Aim to compare incidence of post-operative pain and apical healing after single-visit versus
      two-visit root canal treatment of teeth with necrotic pulp and apical periodontitis.

      Methodology: All teeth of the one and two-visit group were asymptomatic (92) and symptomatic
      (18) with a diagnosis of pulp necrosis (RCT cases) determined by hot and cold sensitivity
      tests and radiographically all teeth showed a small and irregular radiolucency at the tooth
      apex. Working length was established with EAL and confirmed radiographically. Reciprocating
      files (VDW, Munich Germany) were used to complete root canal preparation. EDTA served as a
      lubricant.

          4. A negative response to hot and cold pulp sensitivity tests;

          5. Presence of sufficient coronal tooth structure for rubber dam isolation;

          6. No prior endodontic treatment on the involved tooth

          7. No analgesics or antibiotics were used five days before the clinical procedures began.
