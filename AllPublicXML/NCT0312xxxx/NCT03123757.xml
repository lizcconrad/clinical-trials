      This study evaluates the determinants of mobility, measured by the 6-minute walk test, and
      its correlation with quality of life in near elderly patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the determinants of mobility an its correlation with quality of life, we
      conducted a study that evaluated patients ability to perform the 6-minute walk test and their
      corresponding quality of life measured by the EQ-5D. Cognition was evaluated used the
      Callahan six-item screener, and additional measures of physical performance were assessed
      using the Short Physical Performance Battery. Participants disclosed self reported physical
      function and physical activity. Additionally, other participant characteristics including
      vital signs, medication history and healthcare utilization were determined as well as social,
      economic and health related information was collected.

    <description>The 6 minute walk test measures the distance walked in 6 minutes without sitting and without the use of a walker or the help of another person (a cane may be used). The walk was conducted in a wide hallway, specifically designed for this type of assessment, with a defined 20-meter course. The subject walked back and forth in the hallway for six minutes and the distance covered was recorded.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D is a self-reported questionnaire that describes a respondent's health using a descriptive system comprised of five items, each representing a different health dimension (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). For each dimension, respondents state whether they have no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, or are unable to perform the activity.</description>

    <description>The SPPB is a brief performance battery based on timed short distance walk, repeated chair stands and balance test administered by trained examiners. The measurement goal for this battery is to assess lower extremity functional limitations, which indicate functional abilities and are a strong measure of risk for future disability.</description>
