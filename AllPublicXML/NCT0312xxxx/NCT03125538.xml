  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motor imagery practice (MIP), which is the repeated internal representation of a movement
      without engaging its physical execution and which shares a neurofunctional equivalence with
      physical practice, has been show to contribute to promote motor recovery and pain
      alleviation. Despite the extensive body of evidence concerning MIP therapeutic effects, the
      impact of mental training during lower-limb amputees' rehabilitation process remains to be
      investigated. This study was designed to assess MIP effects on the relearning of walking and
      the frequency and intensity of phantom-limb pain among acute lower-limb amputees. Data should
      contribute to scale up the tools made available to therapists and extend the scope of MIP
      application. Moreover, results may contribute to directly provide patients recovering from a
      lower-limb amputation with a cost-effective and adaptable technique that could considerably
      improve their quality of life.

      Arms:

      Arm label: Experimental

      Arm type: Experimental

      Arm description: Participants from the experimental group will perform MIP concomitantly with
      usual physical rehabilitation program.

      Intervention type: Other

      Intervention name: Motor Imagery Practice of locomotor tasks

      Intervention Description: Together with physical rehabilitation performed with
      physiotherapists, participants from the experimental group will mentally rehearse 3 different
      locomotor exercises that they already physically performed beforehand.

      Exercise 1: 10m Walk

      Exercise 2: Timed Up and Go test (rise up from a chair, walk 3 meters, turn around, come back
      to the chair, turn around and sit down)

      Exercise 3: Stairs climbing test (climb up 4 stairs, turn around, climb down the for stairs)

      Two min of MIP will be scheduled 5 times/day, during rest periods, so that patients complete
      10min of MIP per day.

      Locomotor capacities and phantom-limb pain intensity will be assessed at 5 different moments
      of the functional rehabilitation:

      Evaluation 1: first day of functional rehabilitation Evaluation 2: right after prosthesis
      fitting and when patients are able to walk with it during 10min Evaluation 3: three weeks
      after the second evaluation (to have temporally equivalent data for all patients) Evaluation
      4: one week before leaving the rehabilitation center (to have functionally equivalent data
      for all patients) Evaluation 5: six weeks after patients left the center, for follow-up
      assessment

      Arm label: Control

      Arm type: Active comparator

      Arm description: Concomitantly with usual physical rehabilitation program, participants from
      the control group will perform a cognitive task that has no impact on motor rehabilitation
      (word scramble game).

      Intervention type: Other

      Intervention name: Control cognitive task

      Intervention Description: Together with physical rehabilitation performed with
      physiotherapists, participants from the control group will spend equivalent time focusing on
      a cognitive task without impact on motor rehabilitation.

      Two min of this cognitive task will be scheduled 5 times/day, during rest periods, so that
      patients complete 10min of control task per day.

      As for patients of the experimental group, locomotor capacities and phantom-limb pain
      intensity of participants from the control group will be assessed at 5 different moments of
      the functional rehabilitation:

      Evaluation 1: first day of functional rehabilitation Evaluation 2: right after prosthesis
      fitting and when patients are able to walk with it during 10min Evaluation 3: three weeks
      after the second evaluation (to have temporally equivalent data for all patients) Evaluation
      4: one week before leaving the rehabilitation center (to have functionally equivalent data
      for all patients) Evaluation 5: six weeks after patients left the center, for follow-up
      assessment
