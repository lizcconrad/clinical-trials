  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hemoporfin photodynamic therapy
      (PDT) with different light doses for port-wine stain (PWS） in 7-14 years old children. The
      population pharmacokinetics of hemoporfin in children will be investigated as well.
