          -  Participant must have a body mass index (BMI; weight in kilogram (kg) divided by the
             square of height in meters [m]) of 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m^2, extremes included, and a body
             weight not less than (&lt;) 50.0 kg

          -  Participant must be willing and able to adhere to the requirements, instructions, and

             at screening. If the results of the biochemistry panel, hematology, or urinalysis are
             outside the normal reference ranges, the participant may be included only if the
             investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically
             significant. This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents
             and initialed by the investigator

          -  Participants must be willing to start ethinylestradiol/drospirenone contraception
             during the COCP lead-in and JNJ-64155806 + COCP coadministration phases

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is a woman who is pregnant as confirmed by a positive beta human chorionic
             gonadotropin (beta-hCG) laboratory test, or who was pregnant within 6 months prior to
             study start, or who is breast-feeding, or who is planning to become pregnant from
             signing of the informed consent form (ICF) until 90 days after the last dose of study
             drug

          -  Participant with creatinine clearance of less than (&lt;) 90 milliliter per minute
             (mL/min) (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration [CKD-EPI] equation)

          -  Participant with a clinically significant cardiovascular, respiratory, renal,
             gastrointestinal, hematologic, neurologic (syncope or seizures), thyroid, or any other
             medical illness or psychiatric disorder, as determined by the investigator and/or
             sponsor's medical monitor

          -  Participant has any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             participation would not be in the best interest of the participant (example,
             compromise the well-being), or that could prevent, limit, or confound the
             protocol-specified assessments

          -  Participant with currently active gynecological disorders including, but not limited
             to, vaginal bleeding without an obvious reason and hyperprolactinemia with or without
