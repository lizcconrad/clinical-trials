  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, non-randomized study of re-irradiation of diffuse intrinsic pontine
      glioma (DIPG)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study therapy will consist of radiation therapy (RT) given over 17 treatment days (for 30.6
      Gy in fractions of 1.8 Gy) or 20 treatment days (for 36 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions), depending on
      the time from completion of the first course of RT. Treatment days will generally be
      weekdays, not including statutory holidays.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All of these criteria must be met for a patient to be eligible for this study:

          1. The patient is 17 years of age of younger at the time of first or second relapse or
             progression of DIPG

          2. The patient has no evidence of metastases on cranial or spinal MR imaging

          3. The patient has received RT in the past, given to a total cumulative dose of &lt;60 Gy;
             prior radiation using opposed lateral fields, conformal 3-D fields, IMRT or using
             protons is acceptable

          4. At least 180 days have elapsed from the last day of primary RT for DIPG

          5. The patient has recovered from all acute and subacute toxicities of prior RT and of
             chemotherapy, if chemotherapy was utilized in the past

          6. The patient has been off all anti-tumour therapy for at least 14 days

          7. The patient has a Lansky score of 40% or higher

          8. The patient has a life expectancy anticipated to be at least 8 weeks with treatment
             using re-irradiation, with or without dexamethasone

          9. The patient has no uncontrolled medical condition (e.g., seizures, diabetes,
             infection) that would interfere with the delivery of rRT

         10. The patient agrees to not enroll on any other clinical trial of an anti-tumour
             intervention

         11. The patient agrees to report and have recorded the use of all medications taken during
             ReRAD therapy, from the time of diagnosis of progression or recurrence, then through
             and after completion of, ReRAD therapy; this includes the use of complementary,
             alternative and dietary therapies

         12. The patient is treated at a site where the study is approved by the local ethics board

         13. Males and females of child-bearing potential must agree to use effective birth control
             measures during rRT

         14. Consent, and, if applicable, assent, has been obtained according to institutional
             standards

        Exclusion Criteria:

        If the patient fulfills any of these criteria, then he or she will not be eligible for the
        study:

          1. Females who are pregnant, due to risks from rRT on the developing fetus.

          2. Any patient with a condition that prohibits the planned delivery of rRT as prescribed
             in this study.

          3. Patients who are receiving any other clinical trial of an anti-tumour intervention
