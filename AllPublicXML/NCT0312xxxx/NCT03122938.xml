  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the effects of a lactoferrin supplemented formula on fetal development , iron
      metabolism and immunity in healthy pregnant women. One hundred and twenty healthy pregnant
      women (24&lt;gestational weeks&lt;26) are enrolled and randomly assigned to
      lactoferrin-supplemented formula group (active group) or normal formula group (control group,
      without lactoferrin supplementation). Subjects allocated in active group consume lactoferrin
      supplemented formula (85mg lactoferrin per 100g) 3 times a day (81g totally), while those in
      control group consume formula without lactoferrin supplementation (&lt;6mg lactoferrin per 100g
      formula) according to the same schedule. Routine blood test including hemoglobin and serum
      ferritin, and food frequency questionnaire-based review and 24h*3 dietary record are
      performed every 4 weeks during intervention until delivery. Body weight of newborns are
      recorded after delivery. The differences in iron deficiency anemia morbility of pregnant
      women and anthropometric measurements of newborns between groups would be analyzed after
      completion of this study.
