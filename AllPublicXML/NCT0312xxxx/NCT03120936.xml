  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Stay Study is a multi-site, open-label HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) demonstration
      project for advancing PrEP delivery in the San Francisco Bay Area Transgender Community.
      Approximately 188 HIV-uninfected participants will be enrolled at 4 sites in San Francisco
      and Fremont and will be provided Truvada to take orally once daily as PrEP.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PrEP stands for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis, an HIV prevention method that involves HIV negative
      people taking antiviral drugs daily to try to help prevent HIV infection. Studies with men
      who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women showed that people who took PrEP were less
      likely to become infected with HIV than those who did not take it.

      The main purpose of this PrEP Demonstration Project is to make PrEP accessible to people in
      the transgender community. As part of this project, we will study whether transgender women
      and men are interested in taking PrEP, and, if so, for how long and how frequently they take
      the medication and how these relate to demographics (such as race, age, and education). We
      will also assess reasons for stopping PrEP and measure sexual behaviors of participants in
      the demonstration project.
