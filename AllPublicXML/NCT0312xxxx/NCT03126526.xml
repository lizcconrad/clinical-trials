  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project aims to explore the effectiveness of a computerised intervention as a
      treatment for eating disorders, particularly binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa. Two
      interventions will be used to target cognitive processes: 1) food-specific inhibitory control
      training and 2) implementation intentions.

      The full intervention is 4 weeks long and consists of completing the training and food
      diaries every day and meeting with the researcher twice for EEG recording and taste tests.
      Moreover, it involves completing questionnaires at baseline, at intervention completion, and
      one month after the intervention.

      Moreover, healthy control participants will be recruitment to complete baseline
      questionnaires and take part in one EEG recording session in order to assess baseline
      differences in brain activation in response to computer tasks.

      Participants will learn about the study through flyers, e-mail, and social media (i.e.
      twitter and Facebook) which will describe the interventional nature of the study,the main
      eligibility criteria, and the researcher's contact information.

      Interested individuals will be asked to contact the researchers, who will then send an
      information sheet detailing the study procedure and what participation would involve. After
      reading the information sheet, interested individuals will be contacted by the researchers in
      order to confirm all eligibility criteria including diagnostic assessment. If these are met a
      PDF of the consent form will be sent to the participants, including information about their
      rights as participants and their ability to withdraw at any time without having to give a
      reason. Participants who sign the consent form will respond to the email with the attached
      document. Next, researchers will contact the participant to set an appointment to enter the
      lab for the first EEG recording. Before entering the lab, participants will be asked to
      complete a food diary and complete the complete a battery of questionnaires. The
      questionnaires include: 1) a demographic questionnaire, 2) verbal hunger questionnaire, 3)
      eating disorders examination questionnaire, 4) food ratings test, 5) self-regulation of
      eating behaviour questionnaire for adults, 6) The negative urgency scale , 7) the adults
      eating behaviour questionnaire, 8) GAD-7 anxiety, and 9) PHQ-9 Depression.

      Upon participants' arrival to the lab, they will learn to complete the training tasks (i.e.
      food specific go/no-go, general go/no-go, emotion task, and arrow flanker task) and perform
      them during EEG recording. They will be offered the opportunity to ask questions relating to
      the task or the EEG at any time. Next, they will discuss the completed food diary with the
      researcher, who will encourage them to set small weekly goals and plan behaviour towards
      food, known as implementation intentions. Their weight will also be measured. Before leaving
      the lab, participants will take part in a taste test, in which they are asked to rate the
      taste of particular foods. Researchers will monitor intake accordingly.

      Participants will be asked to complete the training and complete food diaries every day for
      four weeks. The food diaries and the successful/ unsuccessful attempts of implementation
      intentions to reduce craving, bingeing, and purging will be assessed weekly. A
      researcher/clinician will discuss setting the implementation intention goals either on the
      phone, e-mail, or in person, depending on travel requirements. Within the training, visual
      analogue scales will be used to assess mood and urge to eat. Moreover, participants will be
      asked to weekly report how often they have completed the training within that week. At the
      end of the training, participants will enter the lab to re-complete the four tasks while
      researchers record brain activation using the EEG. They will also discuss their food diaries
      with the researcher. Additionally, their weight will be re-assessed. Moreover, they will take
      part in another taste test, in which they are asked to rate the taste of particular foods.
      Before leaving, they will be asked to complete a feedback sheet in which they can express
      their experience with the training, in terms of facilitators and barriers and visual analogue
      scales that will ask participants to rate the acceptability, usefulness and level of burden
      experienced with training. Participants will then be followed up at 1 month
      post-intervention; they will be asked to complete food diaries and the complete battery of
      questionnaires used at baseline.

    <intervention_model_description>The model includes two interventions (i.e. inhibitory control training and implementation intentions) that aim to target cognitive processes that have been reported to play a role in the onset and maintenance of eating disorders. Moreover, three arms exist, one for healthy controls including only one EEG assessment, and two interventional arms for participants with eating disorders. Participants in one interventional arm will receive food-specific inhibitory control training, while participants in the other interventional arm will receive general inhibitory control training. These are delivered through a website task (go/no-go training),</intervention_model_description>
