  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      60 newly referred patients with psoriasis at the Department of Dermatology and Allergy,
      Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Denmark will be consecutive included in the study. In the first
      phase of the study 30 patients will receive standard treatment (control group) and in the
      following phase 30 patients will receive the individualized conversational/educational
      intervention (intervention group).The rationale for using a historical control group instead
      of a randomised control group is that it in&quot;real-life setting&quot; is unpractical to realize a
      communicative intervention, because clinicians unintentional can intervene against the
      control group.

      The first conversation will take place when the newly referred patient has initiated a new
      treatment. The rational for this is that the time of transition from private practice to the
      Department of Dermatology and Allergy is characterised by failed treatment, typically
      phototherapy or topical. This meaning that newly referred patients current needs is to get
      their psoriasis under control. When patients have initiated a medical treatment they will be
      more motivated and have better surplus to engage in the conversational/educational
      intervention.

      Patients in the intervention group will receive an individual face-to-face conversation with
      a duration of 45 min. All patients will have access to telephone counselling by their primary
      nurse when needed and able to arrange a new face-to-face conversation. After 4-6 weeks the
      face-to-face the nurse will of conversation reach out to the patient by phone to follow up on
      the earlier conversation. Three months after the face-to-face conversation the nurse will
      offer the patient a closing face-to-face conversation of 15 min at the same time where the
      patient has a doctor appointment at the department. Those who are in the control group will
      continue standard care and not receive any conversation and be used as the control group.

      The intervention will be provided by a team of specialized dermatological nurses who have
      received a formal training on patient-centred communication, Self-regulatory Model/Common
      Sense Model interviewing, the life with chronic disease and action plan support.
