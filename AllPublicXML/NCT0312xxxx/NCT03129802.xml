    <textblock>
      The failure of extubation in pediatric resuscitation is most often described as the need for
      reintubation within 48 hours after extubation. The failure rate of extubation in pediatric
      intensive care varies in the literature there is 4 to 22% failure. These failures result in
      increased mortality, morbidity with a use of larger tracheostomy, a prolonged residence time.
      Some risk factors are well defined in the literature as the duration of intubation, ENT and
      neurological history, the persistence of a respiratory disease, a high level of sedation.
      Other factors are more controversial as age, ventilatory parameters just before extubation
      before extubation blood gases, the interest of a leak test.

      Also pediatric populations are extremely heterogeneous, so the investigators would like to
      highlight to extubation failure risk factors in Hautepierre pediatric ICU to better support
      these high-risk children.
