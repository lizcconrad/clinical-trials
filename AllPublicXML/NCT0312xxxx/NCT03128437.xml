    <textblock>
      This is a 2-arm randomized control trial to test the effect of an anxiety sensitivity
      intervention on health behaviors among 18-35 year-olds. Participants will be 18-35 year-olds
      with high anxiety sensitivity randomized to 1)Exercise Exposure Intervention or 2)Assessment
      Only Control Condition. Participants in both groups will be followed for 8 weeks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety sensitivity represents an individual-level propensity to appraise the experience of anxiety as aversive in terms of social, physical, and/or cognitive consequences. It has been implicated in the maintenance of fear behavior (i.e., avoidance) and the development of clinically significant symptomatology with respect to anxiety and depression. Anxiety sensitivity will be assessed using the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>4 &amp; 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity will be assessed using the 7-day Physical Activity Recall questionnaire.</description>

    <measure>Heart rate variability</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A continuous 3 lead ECG (SE-1010 PC ECG, Edan USA) will be acquired for 5 minutes while the subject rests in a supine position in a quiet, private room.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol use</measure>
    <time_frame>4 &amp; 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quantity and frequency of alcohol use will be assessed using the Timeline Follow-back method (Alcohol TLFB; Sobell &amp; Sobell, 1992). This semi-structured interview asks participants to retrace their behavior and activities over a given timespan in order to assess daily alcohol use.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Binge eating</measure>
    <time_frame>4 &amp; 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Consistent with methods reported in Deboer et al., (2012), binge eating frequency will be assessed continuously using item 8 of the Eating Disorder Diagnostic Scale (EDDS; Stice, Telch, &amp; Rizvi, 2000): &quot;How many times have you eaten an unusually large amount of food and experienced a loss of control?&quot; This question will be integrated into the semi-structured interview procedures as described above in order to increase accuracy of responses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>4 &amp; 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI; Bastien, Vallieres, &amp; Morin, 2001) will also be administered in order to capture more nuanced information about participants' sleep quality. Seven items assessing severity of insomnia symptoms comprise the ISI, with higher scores indicating more significant sleep disturbances.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise Stage of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>4 &amp; 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Stage of exercise behavior change will be measured using a 6-item self-report questionnaire developed by Marcus, Selby, Niaura, &amp; Rossi (1992). Participants respond to each item using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree.&quot;</description>

    <description>At each of the six exposure sessions, participants will be invited to engage in 2-minute warm-up on the treadmill. Following this warm-up period, participants will be asked to briskly walk or jog on the treadmill at a speed that maintains their heart rate at 60-80% of maximum age-predicted heart rate for 20 minutes using the formula: (220-age) x (0.60 [lower bound] or 0.80 [upper bound]). Participants will be fitted with a heart rate monitor, which will be checked by a research assistant at 5-minute intervals in order to ensure adherence to this prescription; participants will be asked to adjust treadmill speed in order to remain in this range. Following each 20-minute exposure, participants will complete 5 minutes of cool down walking on the treadmill. Assessments will take place at baseline, week 2 (post-intervention), week 4, and week 8.</description>
