      The study will look to evaluate the tolerance of a light therapy-based acne mask device in
      participants who report having sensitive skin. All participants will receive a cleanser, a
      light therapy mask, and an extra activator for the light therapy mask.

    <textblock>
      Acne and sensitive skin can be closely connected due to the reported involvement of an
      impaired skin barrier in both conditions, which can be further aggravated by potentially
      irritating topical treatments.

      A patient's sensitive skin may be caused by the skincare products that they are using, the
      amount that they are applying (over-usage), or the concomitant effect of the different
      products being used, as well as by underlying medical conditions. While sensitive skin can be
      self-perceived and sometimes clinically apparent, as there is no agreed upon medical
      definition of 'sensitive skin', it is a 'diagnosis' primarily made by the patient's
      perception. The high incidence of this problem and potential for further irritation due to
      current topical treatments has left many patients in need of a sensitive skin solution for
      their acne.

      Current at-home topical treatments for mild to moderate acne include Over-the-Counter (OTC)
      options, primarily with either benzoyl peroxide, or salicylic acid, as well as prescription
      options including retinoid-based products, however the cutaneous irritation potential of
      topical acne active ingredients has been reported in the literature, which is not desirable
      in particular for patients with sensitive skin.

      Research has shown the benefits of red and blue light therapy in the treatment of mild to
      moderate acne, with blue light reported to target acne-causing bacteria and red light
      demonstrating anti-inflammatory activity. Previous studies with these types of modalities
      have shown high tolerance and efficacy. This study will look to evaluate the tolerance of a
      light therapy-based medical device in patients with self-reported sensitive skin.
