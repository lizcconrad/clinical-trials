  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team plans to enroll a total of 40 subjects with self-reported perimenstrual acne.
      Eligible women will be over the age of 18 and not on any current therapy. The patients will
      first arrive for a screening visit, where they will be given questionnaires on acne quality
      of life (acne QOL) and subjective assessments as well as flare ups (as used in the study by
      Geller et al). The patients' skin will be assessed for inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne
      vulgaris. The baseline visit (day 1) will be scheduled for one week prior to the first day of
      menses (as studies indicate that most women have their acne flare during this time). The
      study team will perform a zit count (counting papules, pustules, and comedones) and global
      assessment, and the patient will be instructed to record their menses (which they will do for
      the duration of the study). The patients will then return in 2 weeks, at day 15, and they
      will be re-assessed. The patients will be dispensed the investigational product and
      instructed on its daily use. The patients will continue to return every 14 days to have their
      skin assessed until their final visit on day 99, one week after their 3rd menses on treatment
      (4th menses on study). The duration of the study per patient is approximately 4 months, and
      the study team anticipates an enrollment period of 12 months.
