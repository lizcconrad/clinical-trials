      This is an Expanded Access to Investigational Drug program available through the FDA. Some
      specific conditions to qualify for this program includes gastroesophageal reflux disease with
      upper GI symptoms, gastroparesis, and chronic constipation. Patients failing standard
      therapies for these conditions may be eligible to receive domperidone. This program
      facilitates availability of investigational drugs, (such as domperidone) to patients with
      serious diseases or conditions when there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative
      therapy to diagnose, monitor or treat the patients's disease or condition. Authorization must
      be obtained from FDA prior to the importation, interstate shipment and administration of
      domperidone.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female

          2. Age 18 and older

          3. Symptoms or manifestations secondary to motility disorders of the upper GI tract.
             These include gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease
             that are refractory to standard therapy.

          4. Patients must have a comprehensive evaluation to eliminate other causes of their
             symptoms. This includes a history and physical examination. A recent (within 3 years)
             evaluation of the upper GI tract with either upper endoscopy or upper GI radiographic
             series. Baseline blood tests suggested are electrolytes, magnesium, and prolactin
             level.

          5. Patient has signed informed consent for the administration of domperidone that informs
             the patient of potential adverse events including:

               -  Increased prolactin levels

               -  Breast changes

               -  Extrapyramidal side effects

               -  Cardiac arrhythmias including QT prolongation (increased risk with the drugs
                  listed in the appendix)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        History of, or current, arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia, ventricular
        fibrillation and Torsade des Pointes. Patients with minor forms of ectopy (PACs) are not
        necessarily excluded.

        2. Clinically significant bradycardia, sinus node dysfunction, or heart block. Prolonged
        QTc (QTc &gt; 450 milliseconds for males, QTc &gt; 470 milliseconds for females).

        3. Clinically significant electrolyte disorders. These include significant hypokalemia,
        hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypermagnesemia that cannot be corrected with treatment
        of these electrolyte abnormalities.

        4. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage or obstruction. 5. Presence of a prolactinoma
        (prolactin-releasing pituitary tumor). 6. Pregnant or breast feedings female. 7. Known
        allergy to domperidone.
