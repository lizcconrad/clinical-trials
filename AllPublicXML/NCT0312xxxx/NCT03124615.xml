  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this trial is to determine whether dose reduction of enzalutamide in
      patients with grade 3 fatigue and/or cognition change will lead to an improvement in symptoms
      while maintaining active drug levels.

      Patients within 3 months of starting enzalutamide will be assessed by their oncologist as
      being potentially eligible for dose reduction due to the onset of moderate to severe fatigue
      and/or cognition change, which is assessed as being due to enzalutamide

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with prostate cancer who have commenced enzalutamide within 3 months

          2. Patient must have concomitant LHRH agonist or antagonist (no single agent
             enzalutamide)

          3. Receiving enzalutamide before or after docetaxel

          4. Patients may have hormone-sensitive or castrate resistant disease

          5. Patients may have metastatic (M1) or non-metastatic (M0) disease

          6. Onset of grade 3 or more cognition change and/or fatigue after commencement of
             enzalutamide considered to be due to enzalutamide

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical dementia

          2. Concomitant use of drugs known to impair cognition such as benzodiazepines or
             antihistamines.

          3. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 and/ or CYP2C8 inducers or inhibitors.

          4. Patient expected to have a change in opioid dose during the study period or have had a

          6. Brain metastases, prior seizures, drugs that significantly reduce seizure threshold.

          7. Active infection or other intercurrent illness that may contribute to fatigue or
             cognition change within 4 weeks of study entry.
