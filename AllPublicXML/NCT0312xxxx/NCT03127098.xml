  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b/2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ETBX-011
      vaccine used in combination with ALT-803 in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic
      CEA-expressing cancers whose tumor has recurred after standard-of-care treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will consist of a phase 1b study with ETBX-011 as a fixed dose with a dose
      escalation of ALT-803 unless de-escalation is required. The proposed phase 2 expansion study
      will give additional safety data for the MTD as well as preliminary efficacy data. Subjects
      will receive treatments unless they experience progressive disease, dose-limiting toxicities
      (DLT), withdraw consent, or if the investigator determines it is no longer in their best
      medical interest to continue treatment.

             respectively, of the first planned dose of ETBX-011 or ALT 803.
