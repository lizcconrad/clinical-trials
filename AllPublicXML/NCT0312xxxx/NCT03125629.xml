    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies how well positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography
      (CT) works compared to PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in evaluating patients with
      cancer. PET/CT and PET/MRI may determine which scanner is best for the patient's type of
      cancer and other types of cancers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate if PET/CT and PET/MRI scanners provide equivalent results for evaluation of
      cancer patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive standard of care 18F fludeoxyglucose (FDG) or Ga68 DOTA TATE intravenously
      (IV). Within 45-60 minutes, patients then undergo PET/CT imaging immediately followed by
      PET/MRI. Total imaging time is up to 2 hours.

    <description>Standardized uptake value max (SUVmax) is a measurement of the maximum radiopharmaceutical uptake value within the region of interest (ROI). It is expected that the SUVmax of PET/CT and PET/MRI will correlate statistically.
Absolute accuracy is determined using the Bland-Altman method and statistically compares the accuracy of measuring SUVmax with PET/CT versus the accuracy of measuring SUVmax with PET/MR. For each pair of measurements, the mean difference plus or minus two standard deviations of the differences will be used to calculate absolute accuracy. The investigators hypothesize that the average difference of the two will be tightly clustered around 0.</description>

    <measure>Relative accuracy of SUV max of PET/CT vs PET/MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>estimated average of 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Standardized uptake value max (SUVmax) is a measurement of the maximum radiopharmaceutical uptake value within the region of interest (ROI). It is expected that the SUVmax of PET/CT and PET/MRI will correlate statistically.
Relative accuracy is determined by expressing the absolute accuracy (obtained in the primary outcome measure) in terms of percent difference between SUVmax values obtained from PET/CT and PET/MR. The closer the percent difference is to 0%, the better the agreement between the two scanners.</description>
