  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently a lack of evidence to support the use of perioperative point-of-care
      ultrasound to assess the outcomes in high risk surgical patients. Thus, the purposes of this
      study were to evaluate whether perioperative use of point-of-care ultrasound can reduce the
      worse postoperative outcomes in high surgical patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Point-of-care ultrasound is increasingly established as a useful bedside tool when performed
      by the anesthesiologist for evaluation of cardiopulmonary dysfunction and other emergent
      situations. However, it remains unclear whether use of perioperative point-of-care ultrasound
      can reduce the worse postoperative outcomes in high surgical risk patients.

      Patients were randomly allocated to two groups. In the point-of-care ultrasound group,
      treatment was oriented by the findings of point-of-care ultrasound, while in the control
      group the decisions about the management of patients were made by the experience of the
      clinical team. The primary outcome measures were hospital mortality and 28-day mortality, and
      the secondary outcome measures were the complications and length of hospital stay.

        More and more high risk patients undergo surgery,which is associated with increased
        morbidity and mortality. The aim of the present study was to investigate the value of
        point-of-care ultrasound for assessment of postoperative outcomes in high risk surgical
        patients.
