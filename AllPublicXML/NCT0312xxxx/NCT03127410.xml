      The objective in this study is to determine the predictive validity of a set of special
      clinical tests in identifying those who will respond to lumbar traction. The central
      hypothesis of this pilot study is that a cluster of lumbopelvic stress tests will be able to
      identify a subgroup of patients with low back pain who will respond favorably to mechanical
      lumbar traction. If these clinical tests can identify a subgroup of patients with low back
      pain who respond favorably to lumbar traction, additional studies, including randomized
      clinical trials will be necessary to further test and validate the use of this cluster of
      clinical tests. The rationale for this research is to examine the connection between
      provocative lumbar compression testing and lumbar traction as a means of decompression
