  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anaesthesia has three major components, analgesia, muscle relaxation and hypnosis.

      For a long time, opioids have been covering the analgesia function. (1) When using opioids,
      an analgesic effect is obtained per-operatively, however, not without side-effects.
      Post-operative complications such as: respiratory depression, post-operative nausea and
      vomiting, pruritus, acute opioid tolerance and hyperalgesia, difficulty voiding and ileus,
      are well known.

      Opioid usage is an important risk factor of postoperative desaturation. Postoperative
      desaturation can lead to severe hypoxemia and even tissue hypoxia, followed by obvious
      cardiologic and neurological complications.

      Thus, in patients at risk, such as the obese patient, experts suggest reducing opioid usage.

      Non-opiate protocols implemented on the obese patient have been published. Non-opiate
      protocols have been established using a combination of ketamine, lidocaine and an alpha-2
      agonist.

      The main purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate whether patients undergoing an opioid
      free anaesthesia regime experience less desaturation episodes during the first 24 h
      post-bariatric surgery than patients having received an opioid anaesthesia regime.

    <description>The primary outcome of this study is to evaluate desaturation episodes during the first 24 h post-bariatric surgery in patients having received an opioid or an opioid free anaesthesia.
Desaturation is defined as a decrease of oxygen desaturation equal to or exceeding 4% of the baseline value. ODI (oxygen desaturation index), the total number of desaturation events divided by the total time of monitoring in hours, will be calculated to evaluate this outcome in both groups.
In case of desaturation lasting longer than 10 seconds, oxygen (via nasal canula) will be administered as per post-anaesthesia care unit protocol.
SP02 will be measured for 24 hours through non-invasive monitoring.</description>
