    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine whether the provision of non-surgical
      periodontal therapy to pregnant women with periodontitis is effective in reducing the
      incidence of low birth weight, preterm birth and still birth when compared to pregnant women
      with periodontitis but who will be provided with oral hygiene instructions alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately two-thirds of pregnant Pakistani women suffer from periodontal disease a common
      inflammatory disease of the soft tissues surrounding the tooth. It was demonstrated that
      periodontitis among pregnant women is significantly associated with preterm birth and low
      birth weight. Pakistan has a high prevalence of these adverse birth outcomes therefore;
      identifying an intervention is of prime importance and may have social and economic benefits.

      Non-surgical periodontal therapy is affordable and amenable to people and thus seems to be an
      intervention which may prove to be of benefit in a population where the dental services are
      available. It has been recommended in systematic reviews and Meta analysis that Randomized
      Controlled Trials are now required to establish whether the removal of inflammatory factors
      by scaling and root planning are effective in reducing adverse pregnancy outcomes such as
      preterm birth and low birth weight.

    <intervention_model_description>It's an assessor blinded, parallel group, randomized controlled trial aimed at determining the superiority of non-surgical periodontal therapy over no dental treatment among pregnant women.
The main objective of this trial is to determine whether the provision of NSPT to pregnant women with periodontitis is effective in reducing the incidence of low birth weight, preterm birth and still birth when compared to the pregnant women who were subjected to no NSPT. Outcomes of interest are pre-term birth (&lt;37 weeks) gestation, low birth weight (&lt;2500g) or still birth with either one occurring being considered as a positive outcome.</intervention_model_description>
