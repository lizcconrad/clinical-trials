      Does the use of analgesic current therapies increase the effectiveness of neck stabilization
      exercises for improving pain, disability, mood, and quality of life in chronic neck pain? a
      randomized, controlled, single-blind study

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Analgesic therapies; such as interferential current (IFC) and transcutaneous electrical nerve
      stimulation (TENS) have been applied solo or combined with exercise for management of neck
      pain (NP), however, the efficacy of these combinations are unclear. In this study, our
      objective were to determine if TENS or IFC increase the effectiveness of neck stabilization
      exercises on pain, disability, mood, and quality of life for chronic NP. 81 patients with
      chronic NP were included in the study. Patients were randomly assigned into 3 groups; Group
      I: neck stabilization exercise, Group II: TENS+ neck stabilization exercise and Group III:
      IFC+ neck stabilization exercise. Patients' pain levels (visual analogue scale (VAS)),
      quality of life (short form- 36), mood (Beck depression inventory (BDI)), levels of
      disability (Neck Pain and Disability Index) and the need for analgesics were evaluated prior
      to treatment, at 6th and 12th week follow-up. All participants had group exercise accompanied
      by a physiotherapist for 3 weeks and an additional 3 weeks of home exercise program.

    <description>This is a self-administered scale, which is widely used to measure the quality of life. It was developed to measure the quality of life in patients who have physical illnesses; however, it can also be successfully used in healthy individuals and patients who have psychiatric diseases. SF-36 includes 36 items and surveys eight domains of health, such as physical functionality, physical role limitations, pain, general health, vitality, social functionality, emotional role limitations, and mental health.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline Beck depression inventory (BDI) at 6th and 12th weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); was used to assess the depression levels of the patients. The BDI evaluates 21 symptoms of depression. These symptoms deal with emotions, behavioral changes, and somatic symptoms. Each symptom is rated on a 4-point intensity scale. Higher scores indicate more severe depression</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline Neck Pain and Disability Index at 6th and 12th weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire consists of 20 items and measures neck movements, pain intensity, effect of neck pain on emotion factors, and interference with daily life activities. Each section is scored on a 0-5 rating scale and total score ranges from 0 to 100.</description>
