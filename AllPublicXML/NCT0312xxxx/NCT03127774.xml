      Objectives:

      - To determine intraperitoneal (IP) progression free survival after optimal debulking and
      heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with cisplatin in patients with IP spread of
      adrenocortical cancer.

      - Determine morbidity of this procedure in this patient population.

      - Determine the impact of surgery and HIPEC on quality of life (QOL) and hormone excess.

      - Examine patterns of recurrence (local versus systemic).

      - Determine overall survival after optimal debulking and HIPEC in patients with IP spread of
      adrenocortical cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare tumor with an overall 5-year mortality rate of 75 -
      90% and an average survival from the time of diagnosis of 14.5 months. The treatment of
      choice for a localized primary or recurrent tumor is surgical resection of all visible tumor
      and involved organs. For unresectable metastatic or recurrent disease, mitotane,
      aminoglutethimide, metapyrone, and ketoconazole are used. This would be the standard of care
      alternative treatment.

      Cisplatin is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic agents for ACC. Phase I and II trials
      using heated intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy with cisplatin have been conducted in other
      tumors that spread primarily to the peritoneal lining of the abdomen. Synergy has been
      demonstrated for cisplatin and hyperthermia. The purpose of this trial is to determine if an
      surgical approach with intraperitoneal administration of heated cisplatin when tumor volume
      is minimal, can impact and improve on progression free survival.
