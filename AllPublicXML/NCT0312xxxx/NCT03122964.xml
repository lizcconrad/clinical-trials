      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the methylation marker
      panel for the detection of bladder cancer in patients with gross or microscopic hematuria.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the predictive accuracy of a risk model including
      clinical factors such as age, gender, smoking history, and presence of gross versus
      microscopic hematuria compared to a model incorporating the same risk factors along with the
      methylation marker panel.
