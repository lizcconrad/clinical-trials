  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the current proposal is to investigate the clinical and physiological
      changes triggered by massage therapy in a group of individuals with chronic low back pain
      experiencing muscular fatigue.

      The investigators believe these objectives are in line with the &quot;2014 Massage Therapy
      Research Fund research priorities&quot;, since the results produced by these investigations will
      generate knowledge with regard to the short term clinical efficacy of massage therapy and
      will provide critical information related to the physiological mechanisms underlying massage
      therapy clinical effects. Most importantly, the combined assessment of clinical and
      physiological outcomes will also yield key information to identify specific biological
      components of the massage therapy intervention. Determining the presence of a biological
      mechanism is, as for any treatment, considered one of the necessary criteria to declare a
      causal relationship between a specific intervention and its associated clinical effects. The
      investigators strongly believe that the proposed research will contribute to the
      identification of specific mechanisms that will complement the emerging clinical evidence
      supporting massage therapy in the treatment of chronic low back pain.

      The proposed research project will involve researchers and future practitioners of massage
      therapy. In conjunction with a high quality research environment, it is the goal of the
      investigators to create an educational environment for undergraduate and graduate students
      that will foster interdisciplinary collaboration in order to ensure a diversified; high
      quality training of young researchers and clinician scientists working in the field of manual
      therapies.
