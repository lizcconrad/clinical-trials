    <textblock>
      1. To evaluate achievement ratio of iPTH,Calcium and phosphorus after taking Cinacalcet HCL
           in hemodialysis subjects with mild, moderate and severe SHPT;

        2. To explore the impact of Cinacalcet HCL using on the combined use of drugs;

        3. To explore the difference of patients who continued or discontinued Cinacalcet HCL in
           real-world period from 33rd to 52nd week.
