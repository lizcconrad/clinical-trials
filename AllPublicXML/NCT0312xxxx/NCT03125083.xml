  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the role of inflammation in the high prevalence of
      psychiatric disorders in skin-restricted lupus (SRL) patients. SRL is an inflammatory
      disease. Inflammation can lead to a decrease in the synthesis of neurotransmitters via the
      activation of the IDO enzyme and to induce the synthesis of neurotoxic molecules (kynurenin
      pathway). This leads to the development of psychiatric disorders.

      Investigator therefore want to compare inflammation and neurotransmitter synthesis in SRL
      patients according to the presence or absence of psychiatric disorders.

      Investigator expect a decrease in neurotransmitter synthesis and activation of the kynurenin
      pathway in patients with a psychiatric disorder.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of cutaneous lupus:

        Chronic (or discoid) cutaneous lupus during activity:

        Either the typical chronic lupus plaque (associated with erythema, hyperkeratosis, atrophy)
        sitting on the photoexposed areas of the face and / or on the scalp; The erythematous forms
        in sheets are excluded in order not to include patients who may be ambiguous in diagnosis
        with systemic lupus.

        Either form &quot;tumidus&quot; of chronic lupus. Typical cutaneous histology of chronic cutaneous
        lupus (orthokeratosis hyperkeratosis with horny plugs, thickening of the basal membrane
        area (PAS staining), lymphocytic infiltrate predominantly peri-necular but possibly having
        lichenoid aspects with vacuolation of the epidermal basal layer and cytoids).

        the body's photoexposed areas, erythematous, squamous leaving scarred scars, the intensity
        of which is clearly aggravated by exposure to light.

          -  Mental retardation
