  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Detroit Young Adult Asthma Project is to test a technology based program
      to help African American young adults learn to better manage their asthma. Participants will
      be randomized to a multi-component technology-based intervention (MCTI) targeting asthma
      medication adherence or to a comparison control condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Racial and ethnic minority youth have poorer asthma status than Caucasian youth, even after
      controlling for socioeconomic variables. Proper use of asthma controller medications is
      critical in reducing asthma mortality and morbidity. The clinical consequences of poor asthma
      management include increased illness complications, excessive functional morbidity, and fatal
      asthma attacks. There are significant limitations in research on interventions to improve
      asthma management in racial minority populations, particularly minority adolescents and young
      adults, though illness management tends to deteriorate after adolescence during emerging
      adulthood, the unique developmental period beyond adolescence but before adulthood. All
      elements of the proposed study protocol were piloted in an NHLBI-funded pilot study
      (1R34HL107664-01A1 MacDonell). Results suggested feasibility and acceptability of the study
      protocol as well as proof of concept. The intervention is now being tested in a larger
      randomized clinical trial. The proposed study will include 192 African American emerging
      adults with moderate to severe persistent asthma and low controller medication adherence
      recruited from clinic and emergency department settings. Half of the sample will be
      randomized to receive a multi-component technology-based intervention (MCTI) targeting
      adherence to daily controller medication. The MCTI consists of two components: 1) 2 sessions
      of computer-delivered motivational interviewing targeting medication adherence, and 2)
      individualized text messaging focused on medication adherence between the sessions. Text
      messages will be individualized based on Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). The remaining
      half of participants will complete a series of computer-delivered asthma education modules
      matched for length, location, and method of delivery of the intervention session. Control
      participants will also receive text messages between intervention sessions. Message content
      will be the same for all control participants and contain general facts about asthma (not
      tailored). Youth will be recruited from the Detroit Medical Center, the only university
      affiliated medical center in Detroit, Michigan. It is hypothesized that youth randomized to
      MCTI will show improvements in adherence to medication (primary outcome) and asthma control
      (secondary outcome) compared to the comparison condition at all post-intervention follow ups
      (3, 6, 9, and 12 months).

    <description>The intervention group will receive two sessions of computer-delivered motivational interviewing via CIAS software programmed to target adherence to medications. The intervention group will also receive text messaged adherence reminders between sessions. Both the computer-delivered sessions and text messages will be tailored to the participant using ecological momentary assessment.</description>

    <description>Control participants complete CIAS-delivered asthma education modules matched for length, location, and method of delivery of the intervention session. Control participants complete each module at their own pace and then complete a short quiz to assess their knowledge. Control participants also receive text messages between intervention sessions. Message content is the same for all control participants and contains general facts about asthma (not tailored). Message timing is not tailored and is sent at the same time every day (4:00 PM--time chosen to avoid AM and PM medication times but to not interfere with sleep and school activities).</description>

    <description>The intervention group receives two sessions of computer-delivered MI via software programmed to target adherence to medications and text messaged adherence reminders between sessions. Sessions are provided by an avatar. The intervention engages the youth with the avatar's communication of empathy, optimism, and autonomy support. The intervention focuses the youth on adherence and relevant health behaviors with feedback on adherence, asthma symptoms, and tailored education. Participants are guided in the planning process through goal setting activities. The length of the intervention sessions are about 30 minutes each, with the total duration of the visit (assessment and intervention) lasting about 1.5 hours.</description>
