  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to characterize the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      rilpivirine (RPV) after intramuscular (IM) injection of rilpivirine long-acting parenteral
      formulation (RPV LA) nanosuspensions with different particle size distribution (PSD), in
      healthy adult participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open‐label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized
      (study medication is assigned by chance), parallel‐group, sequential study in healthy adult
      participants to characterize the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of rilpivirine (RPV) after
      intramuscular (IM) injection of RPV LA nanosuspensions with different particle size
      distributions (PSD), in healthy adult participants. A total of 110 healthy adult participants
      will be enrolled in this study. The study will consist of 2 treatment sessions in a fixed
      sequential order: Session 1- all participants will receive a single oral dose of rilpivirine
      25 milligram (mg) as oral immediate release solution on Day 1; Session 2- the participants
      will be randomized in session 2 on Day 1 in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to Treatments A, B, C, D and E.
      Each treatment group will receive a single IM injection of RPV LA on Day 1 of session 2.
      Session 1 and 2 will be separated by a washout period of at least 14 days. The total study
      duration for each participant will be approximately 9.5 months. Safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
