  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a stroke, people find it difficult to perform everyday activities independently, like
      getting dressed, preparing meals, and shopping, limiting their independence and requiring the
      assistance of a family member, friend or a home care worker. Losing one's independence can
      decrease quality of life. Functional exercise classes run by physical therapists where people
      with stroke practice getting in and out of a chair, stepping, and walking, can improve the
      ability to balance, walk, and do everyday activities. These classes are not commonly
      available in community centres, mainly because fitness instructors do not receive training in
      how to run exercise classes for people with stroke. Therefore there is a need to make these
      functional exercise programs available in local community centres.

      The objective of this project is to test procedures for running a large study to see whether
      people with stroke improve their ability to do everyday activities after participating in
      functional group exercise classes for 12 weeks in local community centres. If ability to do
      everyday activities improves, the investigators wish to see if the improvement is still
      present 3, 6 and 9 months later. Physical therapists at a nearby hospital will teach fitness
      instructors how to run the exercise class, help out during the classes, and answer questions
      by email or phone. Before conducting the larger Canada-wide study, it is important to
      determine the interest in such a program, the acceptability of the evaluations and the costs
      associated with the program, the degree of improvements resulting from the program, and if
      fitness instructors are able to run the program as planned.

      In Toronto, London and Pembroke, Canada, managers at a hospital and a nearby recreation
      centre have agreed to help run the exercise program. A recruiter will ask people with stroke
      who can walk and are being discharged home from the hospital whether they can be called about
      the study. People with stroke and a caregiver who agree to participate in the study will
      complete four evaluations when they enter the study, and 3, 6, and 12 months later. At each
      evaluation, people with stroke will perform tests of balance and walking, and complete
      questionnaires about their mood, participation in valued activities, and quality of life.
      After the first evaluation, the investigators will use a process like flipping a coin, to see
      if the person with stroke will begin the exercise program immediately or 12 months later. The
      investigators will call people each month to ask if a fall occurred. The investigators will
      interview exercise participants, family members and hospital/recreation staff at the end of
      the study to ask about the experiences.

      This project is unique because the program combines the expert knowledge and skills of
      physical therapists and fitness instructors. The exercise program involves practicing
      everyday movements, making the exercises easy for fitness instructors and people with stroke
      to learn. Each exercise has multiple levels of difficulty so the instructor can adapt
      exercises to how the person is feeling. The exercise program does not require expensive
      equipment (e.g. chairs, stepping stools) and therefore can be offered in most community
      centres. Finally, an extensive network of hospitals providing stroke care and community
      centres run by recreation organizations exists in Canada. Thus, if this program is
      beneficial, it could easily be made widely available.

      With the number of Canadians living with the consequences of stroke increasing every year,
      access to a functional exercise programs in local community centres will improve their
      ability to function and live independently in the community and reduce the burden on family
      or caregivers and on the healthcare system.

    <description>The intervention is a group, task-oriented exercise program involving two 1-hour exercise classes per week for 12 weeks. The class involves a seated warm-up, repetitive, progressive practice of functional balance and mobility tasks, and a seated cool down. The warm-up consists of active range-of-motion exercises, aerobic exercise, leg loading, stretching, and sit-to-stand training. The cool-down involves exercises with an emphasis on stretching and relaxation. Tasks are organized in a 3-station circuit completed by participants grouped by overall ability: Superstation 1: walking, aerobic training, and wall work (standing and reaching, wall push-ups); Superstation 2: standing weight shifts, coordinated with stepping and lunging; and Superstation 3: tap-ups, step-ups, and heel/toe raises, hamstring curls, marching-on-the-spot, and mini-squats. Participants are instructed to be physically active by walking in their neighbourhood, practicing the program exercises, or using the stairs.</description>
