  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to investigate whether a computer-based alert system in the electronic
      patient chart and order entry system using the Geneva Risk Score as clinical decision support
      tool to estimate the risk of venous thromboembolism improves the rate of appropriate
      thromboprophylaxis among hospitalized medical patients.

    <textblock>
      The use of thromboprophylaxis among acutely ill hospitalized medical patients remains
      inconsistent. The present study aims to improve the use of appropriate thromboprophylaxis by
      implementing a computer-based alert system combined with a Geneva Risk Score calculation tool
      in the electronic patient chart and order entry system. Consecutive acutely ill medical
      patients without indication for therapeutic anticoagulation or ongoing therapeutic
      anticoagulant treatment admitted to the medical wards of the University Hospital Bern,
      Switzerland, will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to the alert group in which an alert and the
      Geneva Risk Score calculation tool will be issued in the electronic patient chart or to the
      control group in which no alert will be issued. The primary endpoint is the rate of
      appropriate thromboprophylaxis during hospital stay.
