      The primary objective of the feasibility study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      the PQ Bypass Stent Graft System in the treatment of atherosclerotic lesions of the native
      superficial femoral artery (SFA) or the superficial femoral and proximal popliteal arteries.

      The primary safety endpoint for this study is freedom from a major adverse event (MAE) at 30
      days post-procedure. An MAE is defined as TLR, amputation of the treated limb or death.

      The primary effectiveness endpoint is defined as stent patency as evidenced by a peak
      systolic velocity ratio (PSVR) &lt; 2.5 from DUS obtained within the 12-month visit window with
      no clinically-driven re-intervention within the stented segment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years and of age of legal consent.

          2. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days
             prior to the index procedure.

          3. Subject has lifestyle limiting claudication or rest pain (Rutherford Becker scale 2-4)
             with a resting ABI &lt; 0.9. Resting TBI is utilized only if unable to reliably assess
             ABI. TBI must be &lt;0.7. These assessments are required for the target limb, but both
             limbs are preferred.

          4. A superficial femoral artery lesion with &gt;50% stenosis or occlusion which requires
             treatment.

          5. Stenotic lesion(s) or occluded length within the same vessel (one long or multiple
             serial lesions) ≥ 120mm to &lt; 200mm.

          6. Reference vessel diameter (RVD) ≥ 5.0mm and ≤ 6.7 mm, angiographically/CTA/MRA
             defined.

          7. Patent popliteal artery 3 cm proximal to tibial plateau

          8. At least 1 patent tibial artery to the foot (&lt;50% stenosis)

          9. The target lesion(s) can be successfully crossed with a guide wire and dilated.

         10. Poor aortoiliac or common femoral &quot;inflow&quot; (i.e. angiographically defined &gt;50%
             stenosis of the iliac or common femoral artery) that would be deemed inadequate to
             support a successful treatment of the target lesion without prior treatment. Adequate
             aortoiliac or common femoral &quot;inflow&quot; is defined as &lt;30% stenosis after either PTA or
             stenting of the inflow lesion. After treatment of the inflow lesion, the residual
             pressure gradient across the target lesion will be obtained and if the peak to peak
             pressure gradient is &lt; 20mmHg, the subject will be included in the study.

         11. A subject with bilateral obstructive SFA disease is eligible for enrollment into the
             study. The contra-lateral procedure should not be done until at least 30 days after
             the index procedure (staged); however, if contra-lateral treatment is performed prior
             to treatment of the target lesion, the waiting period will be at least 30 days prior
             to the index procedure.

         12. The subject is eligible for standard surgical repair, if necessary.

         13. A subject who requires a coronary intervention should have it performed at least 30
             days prior or 30 days post the treatment of the target lesion.

         14. Subject must provide written informed consent.

         15. Subject must be willing to comply with the specified follow-up evaluation schedule.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age greater than 90

          2. Thrombophlebitis or deep venous thrombus, within the previous 30 days.

          3. Receiving dialysis or immunosuppressant therapy within the previous 30 days.

          4. Thrombolysis of the target vessel within 72 hours prior to the index procedure, where
             complete resolution of the thrombus was not achieved.

          5. Stroke within the previous 90 days.

          6. Ipsilateral femoral aneurysm or aneurysm in the SFA or popliteal artery.

          7. Required stent placement via a popliteal approach.

          8. Procedures which are pre-determined to require stent-in-stent placement to obtain
             patency, such as in-stent restenosis.

          9. Significant vessel tortuosity or other parameters prohibiting access to the lesion or
             90° tortuosity which would prevent delivery of the stent device.

         10. Required stent placement within 1 cm of a previously deployed stent.

         11. Known allergies to any of the following: aspirin and clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix®),
             ticlopidine (Ticlid ®),and prasugrel (Effient®); heparin; Nitinol (nickel titanium);
             or contrast agent, that cannot be medically managed.

         12. Presence of thrombus prior to crossing the lesion.

         13. Known or suspected active infection at the time of the procedure.

         14. Use of cryoplasty, laser, or atherectomy devices in the target vessel at the time of
             index procedure.

         15. Restenotic lesion that had previously been treated by atherectomy, laser or cryoplasty
             within 3 months of the index procedure.

             international normalized ratio (INR) greater than 1.5, c. serum creatinine level
             greater than 2.0 mg/dL.

         19. Subject requires general anesthesia for the procedure.

         20. Major distal amputation (above the transmetatarsal) in the study or non-study limb.

         23. Previous bypass surgery on the target limb

         24. Subject is pregnant or plans to become pregnant during the study.

         25. Subject has a co-morbid illness that may result in a life expectancy of less than 1
             year.

         26. Subject is participating in an investigational study of a new drug, biologic or device
             at the time of study screening other than a PQ Bypass study.
