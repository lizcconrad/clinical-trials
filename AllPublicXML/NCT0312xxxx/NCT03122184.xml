  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled pilot trial in 50 acute coronary syndrome patients to
      determine if a 12 week, telephone-delivered, combined positive psychology-motivational
      interviewing intervention is more effective than a health behavior education program at
      improving health behaviors and other outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that the
      intervention will be associated with better mental and physical health outcomes and better
      health behavior adherence compared to the health behavior education program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The initial study visit will occur in-person two weeks after discharge from the hospital.
      Participants will meet with a member of the study staff (the study &quot;trainer&quot;) and complete
      self-report questionnaires assessing health behavior adherence and mental and physical
      health. Then, participants will be randomized to receive the positive psychology + goal
      setting or the health behavior education interventions. A study interventionist will provide
      a treatment manual specific to their condition, review the rationale for the initial
      exercise, and assign the first exercise. If the participant is in the positive psychology +
      goal setting condition, the trainer will explain the rationale for both the positive
      psychology and goal-setting portions of the program, and will be assigned the first exercise.
      Similarly, if the participant is randomized into the health behavior education program, the
      interventionist will introduce them to the program and assign the first exercise.
      Participants in both groups will then be given an accelerometer, which they will be asked to
      wear for 7 days to ensure that they are comfortable with the device and that useable data can
      be obtained from the participant. Participants in both groups will then complete twelve
      30-minute weekly phone sessions with a study trainer. The phone sessions primarily will
      include a review of the prior week's session content and a discussion of the rationale and
      assignment of the next week's exercise/assignment. Upon the completion of these calls, and
      again at a final follow-up timepoint at 24 weeks, a blinded member of the study staff will
      call participants to administer self-report outcome measures. Participants will also be asked
      to wear an accelerometer at each of these follow-up timepoints as an objective measure of
      physical activity, which they will return by mail to the study staff.
