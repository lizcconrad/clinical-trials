  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to establish target engagement and identify an effective dose the investigators will
      conduct a placebo-controlled single-dose parallel group trial of levetiracetam 185 mg and 500
      mg in 24 medication-naïve early psychosis (EP) patients, measuring hippocampal activity by
      pulsed arterial spin labelling (ASL) pre-dose and 2 hours post-dose. The lower dose is
      calculated to achieve blood levels within the range that were associated with reduced
      hippocampal activity and improved cognition in patients with mild cognitive impairment; the
      higher dose is a typical antiepileptic dose. Successful demonstration of target engagement
      will be defined by an effect size of 0.5 or greater compared to placebo in reduction by
      levetiracetam of hippocampal blood flow measured by ASL. The optimal dose will be defined by
      maximal reduction of hippocampal perfusion in the absence of clinically-significant adverse
      effects. The investigators will also study 8 healthy control subjects to verify that baseline
      hippocampal blood flow is elevated in the sample of FEP subjects.

             for at least 4 weeks.
