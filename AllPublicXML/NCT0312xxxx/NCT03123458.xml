  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of infusion of the third party
      fully-characterized clonally derived fetal MSCs (cfMSCs) for the control of severe symptoms
      associated with acute and chronic immune-related disorders and tissue damage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MSCs have been extensively studied and clinically evaluated for the treatment of autoimmune
      diseases and graft versus host disease (GVHD) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HSCT). The variable source of MSCs and the lack of consistency of primary tissue-derived
      MSCs are major obstacles to reliable translational applications of such therapeutic cell
      products. Fetal tissue-derived clonal MSCs (cfMSCs) have extended expansion potential and
      express rich levels of various growth factors, and thus can achieve quality consistency.
      Careful evaluation of fMSCs in clinical studies has not been conducted. Autoimmune diseases
      involve aberrant immune responses that harm tissues and organs. GVHD is a serious and often
      fatal problem associated with HSCT. MSCs have immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive effects.
      In many studies, MSCs have demonstrated promising beneficial effects that reduce severe
      autoimmune reactions, diminish symptoms of chronic GvHD and therapy-resistant acute GvHD
      including steroid-resistant GVHD. The safety and therapeutic effects of phenotype and
      functionally characterized fMSCs still require extensive clinical evaluation. This study aims
      to assess the safety and the potential beneficial effects of infusion of various dosages of
      third party fMSCs for the control of severe symptoms associated with acute and chronic
      immune-related disorders.
