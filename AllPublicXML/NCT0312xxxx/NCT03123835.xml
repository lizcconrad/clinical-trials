  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last few years there have been numerous advances in the use of endoscopic equipment
      and related treatments in the identification and intervention of gastrointestinal diseases.
      Many of these treatments using flexible endoscopes have either complimented or replaced
      surgical approaches to these same benign and malignant disease processes with the potential
      of being the standard of care for many of these clinical conditions. The initial primary
      focus of this study will be the use of endoscopic myotomy for achalasia, endoscopic treatment
      of post bariatric weight gain, endoscopic gastro-gastric fistula treatments, and other
      endoluminal therapies for gastrointestinal and post-operative conditions. These treatments
      have been validated by prior surgery studies.

    <description>Patients meeting inclusion criteria for possible surgical therapies for their current condition (IE Achelasia, Enlarged Gastric Pouch and/or Gastrogastric Fistula after primary weight loss surgery, etc) will be educated on the different therapy options including traditional laparoscopic surgery and/or Endoscopic Interventions including POEM (Percutaneous Oral Endoscopic Myomectomy for the treatment of Achelasia) or Endoscoscopic Pouch/GastroJejunostomy repair or closure of the Gastrogastric Fistula as examples.</description>

    <description>After reviewing all therapeutic options the patient will be offered the best therapeutic option to treat their condition. Surgical interventions include open laparotomy, diagnostic/therapeutic laparoscopy or endoluminal therapies. After the patient is consented for the related surgical intervention the patient will be given the option to participate in the clinical study to measure outcomes after surgery.</description>
