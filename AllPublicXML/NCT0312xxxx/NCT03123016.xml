  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is a common acquired disorder of pigmentation affecting 0.5% to 1% of the world
      population. Sharply demarcated patches of depigmentation, which can affect all ethnicities,
      and can lead to cosmetic disfiguration and psychosocial distress, characterize the disease.
      The etiology of vitiligo remains unknown. Various mechanisms have been proposed, such as
      autoimmunity, self-destruction, biochemical, genetic, neural, oxidative stress, and an
      imbalance of epidermal cytokines leading to inflammation and selective loss of epidermal
      melanocytes. Currently, the most popular theory is autoimmunity. Previous studies noted that
      around 25-30% of patients have at least one other autoimmune disease, such as autoimmune
      thyroid disease, Addison's disease, pernicious anemia, and alopecia areata. Currently, NB-UVB
      phototherapy is the most widely used therapeutic option for vitiligo affecting more than
      10-20% of the skin surface, as it is generally considered to be a safe initial treatment.
      Potential side effects include phototoxic reaction, thickening of the skin and
      koebnerization. NB-UVB is a band of UV radiation with a wavelength of 311-313 nm. UVB induces
      mitogenesis and migration in melanocytes mediated by several factors such as IL-1, TNF alpha,
      and leukotriene C4. UV radiation produces increased number and activity of melanocytes,
      increased melanin density, elongation and branching of dendrites, with increased transfer of
      more heavily melanized melanosomes to keratinocytes, seen clinically as increased
      pigmentation. Apremilast is an oral small molecule phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor that
      has been shown to regulate inflammatory mediators. Apremilast enters cells by passive
      diffusion and, once intracellular, binds PDE4. PDE-4, the dominant phosphodiesterase
      expressed in immune cells, degrades cyclic AMP (cAMP) into AMP. PDE4 inhibition thereby
      elevates intracellular cAMP, which can down-regulate the inflammatory responses such as
      TNF-α, IFN-γ, interleukins (IL) 2, 12 and 23 through mechanisms such as partially inhibiting
      expression of inflammatory cytokines and increasing expression of anti-inflammatory mediators
      such as IL2 and IL10. The hypothesis is that apremilast will shut down the inflammatory
      insult in vitiligo and NB-UVB phototherapy will then be able to regenerate melanocytes and
      their activity. By examination of skin biopsies taken pre- and post-therapy, the study team
      aims to assess changes in immune and cellular markers in affected skin.

    <time_frame>Week 32 and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>One hand unit, which encompasses the palm plus the volar surface of all the digits, is approximately 1% of the total body surface area and is used as a guide to estimate the baseline percentage of vitiligo involvement in each body region. The body is divided into five separate and mutually exclusive regions: hands, upper extremities (excluding hands), trunk, lower extremities (excluding feet), and feet. The axillary region is included with the upper extremities while the buttocks and inguinal areas are included with the lower extremities. The extent of residual depigmentation is expressed by the following percentages: 0, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, or 100%. At 100% depigmentation, no pigment is present; at 90%, specks of pigment are present; at 75%, the depigmented area exceeds the pigmented area; at 50%, the depigmented and pigmented areas are equal; at 25%, the pigmented area exceeds the depigmented area; at 10%, only specks of depigmentation are present.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 64 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The VETF is a validated scoring system that assesses 3 dimensions of the disease (extent, staging, and spreading/progression). (1) the extent of vitiligo will be estimated as the percentage of vitiligo involvement of 5 body sites. (2) Stage of vitiligo will be assessed as 0 (normal pigmentation), 1 (incomplete depigmentation), 2 (complete depigmentation), 3 (partial hair whitening [&lt;30%]), and 4 (complete hair whitening). (3) Spreading of vitiligo will be scored as 0 (stable disease), −1 (observed ongoing subclinical repigmentation), and +1 (additional patches in a given area or observed ongoing subclinical depigmentation). The VETF score calculated as follows:
VETF Extent or Staging or Spreading = Sum of all specific values for that category from all body sites (% of Area affected for Extent; 0-20 for Staging; -5 to +5 for Spreading).</description>

    <description>The DLQI is a simple 10-question validated questionnaire that has been used in over 40 different skin conditions, and its use has been described in over 1000 publications including many multinational studies.

    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 64 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is commonly used as the outcome measure in research studies. A VAS for satisfaction is a horizontal line of 100-mm long. At the beginning and at the end, there are two descriptors representing extremes of satisfaction (i.e. no satisfaction and extreme satisfaction). The patients rate their satisfaction by making a vertical mark on the 100-mm line. The measurement in millimeters is converted to the same number of points ranging from 0 to 100 points. The exact question will be &quot;Are you satisfied with your study treatment?&quot;</description>

    <measure>Number of Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 64 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Safety analyses will be performed on the safety population. Safety will be evaluated by tabulations of adverse events (AEs) and will be presented with descriptive statistics at each visit. AEs will be coded using the CTCAE, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, V 4.0. The CTCAE v4.0 AE terms are MedDRA's LLTs (Lowest Level Terms) which are based on their MedDRA (System Organ Class). The number and percentage of subjects experiencing an AE/SAE will be stratified by system organ class, or a preferred term, and/or severity of the adverse event, and recorded and tabulated overall.</description>
