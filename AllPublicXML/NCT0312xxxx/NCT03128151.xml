  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NMB (Neuromuscular Blockade) is the most frequent complication in anesthesiology
      associated with an increase in adverse respiratory events in the postoperative period. Its
      appearance depends on multiple factors. The introduction of a comprehensive educational
      strategy aimed at promoting the proper management of NMB in the intraoperative period and a
      package of measures that must be performed (intraoperative neuromuscular monitoring and
      reversal of the effect of neuromuscular blockers) may contribute to a decrease in the
      incidence of NMB, Increase safety in the surgical patient and decrease associated costs.

      Multicenter, epidemiological, prospective, randomized, sequential study. The introduction of
      an educational program and a package of clinical measures (specific monitoring and
      pharmacological reversion) in the incidence of NMB will be evaluated by evaluating variations
      in this incidence of NMB, the rate of compliance with the preventive measures and the
      perception of the Safety in the perioperative, through pre and postoperative survey.
