  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this explanatory mixed methods study is to compare a novel attachment system
      (Novaloc) to a traditional alternative (Locator) for single implants in the mandible of
      edentate elders. The investigators will carry out a randomized cross-over clinical trial
      comparing Novaloc attachments to Locators for single-implant mandibular overdentures in
      edentate elders. Participants will be followed for three months with each attachment type;
      patient-based, clinical and economic outcomes will be gathered. A sample of 26 participants
      is estimated to be required to detect clinically relevant differences in terms of the primary
      outcome (patient ratings of general satisfaction). Participants will choose which attachment
      they wish to keep, then be interviewed about their experiences and preferences with a single
      implant prosthesis and with the 2 attachments. Data from the quantitative and qualitative
      assessments will be integrated through a mixed-methods explanatory strategy. A last
      quantitative assessment will take place after 12 months with preferred attachment; this
      latter assessment will enable the observation of attachments' long-term wear and maintenance
      events.
