  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) issued the definition and
      classification system of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), and received widespread
      recognition. Currently, it has become an important reference for clinical treatment of POPF.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The definition of POPF released by ISGPS in 2016 still seems to have certain deficiency. For
      example, in both definitions in 2005 and 2016, the re-operation is used as an important
      judgment index of &quot;Grade C POPF&quot;. But a unified standard or consensus is still lacked for the
      indication of POPF re-operation, which may finally impact the diagnosis of &quot;Grade C POPF&quot;.
      Therefore, we performed this study, so as to better improve the relevant definition and
      provide guidance for the diagnosis and treatment.
