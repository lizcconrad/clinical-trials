  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate differences in ILC2 blood levels
      between asthma patients and control patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives of this study are:

      To show that ILC2 levels differ between asthma patients with a &quot;TH2&quot; (helper T cell type 2)
      profile and asthma patients with a &quot;non-TH2&quot; profile. A TH2 profile is defined as (for a
      given patient):

        -  circulating eosinophils &gt; 500 mm^3 at least once during the year AND

        -  positive allergy skin or specific IgE (Immunoglobulin E) test AND

        -  induced sputum eosinophil level &gt;3% of leukocytes AND

        -  exhaled nitric oxide &gt; 25 ppb.

      To study the variation in ILC2 levels over time among asthma patients who obtained a good
      level of control compared to other patients. A good level of control is defined as:

        -  no exacerbations during 6 months of followup (an exacerbation is defined as the
           un-planned need for care that modifies the patient's prescription for &gt;48h)

        -  FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) value current / FEV1 best value &gt; 0.8

        -  symptom levels correspond to an ACQ (Asthma Control Questionnaire) questionnaire score
           of &lt; 0.75 over the last 7 days
