  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different conditions of gait ignition freezing, spontaneous freezing during walking and
      turning freezing on encountering obstacle will be investigated in fMRI study to examine
      whether different regions of brain will be involved under different conditions of freezing.
      We hypothesize that anterior cortical regions will engage in gait ignition failure, deep
      locomotion regions will be responsible for spontaneous freezing and schema regions will be
      involved in the generation of turning freezing on seeing the barrier. In the third part of
      the project, we will deliver a 5-day session of transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) to the motor cortex of the FOG patients to examine whether the intervention will
      benefit the patients. Based on the signal source findings, we will investigate whether the
      possible tDCS beneficial effect will be different or similar in patients with different
      electric sources. In addition, how long the possible beneficial effect of tDCS can be
      consolidated after the 5-day course of stimulation is crucial and requires to be elucidated
      under the research project. We aim to peep the myth of FOG in PD by the multi-modality
      approach and hope the study will benefit the long suffering patients.

    <description>Device: Transcranial direct current stimulation In tDCS,the anodal pad was tapped over the primary motor cortex and the cathode pad was adhered of the contralateral frontal region. A constant current of 2.0 mA will be apply for up to 20 min, with a linear fade in /fade out of 10 s in anodal and cathodal conditions resulting in a current density of 0.8A/M2 which is 177 times below the lesion effect of tDCS in the rats study(142.9A/m2)</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        The diagnosis of freezing of gait will be made by the following criteria:

          1. Without video:Is there any feeling that your feet are transiently glued to the floor
             while trying to initiate walking, making a turn or when walking through narrow spaces
             or in crowded places? (Sometimes it can be accompanied with trembling of the legs and
             small shuffling steps.)

          2. Additional instructions with video:We will watch a short video together to see the
             many ways in which freezing can occur. Also, look carefully for how long these
             episodes last, as you can expect some questions on this later.

          3. Patient is diagnosed to have freezing of gait if &quot;I have experienced such a feeling or
             episode over the past month&quot; was answered.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Impairment of cognition that leads unable to fully cooperate with the oral commands
             during examinations.

          2. Moderate to severe medical disorders such as functional III or above congestive heart
             failure, or cancer with distant metastasis etc.

          3. Hoehn and Yahr stage 5.
