      Analyze the effect of preincubation time of oocyte on the results of ICSI in a oocyte
      donation model.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an intense communication inside the follicular structure. Bidirectional information
      between the oocyte and the granulosa cells is needed for a normal follicular development and
      oocyte competence.

      There are conflicting results on the effect of pre-incubation time in ICSI.

      It is not clear the proper time to denudate the oocyte from the somatic cells prior to ICSI,
      and some authors describe a negative impact of the premature cummulus removal on the ICSI
      results.

      The aim of this study is to investigate wheter a preincubation time between oocyte retireval
      and injection has any effect on the ICSI ( intracytoplasmatic sperm injection) results .

    <description>Donated oocytes were randomly allocated to two groups concerning the time of cumulus corona removal.
The first group: After oocyte retrieval, cumulus cells were immediately removed and then ICSI was performed; in the second group, the oocyte-cumulus complexes were incubated for 4 hours. Afterwards, the granulosa cells were removedand ICSI was immediately performed.</description>
