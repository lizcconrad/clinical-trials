      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab in
      combination with radiation therapy and find out what effects, if any, this combination has on
      people, and whether it improves overall survival.

    <description>Patients will receive durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab together every 4 weeks. SBRT delivered to one metastatic site using a standard 9Gy x 3 fractions will be given within 2 weeks after the completion of the first cycle of durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab. After 4 cycles of durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab, patients will then continue with single agent durvalumab (MEDI4736) every 4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or a total of 12 months from date of initial treatment.</description>
