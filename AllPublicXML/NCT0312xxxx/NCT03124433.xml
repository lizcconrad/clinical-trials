  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated phase II single arm trial, combining neoadjuvant
      apalutamide (ARN509) with radical prostatectomy, in the treatment of D'Amico intermediate to
      high risk organ-confined prostate cancer. Apalutamide has shown efficacy in castrate
      resistant prostate cancer in phase II studies and are now in phase III trials combined with
      radiation in organ confined disease.

      The primary study objectives include assessment of (i) oncological efficacy as determined by
      tumour downstaging and achievement of nadir PSA The secondary study objectives include(i)
      determination of adverse effects related to apalutamide and surgical complication rates (ii)
      human prostate tissue effect of apalutamide

      The study will recruit thirty eligible participants who will receive 12 weeks of oral
      apalutamide 240mg daily. This will be followed by standard-of-care radical prostatectomy. The
      total trial duration is 26 weeks.

      This is a phase II single arm study looking at the efficacy of 12 weeks of neoadjuvant
      apalutamide (ARN 509), combined with standard-of-care radical prostatectomy, for D'Amico
      intermediate to high risk prostate cancer patients. The phases of the study will include:
      screening, treatment and follow-up phases.

      Safety will be monitored throughout the study.
