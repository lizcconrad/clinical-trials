      This study will be to compare the pharmacokinetics of nalmefene administration intranasal
      with and without an absorption enhancer compared to an intramuscular injection.

      This study will be an inpatient, double-blind, randomized, crossover study involving 14
      healthy volunteers. Each subject will receive 4 treatments during the 4 dosing
      periods.Subjects will stay in the inpatient facility for 17 days to complete the entire study
      and be discharged following completion of discharge procedures at the end of the last period.
      Subjects will be called 3 to 5 days after discharge to inquire concerning adverse events and
      concomitant medications since discharge. After obtaining informed consent, subject will be
      screened for eligibility. ON the day after clinic admission, subjects will be administered
      the intranasal-formulated drug in randomized order with 4 days between doses; the
      intramuscular dose will be administered during the fourth (last) treatment period.
