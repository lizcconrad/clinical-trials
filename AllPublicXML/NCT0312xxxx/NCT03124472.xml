      Pfannenstiel incision of skin and opening of the anterior abdominal wall in layers.

        -  The loose peritoneum of the lower uterine segment is dissected downwards to mobilize the
           urinary bladder and expose the lower uterine segment.

        -  Uterine artery ligation was performed by grasping the broad ligament with thumb anterior
           and the index finger lifting the base below the site uterine incision; the uterine
           artery was singly ligated with No. 1 vicryl suture. Myometrium was included so that
           uterine vessels are not damaged.

        -  Cresenteric lower uterine segment incision was performed as usual. Higher incisions were
           performed in cases where the traditional incision was expected to be directly through
           the placenta Delivery of the baby and placenta.

        -  Closure of the uterine incision in 2 layers with N0. 1 vicryl suture.

        -  Closure of the anterior abdominal wall in layers
