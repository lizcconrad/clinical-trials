  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a Phase II clinical trial. Patients will receive intensity modulated total body
      irradiation (TBI) at a dose of 3 Gy with standard fludarabine/ i.v. cyclophosphamide
      conditioning prior to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT).

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the engraftment at Day +60 following
      HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant protocol using immunosuppressive agents
      and low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) for conditioning and post-transplant
      cyclophosphamide in patients with sickle cell disease.

    <description>Patients who achieve &lt; 5% peripheral blood donor chimerism by Day +30 and do not have a Day +60 measure will be regarded as failing to achieve full donor chimerism by Day +60; patients who achieve &gt; 5% donor chimerism by Day +30 but do not have a Day +60 measure will be considered nonevaluable for the primary endpoint.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive the following conditioning regimen: ATG, fludarabine (6 days before stem cell infusion), cyclophosphamide, and total body irradiation. The stem cell product will be infused according to BMT unit policy. Patients will also receive GVHD prophylaxis which will consist of cyclophosphamide, sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil according to the protocol. Post-transplant evaluation will be done as per standard care with study data collected at days 30, 60, 100, 180, 365, and annually thereafter.</description>

          6. Estimated GFR ≥ 50mL/min/1.73m2 as calculated by the modified MDRD equation

          7. ALT ≤ 3x upper limit of normal
