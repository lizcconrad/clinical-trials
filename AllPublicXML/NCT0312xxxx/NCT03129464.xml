    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized controlled trial examining post-operative pain scores and outcomes
      after laparoscopic hysterectomy in patients prescribed cold therapy as an adjunct to routine
      post-operative multi-modal analgesia, compared to those patients prescribed routine
      multi-modal analgesia without cold therapy. All patients scheduled for total laparoscopic
      hysterectomy (without robotic-assistance) will be screened for eligibility in the study. If
      eligible, patients will be invited to participate in the study and standardized informed
      consent process will ensue. After surgery is completed participants will be randomized to
      either the control group or the study group. The study group will be prescribed the use of
      cold therapy to their abdominal incisions through reusable cold gel packs. The cold therapy
      is to be applied to participants' incisions for the first three postoperative days, in
      addition to routine post-operative analgesia regimen. Investigators will then collect
      information on pain scores, narcotic use, quality of life and surgical recovery scores.

      This study aims to examine if there is a difference in post-operative pain scores with the
      application of cold therapy to laparoscopic abdominal incisions following laparoscopic
      hysterectomy, when compared to no cold therapy. Secondarily, investigators will examine
      post-operative quality of life scores, postoperative surgical recovery scores, as well as
      narcotic use among the two groups. Investigators also aim to ascertain additional information
      regarding total quantity of narcotics used post-operatively to aid in prescribing patterns.
