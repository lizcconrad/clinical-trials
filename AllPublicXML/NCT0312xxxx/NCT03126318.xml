    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic effects of a single dose of the study drug or placebo
      administered subcutaneously to patients with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD)
      and persistent inflammation (defined as a persistently elevated serum CRP (C-Reactive
      Protein) level). The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of a single dose of the
      study drug delivered subcutaneously. Four CKD patients will be randomized to the study drug
      or placebo within each dosing cohort in a ratio of 3:1. The dosing cohorts are 5 mg, 15 mg,
      50 mg, and 100 mg. Each patient will be given 1 dose of the study drug and then be followed
      for 12 weeks for primary safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments. Next,
      patients will continue to be followed for an additional 20 weeks (32 weeks observation in
      total) for safety and anti-drug antibody assessments.

      Prior to dose escalation (i.e., higher total dose than studied in the preceding cohorts),
      there will be a formal safety review and the data will have been determined to be acceptable
      by a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) which will include at least one nephrologist. The
      safety review required for dose escalation will include at least 21 days of treatment data
      from the preceding cohort(s). The DSMB will also meet to review data concerning an SAE
      (Serious Adverse Event) that is suspected to be study drug related

      The investigative team (other than an un-blinded research pharmacist or equivalent) will be
      blinded to the treatment assignment.
