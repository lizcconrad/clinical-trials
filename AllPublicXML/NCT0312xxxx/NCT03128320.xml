  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to analyse skin blood flow in diabetic patients with peripheral
      artery disease. The patients receive a single dose of placebo, 1 mg BAY1193397, and 5 mg
      BAY1193397. The analysis of safety and tolerability are secondary objectives of this study.

             metabolism or excretion of study drugs, including, but not limited to: history of

             recordings

          -  Diastolic blood pressure below 50 or above 110 mmHg at the screening visit based on

          -  Heart rate below 50 or above 100 beats/min at screening (obtained from ECG)

          -  Clinically relevant findings in the physical examination which, in the opinion of the
