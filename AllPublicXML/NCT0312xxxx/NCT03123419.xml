  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Gardasil study is to increase the rates of Gardasil vaccination at a
      maternal fetal Care Center. This will be done by reminding patients via text to come for
      follow up vaccine appointments.

      Patients will be screened in center for history of Gardasil vaccination. If the patient has
      not received the vaccination series they will be counseled/educated (standard of care [SOC })
      and offered the vaccine series. If the patient agrees to the vaccination, they will then be
      offered participation in this study, (consent will be reviewed and signed) and they will
      receive the first vaccination at this visit, administered according to standard protocol. The
      patient will then be scheduled for two follow up vaccination appointments. The second
      vaccination will be given 2 months after the first vaccine and the third will be given 4
      months after the second vaccination in accordance with the Gardasil vaccine guidelines. -SOC

      The patients will receive a total of two texts during the study entirety. The two texts will
      be appointment reminders for the second and third vaccination, sent 1 week prior to the next
      appointment. This is study related.

      Data collection Data will be collected using a data collection sheet. The investigators will
      record date of first vaccine administration and adherence to follow up.vaccinations.
