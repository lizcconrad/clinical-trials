  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and how well pembrolizumab with or
      without anetumab ravtansine work in treating patients with mesothelin-positive pleural
      mesothelioma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as anetumab ravtansine and pembrolizumab, may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the dose of anetumab ravtansine that is safe in combination with MK-3475
      (pembrolizumab) to be used in the randomized phase 2 study. (Phase I safety lead-in) II.
      Determine if the overall response rate of the combination of anetumab ravtansine and MK-3475
      (pembrolizumab) is superior to MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) alone. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the progression free survival of anetumab ravtansine and MK-3475
      (pembrolizumab) compared to MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) alone.

      II. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of anetumab ravtansine and MK-3475
      (pembrolizumab) on soluble megakaryocyte potentiating factor (MPF).

      III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of anetumab ravtansine and MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).

      IV. To evaluate mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) function, FcgammaRs, hormone and chemokine
      mediators as methods to evaluate factors affecting the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
      of these agents.

      V. To determine the incidence of antibodies directed against anetumab ravtansine.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine whether elevations in Bim in TTR predict responses to treatment and whether
      its detection is dynamic with treatment.

      II. To determine whether soluble PD-L1 predicts responses to treatment and whether its
      detection is dynamic with treatment.

      III. To evaluate PD-L1 expression in archival tissue as a predictive marker of response to
      MK-3475 (pembrolizumab)-based therapy.

      IV. To explore the symptomatic adverse events (AE) for tolerability of each treatment group
      using patient reported outcomes (PRO)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Upon radiologic documentation of disease progression, patients pay cross over to
      Group II.

      GROUP II: Patients receive anetumab ravtansine IV over 1 hour and pembrolizumab IV over 30
      minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.

               -  Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol

               -  Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol

               -  Investigational agents other than anetumab ravtansine and MK-3475 (pembrolizumab)

                    -  Note: Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may
                       be considered on an exceptional case by case basis after consultation with
                       Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP); the patient must have clear
                       measurable disease outside the radiated field; administration of palliative
                       radiation therapy will be considered clinical progression for the purposes
                       of determining progression free survival (PFS)

               -  Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while
                  participating in the trial; examples of live vaccines include, but are not
                  limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever,
                  rabies, Bacillus Chalmette-Guerin (BCG), and typhoid (oral) vaccine; seasonal
                  influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are
                  allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist) are live
                  attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed

               -  Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an
                  event of suspected immunologic etiology; the use of physiologic doses of
                  corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the study principal
                  investigator (PI) and CTEP

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated with anetumab ravtansine or MK-3475 (pembrolizumab)

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients are eligible provided they meet
             all the other protocol eligibility criteria including the following:

               -  Undetectable HIV viral load by standard clinical assay

               -  Willing to adhere to antiretroviral therapy that has minimal overlapping toxicity
                  or pharmacokinetic interactions with protocol therapy

               -  CD4+ T cell counts of 200/mm^3 or greater

               -  No acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining events other within the
                  past 12 months

               -  Near normal life expectancy if not for the presence of the cancer Also,
                  HIV-positive patients must not be on HIV medications considered to be inhibitors
                  or inducers of CYP3A4

             exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy, or in situ cervical cancer

          -  Receipt of transfusion of blood products (including platelets or red blood cells) or
             administration of colony stimulating factors (including granulocyte colony-stimulating

             recombinant erythropoietin) within 4 weeks prior to study treatment

          -  Patient with active interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis or a prior history of
             ILD/pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids
