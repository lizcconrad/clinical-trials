  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Prospective, Open-label, Single-Arm, Multi-center phase II clinical trial
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of Apatinib for Chemotherapy Failure Ⅳ Stage Soft Tissue
      Sarcoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of sarcoma patients in stage IV is poor. For STS, the response rate of
      chemotherapy is only 20-35% and the median survival time is about 12 months. The 5 year
      survival rate is lower than 10% reported in several large-scale studies. Although
      chemotherapy plays a major role in the treatment of advanced STS, the classic chemotherapy
      agents are not curative. Combination chemotherapy or dose-dense regimens have largely failed
      to improve the response rates. Long-term using of cytotoxic drugs increased the risk of
      toxicity in patients. Apatinib is a small molecular inhibitor of Vascular Epithelial Growth
      Factor Receptor-2 (VEGFR-2). It has been approved as a second-line treatment for advanced
      gastric cancer. Several phase III clinical studies of non small cell lung cancer, liver
      cancer, colorectal cancer and other tumors also showed apatinib has less toxic side effects
      and better patient tolerance. However, the clinical application of apatinib in STS is still
      lack of evidence-based medicine. And this clinical trial is designed to prospectively
      investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in stage IV sarcoma patients who failed in
      chemotherapy.
