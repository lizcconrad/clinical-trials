      75 subjects at risk for HIV infection (25 high risk MSM and 50 sero-discordant couples) will
      be recruited. All subjects will receive Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP, as well
      as routine medical evaluations during one year. Subjects will be managed according to CDC's
      guidelines on the management of PrEP as a tool for HIV prevention.

      All subjects will have a total of at least 8 study visits during which routine assessment are
      performed for patients on Truvada for PrEP. Apart from offering routine medical care, a
      baseline questionnaire that includes socio-demographic variables, PrEP knowledge and
      acceptability and sexual conducts will be offered. At the 6 months visit, an abbreviated
      sexual conducts questionnaire will be offered.
