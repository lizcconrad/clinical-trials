  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention functions have a major impact on children's social and school behavior. They are an
      important issue for prematurely born children often seen as having learning difficulties and
      being restless, when it could be an adaptative answer to attention disorders. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate attention capacity in former premature children aged 6-7 years old with
      regards to different postures or mobility, for the attention functions of orienting, alerting
      and executive control. The Attention Network Test using reaction time and accuracy to visual
      stimuli will be used to evaluate attention functions in each posture and mobility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention functions have a major impact on children's social, school and emotional
      adjustment. They are one of the most common issues for prematurely born children with
      implications in academic and social-behavioral functioning. Prematurely born infants are
      often seen as having excessive mobility or being restless when it could be an adaptative
      answer to attention disorders leading to learning difficulties. Respecting spontaneous
      mobility could improve attention performance in vulnerable children. The aim of the study is
      to evaluate global attention performance of former premature children at the preschool age of
      6 to 7 years. This evaluation will be done in three usual postures or mobility, and for the 3
      attentional functions of orienting, alerting or executive control. They will be compared
      within the prematurely born children group and to term born controls of the same age. The
      Attention Network Test adapted to children by Rueda et al (Neuropsychologia 2004) using
      reaction time and accuracy to visual stimuli will be used to evaluate attention functions.
      Presentation of stimuli through virtual video glasses and collection of answers will be done
      thanks to a specific software.
