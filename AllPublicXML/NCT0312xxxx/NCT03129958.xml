      The study population and sampling were calculated by Raosoft sample size calculator using an
      estimated average of population size 200 and allowing a 5% tolerable error, based on a 95%
      confidence interval (CI).

      About 140 female office workers were targeted from the medical colleges of University of
      Dammam (UoD); Medicine, Applied Medical Science, Nursing, Dentistry, Clinical Pharmacology
