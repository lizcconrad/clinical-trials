      Although the response rate by first-line treatment has been improved, most adult patients
      with relapsed or refractory ALL will eventually relapse with poor outcomes regardless of
      treatments. To further understand current status of the treatment of adult patients with
      relapsed or refractory ALL in China, the study retrospectively collected diagnosis and
      treatment data from ALL patients in 14 centers in China. Primary objective: to estimate the
      proportion of patients in overall response rate (ORR) for early relapsed or primary
      refractory Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph-) B-precursor ALL patients following salvage
      treatment (i.e., proportion of patients in hematological complete remission [CR] and CR with
      partial recovery of blood cells [CRh*]); Secondary objectives included: to estimate the
      proportion of patients in CR, CRh* and CRi(CR/CRh*/CRi) and the duration of CR/CRh*/CRi,
      overall survival, duration of CR/CRh*and the proportion of patients receiving allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AlloHSCT) for early relapsed/primary refractory
      Ph-B-precursor ALL patients following salvage treatment; Exploratory objectives included: to
      estimate the efficacy in late relapsed Ph- B-precursor ALL (first remission duration &gt; 12
      months) patients and in Ph+ B-precursor ALL patients and specific subgroup patients following
      salvage treatment.

      Title A Retrospective Study to Evaluate the Hematological Remission Rates and Survival Among
      Chinese Adult Patients with Relapsed or Refractory B-precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
      (BLING)

      Key Words Relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia, complete remission, duration
      of remission, overall survival, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation

      Study Background and Rationale Although the response rate by first-line treatment has been
      improved, most adult patients with relapsed or refractory ALL will eventually relapse with
      poor outcome regardless of treatments. In order to improve the diagnosis and treatment level
      of adult ALL in China, Chinese Society of Hematology and Committee of Hematologic
      Malignancies of the Chinese Anti-Cancer Association released Expert Consensus on Diagnosis
      and Treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Chinese Adult Patients in 2012. However,
      there is no nationwide multi-center retrospective observational study to evaluate the
      treatment status of adult patients with R/r ALL (including treatment regimens, and remission
      rate, overall survival and rate of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation of R/r
      ALL patients following standard salvage chemotherapy), and these data will provide an
      important reference for further standardization of the treatment of ALL in China, improvement
      of the prognosis and the research and development of new drugs.

      Study questions and Objectives

      Primary objectives:

      To estimate the proportion of patients in overall response rate (ORR) for early relapsed (a
      first remission duration of ≤12 months) or primary refractory R/r Philadelphia chromosome
      negative (Ph-) B-precursor ALL patients following salvage treatment (i.e., proportion of
      patients in hematological complete remission [CR] and CR with partial recovery of blood cells
      [CRh*]).

      Secondary objectives:

      To estimate the proportion of patients in CR, CRh* or CRi for early relapsed/primary
      refractory Ph-B-precursor ALL patients following salvage treatment (CR/CRh*/CRi) To estimate
      overall survival (OS) for early relapsed/primary refractory Ph-B-precursor ALL patients
      following salvage treatment To estimate the duration of CR/CRh* for early relapsed/primary
      refractory Ph-B-precursor ALL patients following salvage treatment To estimate the duration
      of CR/CRh*/CRi for early relapsed/primary refractory Ph- B-precursor ALL patients following
      salvage treatment To estimate the proportion of patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation (AlloHSCT) among early relapsed/primary refractory Ph- B-precursor
      ALL patients following salvage treatment To examine the potential prognostic factors of early
      relapsed/primary refractory Ph-B-precursor ALL patients by performing subgroup and regression
      analyses To estimate overall response rate (CR/CRh*), CR/CRh*/CRi, overall survival (OS),
      duration of CR/CRh*/CRi, duration of CR/CRh* and the proportion of patients receiving
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AlloHSCT) after CR or CRh* among Ph-
      B-precursor ALL patients with duration of first CR ≤ 12 months following first salvage
      treatment

      Exploratory objectives:

      To estimate the proportion of patients in CR/CRh*, duration of CR/CRh*, proportion of
      patients in CR/CRh*/CRi, duration of CR/CRh*/CRi, OS and proportion of patients receiving
      AlloHSCT following salvage treatment for late relapsed (a first remission duration of &gt;12
      months) Ph- B-precursor ALL To estimate the proportion of patients in CR/CRh*, duration of
      CR/CRh*, proportion of patients in CR/CRh*/CRi, duration of CR/CRh*/CRi, OS and the
      proportion of patients receiving AlloHSCT for Ph+ B-precursor ALL patients and specific
      subgroup of patients following treatment for R/r B-precursor ALL To examine the potential
      prognostic factors of late relapsed Ph- B-precursor ALL patients and Ph+ B-precursor ALL
      patients To describe the types of chemotherapy regimens received and the corresponding
      efficacy results of main regimens, among patients following primary and salvage treatment for
      R/r B-precursor ALL Study Design This study was a retrospective study in which data were
      retrospectively collected from patients with R/r B-precursor ALL in 14 main hematologic
      malignancy centers in China. Patient subgroups were defined by factors that might influence
      ORR and OS to better understand their effects on study endpoints.

      Subjects and Study Size

      The study selected patients with R/r B-precursor ALL meeting inclusion criteria. Specific
      inclusion criteria were as follows:

      Chinese adult patients with R/r B-precursor ALL who had received salvage treatment At least
      one complete response evaluation results available for salvage treatment With definite Ph
      chromosome status Age ≥15 years at time of de novo (initial) diagnosis of ALL. For relapsed
      patients who met the above conditions must also have

      1. Evaluable duration of CR by initial therapy, 2. No central nervous system involved at
      relapsed, 3. No isolated extramedullary relapse.

      Patients were divided into 3 analysis sets based on molecular genetic factor and type, and
      time from initial response to relapse. Ph- Primary Analysis Set included patients who are
      diagnosed with Ph- disease and meet one of the following criteria: in first relapse or
      salvage treatment after a first complete remission duration of ≤12 months, or refractory to
      initial treatment, or relapsed/refractory after first or subsequent salvage treatment, or
      Relapsed/refractory within 12 months after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (AlloHSCT). The Ph- Late Relapse Analysis Set included patients who had a first remission
      duration of &gt;12 months and were in first relapse or salvage treatment. The Ph+ Analysis Set
      included patients who were diagnosed with Ph+ disease.
