             admission.

          -  Prisoners, as defined as those who have been directly admitted from a correctional
             facility (a free living individual who is under police observation as a suspect will
             remain in the study until hospital discharge).

          -  Obvious pregnancy in the ED.

             pre-arrival or hospital setting.

          -  Has, on the ring, middle and index fingers of both hands, any of the following: finger
             deformities, injuries, including burns, scar tissue or infection, or any material that
             may interfere with sensor application or trans-illumination of the site.

          -  Has significant bilateral trauma to the arms or forearms.
