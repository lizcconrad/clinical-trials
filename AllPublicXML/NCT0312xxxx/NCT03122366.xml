    <textblock>
      Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a key role in the innate immune system. Toll-like receptor-4
      (TLR4) in particular, appears to play a role in susceptibility to cancer. Of 44 identified
      SNPs (small nucleotide polymorphisms) in TLR4, the most common is an A-G substitution at
      nucleotide position +896, downstream of the cDNA start codon, a missense mutation which leads
      to an amino acid substitution Asp299Gly in the third exon of the TLR4 gene. Pre-clinical
      studies from our laboratory have shown an association of TLR4 with ultraviolet radiation
      induced skin cancer. Hence, in this study we will assess the pattern of TLR4 polymorphisms
      and susceptibility to skin cancer.

        400 patients age 50 and older (case group) will be enrolled at the time of presentation for
        skin cancer excision surgery. These patients will be stratified into melanoma and
        non-melanoma skin cancer subgroups, and the non-melanoma subgroup will be further divided
        into prior and no prior history of skin cancer. All groups will have blood drawn at the
        time of enrollment. 400 patients age 50 and older (control group) with no personal history
        of skin cancer will be enrolled at our clinical trials unit. These patients will be
        stratified into family history and no family history of skin cancer subgroups, and will
        have blood drawn at the time of enrollment.
