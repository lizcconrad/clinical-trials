  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer are randomly divided into two
      groups. One group receive standard of care ADT continually. Another group receive ADT plus
      prostate cryotherapy. Patients are followed up until their death or withdraw from this study
      due to other reasons. The primary endpoint of this study is prostate cancer Progression-Free
      Survival. The secondary endpoint is overall survival, prostate cancer specific survival and
      health-related quality of life.
