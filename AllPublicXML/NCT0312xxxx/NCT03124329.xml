    <textblock>
      Rationale: Treatment of gingival recession defects requires coronal advancement of the
      gingival margin due to patient esthetic demand, tooth sensitivity and improvement of tooth
      prognosis, which can be accomplished either through a flap procedure or through a tunnel. It
      will be desirable to determine the efficacy of Vestibular Incision Subperiosteal Tunnel
      Access (VISTA) to Coronally Advanced Flap (CAF) procedure and intrasulcular tunneling.

      Another aspect of the study is to determine whether autologous concentrate of platelets and
      leukocytes (leukocyte-platelet-rich fibrin; L-PRF) has equivalent efficacy to connective
      tissue autologous graft harvested from the palate.

      The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic
      modalities for the treatment of multiple gingival recession defects.

      The study is designed as a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial. Four groups
      will be compared:

      Group 1: Coronally Advanced Flap (CAF) Group 2: VISTA Group 3: Intrasulcular tunneling (IST)
      Group 4: VISTA + L-PRF

      Each of the groups will be treated without any graft material in order to examine the
      efficacy of coronal advancement and periodontal root coverage without the confounding
      variable of graft material. These techniques don't require any additional graft if there is
      adequate amount of keratinized gingiva

      The study population will be patients who present to Advanced Graduate Program in
      Periodontology at the University of Southern California, USA, and are deemed to require
      treatment of multiple gingival recession defects. A total sample of 100 participants (23
      participants per group) will provide a two sided test of means with 80% power at alpha of
      0.05. The calculation was carried out using PASS Version 12 (Hintze, J. (2014). NCSS, LLC.
      Kaysville, Utah.)

      The study duration will be 1 year. Follow-up visits after the surgery will occur after 3 days
      , 7 days and at weeks 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 52. These follow up visits consistent with
      standard of care follow up for gingival recession treatment and there will be no additional
      costs to the participant.

      The Primary Outcome variable is complete root coverage; the Secondary Outcome Variables are
      clinical attachment level (CAL) gain, changes in gingival thickness and volume and the
      Tertiary Outcomes are aesthetic outcomes, postoperative pain and Patient satisfaction survey

    <description>This score evaluates five variables: level of the gingival margin, marginal tissue contour, soft tissue texture, mucogingival junction alignment, and gingival color. Because complete root coverage is the primary treatment goal, and the other variables were considered secondary, the value assigned for root coverage is 60% of the total score, whereas 40% is assigned to the other four variables.</description>

    <description>Coronally advanced flap will be performed. Briefly, sulcular incisions will be made. Oblique incisions will be made on each papilla requiring root coverage. In the region coronal to the mucogingival junction (MGJ), mucoperiosteal flap will be elevated. Apical to the MGJ, sharp dissection will be performed to the periosteum allowing split-thickness flap elevation to be performed. Epithelium is removed from the papillae adjacent to the recession and the flap is coronally positioned and stabilized with interproximal sutures and apico-coronal interrupted sutures to close the vertical releasing incisions.</description>

    <intervention_name>Intrasulcular Tunneling</intervention_name>
    <description>Initial sulcular incisions are made and small, contoured blades and mini curettes are used to create the recipient pouches and tunnels. The tunnel will be subperiosteal in location. The incision is extended to one adjacent tooth both mesially and distally. This incision maintains the full height and thickness of the gingival component and enables access beneath the buccal gingiva. The connective tissue beyond the mucogingival line will be dissected and free the buccal flap from its insertions to the bone around each tooth. Muscle fibers and any remaining collagen fibers on the inner aspect of the flap, which prevent the buccal gingiva from being moved coronally, are cut. The papillae are kept intact and undermined to maintain their integrity and carefully released from the underlying bone, which allows the coronal positioning of the papillae. An envelope, full-thickness pouch, and tunnel are created and extended apically beyond the mucogingival line by blunt dissection</description>

    <intervention_name>Vestibular Incision Subperiosteal Tunnel Access (VISTA)</intervention_name>
    <description>The VISTA approach begins with a Vestibular Incision Subperiosteal Tunnel Access. Through this incision a subperiosteal tunnel is created, exposing the facial osseous plate and root dehiscence. This tunnel will be extended at least one or two teeth beyond the teeth requiring root coverage to mobilize gingival margins and facilitate coronal repositioning. Additionally, the subperiosteal tunnel is extended interproximally under each papilla as far as the embrasure space permits, without making any surface incisions through the papilla. The mucogingival complex is then advanced coronally and stabilized in the new position with the coronally anchored suturing technique, which entails placing a horizontal mattress suture apical to the gingival margin of each tooth. The suture is tied to position the knot at the midcoronal point of the facial aspect of each tooth, which is secured with help of composite resin to prevent apical relapse of the gingival margin during initial stages of healing.</description>

    <description>Immediately prior to surgery, 72 mL of blood should be drawn from each patient by venipuncture of the antecubital vein and collected in a sterile glass test tube without any anticoagulant. Tubes should be centrifuged at 2,700 rpm for 12 minutes within 2 minutes after blood draw. For individuals on anti-coagulant therapy or supplements to interfere with coagulation, centrifugation will be for 18 minute. After centrifugation, each L-PRF clot will be separated from the portion of red blood cells (red thrombus), obtaining a fibrin clot with a red small portion in order to include the &quot;buffy&quot; coat richer in leucocytes. The L-PRF clot is condensed and modeled on a sterile surgical plate. L-PRF will be used within 60 minutes after the preparation.</description>
