  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cirrhosis is characterized by loss of muscle as well as fat mass, which increases morbidity
      and mortality before, during, and after liver transplantation. A common mechanism for the
      reduced muscle and fat mass in cirrhosis is an increased expression of the TGF (transforming
      growth factor)beta superfamily member, myostatin, in the muscle and adipose tissue. The
      present study will examine the expression of myostatin, its receptor and intracellular
      signaling pathways in the skeletal muscle and mesenteric adipose tissue in cirrhotic patients
      undergoing liver transplantation as compared to healthy controls undergoing planned abdominal
      surgery. 16 cirrhotic patients will be identified from the transplant list, and 16 healthy
      controls from outpatient surgery lists. Nutritional assessment will be performed, including
      anthropometry (triceps skinfold thickness, mid arm circumference), dual energy x-ray
      absorptiometry (DEXA), and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Rectus abdominis muscle
      tissue and omental fat tissue will be harvested in the operating room, and the expression of
      signaling proteins involved in skeletal muscle protein synthesis will be quantified. The
      investigator will also quantify the expression of genes involved in lipolysis and lipid
      synthesis. The investigator anticipates that the expression of myostatin will be higher in
      the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue of cirrhotics as compared to controls. There will be a
      reduction in the expression of the signaling proteins that regulate skeletal muscle protein
      synthesis, as well as the expression of genes regulating lipogenesis. The increased
      expression of myostatin will also correlate with reduced anthropometric and DEXA measurements
      of lean body mass and fat mass.

        Patients will be identified from the Cleveland Clinic transplant list. All subjects with
        cirrhosis of any etiology who will undergo liver transplantation will make up the group of
        cirrhosis patients. The controls will be patients without cirrhosis that are undergoing
        abdominal surgery will be identified from the operating room list at Cleveland Clinic.
        Rectus abdominis muscle biopsies will be obtained directly after induction of anesthesia
