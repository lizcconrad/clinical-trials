  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The survey is a phase IV, prospective randomized clinical trial to determine whether an
      immunomodulating nutrient-enriched diet compared to a standard diet can improve nutritional
      status and reduce postoperative infection and surgery-induced immune suppression in patients
      with gastric cancer or GIST undergoing major surgery in a single medical center.

      Primary Objective:

        1. The primary end points:

           To evaluate the effect of immunomodulating diets on the postoperative inflammatory
           response: including interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and tumor necrosis
           factor-α (TNF-α).

        2. Secondary Objectives:

      (1). Biochemistry parameters: glucose,blood urine nitrogen, creatinine, aspartate
      aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, triglycerides, cholesterol, low-density
      lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, sodium, and leukocyte count.

      (2). Nutritional status: albumin, prealbumin, BMI (3). Adverse events (4). Clinical outcomes:
      postoperative complications, time to first bowel action and length of hospital stay after
      surgery.

      Number of Subjects: Eligible patients will be randomized in 2 arms in the ratio of 1:1, to
      reach 15 patients at least in each.

      Plan of the Study:

        1. This is a randomized, comparative, double blinded study in 2 arms.

        2. Study Schedule Study date: the time getting approval letter issued by both regulatory
           authority and institutional review board (IRB). Duration of the study: 5 years.

        3. Duration of Treatment: Treatment was administered before curative surgery for gastric
           adenocarcinoma or gastric GIST, and postoperative day 5-14 or to discharge whichever
           occurred first, or consent withdrawal during any time of the study, when the patient
           would be withdrawn.

    <description>Patients received oral feeding with an ordinary diet plus 400 mL/day (400 kcal/day) of the immunomodulating nutrients enriched diet for 3-5 days before curative surgery for gastric adenocarcinoma or gastric GIST. On postoperative day 3, enteral nutrition (EN) was initiated with 5% glucose in water at a rate of 20 mL/h. On postoperative day 4, patients received a semi-liquid diet plus 400 mL/day (400 kcal/day) of the immunomodulating nutrients enriched diet. From postoperative day 5-14 or to discharge whichever occurred first, 1200 mL/day (1200 kcal/day) of the interventional diet was administered, and an oral soft diet was also administered if no postoperative complications developed and if oral feeding was not prohibited.</description>
