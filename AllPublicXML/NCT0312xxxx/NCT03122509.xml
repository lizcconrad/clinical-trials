It will be conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of (1) durvalumab and tremelimumab plus RT in subjects with metastatic CRC who are undergoing RT as standard therapy; and, (2) durvalumab and tremelimumab plus ablation in subjects with metastatic CRC who are undergoing ablation as standard therapy.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Patients will receive 1500 mg durvalumab via IV infusion q4w for up to 4 doses/cycles and 75 mg tremelimumab via IV infusion q4w for up to 4 doses/cycles, and then continue 1500 mg durvalumab q4w starting on Week 16. Tremelimumab will be administered first. Durvalumab infusion will start approximately 1 hour after the end of tremelimumab infusion. The duration will be approximately 1 hour for each infusion. Radiotherapy (RT) will be performed using external beam ionizing radiation as standard therapy in accordance with institutional standard practice. RT will be initiated within 7 days after the first of durvalumab and tremelimumab.</description>
