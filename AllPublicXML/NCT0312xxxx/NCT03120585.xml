    <textblock>
      The object of this study is to determine the best way to care for infants with respiratory
      distress. The investigators are testing a method of feeding fluids to infants with
      respiratory distress in amounts similar to what healthy breastfed babies eat when they are
      feeding on demand, and comparing this method to the current standard of care for feeding
      fluids to infants with respiratory distress. These methods of feeding fluids to the study
      infants will continue until the infants are able to feed normally by mouth. The study will
      include about 400 infants across five sites in the United States, Chile and Argentina.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants with respiratory distress syndrome will be enrolled within the first twelve hours of
      life, and randomly assigned to one of two groups: the first group will receive the
      interventional fluid management method, and the second (the control group) will receive the
      current standard of care for fluid management. To standardize respiratory care across all
      five study sites, a computer-based algorithm for respiratory support management based on
      objective markers of respiratory distress will guide clinician management decisions. However,
      each infant's medical team will make all final decisions on respiratory treatment and IV
      fluid management. Any study infant who experiences dehydration and/or low blood sugar during
      the course of the study will be removed from the study and be treated for the condition.

    <description>Fluid management intervention is fluid restriction to 60 mL/kg/day on Day of Life (DOL) 1 for preterm and 40 mL/kg/day on DOL 1 for term neonates, calculated as total of IV and enteral fluid intake. Infants randomized to low infusion with be placed on 10% dextrose and the Infant will be monitored by obtaining serum glucose levels by point of care testing. Glucose infusion rates (GIR) would be calculated to the corresponding serum glucose and recorded. After 24 hours, infusion rate will be increased to 60ml/kg/d providing minimum GIR &gt;4mg/kg/d. . Total fluid intake will be increased by 20 mL/kg/day until 150 mL/kg/day .</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Neonates born between 34-0/7 and 41-6/7 weeks gestational age (GA) at birth with
             primary pulmonary disease of the newborn including Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn
             (TTN), Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS), air leak syndrome, pneumonia, or meconium
             aspiration syndrome in the first 12 hours of life will be eligible for inclusion in
             this study.

          -  Those neonates who are intubated for administration of exogenous surfactant but who
             are immediately extubated to non-invasive respiratory support after surfactant
             administration will remain eligible for study inclusion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Neonates with a genetic abnormality or congenital anatomic anomaly

        Subsequent Study Exclusion resulting in removal from study:

             for refractory respiratory distress

          -  Neonates with hypoglycemia or clinical evidence of dehydration or volume depletion
             requiring fluid bolus

          -  Infants that are transported out of the participating site prior to study endpoint.
