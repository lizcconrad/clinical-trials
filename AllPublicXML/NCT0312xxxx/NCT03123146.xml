  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with high functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently experience
      obsessions and/or compulsions that are similar to those specified in Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5) criteria for obsessive compulsive
      disorder (OCD). However, little research exists on effective interventions for OCD symptoms
      (referred to as OCBs) in ASD. In a randomized controlled trial, a manualized functional
      behavior-based cognitive-behavior therapy (Fb-CBT) consisting of traditional CBT components
      (psychoeducation and mapping, cognitive-behavioral skills training, exposure, and response
      prevention) as well as function-based behavioral assessment will be evaluated. Participants
      will be assigned randomly to Fb-CBT or treatment as usual (TAU). Primary and secondary
      outcome measures will be used to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment, and will be
      administered at pre and post-intervention as well as six month follow-up.

    <measure>Change in Repetitive Behavior Scale (RBS_SCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment occurred at baseline and 2 weeks following end of treatment, as well as at follow-up (6 months following the cessation of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The RBS is a 43-item parent rating measure of repetitive behavior. It is comprised of a four-point Likert scale ranging from (0) behavior does not occur, to (3) behavior occurs and is a severe problem . The RBS_SCR scale specifically focusses on the assessment of sameness, compulsive, and ritualistic behaviors</description>

    <measure>Change in Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment occurred at baseline and 2 weeks following end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A 10-item, semi-structured interview used to assess symptom severity for children ages 6 through 17 years. Each item is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale from 0 (none) to 4 (extreme)' For the purpose of this study, only the 5-item Compulsion score was used pre and post-treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Repetitive Behavior Scale 100 (RBS_100)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment occurred at baseline and 2 weeks following the end of treatment, as well as at follow-up (6 months following the cessation of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The final item on the RBS-R asks caregivers to rate on a scale from 1 to 100 how much OCBs affect the child and the people around them (1 is not a problem to 100 is as bad as can be imagined; Bodfish et al., 1999).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in The child Obsessive-Compulsive Impact Scale-Revised (COIS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment occurred at baseline and 2-weeks following the end of treatment, as well as at follow-up (6 months following the cessation of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>A 33-item, parent-report questionnaire that assesses OCD-related impairment in various areas of the child's life, including school, social, and home/family activities. For each item, the parent rates the child's level of impairment on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parent OCB Rating Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Scale was completed by parents at baseline, each day throughout the 9-week treatment period, and at follow-up (6 months following the cessation of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>A Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (desired post-treatment levels of OCBs) to 3 (partial improvement from pre-treatment levels) to 5 (pre-treatment levels of OCBs) was used by parents to rate OCBs.</description>
