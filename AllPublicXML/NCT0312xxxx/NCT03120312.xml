  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The is a retrospective analysis to study the characteristics of elderly patients treated with
      total hip replacements during past 5 years．
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients underwent total hip replacement due to removal of the hip caused by retrogressive
      lesions, is conducive to the improvement of hip function .But at the same time,the
      complications from patients accepted total hip replacement surgery will directly or
      indirectly affect the prognosis of the patients, resulting in patients with delayed recovery
      and increase the hospitalization time and cost. Serious complications can lead to patients
      deaths during perioperative period. This study was designed to provide a retrospective
      analysis of postoperative recovery, quality of life, and complications in patients undergoing
      hip replacement over the past five years, providing data for clinical studies.
