  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a trial to validate the use of the STarT Back Screening Tool (SBST) in the Military
      Health System for patients with low back pain presenting to primary care.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with low back pain presenting to primary care will be enrolled in a study that aims
      to evaluate the utility of the SBST for providing risk-stratified care. The concept of this
      approach revolves around matching treatment to patients based on their risk for developing
      chronic disability from back pain. Those at low risk receive less treatment, and those at
      high risk need more specialized treatment, that includes psychosocially-focused and cognitive
      considerations. This approach will be compared to usual care, where general practitioners
      carry out the course of action they think best for each patient, without any other guidance.
      Patients will be followed for 1 year.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The focus of the interventions is directed towards the secondary prevention of disabling back pain. The RMDQ will be used to assess physical disability. The RMDQ is a recommended disability measure that it is widely used in LBP studies in primary care and was the primary outcome used in the STarT Back trial by Hill et al. (2011). The form provides 24 statements and prompts the participant by stating &quot;When your back hurts, you may find it difficult to do some of the things you normally do.&quot; Then it states, &quot;Mark only the sentences that describe you today.&quot; Examples include &quot;I avoid heavy jobs around the house because of my back&quot; and &quot;I find it difficult to turn over in bed because of my back&quot;. Scores are calculated by percent improvement from baseline to post-intervention [(points of improvement made/total items checked at baseline) x 100]</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Acceptable Symptom Scale (PASS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Often defined as &quot;the highest level of symptoms beyond which patients consider themselves well.&quot; This outcome measure has been used in previous studies looking at the effects of cervical thoracic thrust manipulation on shoulder pain. The question that will be asked to assess this level is, &quot;Taking into account all the activities you have during your daily life, your level of pain, and also your functional impairment, do you consider that your current state is satisfactory?&quot; Individuals who respond &quot;yes&quot; will be categorized as a success.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Credibility Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The CEQ is a 6-item self-report measure evaluating treatment credibility and expectations for improvement. This will be assessed at baseline after treatment group assignment is revealed to provide descriptive information about participants' perceptions of their treatment assignment and optimism for improvement. The CEQ may be used as a covariate if perceptions differ meaningfully between groups as participants' initial perceptions of treatment credibility can impact outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 57-Item Profile v 2.0 (PROMIS-57)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS 57 efficiently assesses several outcomes important to patients including pain intensity and interference, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and social role participation using items developed with rigorous methodology and patient input. This is a 57-item questionnaire with 8 questions per domain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EuroQoL (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a generic quality of life questionnaire that will assess quality of life on a scale that can be referenced to other disease conditions. The EQ-5D covers 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each domain has 3 response categories: level 1, &quot;no problems&quot;; level 2, &quot;some problems&quot;; and level 3, &quot;inability or extreme problems.&quot; Responses are combined to give a 5-digit descriptive health state classification (e.g., 11222). The EQ-5D yields a total of 243 possible health states. Valuations for each health state are available. The EQ-5D is commonly used in economic evaluation of interventions and cost-effectiveness analysis.</description>

    <description>Physical therapists providing care will all have attended live training in PIPT principles and be involved in monthly continuing education on these principles. The use of specific principles is guided by the patient's risk stratification (as determined by the STarT Back Tool).
Medium Risk:
- Reassurance will be provided to address specific concerns related to their LBP and implications on work
High Risk:
- Physical therapy will be psychologically augmented with the assessment of biopsychosocial risk factors and the adoption of cognitive behavioral principles that explore patient concerns and address unhelpful beliefs and behaviors, including tailored education (e.g., stress management and pain neuroscience), graded exercise, &amp; graded exposure</description>
