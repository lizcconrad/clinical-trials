    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a disease associated with impaired quality of life and
      substantial societal costs. Though sometimes co-appearing with other conditions, such as
      asthma, allergy, and nasal polyps, many cases present without co-morbidities.
      Micro-biological diagnostic procedures are frequently undertaken, but the results are often
      inconclusive. Nevertheless, antibiotics are usually prescribed, but invariably with limited
      and temporary success. Accordingly, there is a need for new treatments for CRS.

      Recent studies indicate that the sinuses are colonized by a commensal microbiome of bacteria
      and that damage to this natural microbiome, by pathogens or antibiotics, may cause an
      imbalance that may promote CRS. Therefore, treatments that restore the commensal microbiome
      may offer an alternative to current protocols. Arguably, as suggested by studies on patients
      with intestinal infections (next paragraph), one such possibility may be to transfer a
      &quot;normal microbiome&quot; to patients with CRS.

      A disrupted microbiome is linked to intestinal clostridium difficile infections. Probiotic
      restitution therapy may be effective even in cases recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment.
      However, a key to effective probiotic restitution is selecting the bacteria that facilitate
      regrowth of normal microbiome. As an answer to this, researchers have chosen to simply
      transplant the entire microbiome from a healthy donor. In the case of clostridium difficile
      infection in the form of faecal transplants.

      In this study, we will examine the possibility to treat patients with chronic rhinosinusitis
      without polyps (CRSsNP) with complete sinonasal microbiomes obtained from healthy donors. Our
      analysis will focus on symptoms and signs of disease as well as on nasal inflammatory and
      microbiological indices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last few years the theory of a damaged microbiome as a cause or promoting factor
      behind chronic rhinosinusitis has gained increasing interest from the scientific community.

      A number of studies aimed at investigating the microbiota of the nose and paranasal sinuses
      in health and disease has been published with very varying outcomes. Furthermore, other
      studies have been aimed at probiotic treatment of sinonasal disease either locally or through
      immunologic manipulation via the gastrointestinal microbiota.

      A problem common to all these studies is that studies examining the normal nasal microbiota
      have identified a great amount of different bacterial species. It is as of today not known
      which individual species or combinations of species that promotes health.

      The probiotic assemblages examined in previous studies have consisted of one or a combination
      of a few bacterial species.

      Probiotic restitution therapy has been proven very effective for intestinal clostridium
      difficile infections. The restitution therapy has then consisted of transplantation of a
      complete microbiome from a healthy donor in the form of a faecal transplant.

      In this study the investigators aim at recruiting patients suffering from chronic
      rhinosinusitis without polyps (CRSsNP) and healthy participants without any history sinonasal
      disease. The patients and the healthy participants will be examined for infectious diseases
      in a manner similar to other medical transplant procedures to minimize the risk for the
      recipients. The patients will then be treated with antibiotics to reduce the bacterial load
      of the nose and the paranasal sinuses. After the patient has finished the antibiotic
      treatment a microbiome transplant will be harvested from the healthy participant as a nasal
      lavage. The raw lavage fluid will then be used to transplant the microbiome to the patient.
      The procedure will be repeated for five consecutive days.

      The outcome measures analysed will focus on subjective sinonasal health and symptoms of the
      patients but also include nasal inflammatory and microbiological indices.
