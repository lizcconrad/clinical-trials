      The objective of this cross-sectional study is to assess the prevalence of depression at 2
      months, 6 months, and 1 year postpartum in women who had an immediate postpartum hemorrhage
      (immediate PPH defined as blood loss ≥ 500 mL within 24 hours of delivery). The potential
      serious consequences of PPH may lead to a greater number of psychological disorders in these
      women than in women without PPH.

      Study design: This repeated, cross-sectional, descriptive and etiological single-center study
      will take place within a cohort of women giving birth at the Clermont-Ferrand University
      Hospital Center.

      Principal endpoint: The prevalence of depression, measured by the Edinburgh postnatal
      depression scale (EPDS), validated in French, with a discrimination threshold ≥ 11.

      Study plan and procedures:

      For each woman with a PPH (exposed), 2 women without PPH (not exposed) will be included: the
      women who gave birth immediately before and immediate after her. If one of these 2 unexposed
      women eligible for the unexposed group also has a postpartum hemorrhage, another woman
      immediately just before or after the woman with PPH will be included. The PPH will be managed
      according to the national guidelines issued in December 2014.

      The intervention will consist of 3 questionnaire surveys, at 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year
      postpartum.

      Information and inclusion will take place in the immediate postpartum period at the
      Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital Center, France. An investigator (midwife or
      gynecologist-obstetrician in the maternity ward) will inform eligible women about the study,
      in the postpartum period. This investigator will provide them with a written information
      sheet and obtain their written consent. If the woman has already left the maternity ward, an
      investigator will contact her by mail or telephone, and she will receive the information
      sheet and consent form at her postnatal consultation in the department.

      The cohort will complete each questionnaire at the same times in relation to their date of
      delivery (2 months, 6 months, and 12 months after). They will receive an email asking them to
      complete the questionnaires, including a participation number and an internet link to the
      self-administered questionnaires. This intervention is not usually performed for women who
      give birth at our hospital, whether or not they had a PPH. The procedures, other than the
      surveys, will be those provided habitually as usual care and will comply with good clinical
      practices and French regulations (1992 decree, French early discharge guideline from 2004).
      Should the questionnaire identify a woman in need of immediate psychological care, she will
      be contacted, referred to, and encouraged to consult a competent professional (psychologist,
      psychiatrist, child psychiatrist, etc.).

      Data collection:

      The source documents will be the medical file and the questionnaires. Clinicians will make
      the data extraction from the medical files, including the relevant covariables: confounding
      factors, prognostic factors (e.g., history of depression, anxiolytic treatment before
      delivery, psychological or psychiatric care before and delivery and after delivery, etc.).

      Quality assurance plan:

        -  The Investigator undertakes to conduct this study in compliance with Good Clinical
           Practices and French public health law [Act n°2004-806 dated 9 August 2004 concerning
           biomedical research, its implementing decree n° 2006-477 dated 26/04/2006, which
           modifies the portion of the Public Health Code (specifically, Part 1, Book 1, Title II,
           Section 1) concerning biomedical research, as well as the decrees in force]. The
           investigator also undertakes to conduct this research in accordance with Declaration of
           Helsinki of the World Medical Association (Tokyo 2004, as revised).

        -  The investigators guarantee the authenticity of the data collected in this study and
           accept the legal provisions authorizing the study sponsor to set up quality control
           procedures. During quality control inspections, the following items will be checked:

             -  Informed consent.

             -  Compliance with the research protocol and the procedures defined there.

             -  Assurance of the quality of the data collected in the electronic CRF: accuracy,
                missing data, consistency of the data with the source documents (such as paper and
                electronic medical files and questionnaires completed by the midwives).

      Reporting for adverse events:

      In compliance with decree n° 2006-477 dated 26/04/2006, which modifies the portion of the
      Public Health Code (specifically, Part 1, Book 1, Title II, Section 1) concerning biomedical
      research, as well as the decrees in force, any suspected unexpected serious adverse effect
      will be reported by the Sponsor to the competent, authority at the CPP, as soon as the
      Sponsor is aware of it and at the latest 7 days after the event.

      Sample size assessment:

      For a power of 90%, with a two-sided alpha of 5%, with 2 unexposed subjects for 1 exposed and
      according to the Australian study by JF Thompson et al. (2011) who found a depression rate of
      10% in unexposed and 16% in exposed women at 4 months postpartum, this study requires:

        -  1028 women in the unexposed group, with no hemorrhage

        -  and 514 women in exposed group with a hemorrhage

      A total of 1542 women must therefore be included.

      Statistical analysis plan:

      There will be 3 samples for analysis:

        -  Respondents to the survey at 2 months

        -  Respondents to the survey at 6 months

        -  Respondents to the survey at 12 months

      The participation and refusal rates will be calculated at each survey point, together with
      the prevalence of the psychological states studied. Some women will be lost to follow-up at
      the M6 and M12 surveys. These women will be included in the crude descriptive analyses, and
      population lost to follow-up will be compared with the study population to look for possible
      differences in the principal characteristics studied. We plan to perform an interim analysis
      to assess the need to adjust the study calendar. This interim analysis will be performed
      after half of the planned subjects have been included.

      Statistical techniques:

      The statistical methods used for the crude analyses will be a descriptive analysis of the
      sample with a comparison of the exposed and unexposed groups, where we describe the
      characteristics of the groups included in the study.

      The Chi 2 test (or Fisher's exact test when appropriate) will be used to compare the
      qualitative variables and Student's t test (or a Mann-Whitney test) for the quantitative
      variables.

      Prevalence rates and their 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for depression at 2
      months, 6 months, and 1 year.

      A multivariate analysis (logistic regression) will be conducted to take into account
      confounding factors (smoking, cannabis, etc.) as well as clinically relevant prognostic
      factors (history of depression, use of anxiolytic or antidepressant agents, etc.) for
      depression at each survey interval (at 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year). The results will be
      expressed as adjusted odds ratios (aOR).

      At the end of the study, another multivariate analysis (generalized linear mixed model) will
      be performed to study the trends in the prevalence of depression over the 3 study periods.

      Plan for missing data

      The missing data will be treated as missing and excluded from the analyses.
