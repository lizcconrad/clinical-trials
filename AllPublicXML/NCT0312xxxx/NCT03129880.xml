  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there are differences in treatment outcomes
      between traditional voice therapy, performed weekly for a maximum of 6 weeks versus intensive
      voice therapy, consisting of 4-6 therapy sessions performed within one day.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of voice therapy is optimal long-term vocal quality and communication function with
      minimal recurrence. Traditional voice therapy for dysphonia typically consists of one to two
      therapy sessions each week with a single clinician for about 8 weeks. Another approach of
      voice therapy is intensive short-term therapy also known as &quot;boot camp.&quot; This approach,
      borrows from the disciplines of neurobiology, exercise physiology, motor learning, and
      psychotherapy which describe desirable learning and behavior changes influenced by practice
      that involves high-intensity overload, variability, and specificity of training. A few
      studies have showed that &quot;Boot Camp&quot; model of intensive therapy resulted in comparable gains
      in voice quality and vibratory mechanics and may promote better patient satisfaction and
      attendance.

      While such findings support the notion that intensive voice therapy may enhance voice therapy
      outcomes, no study to date has examined patient response to the &quot;Boot Camp&quot; approach to voice
      therapy. The investigators will compare the outcomes of traditional, weekly voice therapy and
      intensive voice therapy with multiple sessions in one day.
