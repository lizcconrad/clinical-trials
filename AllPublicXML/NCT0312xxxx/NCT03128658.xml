  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While a number of factors are known to be associated with the development of trauma induced
      coagulopathy (TIC), inflammation, and multi-organ failure, we currently cannot predict which
      patients are at risk for developing these life threatening conditions with any certainty. In
      this prospective observational study, we will investigate the many factors that contribute to
      the development of trauma induced coagulopathy, post injury inflammation and the development
      of organ dysfunction in order to develop a multi scale computational algorithm of clinical
      prediction. Using a convenience sample technique, demographic data, physiologic data, blood
      samples and clinical variables will be collected over 5 days following traumatic injury. A
      computational model will be used to predict the development of TIC and multi-organ failure.

      A prospective, observational, convenience sample of trauma patients 18 years old or older who
      present to the trauma bay as a trauma alert will be included after evaluation by the on-call
      trauma surgeon and research assistant. Minimally injured patients will be compared to those
      with a systolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or less, the need for blood product transfusion
      within 1 hour of admission, and/or an ISS (injury severity score) of greater than or equal to
      15. Demographic data including past medical/medication history as well as clinical data
      including continuous vital signs will be recorded. If eligibility criteria are met, the
      research blood samples will be drawn at the same time as routine clinical samples. Blood
      samples (approximately 15 ml) will be taken on admission, 3hr, 6hrs, 12hrs, 24 hrs, 48 hrs,
      and 5 days post admission. Vital signs, number of blood transfusions, volume of crystalloid,
      administration of medications, and the values of routine laboratories will be monitored
      continuously for 24 hours, and then cumulatively for up to 5 days. After the last blood draw,
      we will be following the patient's outcome for up to 30 days. If patients are discharged or
      die prior to completing the 5 days of blood samples, additional samples and/or clinic
      appointments for the purpose of research will not be obtained. A computational algorithm will
      be used to predict the development of trauma induced coagulopathy, inflammation and
      multi-organ failure.

    <description>The computational whole-patient systems model is a multiscale, multi-compartment model whose state-space is defined by a very large and heterogeneous set of variables as well as a large number of input parameters. The model will be integrated in time for various initial trauma conditions in an attempt to determine whether the model can be predictive, and help us discover new variables that are more predictive of clinical outcomes than those employed in current clinical protocols.</description>

      During the initial trauma evaluation, 15 ml of blood will be collected for research purposes
      during the routine blood trauma blood draw. Additional 15 ml samples will be collected at 3
      hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours and 5 days post admission.

      Blood samples will be analyzed for coagulation parameters using thromboelastography.
