      Patient will complete informed consent, inclusion/exclusion criteria, sleep apnea and snoring
      surveys online. If patient meets all criteria for the study, patient will be provided with a
      treatment device for use for a 10 day treatment period. Patient will complete the trial upon
      providing final online surveys.

    <measure>Snoring Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 10 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The Snoring Severity Scale (SSS) is a 9-point, validated scale to measure the severity of snoring. A total of three questions are asked: 1) &quot;How often do you snore, 2) &quot;How long do you snore&quot;, and 3) How audible is your snoring. Answers for each of these questions are summed for a total SSS score. A score of '0' would indicate no snoring at all, while a score of '9' would indicate the most severe snoring as measured by the SSS.
Outcome measure reported as change with use of the device over pre-trial. In this case, a negative ('-') would represent improvement in snoring symptoms, while a positive ('+') number would indicate an increase in snoring severity.</description>

    <description>Quantitative assessment on 1-10 scale. Outcome measurement reported as a percentage change from pre-trial with use of the device. A negative ('-') percentage would indicate a reduction in snoring symptoms as measured by the VAS, while a positive percentage ('+') result would indicate an increase in the measured symptom.</description>

        <title>Snoring Severity Scale</title>
        <description>The Snoring Severity Scale (SSS) is a 9-point, validated scale to measure the severity of snoring. A total of three questions are asked: 1) &quot;How often do you snore, 2) &quot;How long do you snore&quot;, and 3) How audible is your snoring. Answers for each of these questions are summed for a total SSS score. A score of '0' would indicate no snoring at all, while a score of '9' would indicate the most severe snoring as measured by the SSS.
Outcome measure reported as change with use of the device over pre-trial. In this case, a negative ('-') would represent improvement in snoring symptoms, while a positive ('+') number would indicate an increase in snoring severity.</description>
