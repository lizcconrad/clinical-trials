  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced unresectable or metastatic STS, not
             amenable to curative treatment and after available standard therapies have failed to
             provide clinical benefit. Note: Participants with a diagnosis of Grade 1 liposarcoma
             (atypical lipomatous neoplasms) are eligible if there is histological or radiographic
             evidence of evolution to more aggressive disease.

          -  Presence of measurable or nonmeasurable but evaluable disease as defined by the
             Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1).

          -  Performance status 0-1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale.

          -  Must be able to provide tumor tissue obtained within 6 months of study enrollment. If
             such tissue is not available, a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor
             lesion must be performed.

          -  Have an anticipated life expectancy of â‰¥3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received any previous systemic therapy (including investigational agents)
             targeting PD-1/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL-1) or PD-1/PDL-2 signaling pathways
             (including previous participation in Merck MK-3475 trials). Prior treatment with
             olaratumab is allowed. Prior therapy with other immune checkpoint inhibitors,
             including but not limited to, anti-CD137 antibody or anti-cytotoxic
             T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody, is not permitted.

          -  Have known active central nervous system (CNS) metastasis and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Participants with treated CNS metastases are eligible for this study if
             they have not received corticosteroids and/or anticonvulsants within 7 days of study
             treatment, and their disease is asymptomatic and radiographically stable for at least
             60 days.

          -  Have active autoimmune disease or other syndrome that requires systemic steroids or
             autoimmune agents in the past 2 years.

          -  History of interstitial lung disease or non-infectious pneumonia.

          -  Have received a live-virus vaccine within 30 days prior to planned treatment start.

          -  Have histologically or cytologically confirmed Kaposi's sarcoma or gastrointestinal
             stromal tumor (GIST).

          -  Have inflammatory bowel disease for which the participant has used immunosuppressive
             agents within the last 2 years.
