  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a condition that affects a quarter of the Western adults,
      triples the risk for cardiovascular diseases and increases all-cause mortality. Intermittent
      hypoxia (IH) during transient cessation of breathing in OSA leads to endothelial
      inflammation, a key step in the initiation and progression of cardiovascular disease.
      However, the mechanisms that mediate IH-induced endothelial inflammation remain unclear and,
      consequently, no targeted therapy is available for vascular manifestations of OSA. Using
      endothelial cells (ECs) freshly harvested from OSA patients, they study team has identified
      impaired complement inhibition as an initial stimulus for endothelial inflammation in IH,
      thereby linking for the first time complement activation to vascular risk in OSA. The
      investigators found that a major complement inhibitor cluster of differentiation (CD59), a
      plasma membrane protein that inhibits the formation of the terminal complement membrane
      attack complex (MAC) and protects host cells from complement injury, is internalized from the
      EC surface in OSA patients. Consequent MAC deposition initiates endothelial inflammation in
      IH. Importantly, the investigators showed that IH does not significantly affect inflammation
      in ECs in the absence of complement, suggesting that complement activation has an essential
      role in endothelial inflammation in OSA. Interestingly, internalization of CD59 in IH appears
      to be cholesterol-dependent and statins prevent MAC deposition on ECs in IH in a
      CD59-dependent manner, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce vascular risk in
      OSA. This led the study team to hypothesize that IH-induced cellular cholesterol accumulation
      reduces complement inhibition via increased internalization of CD59 from the EC surface
      leading to increased MAC deposition, and that treatment of OSA with continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP) and/or statins reverses endothelial dysfunction by restoring
      complement inhibition.

    <textblock>
      To address the hypothesis, the investigators seek to determine whether statins prevent
      endothelial dysfunction in OSA by restoring complement inhibition. The preliminary data
      indicate that the expression of CD59 on the EC surface is preserved in OSA patients who are
      receiving statins and that statins prevent CD59 internalization and MAC deposition in IH
      leading to reduced inflammation. The study proposes to determine whether statins restore
      endothelial protection against complement activity in OSA patients using double-blind
      placebo-controlled parallel group randomized study design. The hypothesis: The proportion of
      CD59 on the EC surface is increased while MAC deposition is decreased after 4 weeks of
      atorvastatin 10 mg daily compared with placebo in OSA patients who adhere with CPAP or do not
      adhere with CPAP.

      The proposed studies may advance our understanding of vascular dysfunction in OSA and provide
      the basis for large, long-term clinical trials of novel therapeutic strategies, such as
      addition of statins to the standard CPAP therapy, for preventing and/or reversing vascular
      risk in OSA.
