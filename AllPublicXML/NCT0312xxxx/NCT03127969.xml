    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of fluidotherapy primarily on
      function and quality of life, secondarily on pain, morning stiffness, grip strength, and
      disease activity in patients with rheumatoid hand.Ninety-three patients were enrolled in this
      prospective, single-blind, randomized, and controlled trial. Patients were randomized into 2
      groups. Group 1 (n=47) had fluidotherapy (5 times per week, for 3-week duration) and Group 2
      (n=46) was the control group. All patients received joint protection and exercise program.
      The primary outcome measures were Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and Duruöz Hand Index
      (DHI) and secondary outcome measures were pain and morning stiffness assessed using the
      Visual Analog Scale (VAS, 0-100 mm), the Grip Ability Test (GAT), Disease Activity Score-28
      (DAS-28), and grip strength. These assessments were performed at baseline, at week 3 and week
      12 after treatment.
