    <textblock>
      Fecal incontinence is common in patients with rectal cancer after surgery. Previous studies
      showed that pelvic floor muscle and external sphincter muscle training after stoma closure
      could improve the severity of incontinence and other fecal symptoms, but there is no study
      about the effects of pelvic floor muscle exercise intervention before stoma closure. We are
      wondering would the symptom of fecal incontinence recover sooner and better if we give the
      pelvic floor muscle exercise intervention before the stoma closure. This article aims at
      comparing the effects of pelvic floor muscle training before stoma closure on fecal
      incontinence (pre-intervention group) with pelvic floor muscle training after stoma closure
      (post-intervention group), and we hypothesise that the severity of fecal incontinence will
      improve sooner and better in pre-intervention group.
