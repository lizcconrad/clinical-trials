    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access program (EAP) for eligible participants. This program is designed
      to provide access to Veliparib prior to approval by the local regulatory agency. Availability
      will depend on territory eligibility. Participating sites will be added as they apply for and
      are approved for the EAP. A medical doctor must decide whether the potential benefit
      outweighs the risk of receiving an investigational therapy based on the individual patient's
      medical history and program eligibility criteria.
