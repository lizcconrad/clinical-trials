    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effectiveness of different polarities of transcranial direct
      current stimulation paired with intensive motor training in recovery of upper extremity
      function in individuals with severe post-stroke hemiparesis. The hypothesis is that more
      severely impaired individuals will derive greater benefit from anodal stimulation of the
      ipsilesional hemisphere or cathodal stimulation of the contralesional hemisphere than dual
      stimulation (anodal applied to the ipsilesional hemisphere and cathodal applied to the
      contralesional hemisphere.)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has 2 aims: 1) determine which transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      electrode configuration is most effective in combination with motor training to promote motor
      recovery from severe post-stroke hemiparesis; and 2) begin to clarify the extent to which
      baseline transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measures predict response to tDCS, as well
      as the effects of tDCS paired with motor training on TMS measures of motor cortical
      organization.

      To accomplish these aims, the investigators will recruit 36 human subjects with severe
      post-stroke hemiparesis and assign each subject to 1 of 4 tDCS conditions (anodal excitatory
      ipsilesional; cathodal inhibitory contralesional; a combination of anodal excitatory
      ipsilesional during cathodal inhibitory contralesional; or sham). Each subject will undergo a
      20-minute stimulation session once a day for 10 days over a 2-week period. Each session will
      be followed by 3 hours of intensive, task-oriented upper extremity motor training.

      Outcome measures for this study include TMS motor cortical maps and standardized tests of
      motor performance. The investigators hypothesize that all groups will show improvement in all
      measures; however, both the anodal excitatory ipsilesional group and the cathodal inhibitory
      contralesional group will show significantly greater improvement compared with the other 2
      groups. The investigators will also find evidence clarifying whether the presence or absence
      of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) has predictive value regarding which tDCS configuration
      would be most effective for a particular subject.
