      Common bile duct stones in clinical manifestations of biliary colic, obstructive jaundice,
      cholangitis, pancreatitis and other symptoms. At present, thanks to the rapid development of
      minimally invasive surgery and the concept of ERAS, laparoscopic common bile duct incision
      and primary suture has been gradually used as a routine surgical approach in clinical
      application. However, whether or not to place the abdominal drainage tube after surgery, so
      far has not yet reached a consensus. Therefore, this study focuses on the clinical advantages
      of LCBDE+PC placed abdominal drainage.

      On the basis of the analysis of 7 cases were selected by laparoscopic treatment of
      cholecystolithiasis complicated with choledocholithiasis bile duct suture in patients with a
      clinical data of our hospital were prospectively divided into peritoneal drainage group of 40
      cases, no abdominal drainage group of 40 cases, compared two groups of operation time,
      hospitalization time and cost, operation cost, operation bleeding and postoperative bilirubin
      recovery, complication and return to hospital again and so on, and to explore the clinical
      significance of indwelling drainage tube.
