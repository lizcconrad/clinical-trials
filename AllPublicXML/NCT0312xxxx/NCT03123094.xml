  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI
      655130 following administration of single rising intravenous doses and single subcutaneous
      dose in healthy Japanese male volunteers.

      Secondary objective is the exploration of the pharmacokinetics including dose proportionality
      of BI 655130 in healthy Japanese male volunteers.
