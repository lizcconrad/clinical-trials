    <textblock>
      During acute coronary syndrome, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart
      Association recommend oxygen delivery to patients with less than 90% oxygen saturation.
      Oxygen therapy in these patients for a duration of at least 6 hours, but also stipulates that
      it is reasonable to administer oxygen to all acute coronary syndrome patients during the
      first six hours following the presentation. Hyperoxia also has well-established risks.

      Our research hypotheses are:

      (I) that current practices tend to use high oxygen flows resulting in high SpO2 levels during
      acute coronary syndrome.

      (II) there is a high rate of desaturation in patients with acute coronary syndrome and an
      automatic adaptation of oxygen flows may reduce this frequency.

      (III) that excessive oxygenation targets have no advantage. Our hypothesis is that
      maintaining a SpO2 of 90 to 94% is at least equivalent when compared to higher saturation
      objectives (SpO2 of 94 to 100%) with regard to the occurrence of complications in the patient
      in acute coronary syndrome . We will use two SpO2 targets with the FreeO2 system, 92 and 97%.

      Hypoxemia is a common problem encountered during acute coronary syndrome. During acute
      coronary syndrome, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association
      recommend oxygen delivery to patients with less than 90% oxygen saturation. Oxygen therapy in
      these patients for a duration of at least 6 hours , but also stipulates that it is reasonable
      to administer oxygen to all acute coronary syndrome patients during the first six hours
      Following the presentation. However, the studies underlying these guidelines are few and far
      between, most of them having been done more than forty years ago.

      Hyperoxia also has well-established risks.

      Our research hypotheses are:

      (I) that current practices tend to use high oxygen flows resulting in high SpO2 levels during
      acute coronary syndrome.

      (II) there is a high rate of desaturation in patients with acute coronary syndrome and an
      automatic adaptation of oxygen flows may reduce this frequency. This will be our primary
      endpoint and will be tested with the use of the automated oxygen delivery system.

      (III) that excessive oxygenation targets have no advantage. Our hypothesis is that
      maintaining a SpO2 of 90 to 94% is at least equivalent when compared to higher saturation
      objectives (SpO2 of 94 to 100%) with regard to the occurrence of complications in the patient
      in acute coronary syndrome . We will use two SpO2 targets with the FreeO2 system, 92 and 97%.
