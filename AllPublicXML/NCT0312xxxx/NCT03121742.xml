  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is the most common form of deadly violence. Indeed, since more than 40,000 people die
      by suicide each year, people are 2.5 times more likely to die by their own hand than someone
      else's. The four weeks after discharge from inpatient care is an especially dangerous period
      in terms of suicide risk, possibly because of poor post-discharge treatment adherence and
      poor treatment efficacy during a suicide crisis. To reduce suicide risk both in general and
      during the post-discharge period, interventions are needed that (1) are easily adhered to and
      (2) are effective during a suicide crisis. The goal of the study is to pilot-test a suite of
      five smartphone-based ecological momentary interventions (EMI) that can be easily used during
      a suicide crisis. Two target hopelessness, two target loneliness, and one targets negative
      automatic thoughts associated with hopelessness and loneliness. Although these interventions
      are new to the study of suicide, they are all grounded in decades of empirical work and
      adapted from effective interventions in areas relating to suicide.

      Participants will be 20 inpatients (n = 10 each in treatment as usual [TAU] plus intervention
      and TAU plus assessment [i.e., control] groups) from the Massachusetts General Hospital
      Inpatient Psychiatric Service. The investigators hypothesize that those in the TAU plus
      intervention group will have lower levels of suicidal ideation during the inpatient and
      post-discharge period than those in the TAU plus assessment group.

    <description>Suicidal ideation as assessed by the ecological momentary assessment/intervention using a three item assessment of suicidal ideation that assess: (1) the desire to die by suicide, (2) the intention to die by suicide, and (3) the ability to resist the urge to die by suicide.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion criteria include a recent (i.e., was included as the reason for admission)
             suicide attempt or serious suicidal ideation (i.e., ideation with at least 50% intent,
             assessed through either an explicit mention in the intake summary of intent greater
             than 50% or through this intent being inferred by clinical staff or in the notes [for
             example, if the patient notes they wanted to die more than they did not want to die
             during the attempt or episode of suicidal ideation]), English fluency, and access to
             an internet-capable smartphone (e.g., iPhone or Android).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria include any factor that impairs the ability to effectively
             participate in the study (e.g., intellectual abilities that are too low to understand
             the study and/or consent process) or a diagnosis of any schizophrenia-spectrum or
             psychotic disorder.

          -  Additionally, patients who are on involuntary hospitalization status will be excluded.
