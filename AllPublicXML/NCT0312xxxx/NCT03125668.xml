    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test an educational program with telephone follow-up to
      improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL), treatment adherence, and reduce anxiety and
      depression symptoms in patients who are starting oral anticoagulants (OA).

      Randomized controlled trial (RCT) at two Brazilian public hospitals, one in Ribeirão Preto
      and another one in Américo Brasiliense, state of São Paulo, Brazil.

      Both groups will receive the educational program (Power Point®Slides, booklets and
      orientation) at the hospitalization. After the hospital discharge, the intervention group
      will receive the telephone follow-up (five calls for six months: 1st call in one week and the
      others calls month by month until six months) and two face to face counseling (1st meeting in
      three months and the 2nd meeting in six months). The control group just receive the same face
      to face counseling (1st meeting in three months and the 2nd meeting in six months) after the
      hospital discharge.

      The educational program consist in information about the use of Warfarin and approach the
      specific topics in Power Point®Slides: Physiology: Definition of oral anticoagulants,
      mechanisms of action and clinical indication; Medication: Dose, time, storage and duration of
      therapy; Monitoring: Meaning of International Normalized Ratio (INR) , collection period and
      doctor's appointments; Other medications: Drug interactions and those considered &quot;natural&quot;;
      Feeding: Eating foods rich in K vitamin and fats; Alcoholic beverage: Care about alcohol ,
      and if it occurs, does not stop the Oral Anticoagulants; Gestation: Necessity to start IV
      anticoagulants; Activities: In physical, domestic or work activities to use protective
      measures; Health treatment: Warn about OA to other professional and take the card of INR
      values; Travels: On trips take the OA and be programmed to the realization of INR out of
      their units; Signs /Symptoms: Report underdose (thrombus formation) and overdose (bleeding),
      seek health care.

      After the orientations with Power Point®Slides, the patients receive one booklet with the
      same informations and the researcher answer any questions that patients have about the
      anticoagulation therapy.

      In this moment (at hospitalization) the researcher also collects the data about symptoms of
      anxiety and depression using the validated questionnaire.

      During the telephone calls the researcher talk with the patient about the topics that were
      approach in the educational intervention and motivate the patient to follow the
      recommendations for they have a successful treatment.

      In the face to face counseling (three and six months after hospital discharge) the researcher
      collect the data about anxiety and depression again, health-related quality of life and
      adverse events related to oral anticoagulation therapy.

    <description>The Duke Anticoagulation Satisfaction Scale (DASS) was developed by Samsa et al. (2004) and validated for the Brazilian population by Pelegrino et al. (2011). The scale have 25 items divided in three domains: Limitation (9 items); Hassles and burdens (8 items); Psychological Impacts (8 items). All items have seven response categories: &quot;not at all&quot;, &quot;a little&quot;, &quot;somewhat&quot;, &quot;moderately&quot;, &quot;quite a bit&quot;, &quot;a lot&quot;, and &quot;very much&quot;. Possible range: 25 to 175 and lower scores, indicated better Health-Related Quality of Life.</description>

    <description>The questionnaire &quot;Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)&quot; was developed by Zigmond and Snaith (1983) and validated and adapted to Portuguese by Botega et al. (1995). The HADS contains 14 multiple choice questions, divided into two subscales: anxiety and depression (composed of seven items each).This questionnaire will be used to collect the data at baseline and at six months.</description>
