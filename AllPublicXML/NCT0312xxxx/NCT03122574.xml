  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research was to estimate feasibility of an aromatherapy pain management
      intervention to reduce pain and distress caused by venipunctures in a pediatric population.
      The feasibility of the use of aromatherapy essential oil lavandula angustifolia for pain
      management intervention (Treatment Group) was compared to placebo aromatherapy with jojoba
      oil (Placebo Control Group) and to the current standard of care, which is no oil during a
      venipuncture (Standard of Care Control Group). Primary measured outcomes were assessed using
      a double-blind randomized design. The physiological measure of heart rate was taken over the
      course of four minutes at three different intervals to note the pattern of change that occurs
      during anticipatory anxiety resulting from the impending procedure, the procedural pain
      experienced during the venipuncture, and the residual fear common after completion of the
      venipuncture procedure. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain and the Hospital Fears
      Rating Scale (HFRS) were administered to measure subjective pain and anxiety. Participants
      (N=21) were recruited from the Laboratory Medicine Unit of Children's National Health System.
      Feasibility was estimated based on the ability to inhale the full dose of oil without adverse
      effects and and ability to inhale the full dose within the ten-minute time frame. This study
      analyzed the effect of the aromatherapy pain management intervention, lavandula angustifolia
      aromatherapy, on the stress response of a pediatric population through observation of
      physiological and psychological indicators of pain and distress, in order to learn more about
      the pain and anxiety experienced during venipuncture and the use of aromatherapy to decrease
      pain and anxiety during venipuncture.

    <description>Heart rate (raw score) as measured using a NONIN Onyx finger cuff. It took approximately 10 seconds to record. Heart rate was measured (1) two-minutes prior to venipuncture, (2) during venipuncture, and (3) two minutes post-venipuncture, covering in total a 4 minute time span.</description>

    <measure>Psychological- Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Minute 10</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS for pain is a self-report measure that assesses subjective patient pain on a scale from 0-10. It was administered at the end of the 10 minute study and took approximately one minute to administer.</description>
