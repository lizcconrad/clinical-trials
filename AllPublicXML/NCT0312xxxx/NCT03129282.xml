  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression and anxiety are highly prevalent in people with heart disease, causing immense
      human and economic burden. Available pharmacological and psychological interventions have
      limited efficacy and the needs of these patients are not being met in cardiac rehabilitation
      services despite emphasis in key NHS policy.

      Extensive evidence shows that a particular style of thinking dominated by rumination
      (dwelling on the past) and worry maintains emotional distress. A psychological intervention
      called metacognitive therapy (MCT) that reduces this style of thinking alleviates depression
      and anxiety in mental health settings.

      This is a single-blind feasibility randomised controlled trial of metacognitive therapy
      delivered in a home-based format (Home-MCT). The aim of the study is to evaluate the
      acceptability and feasibility of integrating Home-MCT into cardiac rehabilitation services
      and to provide provisional evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness on Home-MCT.

    <description>Acceptability of the intervention is defined as the completion of the first 4 modules of the Home-MCT manual, which includes 6 modules in total. Acceptability will be expressed as a % of all patients randomised to the treatment arm, minus deaths. This will be compared to the % of controls (minus deaths) who complete the 4-month follow up.</description>

    <description>Home-based metacognitive therapy (Home-MCT) is a facilitated self-help manual comprising six modules which participants will complete at their own pace over approximately 6 weeks. Participants will have an initial appointment with a Home-MCT trained cardiac rehabilitation staff members (face to face or by telephone). In addition, they will receive two telephone calls from trained cardiac rehabilitation staff members over the course of the intervention to offer support with completing the modules of the self-help manual.</description>
