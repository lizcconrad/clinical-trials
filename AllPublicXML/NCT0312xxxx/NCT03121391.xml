  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is an important, under-investigated area of ICU care for terminally ill
      patients undergoing terminal ventilator withdrawal. The proposed research has relevance to
      public health because an algorithmic approach to the ventilator withdrawal process will
      enhance clinicians' ability to conduct the process while assuring patient comfort, using
      opioids and/or benzodiazepines effectively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Terminal ventilator withdrawal is a process that entails the cessation of mechanical
      ventilatory support with patients who are unable to sustain spontaneous breathing and is
      commonly performed in the ICU. Ventilator withdrawal is undertaken to allow a natural death.
      Opioids and/or benzodiazepines are administered before, during, and after as an integral
      component of the ventilator withdrawal process to prevent or relieve respiratory distress,
      but there are few guidelines to determine how much to administer or when. Insufficient opioid
      and/or benzodiazepine administration places the patient at risk for unrelieved respiratory
      distress and preventable suffering. Conversely, excessive medication administration may
      hasten death, an unintended consequence, and one that concerns clinicians. The effective
      doses of medications given during ventilator withdrawal are unknown. The investigators
      hypothesize that an algorithmic approach to ventilator withdrawal, relying on a biobehavioral
      instrument to measure and trend distress, will ensure patient comfort, and guide effective
      opioid and/or benzodiazepine administration. The investigators plan to use a stepped wedge
      cluster randomized controlled trial with all clusters providing unstructured usual care until
      each cluster is randomized to implement the algorithmic approach (intervention). The proposed
      study is innovative because there is no standardized, evidence-based approach guided by an
      objective measure of respiratory distress to this common ICU procedure. The study has broad
      clinical significance to provide knowledge that can potentially reduce patient suffering.

    <description>The medical intensive care unit in four hospitals will comprise the clusters. All four clusters begin the study under the control condition. Ventilator withdrawal is conducted by the usual personnel in those units. Data is collected through observation of the process and the respiratory comfort of the enrolled patients. Each cluster is randomly selected to sequentially cross over to the intervention. The remaining clusters continue with usual care (control) until selected for crossover.</description>

    <description>Each cluster is randomly selected to sequentially crossover to the intervention. When crossed over to the intervention the assigned intensive care nurse conducts the ventilator withdrawal according to the algorithm. The algorithm is informed by an objective measure of patient respiratory comfort. Data is collected through observation of the process and the respiratory comfort of the enrolled patients.</description>
