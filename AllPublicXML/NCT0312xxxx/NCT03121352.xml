  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how effective the combination of the two chemotherapy
      drugs (carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel) are when added to a third drug, pembrolizumab.

      Pembrolizumab is an investigational (experimental) drug that works by reinvigorating the
      immune system, allowing it to target and destroy cancer cells. Pembrolizumab is experimental
      because it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this type of breast
      cancer treatment.

    <description>The number of people with tumor responses according to RECIST (V1.1). These responses include Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression). Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study</description>

    <description>Average time (in months) patient's tumors did not progress according to the RECIST criteria (V1.1). Progressive disease is defined as Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).

    <description>the percentage of patients with advanced or metastatic cancer who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease to a therapeutic intervention. Responses are defined as Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.
