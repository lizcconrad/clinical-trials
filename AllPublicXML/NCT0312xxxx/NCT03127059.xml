  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dyspnoe can disable patients with asthma. Dysfunctional breathing (DB), resulting in dyspnoe,
      can mimic or exaggerate asthma. Around every forth patient with asthma have DB. Breathing
      exercises (BrEX) can improve asthma-related quality of live (QOL) in less severe asthma. No
      study has investigated the effect of BrEX on QOL neither on level of physical activity in
      severe asthma.

      A randomised controlled multicentre trial will include 220 adults with poor asthma control
      (Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ6)-score≥1.5) from five outpatient departments. Patients
      will be allocated to either usual care (no intervention) or breathing exercises
      (BrEX)-treatment consisting of 12-week intervention including three physiotherapist-sessions
      focusing on breathing pattern modification (Papworth Method; Buteyko technique) in rest and
      activity and 10 minutes home-exercise twice daily. Primary outcome is change in Mini Asthma
      Quality of Life Questionnaire (MiniAQLQ) at six-months follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Denmark around 300,000 suffer from asthma. Dyspnoe can disable patients with asthma.
      Dysfunctional breathing (DB), resulting in dyspnoe, can mimic or exaggerate asthma. Around
      20-29% of asthmatic patients have DB. Breathing exercises (BrEX) can improve asthma-related
      quality of life (QOL) and control of asthma symptoms in less severe asthma. No study has
      investigated the effect of BrEX on QOL neither on level of physical activity in severe
      asthma.

      A randomised controlled multicentre trial will include 220 adults with poor asthma control
      (Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ6)-score≥1.5) from five outpatient departments. After
      optimizing of inhalation technique, patients will be allocated to either usual care (no
      intervention) or BrEX-treatment consisting of 12-week intervention including three
      physiotherapist-sessions focusing on breathing pattern modification (Papworth Method; Buteyko
      technique) in rest and activity and 10 minutes home-exercise twice daily. Primary outcome is
      change in Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (MiniAQLQ) at six-months follow-up.
      Secondary outcomes are changes in ACQ6, Nijmegen Hyperventilation Questionnaire (NQ),
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), accelerometry (physical activity level, number
      of steps), 6 minutes walk distance, and forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV1),
      besides response of Global perceived effect rate (GPE) in asthma-related QOL and asthma
      control.

    <description>MiniAQLQ is a disease-specific patient-reported outcome on experiences during the previous two weeks. The original version of AQLQ (32 items) is recommended for clinical use, whereas this shortened version is suggested for research. In moderate to severe asthma cohorts, MiniAQLQ has good reliability (ICC 0.83-0.86) and strong validity (criteria validity to AQLQ, r≥0.80; construct validity against ACQ, r=0.69). MiniAQLQ has 15 items in four domains (symptoms, activity limitation, emotions, environment), which are answered using a 7-point Likert scale (1=maximum impairment; 7=no impairment).</description>
