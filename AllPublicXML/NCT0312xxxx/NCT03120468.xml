      This is a pilot study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability of Topiramate (TPM) +
      N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) in combination versus Topiramate (TPM) + placebo for the treatment of
      alcohol use disorder (AUD).

      This is a pilot study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability of Topiramate (TPM) +
      N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) in combination versus Topiramate (TPM) + placebo in 16 subjects
      enrolled in a 12 week, randomized, double-blind, outpatient trial. Each subject will receive
      randomly one of the drug combinations for 12 weeks plus medication management.

      Primary Aim 1: To evaluate the safety, tolerability of Topiramate (TPM) and N-Acetyl Cysteine
      (NAC) in combination or Topiramate (TPM) + placebo for the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder
      (AUD). This aim will be accomplished by testing the following:

      •Hypothesis 1 - The combination of Topiramate (TPM) and N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) will be well
      tolerated by participants as evidenced by less self-report cognitive side effects (word
      finding difficulties, difficulties with concentration, and confusion).

      Secondary Aim 1: The combination of Topiramate (TPM) and N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) or
      Topiramate (TPM) + Placebo will reduce alcohol drinking. This aim will be accomplished by
      testing the following:

      •Hypothesis 2 - The combination of Topiramate (TPM) and N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) or Topiramate
      (TPM) + Placebo will reduced alcohol drinking , as evidenced by a statistically significant
      reduction in percentage of heavy drinking days (PHDD) as compared to baseline.
