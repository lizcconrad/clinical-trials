    <textblock>
      Korean data of treating EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patients with Erlotinib and Bevacizumab
      is significantly necessary for developing new standard treatment in first-line therapy in
      Korean EGFR mutant NSCLC patients.

      In this study, The investigators will investigate the efficacy and safety of Erlotinib and
      Bevacizumab combination compare to Erlotinib alone in Korean EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients.

    <textblock>
      EGFR-TKIs are the standard first-line treatment option for EGFR-mutant NSCLC. After a
      randomized phase II trial, JO25567 was presented at 2014 ASCO, the synergistic effect of
      progression-free survival(PFS) could be expected when EGFR TKI, Erlotinib is combined with
      Antiangiogenesis agent, Bevacizumab. Even Korean and Japanese are classified as Asian based
      on location, the figure of Korean is more tended to Western people due to the dietary life in
      recent years. However the incidence rate of EGFR mutation positive patients in Korea is much
      higher than Western countries.

      Therefore Korean data of treating EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patients with Erlotinib and
      Bevacizumab is significantly necessary for developing new standard treatment in first-line
      therapy in Korean EGFR mutant NSCLC patients.

      In this study, The investigators will investigate the efficacy and safety of Erlotinib and
      Bevacizumab combination compare to Erlotinib alone in Korean EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients.
