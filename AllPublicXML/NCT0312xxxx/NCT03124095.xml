      The aim of the present study is analyze the effects of combined training program (resistance
      and aerobics) in comparison with a non-training group on quality of life, as well as on
      neuromuscular and cardiorespiratory parameters in breast cancer patients in stages one to
      three who have finished their treatment, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
      Therefore, 42 women will be randomly divided into two groups: combined training group and
      control group. The subjects of the combined training group will undergo the intervention
      three times a week for eight weeks. The combined group will carry out both resistance and
      aerobic exercises in the same session. The resistance training will be comprised by ten
      exercises which will alternate body segments with maximum repetitions in the first set and
      the lower limit of the repetitions interval in the next sets. Along the training, the number
      of series will be increased whereas the number of repetitions will be decreased. The
      intensity of the aerobic exercises will be based on the percentage of the heart rate of the
      anaerobic threshold on the first weeks and on the speed of the anaerobic and aerobic
      threshold on the last weeks. Before and after the intervention, there will be evaluation of
      maximal dynamic strength of knee extensors and elbow flexors, maximum voluntary isometric
      contraction of knee extensors, maximum muscular activity of vastus lateralis and rectus
      femoris, muscle thickness of knee extensors, peak oxygen uptake and ventilatory threshold,
      quality of life and cancer-related fatigue. Data will be analyzed by Generalized Estimating
      Equations (GEE) and Bonferroni's post-hoc (Î±=0,05), including both protocol and intention to
      treat.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization, breast cancer is the most common one among women,
      both in developed and developing countries. It accounts for 23% of all breast cancer cases
      worldwide whereas, in Brazil, it represents 25% of new cases per year. However, its mortality
      rate has increasingly decreased due to advances in screening protocols, diagnoses and
      treatment in the last decades. Even so, breast cancer and its treatment might cause
      psychological and physiological side effects that can affect patients' quality of life.

      There is evidence that increase in physical activity generates important physical and
      psychological benefits to patients with cancer. Studies with breast cancer survivors have
      shown that the fact that the patients become physically active after the diagnosis leads to a
      24-67% decrease in total death risk and 50-53% decrease in death related to breast cancer, by
      comparison with sedentary patients.

      Reviews, systematic reviews and metaanalysis of studies that investigated the effects of
      interventions with physical exercise programs on health outcomes in breast cancer survivors
      showed the benefits brought to these patients by exercise. However, these reviews have also
      called the attention of the scientific community regarding the need to standardize measures
      of outcomes and intervention methods of evaluation since variations found in the studies make
      it difficult to reach definite conclusions. Furthermore, type, frequency, intensity and
      duration of exercise sessions to reach beneficial effects on important health parameters for
      breast cancer have not been well established yet. Therefore, this study aims at analyzing the
      effects of combined training program (resistance and aerobics), in comparison with a
      non-training group, on quality of life, as well as on neuromuscular and cardiorespiratory
      parameters in breast cancer patients in stages one to three who have finished their
      treatment, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

      Methodology: This trail will be carried out with women with histological confirmed breast
      cancer who have already completed the primary treatment for breast cancer (including surgery,
      radiation therapy and chemotherapy) from 6 months to 5 years but keep on hormone therapy.
      After baseline assessments, the eligible participants will be randomized to the combined
      exercise group or control non-exercising group. The combined exercise group will follow an
      eight week exercising program, which consists of three weekly exercise sessions. Each session
      will last around 60 minutes and will include strength training (with machines and elastic
      bands) and aerobic exercises on treadmills. Workouts will be guided and supervised by
      previously trained physical education professionals and physiotherapists. The strength
      training will comprise nine exercises, which will alternate body segments with maximum
      repetitions in the first set and the inferior limit of repetitions in the second set. Along
      the training, the number of series will increase whereas the number of repetitions will
      decrease. The intensity of the aerobic exercises will be based on the percentage of cardiac
      frequency of anaerobic threshold. All exercise sessions will take place at the Physical
      Education School at the Pelotas Federal University, located in Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul,
      Brazil.

    <time_frame>Testing of VO2peak change - Baseline and 8 week</time_frame>
    <description>We created a protocol on the treadmill to determine the peak oxygen uptake change(VO2peak), the first ventilatory threshold and the second ventilatory threshold. The protocol consists in 1-minute stages. The initial speed is 1.86 miles per hour. In each stage, the speed increases 0.3 miles per hour and every 2 stages, the treadmill inclination increases 1%. The test is interrupted when the subject indicates exhaustion. The respiratory gases will be collected through a portable gas analyzer (VO2000, MedGraphics, Ann Arbor, USA).
The maximum value of VO2 , closed to exhaustion will be considered the VO2peak. The fist and the second ventilatory threshold will be determined by the ventilation versus intensity curve and confirmed by the O2 and Carbon dioxide ventilatory equivalents by two independent physiologists in a visual inspection.</description>
