  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through 5 years continuous observation of acute ischemic stroke patients in Neurology
      Department of Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and
      Technology, clinical data about emergency treatment (neurological score, examination and
      treatment), medical data after admission (neurological score, inspection, examination and
      treatment) and long-term prognosis (neurological score) was collected. The outcomes were set
      as the score scale, all blood test index and examination index of the research objects at
      specific period after illness. Through statistical analysis and comparison of different
      in-hospital clinical data in predicting the outcome of the patients, our study will provide
      more evidence-based solutions for the treatment and prediction of acute ischemic stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research is designed as registrated, prospective, open-labeled, blind-endpoint, and the
      research objects are continuously recorded. The final subgroups are blind to neurological
      evaluators, data inputers and statisticians.

      The research is a continuous observational exploratory study. All patients with ischemic
      stroke admitted to Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science
      and Technology from April 1, 2017 to December 31, 2021 will be included. According to the
      current situation, it is expected to enroll approximately 5000 of eligible patients for
      long-term follow-up observation.

      We'll use multiple linear regression analysis model to study factors and confounding factors
      and their interaction. And we will control the confounding factors, and make a quantitative
      description of the relationship between factors and outcome variables.

      Missing cases will be treated as censored values, and the ratio of missing cases will be
      recorded. All samples will be analyzed by Intent-to-Treat (ITT) analysis. In the analysis, if
      the results are statistically significant, the missing cases in the exposed group will be
      deleted, and the missing cases in non-exposure group be added. If the results are still
      statistically significant, then the missing cases are defined as not affecting the analysis
      results.

      If the heterogeneity of data is large, the objects will be analyzed in subgroups according to
      age or sex.

      If the missing rate is greater than 20%, it is necessary to analyze the sensitivity of the
      whole sample.
