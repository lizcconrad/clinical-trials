             profile with clinical significance, for example complete left bundle branch block, 2

             hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, any first degree relative suffered from long
             QT syndrome or undertook unexplained sudden death before 40 years old, or taking any
             drug leading to a longer QTc.

          -  Any history of interstitial lung disease, drug induced interstitial lung disease,
             radiation pneumonia require steroid therapy or active interstitial lung disease with
             clinical evidence during recruiting.

          -  Patients with other factors the researchers considered not suitable for the trail (for
             example, patients those who not willing to follow the procedure, limitation or
             requirements, who once experienced bone marrow allotransplantation, who have other
             kinds of malignant tumor coexisted or who showed allergic to the active ingredients or
             inactive adjuvant of the investigational drug, as well as drugs with similar chemical
             structure or in the same class).
