  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GLP-1(9-36) amide and (9-37), which was previously thought to be the inactive metabolite of
      GLP-1, also exerts cardioprotective effects. Direct administration of GLP-1(9-36) during
      reperfusion reduced ischaemic damage in isolated hearts and increased cGMP release,
      vasodilatation and coronary flow in AMI mouse model, one may speculate that total GLP-1 level
      may associate with adverse cardiovascular events in AMI patients, the hypothesis is therefore
      tested in this study.
