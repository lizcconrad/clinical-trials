  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving the drug venetoclax with
      ibrutinib can help to control the disease in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
      or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). The safety of this combination treatment will also be
      studied.

      This is an investigational study. Ibrutinib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of CLL/SLL. Venetoclax is FDA approved for some patients with CLL whose disease
      has come back after 1 or more previous treatments. The use of venetoclax in combination with
      ibrutinib is considered investigational.

      The study doctor can describe how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 45 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive the study drugs
      in study cycles that are 4 weeks (28 days) long.

      You will take ibrutinib 1 time every day while you are on study with about 1 cup (8 ounces)
      of water.

      If you miss a dose of ibrutinib, it can be taken as soon as possible on the same day with a
      return to the normal schedule the following day. You should not take extra capsules on the
      following day to make up for a missed dose.

      You will also take tablets of venetoclax 1 time every day for the rest of the study. Each
      dose of venetoclax will be taken at about the same time as ibrutinib with about 1 cup (8
      ounces) of water, within 30 minutes after you finish eating a low-fat breakfast. Timing of
      dosing can be adjusted, if necessary, after discussion with your doctor.

      In order to lower the risk of side effects, you will start taking venetoclax at a low dose
      and then it will be increased each week as directed by your doctor until you are taking the
      full dose.

      If you vomit within 15 minutes of taking venetoclax and all the tablets are still intact,
      another dose may be taken. Otherwise, you should not take another dose. In cases where a dose
      of venetoclax is missed or forgotten, you should take the dose as soon as possible, as long
      as it is within 8 hours after the dose was planned to have been taken.

      You will also be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects beginning 3
      days before your first dose of venetoclax. You may ask the study staff for information about
      how the drugs are given and their risks. You will also be instructed to drink at least 6 cups
      of water every day beginning 2 days before you take venetoclax until 1 day after the first
      dose.

      Tumor Lysis Syndrome Monitoring:

      Starting about 3 days before receiving your first dose of venetoclax (and continuing for at
      least 5 weeks of treatment), you will be given a drug to lower the risk of a serious side
      effect called Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS). TLS happens when cancer cells break down rapidly.
      The break-down products enter the bloodstream and are not flushed out quickly enough.

      You will need to drink lots of water (at least a half-gallon each day) starting 2 days before
      your first dose.

      You will have blood tests (about 2 tablespoons each time) before your dose of venetoclax.
      Depending on your individual risk of TLS, you may need to be hospitalized for 2 nights to
      monitor for TLS. If you are hospitalized, you will have blood tests (about 2 tablespoons each
      time) 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after your dose. Based on your test results, your study doctor
      may have more instructions for you, and you may need to meet with a kidney doctor while you
      are in the hospital. You may need to receive fluids by vein.

      If you are not hospitalized for TLS monitoring, you will be monitored closely as an
      outpatient. You will have blood tests (about 2 tablespoons) 6-8 hours and 24 hours after you
      take your first dose of venetoclax in Week 1 and Week 2. Some patients may also need this
      monitoring in Weeks 3-5. This decision will be made by the study doctor based on your
      individual risk of TLS. Based on these test results, your study doctor may have more
      instructions for you. You may need to be hospitalized or have further tests.

      Study Visits:

      Every week during Cycle 1, and at the start of Cycles 2, 3, and 4:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      At the end of Cycles 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24, you will have CT, PET/CT or MRI scans to check
      the status of the disease. If the disease is considered to be in &quot;complete remission,&quot; your
      treating doctor may decide you do not need these scans.

      At the end of Cycles 6, 12, 18 and 24, you will have a bone marrow biopsy to check on the
      status of the disease. Based on how the disease responds to treatment, your doctor may decide
      that you do not need to have this bone marrow biopsy at Cycles 18 and 24.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22 and at the end of Cycle 24:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Physical exams and blood draws may be done more often if the doctor thinks they are needed.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may receive venetoclax for up to 96 weeks. You may continue receiving ibrutinib for as
      long as the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to
      take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you
      are unable to follow study directions.

      Long-term follow-up:

      After completion of the study, you will continue to see your doctor for routine medical care.
      You will also be asked to participate in a separate leukemia department protocol (DR09-0223).
      The purpose of this protocol is to determine how long patients live after receiving leukemia
      treatment. On this study, if you are not having follow-up at MD Anderson, study staff will
      contact you, via phone, email or MyMDAnderson every 6-12 months, to see how you are doing.
      Phone calls will take approximately 5-10 minutes. If you agree, you will sign a separate
      consent form for this study.
