      Phase 2, single-arm, open-label trial. Patients will receive bosutinib for the duration of
      the study.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be open for enrollment until the planned number of approximately 60
      Philadelphia Chromosome Positive (Ph+) patients have been registered. All patients will be
      treated and/or followed for up to approximately 3 years (144 weeks) after registration of the
      last patient or until study termination. Patients who discontinue study therapy early due to
      disease progression or intolerance to study medication will continue to be followed yearly
      for survival for up to approximately 3 years (144 weeks) after registration of the last
      patient or until study termination.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, including recent or
             active suicidal ideation or behavior, or laboratory abnormality that may increase the
