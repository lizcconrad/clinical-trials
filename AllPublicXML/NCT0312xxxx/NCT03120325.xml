  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating a new form of treatment for a digestive disorder called
      gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is thought to be caused by a mix of inflammation and neural
      dysfunction. The vagal nerve is a large nerve originating from the brain that regulates
      digestive function. Patients with gastroparesis have what is a called a low vagal tone which
      results in gastrointestinal motility problems and inflammation; therefore, investigators
      hypothesize that increasing vagal tone through a hand-held vagal nerve simulator will reduce
      inflammation and gastrointestinal motility problems in gastroparesis patients. Investigators
      will evaluate this hypothesis through the use of upper endoscopy testing, breath testing, and
      blood, stool, urine, heart rate variability, and saliva testing before and after 4 weeks of
      vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) treatment.

      There are 6 research visits

      Visit 1 and visit 2 may take up to 8 weeks (screening/baseline) Visit 3 and visit 4 will take
      4 weeks (VNS treatment) visit 5 and 6 will take approximately 4 weeks (VNS followup/washout)

      Consequently, it is possible that if a patient were to be at the farthest ends of visit
      windows, they could potentially be in the study for approx 16 weeks. Visit 1 and 2 may be
      less than 8 weeks which would shorten the patient's overall involvement in the study.

      The treatment phase of the study will always be 4 weeks with an additional 4 week washout
      phase.

      Use of the VNS device takes 4 weeks. Endoscopy and blood work are taken before and after the
      treatment period.

    <measure>Effect of Vagal Nerve Stimulation on gastroparesis symptoms as measures by the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks (2 weeks prior to stimulation, 4 weeks of stimulation, 2 weeks after stimulation). Data analysis will occur at the 1 year mark after enrollment has stopped.</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will send daily GCSI's to patients for 8 weeks. This 10 item questionnaire measures the severity of gastroparesis symptoms on a scale 0-5. 0=none, 1=very mild, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe, 5=very severe. Investigators hypothesize a change of more than 1 point.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of Vagal Nerve Stimulation on the gastric emptying spirulina breath test emptying time</measure>
    <time_frame>Gastric emptying testing will occur at visit 3 (the very first day of VNS treatment) and then again at visit 5 (which occur after four weeks of VNS treatment). Data analysis will occur at the 1 year mark when enrollment has stopped.</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will measure a change in gastric emptying time before and after vagal nerve stimulation as measured in minutes.</description>

    <description>Patients will be giving themselves vagal nerve stimulation for four weeks at interval of two times a day for five minutes for four weeks. The impact of the intervention on gastroparesis symptoms will be measured by upper endoscopy biopsies, blood work, autonomic function tests, survey data, stool samples, urine sample, and saliva samples before after after the four weeks of stimulation treatment.</description>
