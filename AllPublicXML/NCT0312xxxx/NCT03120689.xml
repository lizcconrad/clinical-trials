  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is research in which students are queried by questionnaires on their satisfaction with
      and experience with certain educational practices (use of a camera image projecting during a
      live surgery) or with pre-recorded video. As data collection only involves survey data
      collection and satisfaction with an educational experience, and randomization/intervention is
      only involving use of one type of educational method versus another .

      As better training in vaginal surgery is a priority of gynecologic safety and quality
      organizations, optimizing learner satisfaction with vaginal surgery learning experiences is
      of paramount importance. Our purpose was to investigate if this unique camera system may have
      advantages in learner satisfaction both in the operating room and in video learning settings,
      therefore increasing the interest of the learner pool in vaginal surgery and optimizing their
      experience. This study has two main, non-dependent aims:

      Aim 1: The investigators aim to perform a randomized, controlled trial that compares a
      vaginally-mounted high-definition telescopic camera system (VITOM®) that can project live
      images in the operating room during vaginal surgery to traditional learner surgery
      observation practices, with the primary outcome of learner satisfaction as measured by
      validated adult learner satisfaction measures.

      Aim 2: The investigators aim to investigate in a randomized, controlled trial whether
      learners watching videos acquired with the VITOM® camera feel the video is more
      learner-friendly and optimal that videos acquired with traditional, tripod-mounted standard
      definition cameras.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult learners (age &gt;=18 years)

          -  Residents and medical students rotating in the field of gynecology at the University
             of Louisville and within the group of learners who are available to observe and
             participate in surgeries with the Urogynecologic team at any of the study sites.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult learners will be excluded if they have participated in the study prior, are
             performing a role within the surgery that precludes their participating in one of the
             study arms.

          -  If it is deemed by the surgical team that participation of the learner in the study or
             filming of the surgery would compromise the quality of surgery or patient safety in
             any manner.
