  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prediction of preterm birth is beneficial because it initiates early treatment to
      minimize risk. It defines a population at risk to provide particular treatment and may lead
      us to a better understanding the mechanisms of preterm birth. The understanding of the
      mechanisms and etiology consequently leads to the possibility of early intervention and
      effective management aiming at preventing preterm birth. Five most common interventions for
      preventing and treating preterm birth are antibiotics, cervical cerclage, bed rest,
      progesterone, and tocolytic therapy. However, there are insufficient evidence showing the
      efficacy of cerclage and bed rest; antibiotics may only delay but not prevent the preterm
      birth; the use of certain tocolytics needs to be considered against the possible adverse
      effects. The early detection of pregnant women with high risk for preterm delivery would be
      the ideal solution to prevent preterm birth. However, to date, there is inadequate literature
      and little knowledge of diagnosis, treatment, prevention and prediction of preterm birth.
