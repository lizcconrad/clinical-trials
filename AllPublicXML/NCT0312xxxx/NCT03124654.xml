  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacists are in the best position to counsel and educate patients on anticoagulant agents
      such as NOACs. This should enable patients to play a more active role in their treatment and
      ultimately enhance adherence behaviour. However, educational elements should be targeted to
      knowledge. Thus, the investigators will develop and validate a questionnaire that can assess
      knowledge about NOACs
