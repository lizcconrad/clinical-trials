      A prospective observational study to re-establish a new prognostic model for predicting the
      outcome in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) using the current
      recommendation regimen for intermediate and high risk groups and including all potential and
      highly prognostic factors.

    <textblock>
      Bladder urothelial carcinoma is the most common cancer of the urinary tract and is the 7th
      most common cancer in males and the 7th most common cancer in females. Most of newly
      diagnosed cases of urothelial cancer of the bladder are non-muscle invasive (NMIBC), and
      including stages Ta, T1, or Carcinoma in situ (CIS). The initial management is endoscopic
      resection, aiming at complete removal of all visible papillary lesions, and accurate staging
      of the bladder tumor. The future plan is determined based on the results of histopathological
      diagnosis and included either re-resection or adjuvant immunotherapy.

      The incidence of recurrence and progression to muscle invasive disease after resection of
      NMIBC reaches up to 42 % and 21%, respectively, concluding that alternative treatments are
      urgently required. Therefore, the development of prognostic models is of ultimate importance
      to minimize long-term morbidity and improve the outcome. The most commonly used
      stratification systems are the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
      (EORTC) risk tables and the The Club Urologico Espanol de Tratamiento Oncologico (CUETO)
      scoring model. The EORTC risk tables have been constructed based on 2596 patients diagnosed
      with Ta/T1 urothelial bladder carcinoma. Nevertheless, there were low number of patients
      treated with BCG (7%), as well as immediate postoperative instillation of chemotherapy
      (&lt;10%); in addition, there was no second-look transurethral resection (re-TUR) of the bladder
      was performed. The CUETO scoring model has been built based on a retrospective analysis of
      1,062 patients underwent TUR of bladder tumor followed by 6-month BCG maintenance therapy.
      Nevertheless, the study was limited by the relatively old grading systems, lack of re-TUR or
      immediate intravesical instillation, and inadequacy for determining the time of recurrence.

      Pan et al have developed a prognostic nomogram from the retrospective analysis of 1366
      patients with NMIBC classified according to the 2004 World Health Organization
      WHO/International Society of Urologic Pathology grading system. Similarly, this study was
      limited by the retrospective nature, lack of the current recommendations of immediate
      intravesical instillation, and lack of studying other different prognostic factors .
      Ali-El-Dein et al have constructed a nomogram for recurrence and progression based on a
      retrospective analysis of more than 1000 patients from a single institution. Nevertheless,
      there was heterogeneity on the adjuvant regimens, in addition, re-TUR were not performed in
      all patients.

      Recently, Cambier et al have published their nomograms and risk stratification systems based
      on a data from 1812 patients with intermediate risk and high risk NMIBC with adjuvant BCG
      maintenance therapy 1-3 years. Although this study presents the first prognostic factor
      analysis in NMIBC patients receiving the currently recommended 1-3 yr of maintenance BCG, it
      has several limitations. There was no repeat transurethral resection in high risk patients
      during the study period. In addition, there was no central pathology review, and there was no
      data on upper tract status at time of recurrence or progression.

      Although all previously mentioned nomograms have demonstrated significant ability for
      detecting the outcome after transurethral resection of bladder tumor. Neither of these papers
      has included any other biological markers that have been proven to improve the predictive
      ability. Recently, special emphasis has been focused on the relation between smoking with
      recurrence and progression of NMIBC. It has been shown that smoking not only increases the
      risk of disease recurrence and progression, but also Current and heavy long-term smokers seem
      to be at the greatest risk for both end points. In addition, Ogihara et al have shown that a
      positive smoking history was an independent predictor for NMIBC recurrence and refraining
      from smoking for 15 years or more reduced the risk of tumor recurrence in former smokers with
      regardless of the intensity or duration of smoking.

      Inflammation in the tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in the proliferation and
      survival of malignant cells through enhanced angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. The
      underlying mechanisms include recruitment of T lymphocytes, chemokines, activated cytokines,
      secretion of CRP, and neutrophilia . In a recent meta-analysis, Masson-Lecomte et al have
      shown that among different inflammatory predictors, serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP),
      Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and urinary and serum interleukin levels were the most
      prognostic factors for bladder cancer prognosis. Furthermore, Kamat et al have shown that a
      cytokine panel had the potential for identifying patients at risk of tumor recurrence during
      BCG treatment. In addition, interleukin IL-2 have been shown to be the most prognostic
      biomarker for response to BCG therapy.

      In a recent meta-analysis including 15,215 patients, Martin-Doyle et al have shown that the
      highest impact risk factor was depth of invasion into lamina propria. In addition,
      lymphovascular invasion, associated carcinoma in situ, tumor size &gt; 3 cm, and older age were
      independent predictors for progression and cancer specific survival.

      Currently, all publications investigating the outcome after treatment of NMIBC lack several
      factors including the re-staging TUR, maintenance BCG therapy, inclusion of other highly
      prognostic factors e.g. smoking, inflammatory biomarkers, depth of lamina invasion.
      Therefore, this protocol is constructed to combine all clinically affordable biomarkers into
      a prognostic model for predicting the outcome after NMIBC.
