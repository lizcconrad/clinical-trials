  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the expression of keratins before and after application of
      sulforaphane (SF) to determine whether this agent alters skin fragility seen in both
      intrinsic and extrinsic skin aging and UV light exposure.

      The primary purpose of the study is to compare the expression of keratins before and after
      application of sulforaphane (SF) and determine whether these findings alter skin fragility
      seen in both intrinsic and extrinsic skin aging as well as in ultraviolet (UV) light
      exposure.

      This investigation will be done in collaboration with researchers from the Department of
      Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins
      University. The study population recruited by Johns Hopkins Department of Dermatology will
      include up to 50 individuals over the age of 18 with healthy skin. Each study participant
      will have four on-site study visits and will be asked to contribute photographs, undergo non
      invasive elasticity measurements, use topical sulforaphane for 7 days and contribute up to
      four biopsy specimens for laboratory study. The investigators will also evaluate any
      differences in keratins' expression in skin exposed to acute UV light, separately and after
      pretreatment with sulforaphane.

    <description>All areas will be biopsied using standard punch biopsy tools and following standard clinical protocols, including cleansing the skin with an alcohol wipe and injecting local anesthesia with lidocaine and epinephrine. No more than four total skin biopsies will be obtained from a volunteer over the course of the study. After removal of the tissue sample, one or two sutures are placed to close the circular opening. Sutures are removed and a scar is formed, but typically heals well without complications and blends well with the surrounding skin.</description>
