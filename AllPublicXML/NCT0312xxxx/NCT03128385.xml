      This 3-year research project aims to investigate and compare the treatment effectiveness (in
      terms of motor and psychosocial outcomes) and potential predictors (in terms of
      demographical, biological and psychosocial domains) of the intensive and distributed Child-
      and Family-Friendly CIT protocols with an equivalent intervention period in children with CP
      by cross-over study design. In addition, the selection and examination of outcome measures
      were based on the ICF-CY model to provide comprehensively documents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upper limb dysfunction is a common and disabling consequence of children with cerebral palsy
      (CP). As children with hemiplegia primarily have one better funcitoning side of their body
      and one more affected side, they often tend not to use the affected extremity resulting in
      the phenoema of developmental disregard. Recent evidence suggests that constraint-induced
      therapy (CIT) is the most effective technique to improve the use of the affected hand and
      reduce the developmental disregard in children with CP. However, despite the cumulative
      evidence supporting the effects of pediatric CIT, the concerns of feasibility and gaps of
      current knowledge prompt us to conduct this current proposal. The concerns of the feasibility
      include this approach is emotionally problematic at early stages and researchers suggested
      that the orginal CIT protocols may be too intrusive for children and their families. The gaps
      of current knowledge include: no study has directly investigated the effectiveness
      differences between various CIT models; no study examines, monitors and compares the
      psychosocial outcomes while receiving the CIT protocols for children and their parents
      systematically and comprehensively; and no study investigates the possible clinical
      characteristics of children that may influence the training effects of the various CIT
      models.

      Investigators will recruit a total of 60 children with CP from the CP Association, medical
      centers, and special educational systems and participants will be randomly assigned to the
      two intervention groups. The intensive CIT is delivered by the group-based design with 6
      hours a day for 6 days (36 hours in total) and the distributed CIT will be delivered by
      individualized home-based intervention with 2.25 hours a day, two times a week, for 8 weeks
      (36 hours in total).

    <time_frame>Intensive and CIT Model Program: baseline, 1 week, 2 months, 6 months; Distributed CIT Model Program: baseline, 1 months, 2 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BBT assesses manual dexterity by county the number of blocks that are transferred with a single hand from one compartment to another within 60 seconds. In recent years, it has increasingly been used to assess gross manual dexterity of the affected versus the non-affected hand in children and young adolescents with hemiplegia cerebral palsy.</description>

    <measure>&quot;change&quot; Pediatric Motor Activity Log-Revised (PMAL-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Intensive and CIT Model Program: baseline, 1 week, 2 months, 6 months; Distributed CIT Model Program: baseline, 1 months, 2 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PMAL-R is adapted from the Pediatric Motor Activity Log (Taub et al., 2004), which was developed as an outcome measure for evaluating the effectiveness of CIT in children with CP. It is a parent-reported evaluative tool used to capture the spontaneous use of the affected upper limb in 22 daily activities. Each activity is rated by parents/careers on two set (how often and how well) of 6-point ordinal scales (0-5). The 'how often' scale measures amount of use, and the 'how well' scale measures quality of movement, of the affected upper limb. The PMAL-R testing manual is available online.</description>

    <time_frame>Intensive and CIT Model Program: baseline, 1 week, 2 months, 6 months; Distributed CIT Model Program: baseline, 1 months, 2 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BOT-2 is widely used as an efficient and standardized measurement of motor control skills for children aged 4 through 21. The subtest 3 of the BOT-2, manual dexterity (MD), will be used to assess a child's upper limb dexterity. The subtests 3 of the BOT-2 consist of 5 goal-directed activities that involve reaching, grasping, and bimanual coordination with small objects to investigate a child's upper limb manual function</description>

    <time_frame>Intensive and CIT Model Program: baseline, 1 week, 2 months, 6 months; Distributed CIT Model Program: baseline, 1 months, 2 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>For the performance outcome measures, endpoint variables during reach-to-grasp task, namely reaction time, movement time, movement unit, peak velocity and its time percentage during the movement time will be calculated using the wrist marker. For the performance production measures, joint angles of the shoulder, elbow and wrist during reach-to-grasp task will also be calculated to represent the motor strategy of children with CP before and after intervention.</description>

    <time_frame>Intensive and CIT Model Program: baseline, 1 week, 2 months, 6 months; Distributed CIT Model Program: baseline, 1 months, 2 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ABILHAND-Kids questionnaire is a Rasch-based assessment that measures children's perceived difficulty in performing ADL that require the use of the bilateral upper limbs. It contains 21 items measuring manual ability and is rated on a 3-point response scale. The parent is asked to fill in the questionnaire by estimating their child's ease or difficulty in performing each activity, irrespective of the limb(s) the child actually use and whatever the strategies used to perform the activity.</description>

    <measure>&quot;change&quot; Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Intensive and CIT Model Program: baseline, 1 week, 2 months, 6 months; Distributed CIT Model Program: baseline, 1 months, 2 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PEDI is used to evaluate the generalization of treatment effect to daily life. The PEDI assesses the level of independence in daily activities in children with cerebral palsy, including the functional performance and level of assistance needed in daily activities.</description>

    <measure>&quot;change&quot; Dimensions of Mastery Questionnaire (DMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Intensive and CIT Model Program: baseline, 1 week, 2 months, 6 months; Distributed CIT Model Program: baseline, 1 months, 2 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The DMQ provides a primary caregiver's perceptions of mastery motivation. It consists of 45 items across seven subscales and two aspects of mastery motivation. Instrumental mastery focuses on persistence with tasks and includes the subscales of object-oriented persistence, gross motor persistence, social persistence with adults and social persistence with peers. Expressive mastery comprises subscales of negative reactions to failure and mastery pleasure. The final subscale, competence, is considered a separate construct which measures the child's ability to master tasks relative to peers. This involves rating each of the 45 items on a five-point scale ranging from 1=not at all typical to 5=very typical.</description>

    <time_frame>Intensive and CIT Model Program: baseline, 1 week, 2 months, 6 months; Distributed CIT Model Program: baseline, 1 months, 2 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ToP is an assessment designed for measuring the playfulness of individuals between the ages 6 months and 18 years. It is composed of 24 items that are scored following an observation of the individual's free play. Items are scored on a 4-point Likert scale with respect to three dimensions: Extent (0 = rarely or never, 3 = almost always), Intensity (0 = not, 3 = highly), and Skillfulness (0 = unskilled, 3 = highly skilled).</description>

    <measure>&quot;change&quot; Pediatric Engagement Questionnaire (PEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Intensive and CIT Model Program: baseline, 1 week, 2 months, 6 months; Distributed CIT Model Program: baseline, 1 months, 2 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PEO includes two versions, that is, child version and therapist version (PEQ-C, PEQ-T). The items of the PEQ are modified from existing questionnaires Pediatric Motivation Scale (PMOT) and based on tenets of self-determination theory. The PEQ-C consists 16 items by 5-point Likert scale with smiley face figures. It is an event-based measurement of motivation and is designed to measure motivation and the experience of receiving specific therapeutic activities. The PEQ-T represents therapists' observations of the child's engagement, participation, and persistence of master the tasks during interventions sessions. It is also designed as 5-point Likert scale on child's engagement, participation, and task persistence for therapists' points of view.</description>

    <time_frame>Intensive and CIT Model Program: baseline, 1 week, 2 months, 6 months; Distributed CIT Model Program: baseline, 1 months, 2 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PSI-SF is direct derivative from the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) full-length test which was created to sample a diverse range of potential influences on parenting practices to address the need for a psychometrically sound but brief screening measure of parenting stress. All 36 items of the PSI-SF consist of three subscales: Parental Distress, Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction, and Difficult Child. Each subscale consists of 12 items rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).</description>

    <description>All treatment activities will be focused on the training of the more affected upper limbs with contextual restraint. Investigators choose this child-friendly way to restraint children's non or less impaired hand without any devices. Investigators will provide a unilateral activities and verbal cues to restraint participants' non or less affected side. All tailored activities will be designed as fun and age-appropriated based on the child's preference and parents' concerns. In order to help children to generalize the therapeutic gains to the real world environment, the intervention will take place in the natural environment such as home or school where it may be easier to identify real practical problems and makes the family or caregivers involved more closely and directly.</description>
