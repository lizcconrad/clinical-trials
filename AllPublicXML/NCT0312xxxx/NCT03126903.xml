    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Corneal blindness where cornea transplantation is necessary but is expected to be
             unsuccessful due to severe limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) associated with aniridia
             or due to multiple (two or more) failed cornea transplantation surgeries and
             spontaneous visual improvement without surgical intervention is not expected or
             probable.

          -  Best Corrected Distance Visual Acuity (Snellen) which is equal or worse than 20/200 in
             the study eye (but at least light perception with projection)

          -  Estimated visual potential of the study eye is greater than or equal to at least two
             lines visual improvement of BCDVA of current vision in the study eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Visual Acuity of No Light Perception (NLP) in the study eye

          -  The patient is monocular or the non-study eye has Best Corrected Distance Visual
             Acuity (Snellen) of worse than 20/160 due to an ocular condition other than severe
             aniridic limbal stem cell deficiency or due to multiple (two or more) failed cornea
             transplantation surgeries.

          -  Suitable for standard PK with donor tissue in the study eye.

          -  History of severe dry eye syndrome or a Schirmer test with results of less than 3mm
             after 5 minutes of testing with the use of topical anesthetic in either eye.

          -  Active or history of an auto-immune disease (e.g. Rheumatoid Arthritis, Ocular
             Cicatricial Pemphigoid, Lupus, Steven's Johnson Syndrome, atopic keratoconjunctivitis,
             etc.).

          -  On medications that may affect wound healing, such as antimetabolites or other
             chemotherapeutic agents.

          -  History of posterior segment eye disease in either eye (including macular
             degeneration, optic neuropathy, posterior uveitis) which is expected to limit the
             visual improvement to less than two lines of vision.

          -  History of retinal surgery in the fellow eye (including retinal detachment repair,
             intravitreal injection etc.).

          -  History of retinal surgery in the study eye (including retinal detachment repair,
             intravitreal injection, etc.) unless the vision is at least light perception with
             projection in four field quadrants and the macula is attached (if there is no view of
             the retina, an ultrasound must show the macula is attached).

          -  History of uncontrolled glaucoma in either eye (IOP has been measured above 25 mmHg at
             any time in the last 6 months).

          -  Current use of beta blocker eye drops (e.g. timolol, levobunolol, etc.).

          -  Vertical cup-to-disc (C:D) ratio greater than or equal to 0.8 in either eye (if able
             to visible through corneal opacity). If not visible, patient is not to be excluded.

          -  Limited visual potential (patient does not have the ability to improve a minimum of
             two lines of vision of BCDVA by history).

          -  History of amblyopia in the study eye limiting visual potential.

          -  If the patient has had a corneal transplant, corneal transplantation surgery was
             performed less than 2 years ago.

          -  Anticipated need for surgery on the study eye during the course of the study
             (including cataract surgery).

          -  Aphakia in the study eye.

          -  Active ocular infection in either eye.

          -  Hypotony in the study eye (IOP &lt; 6mmHg).

          -  History of herpetic ocular infection in the study eye.

          -  Corneal thickness less than 400 microns in any region of the pachymetry map.

          -  Inability to protect the operated eye from trauma.

          -  Females who are pregnant, lactating, or unwilling to use adequate birth control for t
             the duration of the study.

          -  Patient is currently taking Sumatriptan (Imitrex) and unable to discontinue during the
             study.
