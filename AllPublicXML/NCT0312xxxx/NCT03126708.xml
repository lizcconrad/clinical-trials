    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, controlled trial. At the end of a 28-day screening period,
      all eligible subjects will be randomly assigned into treatment Arm A or B in a 1:1 ratio.
      Subjects in Arm A will receive a maximum of 6 cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin plus
      paclitaxel) and cetuximab weekly in the absence of progressive disease (PD), as assessed by
      the Investigator, and unacceptable toxicity. After 6 cycles of treatment, subjects who derive
      clinical benefit will continue treatment with cetuximab as monotherapy until either PD or
      unacceptable toxicity. Subjects in Arm B will receive the same chemotherapy regimen as Arm A
      alone for a maximum of 6 cycles in the absence of PD and unacceptable toxicity.
