  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the current era of assisted reproductive techniques where technology can help overcome
      defects in sperm function, the value of semen analysis has become even more inaccurate.
      Initial reports of intracytoplasmic sperm injection revealed its ability to bypass the
      natural selection process and enable men with severely impaired semen parameters to achieve
      both clinical pregnancy and live birth

    <description>flowcytometric test where sperm DNA breaks are evaluated indirectly through the DNA denaturability. The assay measures the susceptibility of sperm DNA to acid-induced DNA denaturation in situ, followed by staining with the fluorescence dye acridine orange. By using a flow cytometer 5.000-10.000 sperm can be analyzed within few seconds and thus provide a less subjective result compared to the World health organization analysis where only 1-300 cells are analyzed.</description>
