  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center cross-sectional imaging and correlative biomarker study in patients
      with Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN). Cohort 1 will be patients with
      unresectable or metastatic SCCHN cancer receiving standard of care (SOC) anti-PD-1 treatment
      and Cohort 2 will be neoadjuvant study participants who will receive one dose of anti-PD-1
      treatment prior to tumor resection or radiation. Blood sampling and tissue biopsies will be
      collected from both cohorts and both cohorts will undergo two whole body PET(Positron
      Emission Tomography)/CT(Computed Tomography) imaging with [18F]F-AraG. First scan prior to
      initiating anti-PD-1 treatment and second scan post initiation of anti-PD-1 treatment in
      Cohort 1 and prior to tumor resection or radiation in Cohort 2

      This is a single-center cross-sectional imaging and correlative biomarker study in patients
      with Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN). Cohort 1 will be patients with
      unresectable or metastatic SCCHN cancer receiving standard of care (SOC) anti-PD-1 treatment
      and cohort 2 will be neoadjuvant study participants who will receive one dose of anti-PD-1
      treatment prior to tumor resection or radiation. Blood sampling and tissue biopsies will be
      collected from both cohorts and both cohorts will undergo two whole body PET(Positron
      Emission Tomography)/CT(Computed Tomography) imaging with [18F]F-AraG. First scan prior to
      initiating anti-PD-1 treatment and second scan 6-12 weeks post initiation of anti-PD-1
      treatment in Cohort1 and within 2-3 weeks of administration of one dose of anti-PD-1 in
      Cohort 2.

      This study will help us assess if [18F]F-AraG can be used for noninvasive imaging and
      assessment of T cell activation and expansion in the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, we
      will be assessing if there is a correlation between an increase in the imaging signal and an
      increase in T cell activation (measured directly from the T cells obtained from biopsy
      specimens).

      Patients and care providers will not be blinded to any part of this study. Patients will be
      evaluated one day and one week via telephone visit after each radiopharmaceutical injection
      for safety follow-up. All adverse events will be recorded. Due to the noninvasive and
      non-therapeutic nature of the study, potential risks of the study are anticipated to be low.

    <description>Patients with unresectable and metastatic SCCHN cancer who will receive anti-PD-1 treatment under SOC. SOC treatments currently include nivolumab and pembrolizumab (&quot;anti-PD-1 treatment&quot;). The protocol may be amended to include other agents should they become SOC. Patients will receive a baseline [18F]F-AraG PET/CT scan and another [18F]F-AraG PET/CT scan 6 to 12 weeks after anti-PD-1 dose.</description>

    <description>Patients with de novo SCCHN prior to initiation of anti-cancer treatment (e.g., radiation, chemoradiation, or surgery). Patients will receive ONE DOSE of the anti-PD-1 treatment, after the baseline [18F]F-AraG PET/CT scan, baseline blood and tumor tissue collection. Patients will receive a second [18F]F-AraG PET/CT scan 2 - 3 weeks after the one dose of anti-PD-1 treatment.</description>
