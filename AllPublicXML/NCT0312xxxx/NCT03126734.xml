    <textblock>
      In the present study, investigators propose to study the effects of infant massage in the
      levels of acceptance, commitment and awareness of influence of parents of babies with Down
      syndrome. The measuring instrument of acceptance, commitment and awareness of parental
      influence will be the &quot;This is my baby Interview&quot;. Two groups of intervention will be
      analysed, the experimental, in which parents have participated and applied the knowledge
      learned in the course of infant massage, and control, which does not receive the infant
      massage course during the study. Parents and babies of both groups have been evaluated twice,
      at the beginning of the intervention (pretest) and at the end after five weeks (postest). The
      study population consists of father or mother of 32 infants with Down syndrome between 4 and
      8 months old.
