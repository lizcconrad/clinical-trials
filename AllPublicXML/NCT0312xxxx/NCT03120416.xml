  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Resistance exercise training has been shown to improve cardiovascular health including
      endothelial function in general populations, but studies in patients with chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) are limited. The investigators aim to evaluate the feasibility and
      acceptability of a resistance exercise training program among individuals with CKD and its
      impact on endothelial and vascular function as measured by brachial artery flow-mediated
      dilation, pulse-wave velocity and carotid artery stiffness. To accomplish this goal the
      investigators propose to conduct a 12-week pilot randomized controlled trial of twice a week
      resistance exercise training among 32 adults with CKD. The results of this study will inform
      the design and implementation of a larger trial evaluating the impact of resistance exercise
      training on adverse outcomes in patients with CKD including CKD progression.

    <description>Eight exercises will be used to include large upper and lower body muscle groups. The baseline 1 repetition maximum (RM) will be used to set initial training loads. All exercise sessions will be performed under the supervision of an exercise physiologist. Vital signs and body weight will be recorded before each session. The workload during training will be adjusted to reflect 80% of the most recent 1 RM (approximately 8-12 RM set). In addition, patients' workloads will be progressively increased if the patients can lift the weight more than 12 repetitions. Participants will perform three sets of 8-12 repetitions on each machine per session.</description>
