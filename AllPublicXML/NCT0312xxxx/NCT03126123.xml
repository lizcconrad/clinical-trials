  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anal condylomatosis is an anal canal mucosa pathology caused by HPV infection (Human
      Papilloma Virus). This condition is common, especially in immunodepressed patients.

      These lesions are not accessible to topical medical treatment because of their location. They
      should be treated surgically because they may degenerate into squamous cell carcinoma.

      In the operating room, lesions are identified by a complete proctologic examination, more or
      less supplemented by an acetic acid test. Acetic acid allows to detect mucous degeneration
      (dysplasia) in the form of intense bleaching. The interpretation of this test may
      nevertheless be difficult in case of local inflammation or scarring. These false positives
      may lead to unnecessary surgical gestures. The surgical procedure consists of a mucosectomy
      or destruction of the condylomatosis by electrocoagulation.

      The acetic acid test is used at the discretion of the surgeon. However, there is little data
      on its performance or consensus on its use.

    <description>Application of acetic acid just before surgery to identify suspect areas of dysplasia.
Biopsies of suspicious areas bleached with acetic acid. The true positives (TP) will correspond to lesions bleached by acetic acid and showing dysplasia at biopsy. False positives (FP) will correspond to lesions bleached by acetic acid but not showing dysplasia at biopsy. The positive predictive value (PPV) will be the proportion of TP over the total number of bleached lesions. (PPV = TP / (TP + FP)). The PPV will be given with its 95% confidence interval (95%CI).</description>
