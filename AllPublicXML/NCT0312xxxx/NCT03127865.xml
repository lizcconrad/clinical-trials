      The purpose of this study is to compare the sensitivity and the specificity of electrical
      cardiometry to the lung ultrasound in measuring thoracic lung water in pregnant females with
      pre-eclampsia. If electrical cardiometry is validated against ultrasound, it will be easy to
      use with numerical number that will not require advanced experience as with the ultrasound.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-eclampsia is accompanied with increased risk of serious complications such as pulmonary
      edema, cerebrovascular accidents, coagulopathy, and hemorrhage.

      Pre-eclampsia is responsible for 46.6% of the etiology of acute pulmonary edema in pregnant
      women.

      Fluid management in pre-eclamptic patients is challenging. Hypovolemia exacerbates organ
      failure, whereas volume overload results in pulmonary edema. Thus, using different methods
      for evaluation of volume status of the patients would improve patient management. Lung
      ultrasound has been developed as an accurate non-invasive method for assessment of
      extra-vascular lung water; However, ultrasound needs skilled operator. Electrical velocimetry
      (cardiometry) is a newer technology for assessment of total thoracic fluid content (TFC);
      however, it has not been validated in pre-eclamptic patients.

      In this study the investigators will validate the accuracy of cardiometry in evaluation of
      lung water using the lung ultrasound as a gold standard. Both methods will be evaluated for
      prediction of the need of diuretic therapy and the need for post-operative oxygen therapy.
