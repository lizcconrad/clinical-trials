  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study to assess the feasibility and success of performing an
      intra-operative standing cough test and the correlation with the long term success of the
      sling surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to seek correlation or disparity between the supine versus the sitting cough
      test, supine (lying down) versus standing cough test and sitting versus the standing cough
      test performed at a constant bladder volume; empty in the office and full in the operating
      room. Secondary objective is to test if the intra-operative standing cough test at fullness
      correlates with long term success of the sling surgery.

    <description>Success criteria will be defined through the examination of patient's post-operative visits regarding cough stress tests in supine, sitting and standing positions where the bladder is at 10% of urodynamic fullness. Failure to meet this criteria will be considered recurrence of stress incontinence.</description>
