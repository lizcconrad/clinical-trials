  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep difficulties are among the main symptoms presented by depressed patients, and they can
      profoundly impact course of illness. Acupuncture is a widely recognized therapy to treat
      depressive disorders and sleep disturbances in clinical practice. This multicenter randomized
      placebo-controlled trial is aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of
      electroacupuncture, sham acupuncture and standard medical care, administrated by professional
      acupuncturists and psychiatrists, in depression patients with insomnia.

      The investigators describe a protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Two
      hundred seventy eligible patients in 3 different health-care centers in Shanghai will be
      randomly assigned to one of 3 treatment groups: EA group (electroacupuncture+standard medical
      care), Control A group (sham acupuncture+standard medical care) and Control B group (standard
      medical care). Treatment will be given 3 times per week for 8 weeks. The primary outcomes is
      the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The secondary outcomes are sleep parameters
      recorded in the Actigraphy, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) score and Self-rating
      Anxiety Scale (SAS) score. Daily dose of patients' antidepressant and sedative-hypnotic
      medication will be recorded in the dairy. All adverse effects will be assessed by the
      Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS). Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, 4 weeks
      post-treatment and 8 weeks post-treatment, as well as at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months
      follow-up.

      The findings from this trial will help further about the efficacy and safety of acupuncture
      for depression related insomnia, as well as determine the differences between
      electroacupuncture, sham acupuncture and standard medical care for treating insomnia and
      depression.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 week post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a widely-used questionnaire to assess one's sleep disorders over one month. It is comprised of 19 self-rated items and 5 other-rated items. The scores include the following indicators: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of medication, and daytime dysfunction. Each indicator is rated from 0 to 3. The accumulated scores of the seven indicators constitute the total score of PSQI (0-21). The higher score indicates the worse sleep quality and severer sleep disorders. The investigators set the PSQI score at 8th week post-treatment as the primary outcome, compared with PSQI scores at other time points, to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture for depression related insomnia.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of PSQI scores from baseline to 6 month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 week post-treatment, 8 week post-treatment, 1 month,3 month, 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>As is mentioned above, PSQI is a widely-used questionnaire to assess one's sleep disorders over one month. In order to assess the effects of acupuncture on patients' sleep quality during the intervention period, and to assess the durative effects of acupuncture after the intervention ends, the investigators set the changes of PSQI scores between baseline to 6 month follow-up as the secondary outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Actigraphy</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 week post-treatment, 8 week post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Actigraphy (wActiSleep-BT. LLC, Pensacola, USA), which is worn on the patient's wrist, can monitor the quality of sleep, such as sleep onset, sleep latency, total sleep time, sleep awakenings during the night, duration of sleep, and sleep efficiency. The software ActiLife6 (Version 6.8.1, ActiGraph, LLC) will be used to analyze every participant's sleep condition recorded in the actigraphy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 week post-treatment, 8 week post-treatment, 1 month, 3 month, 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD), an observer-rating questionnaire with 17 items to describe the severity of cognitive and bodily symptoms of depressive disorders. Each item is rated in 3- or 5-point scales. The higher total score indicates the severer depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 week, 8 week post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) is primarily used as a measure of somatic symptoms associated with anxiety. In using the scale, the participant will be asked to rate each item from 0-3 points according to how it applies to him or her within the past week. The standard score is the sum of the integer part of 1.25 times the raw score of the 20 items. A standard score of more than 50 points means the subject has anxious symptoms. A higher score indicates a more serious case of anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dose dairy</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 week, 8 week post-treatment, 1 month, 3 month, 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The dose dairy is a notebook where participants will be required to record their daily dose of antidepressants or sedative-hypnotics from baseline to 6 months follow-up, as well as the dosage time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse effects</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 week post-treatment, 8 week post-treatment, 1 month, 3 month, 6 month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Any adverse event (described as unfavourable or unintended signs, symptoms or diseases occurring during the trial) related to the intervention or administration of antidepressants and sedative-hypnotics will be reported by patients and practitioners and accessed by the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) which is used as an associated indicator to mainly evaluate the safety of acupuncture treatment in this trial.</description>

    <description>Participants in EA group will receive electroacupuncture treatment. Acupuncture will be applied at Baihui (GV20), Shenting (GV24), Yintang (GV29), bilateral Anmian (EX-HN22), Shenmen (HT7), SanYinjiao (SP6) and Neiguan (PC6). After needle insertion, rotating or lifting-thrusting manipulation will be applied for &quot;Deqi&quot; sensation. The EA apparatus (CMNS6-1, Jianjian Medical Device CO., LTD, China) will be connected to the needles at GV20 and GV29 for 30 minutes and deliver a continuous wave. The frequency will be set at about 30 Hz and the amplitude will be less than 20V. Participants can regularly take the antidepressants or sedative-hypnotics as before during the intervention. Besides, the investigators will strengthen health education about insomnia and depression for the patients.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control A group will receive placebo acupuncture treatment with streitberger needles at the same acupoints as the electroacupuncture group. When the tip of the blunt needles touches to the skin, the patient will get a pricking sensation but there is no real needle inserted into the skin. The electroacupuncture apparatus will be set beside the patients, with no connection to the needles. Inform the patients when removing the needles after 30 minutes. Use the dry cotton ball to press the acupoints so that patients can feel the withdrawal of the 'needles'. Same health education and regular administration of antidepressants or sedative-hypnotics will be given to the participants during the intervention.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control B group will keep their standard medical care for the first 8 weeks. Participants will take their regular antidepressants and the sedative-hypnotics during the whole intervention period. Same health education will be conducted as well for the participants. And after waiting for two months, these patients will be treated with the same electroacupuncture treatment as the EA group.</description>
