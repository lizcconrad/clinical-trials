      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of lumbar stabilization
      exercises on pain intensity, transversus abdominis muscle (TrA) activation capacity,
      functional disability, and TrA thickness in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP).
      Subjects: The subjects of this study were 30 CLBP patients. Methods: The experimental group
      performed diverse lumbar stabilization exercises in different postures, and the control group
      conducted an ordinary trunk muscle strengthening exercise. Results: There were significant
      differences in pain intensity, TrA activation capacity, functional disability, and TrA
      thickness between before and after the intervention in both groups. Significant differences
      between the two groups were shown in the pain intensity, TrA activation capacity, and
      functional disability after the intervention. However, there were no significant differences
      between the two groups in TrA thickness. Conclusion: Lumbar stabilization exercises in
      different postures could reduce pain, functional disability, and increase TrA activation
      capacity and thickness in CLBP patients.
