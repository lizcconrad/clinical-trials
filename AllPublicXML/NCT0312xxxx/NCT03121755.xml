  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The type 1 cholecystokinin receptor (CCK1R) is a potential target for the treatment of
      obesity, due to the ability of this GI hormone to elicit satiety. However, this receptor has
      been shown to be sensitive to the cholesterol content of the membrane in which it is
      expressed. Because some patients who might be candidates for the use of CCK agonists to treat
      their obesity and co-morbidities, the goal of this study is to determine how metabolic
      abnormalities might affect the responsiveness of this receptor to CCK. Because the normal
      site mediating CCK-stimulated satiety is on vagal afferent neurons that cannot easily be
      studied, we will collect buffy coat cells from a peripheral blood sample from patients
      involved in the Sangre Por Salud Biobank at Mountain Park Medical Center. Ex vivo, the CCK1R
      will be expressed on these cells and will be functionally characterized, and the cholesterol
      content of the cells will be assayed. These data will be correlated with the clinical,
      biochemical, and metabolic phenotypic data collected as part of the parent study.

      Subjects are volunteers who provide prospective informed consent to be entered into the
      Sangre Por Salud Biobank at Mountain Park Medical Center. These include men and women age
      18-85 of Hispanic/Latino descent, who are not pregnant or have given birth in the previous 12
      months, or who are nursing, and who have not been diagnosed with cancer in the previous three
      years. Two groups of patients are included, representing those who have not been diagnosed as
      having diabetes, and those with diabetes. Subjects undergo entry physical examination and
      standard metabolic phenotyping, with the non-diabetics also undergoing a 2-hour glucose
      tolerance test. Blood samples are also banked and available for other studies, such as the
      one now being described.

      For the current study, 5 ml of blood will be coded and delivered in an anonymized form. Buffy
      coat cells will be isolated and infected ex vivo with a viral construct including the wild
      type CCK1R tagged with a fluorescent tag. Cells will be placed in culture overnight and
      harvested for quantitation of receptor expression and determination of CCK responsiveness and
      cholesterol content. These data will be correlated with selected relevant clinical,
      biochemical, and morphometric data.
