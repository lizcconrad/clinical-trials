  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social deprivation during pregnancy is associated to adverse perinatal outcomes. However,
      prenatal screening of social deprivation by reliable measurement is not performed. Prevalence
      of social deprivation is yet underestimated during pregnancy and vulnerable women are not
      being provided optimal prenatal care.

      Our aim is to validate EPICES score during pregnancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The process of deprivation was defined first by J. Wrezinski and P. Townsend who also
      reported that deprivation is the main cause of inequalities in health. Several studies have
      already shown an association between socioeconomic deprivation and adverse birth outcomes.
      EPICES score is the only one that measure individual deprivation. The EPICES score should be
      therefore included systematically in standard follow-up of pregnant women.

      Descriptive analysis will assess women's characteristics and prevalence of social
      deprivation. Two groups of women will be compared deprived women and non-deprived women.

      Association between EPICES score and the adverse perinatal outcomes will be assessed by
      quantile regression.
