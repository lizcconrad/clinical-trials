  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study seeks to examine the prevalence of amyloid pathology, among patients
      referred to the Toulouse Geriatric Frailty Clinic presenting objective memory impairment. We
      also aim to fully characterize the clinical progression of frail cognitively impaired
      patients presenting AD (Alzheimer Disease) pathology vs those who also present a cognitive
      impairment but do not have AD pathology.

      The COGFRAIL study is a monocentric study integrating the longitudinal follow-up of 345
      individuals referred to the Toulouse Frailty Clinic during 2 years. The procedure consists in
      neuroimaging to diagnose the presence of amyloid plaques in the brains and permit earlier
      detection of Alzheimer's disease.

        -  Visits will be scheduled at baseline, 1 and 2 years for a full neuropsychological,
           functional and physical evaluation.

        -  At 6 and 18 months patients will be seen in consultation by a Geriatrician and research
           assistant for a medical check.

        -  PET-Scan will be scheduled in the 2 months following inclusion for amyloid measurements.
           The MRI will be proposed, depending on the clinical relevance

        -  A blood sample for biobank will be taken at visit 2 and at the end of the study
