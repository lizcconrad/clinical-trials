      The study has a phase Ib and a phase II part. The phase Ib part of the study aims to
      determine the safety and tolerance of administration at a fixed dosing of 1200 mg / 3 weeks,
      concomitantly to the standard preoperative radio-chemotherapy.

      The phase II part of the study aims to explore efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with
      the standard preoperative chemo/radiotherapy in stage II and III rectal cancers.
