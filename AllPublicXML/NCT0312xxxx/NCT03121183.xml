  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The growing use and the expanding indications for cardiovascular implantable electronic
      devices (CIEDs) have been associated to an increase of device removal. The indications of
      CIEDs removal are infectious (55%) or noninfectious (45%) such as upgrading of devices,
      nonfunctional devices and thrombosis. Removal can be performed according to transvenous or
      surgical procedures. Transvenous lead removal (TLR) must be done by experimented
      cardiologists and respecting current consensus. TLR can be done with conventional techniques
      involving inserting locking stylets and telescoping sheaths around the pacing leads to
      separate them from the surrounding scar tissue. These conventional procedures have a success
      rate of ≈65%. TLR thanks to laser sheath has been validated and improved the success rate
      until &gt;95%. However, the TLR from chronically implanted CIEDs still carries a significant
      risk of procedural failure, morbidity, and mortality, related to tearing of the great vessels
      and cardiac structures, even when performed by experienced operators. Even if the transvenous
      extraction using laser sheath seems to be more effective, this strategy would be more
      expensive.

      Considering the availability of several strategies for TLR and the cost heterogeneity of
      procedures, a cost assessment in real life of these therapeutic strategies is essential for
      an optimal choice of therapeutic strategies.

      The study will compare the strategies of percutaneous extraction to surgical extraction.

        -  Mechanical percutaneous extraction is the conventional technique using locking stylets
           and telescoping sheaths around the pacing leads to separate them from the surrounding
           scar tissue.

        -  Laser-assisted lead extraction is most often used in complex procedures and dissolves
           rather than tear the scar tissue.

        -  Sternotomy is the surgical procedure used when leads cannot be removed by percutaneous
           extraction. It is rarely employed.
