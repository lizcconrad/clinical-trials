  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Four healthy hookworm-naive volunteers will be exposed to 50 L3 Necator americanus larvae
      once and will retain infection for up to 2 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Four volunteers will be exposed to 50 Necator americanus L3 larvae. Volunteers will be
      followed on a weekly basis until week 12 after infection. If volunteers develop a patent
      infection, defined by detectable egg production in stool by microscopy at any timepoint
      within week 9 to 12, they will be scheduled to donate faeces on request.

      Two years after infection or if volunteers do not excrete eggs detectable by microscopy on
      week 9 to 12, volunteers will be treated with a 3-day regimen of albendazole to abrogate the
      infection. Retreatment with albendazole will be given to volunteers who remain positive for
      hookworm after treatment.

      Six months after the treatment, volunteers will undergo their last visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, a subject must meet all of the
        following criteria:

        A potential subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from
        participation in this study:

          1. Any history, or evidence at screening, of clinically significant symptoms, physical
             signs or abnormal laboratory values suggestive of systemic conditions, such as
             cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, neurological, dermatological, endocrine,
             malignant, haematological, infectious, immune-deficient, psychiatric and other
             disorders, which could compromise the health of the volunteer during the study or
             interfere with the interpretation of the study results. These include, but are not
             limited to, any of the following:

               -  history of severe asthma or other health conditions that may require future
                  steroid use;

               -  body weight &lt;50 kg or Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt;18.0 or &gt;30.0 kg/m2 at screening;

               -  positive HIV, HBV or HCV screening tests;

               -  the use of immune modifying drugs within three months prior to study onset
                  (inhaled and topical corticosteroids and oral anti-histamines exempted) or
                  expected use of such during the study period;

               -  having one of the following laboratory abnormalities: ferritine &lt;10 ug/L,
                  transferrine &lt;2.04 g/L or Hb &lt;7.5 mmol/L for females or &lt;8.5 mmol/L for males.

               -  history of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell
                  carcinoma of the skin), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years;

               -  any history of treatment for severe psychiatric disease by a psychiatrist in the
                  past year;

               -  history of drug or alcohol abuse interfering with normal social function in the
                  period of one year prior to study onset.

          2. Known hypersensitivity to or contra-indications for use of albendazole. Including
             co-medication known to interact with albendazole metabolism (e.g. carbamazepine,
             phenobarbital, phenytoin, cimetidine, theophylline, dexamethasone).

          3. Known type 1 hypersensitivity to amphotericin B or gentamicin.

          4. For female subjects: positive urine pregnancy test at screening.

          5. Positive faecal PCR or Kato-Katz for hookworm at screening, any known history of
             hookworm infection or treatment for hookworm infection or possible exposure to
             hookworm in the past.

          6. Being an employee or student of the department of Parasitology of the LUMC.

          7. Current or past scars, tattoos, or other disruptions of skin integrity at the intended
             site of larval application.

          8. Subjects with planned travel to hookworm-endemic areas with a stay in non-hygienic
             environment during this trial.
