  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this project is to improve physical function and muscle health in
      teenagers and young adults with cerebral palsy (CP) by using an eccentric-overload resistance
      exercise model

      Specific aims

        1. To compare the efficacy of eccentric-overload vs. weight stack resistance exercise in
           inducing muscle, functional and gait performance adaptations in teenagers with CP.

        2. To increase force, power and muscle mass in the lower limbs of patients with cerebral
           palsy.

        3. To improve gross motor function, balance and gait through eccentric-overload resistance
           exercise in teenagers suffering from cerebral palsy.

      We hypothesize that the time-effective flywheel resistance exercise paradigm will result in
      greater gains in muscle mass and function in teenagers with CP, when compared with
      conventional weight-stack technology. Importantly, we believe these adaptations will be
      translated into enhanced gross motor function, balance and gait performance.

      Forty teenagers and young adults (age range 16-23 yr) with spastic CP will be recruited. They
      will be randomly assigned to flywheel (FL; n=20) or weight-stack (WS; n=20) resistance
      exercise. During 8 weeks, all the teenagers will follow a standard resistance exercise
      training program within the Stockholm Habilitation Center system. In addition, patients will
      perform either flywheel (FL group) or conventional (WS group) leg press resistance exercise
      twice per week. Muscle force, power and activity (electromyography; EMG), leg extension lag,
      co-contraction, balance, functional mobility, gait quality, and muscle and fat thickness of
      lower extremities are assessed in all patients before and after the 8-week intervention (Fig.
      1).
