  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-masked, crossover, randomized, controlled study that aims to evaluate, in
      women with obesity, a possible influence of wheat gluten on food choices, body weight,
      resting metabolism and circulating inflammation markers and adipokines. The volunteers will
      be randomized into two groups, half of them will initiate the experiment by taking 2 placebo
      muffins daily for 4 weeks (Placebo phase) and the remnant volunteers will take 2 corn muffins
      containing 12g of gluten/each for 4 weeks (Gluten phase). At the 1st, 4th and 8th
      experimental weeks will be evaluated body weight, body composition, lipid profile, glucose,
      insulin, leptin, adiponectin, and inflammatory markers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a double-masked, crossover, randomized, controlled study. For this, volunteers will be
      kept on gluten-free diet for 8 weeks. At the first moment, a structured Food Frequency
      Questionnaire will be applied, as well as a 72-hour food register, to evaluate routine of
      food consumption and daily intake of gluten. The volunteers will be randomized into two
      groups, half of them will initiate the experiment by taking 2 placebo muffins daily for 4
      weeks (Placebo phase) and the remnant volunteers will take 2 corn muffins containing 12g of
      gluten/each for 4 weeks (Gluten phase). After that, volunteers will be transferred for the
      other phase for 4 more weeks. During the 8 experimental weeks, all volunteers will be
      instructed to exclude any food containing gluten from their diet. At the 1st, 4th and 8th
      experimental weeks after 12 hours of fasting and 30 minutes of resting, volunteers will be
      submitted to indirect calorimetry, electrical bioimpedance, blood collection and
      anthropometry (weight and height). The volunteers will also respond a questionnaire about
      life habits, family history, previous history, physical activity and food frequency. Blood
      samples will be used to assess blood count, lipid profile, glucose, insulin, leptin,
      adiponectin, and inflammatory markers (soluble VCAM, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen). Four
      weeks after the end of the experiment, and return to the alimentary routine, body weight,
      blood sample, calorimetry and bioimpedance will be reassessed.
