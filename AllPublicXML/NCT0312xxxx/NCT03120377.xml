      Evaluate the effectiveness of a Whole body vibration training program on quadriceps muscle
      strength, functional capacity and respiratory muscle strength in adult renal transplant
      recipients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a randomized controlled clinical trial involving adult renal transplant
      recipients, who will be recruited through eligibility criteria at Nephrology outpatient
      clinics of the Kidney Transplantation Centers of the Hospital das Clínicas of the Federal
      University of Pernambuco (HC-UFPE). Individuals will be randomized and assigned to one of the
      following groups: Platform Group, which will perform 12-week whole body vibration training or
      Platform SHAM Group that will receive treatment without the therapeutic effect of the
      platform. Afterwards, the patients will be submitted to an evaluation, a form with
      sociodemographic data, the clinical history of the disease and the laboratory tests will be
      completed, after which the pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, quadriceps muscle
      strength and thickness, postural balance , Functional capacity, quality of life, risk of
      falls and level of physical activity.
