  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine elements of abuse liability (AL) related to potential product
      adoption of three electronic tobacco vapor products by current smokers relative to high and
      low AL comparator products (usual brand cigarette and nicotine gum, respectively). Changes in
      subjective measures, speed and amount of nicotine uptake, and maximum changes in
      physiological effects during and after product use that follows a 12-hour (minimum) tobacco
      and nicotine abstinence period, will be determined. The electronic tobacco vapor products
      will not be compared to each other.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, open-label, crossover study, designed to evaluate
      subjective effects (i.e., Product Liking [PL], Overall Intent to Use Again [OIUA], Product
      Effects [PE], Urge to Smoke [UTS], and Overall Product Liking [OPL]), plasma nicotine uptake,
      and physiological measures (blood pressure and heart rate) during and following ad libitum
      use of the following five IPs by healthy subjects. Subjects will be evaluated in five
      separate Test Sessions and the active period of each Test Session will last for approximately
      4 hours during and following IP use.

             hypertension, lung disease, cardiac disease, neurological disease or psychiatric
             disorders) based on safety assessments such as clinical laboratory tests, medical
