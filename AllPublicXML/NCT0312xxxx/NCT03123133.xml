  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To verify and validate a biodosimetry test for determining absorbed ionizing radiation dose
      by analyzing gene expression signatures of blood samples collected from patients treated with
      Total Body Irradiation (TBI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order validate the performance of DxTerity's Radiation Biodosimetry Test (RBT) system,
      several clinical centers will provide controlled, de-identified blood samples and associated
      clinical information to DxTerity Diagnostics (DxTerity). Variations in dose and frequency of
      delivery in TBI protocols are expected between the clinical centers and this has been
      accounted for in the study design. Samples from up to 200 participants will be collected via
      this protocol. Blood samples for this study will be collected from radiation therapy patients
      receiving TBI as part of a therapeutic regimen from the site.

      Blood samples (up to 4 mL per time point) may be obtained at the time of routine blood
      collection; participation in this biomarker study will not affect any aspect of patient
      treatment. Study samples will be obtained prior to, during, and post-radiation treatment
      regimen. Associated clinical information will be collected from the subject's medical record,
      as well.

        Blood samples for this study will be collected from radiation therapy patients receiving
        TBI as part of a therapeutic regimen from the site. Fractionated TBI treatment will provide
        a cumulative dose ≥6.0 Gy depending on the specific treatment protocol, or a single
        non-fractionated dose between 1.5 and 3.0 Gy.

             enough to participate in study activities.

          3. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent/assent document indicating
             that the subject or a legally acceptable representative (parent(s)/legal guardian) has
             been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

          4. Diseases treated with HSCT, including malignant and nonmalignant diseases.

          5. Planned fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) as part of clinical care with a
             cumulative dose ≥6 Gy or a single dose between 1.5 and 3.0 Gy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have received chemotherapy within 21 days prior to TBI.

          2. Concurrent chemotherapy with Fludarabine or an investigational product

          3. Cytokine inhibitor or cytokine-inducer therapy within 30 days prior to and during the
             irradiation regimen

          4. Subjects who have received GCSF within 30 days prior to TBI

          5. Participants, who in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with
             the requirements of the study.
