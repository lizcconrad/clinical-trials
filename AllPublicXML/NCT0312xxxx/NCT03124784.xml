    <textblock>
      In this study, the level of oxygen within the blood will be reduced in a controlled manner by
      reducing the concentration of oxygen the study volunteer breathes. The accuracy of a
      noninvasive pulse oximeter sensor under motion conditions will be assessed by comparison to
      the oxygen saturation measurements from a laboratory blood gas analyzer.

    <description>Accuracy will be determined by comparing the noninvasive blood oxygen saturation measurement of the pulse oximeter to that obtained from a blood sample and calculating the arithmetic root mean square error (Arms) value. In order to obtain the Arms value, the blood oxygen saturation measurement is subtracted from the pulse oximeter oxygen saturation measurement for a number of samples, the average of this difference is computed as the bias. The standard deviation of the differences is computed as the precision. The square root of the sum of the squares of bias and precision is computed as the Arms Error value.</description>
