      Real-time continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) has been attempted to be used in ICU,
      but its feasibility, accuracy and confounding factors are controversial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute glucose metabolic disorder (hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia and high glucose variability)
      is common during critical illness and associated with poor prognosis.Continuous glucose
      monitoring system (CGMS), which providing continuous glucose values, is promising to overcome
      these problems mentioned above and finally optimize glucose control.But its feasibility,
      accuracy and confounding factors are controversial.The aims of this study is to assess the
      accuracy, feasibility and safety of CGMS in daily routine in a general ICU in comparison with
      simultaneous laboratory arterial blood glucose (ABG) values
