  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Southeast Asia, Essence of Chicken, a chicken-meat-extract, is a popular beverage and is
      consumed as a traditional remedy for several ailments, including the use as a nutritional
      supplement for sickness, enhancement of mental efficiency, and recovery from mental fatigue.
      While the elderly use it as a nutritional supplement, students use it for relief from anxiety
      during exam times.

      The present study is conducted in order to assess the effects of BEC on various physical and
      mental parameters including physical fatigue, working memory and attention, mood and stress,
      in comparison to placebo.
