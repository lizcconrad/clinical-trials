  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate how the electrical stimulation of a nerve in the
      skin of the earlobe (transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation), alone or in combination with
      two medications (galantamine and pyridostigmine), affects the way the autonomic (involuntary)
      nervous system controls heart rhythm, symptoms on standing, and inflammatory markers in
      female patients with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS). The study consists of 2 parts: a
      screening (1-2 study days), and 3 testing days. The study will take 5 days total and about 16
      participants will be screened for the study. The investigators estimate 13 will be eligible
      to participate in all of the study days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that impairment of the parasympathetic nervous system
      contributes to the symptoms of POTS and that stimulation of this part of the nervous system
      improves the excessive increase in heart rate, standing tolerance and inflammation in
      patients with POTS. For this purpose, the investigators will use electrical stimulation of a
      nerve in the skin of the earlobe (transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation) and two medications
      that increase the levels of acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter) in the central or peripheral
      nervous system (galantamine and pyridostigmine, respectively) to increase the activity of the
      parasympathetic nervous system.

      Screening Procedures: Potential participants will be screened in the Vanderbilt Autonomic
      Dysfunction Center (ADC). Medications affecting heart rate, blood pressure, blood volume,
      inflammatory markers and the autonomic nervous system will be withdrawn for at least five
      half-lives before studies. Patients will undergo a complete history and physical examination,
      ECG, routine clinical laboratory analyses and a blood pregnancy test for women of
      childbearing potential. Autonomic testing including a posture study with plasma
      catecholamines is then performed to determine if they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      Eligible participants will be studied on three separate days in a randomized, double-blind,
      crossover fashion. On each testing day, patients will be given one dose of the study
      medication (either pyridostigmine, galantamine or placebo pill), and then will have two tilt
      table tests (a motorized table with a footboard that moves to an upright position): one with
      the vagal stimulation and one with sham electrical stimulation. Heart rhythm, blood pressure
      and the amount of fluid in the body (body impedance) will be monitored during studies. Blood
      samples (up to a total of 2 tablespoons per study day) will also be collected. The order of
      the study days and tilt tests will be decided at random, like the toss of a coin. Each study
      day will last about 5 hours.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects of 18-45 years, with Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) as defined
             by a heart rate increase â‰¥30 bpm from supine within 10 min of standing or head-up tilt
             in the absence of orthostatic hypotension, with chronic symptoms (&gt; 6 months), and in
             the absence of other acute cause of orthostatic tachycardia.

          -  Subjects able and willing to provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Medical conditions that can explain postural tachycardia (e.g., dehydration,
             medications).

          -  Patients who are bedridden or chair-ridden

          -  Subjects taking any medication known to affect autonomic function or inflammatory
             markers (e.g. corticosteroids) who could not discontinue them before study
             participation.

          -  Conditions associated with chronic inflammatory processes which in the investigator's
             opinion would affect the interpretation of the results. Examples may include smoking,
             diabetes, BMI&gt;30 kg/m2, current infections or cancer.

          -  Other factors which in the investigator's opinion would prevent the subject from
             completing the protocol.
