      The objective of the Get In Touch - Phase 2 (GIT-2) study was to evaluate a diabetes care
      support intervention facilitated by cellular-enabled glucose meters in adults with persistent
      poor control of type 2 diabetes.

      A 2-group randomized crossover trial comparing usual care to a diabetes care support
      intervention among patients with repeated HbA1c recordings greater than 8.0 percent during
      the previous 12 months. The intervention included 6 months of enrollment in Livongo for
      Diabetes, a Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE) based remote diabetes monitoring program
      facilitated by cellular-enabled glucose meters, with additional remote monitoring by their
      usual care team. HbA1c levels were recorded at enrollment and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post
      enrollment. Questionnaire data were collected at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months post
      enrollment. Primary outcomes evaluated were change in HbA1c and treatment satisfaction at the
      6 month endpoint with secondary outcomes of change in HbA1c and treatment satisfaction at the
      12 month endpoint.

    <description>Participants in Intervention First were enrolled in the intervention for the first 6 months of study participation followed by a return to usual care for the following 6 months. The intervention included provision of a cellular-enable glucose meter and enrollment in the Livongo for Diabetes support program that provided both in-the-moment and scheduled support, both provided by Livongo Health Inc.</description>
