  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of tooth decay and other oral disease are often overlooked indicators of
      overall public health. To improve the understanding of oral health in El Paso, the City of El
      Paso Health Department has teamed up with Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El
      Paso in a collaborative effort to determine the factors that contribute to poor oral hygiene,
      and lead to cavities and periodontitis. The team will collect saliva, oral debris, leftover
      teeth and plaque from children and young adults to study oral infections, markers of
      inflammation, and other contributors to tooth decay and oral illnesses. Samples also will be
      stored for future investigations. This joint effort will provide a better picture of oral
      health in El Paso, and will define a framework for prevention, earlier diagnosis, and better
      treatment.
