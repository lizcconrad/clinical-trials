    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is comparing the effect of almond and pistachio, as the two
      common types of nuts, consumption on healthy obese and overweight female who following a
      hypocaloric diet for 12 weeks. The secondary aim of the current study is to evaluate of these
      two type of nuts on other cardiometabolic risk factors.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Weight</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Body weight was taken to the nearest 0.1 kg using a digital calibrated scale (Omron Health Care, Hoofddorp, Netherland), whilst subjects wore light clothing and no shoes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Waist circumference</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Waist circumference (WC) was measured with a rigid measuring tape and recorded to the nearest 0.5 cm. WC was measured at the smallest horizontal circumference between the ribs and iliac crest (the natural waist), or, in case of an indeterminable waist narrowing, halfway between the lower rib and the iliac crest.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>fasting blood glucose</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were measured using the enzymatic colorimetric method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HbA1c</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Glycated hamoglobin (HbA1c) was measured by a colorimetric method after an initial separation by ion exchange chromatography (Biosystem, Barcelona, Spain).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HOMA-IR</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Insulin resistance was evaluated by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), which was calculated by using the following formula HOMA-IR = [fasting insulin (mU/l) × FPG (mmol/l)]/22.5</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>lipid profiles</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Biochemical analysis of the serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was carried out on a Selectra E auto analyzer (Vita Laboratory, Netherlands) following standard procedures of the Pars Azmoon diagnostic kits (Iran). The LDL cholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald formula.
LDL cholesterol = TC - HDL cholesterol + (TG ÷ 2.2)</description>

    <measure>Insulin</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Insulin was measured by using a radioimmunoassay with 125I-labeled human insulin and a human insulin antiserum in an immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) (Biosource, Dorest, Belgium) with a gamma-counter system (Gamma I; Genesys).</description>
