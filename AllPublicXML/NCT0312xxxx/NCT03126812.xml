    <textblock>
      This is a single arm feasibility study in patients with primary FIGO stage IV serous ovarian,
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer to evaluate neo-adjuvant + adjuvant pembrolizumab for
      its capacity to induce and broaden T cell responses against tumor neo-antigens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long-term survival in stage IV serous ovarian, peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancer is poor
      and has not significantly improved over the last decades. Standard treatment consists of
      debulking surgery and six courses of carboplatin and paclitaxel. Nevertheless, the disease
      recurs in &gt;90% of women, usually within two years.

      Since early observations that the presence of infiltrating T cells is associated with
      improved outcome, ovarian cancer is linked to a potential benefit of immunotherapy.10 More
      recently, T cell checkpoint blockade with anti-PD1 and anti-PDL1 have shown promising
      activity in platinum resistant ovarian cancer with objective and durable responses in 10-20%
      of patients. This finding raises the question whether anti-PD1 could also play a role in
      first line treatment of ovarian cancer.

      To fully use the power of T cell checkpoint inhibition, sufficient TCR stimulation is
      required. Importantly, the amount of antigen that can provide this signal will correlate with
      tumor load, and because of this adjuvant immunotherapy may work most efficiently, when
      initiated prior to surgery. In addition, we postulate that antigen retrieval will increase
      after induction treatment with cytotoxic therapy.

      To address these questions, we propose a feasibility study in patients with FIGO stage IV
      serous ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer in which we evaluate pembrolizumab added
      to standard treatment for its capacity to induce and broaden T cell responses against
      neo-antigens.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent for the trial.

          -  Diagnosis of primary stage IV high-grade serous ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube
             cancer.

          -  Age &gt;= 18 years on day of signing informed consent.

          -  Willing and able to provide three tumor biopsies (1 FFPE, 2 fresh frozen) prior to
             start of treatment

          -  Performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

          -  Adequate organ function as defined in Table 1 of the protocol

             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
             will be required.
