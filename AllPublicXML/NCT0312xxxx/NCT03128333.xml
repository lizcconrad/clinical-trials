  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine whether self-monitoring PA with the RunKeeper app with
      additional physiotherapy coaching is superior in improving patients' self-reported
      leisure-time PA compared with usual care in cancer patients after 12 weeks.

      This is a single-center, prospective, two-armed, randomized controlled trial. Adult cancer
      patients and cancer survivors are randomized in one of the two study arms, (Group A)
      RunKeeper app + physiotherapy coaching or (Group B) usual care.

      Patients assigned to the intervention group will be instructed to use the RunKeeper app for
      12 weeks to self-monitor leisure-time PA. In addition, patients will be educated about the
      health risks of a sedentary lifestyle, inactivity and (when applicable) other unhealthy
      lifestyle behaviors (e.g. unhealthy diet, overweight or obesity, sun exposure, alcohol
      intake). Benefits of a behavior change, becoming physically active and pursuing a healthy
      lifestyle will be explained by a trained physiotherapist who will also coach the patient
      during the PA program. The biweekly physiotherapy coaching starts at baseline and will follow
      a structured sequence of strategies to change patients PA behavior which will contribute to
      the adoption of leisure-time PA in patients daily living, so the program will be optimally
      tailored to the patients capabilities and preferences.

      The primary endpoint is to examine the effectiveness of the RunKeeper use with additional
      physiotherapy coaching in improving patients' leisure-time PA compared with usual care in
      cancer patients as measured by the PASE subscale leisure-time Sum Score at baseline, 6, 12
      and 26 weeks.

    <description>Group A will use the RunKeeper app for half a year to self-monitor leisure-time PA. Besides, patients are requested to activate the 'training reminder' option in the RunKeeper app, which is all explained in a brief user's manual. In addition, patients will be educated about the health risks of a sedentary lifestyle, inactivity and (when applicable) other unhealthy lifestyle behaviors (e.g. unhealthy diet, overweight or obesity, sun exposure, alcohol intake). Benefits of a behavior change, becoming physically active and pursuing a healthy lifestyle will be explained by a trained physiotherapist who will also coach the patient during the PA program.</description>
