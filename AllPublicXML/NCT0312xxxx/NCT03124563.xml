    <textblock>
      The study goal is to design an intervention utilizing implementation intentions to help
      participants prospectively plan and visualize ways to increase activity for the next day
      among working adults who do not currently exercise or use an activity monitor. Investigators
      will assess the level of and changes in physical activity, and how this relates to various
      individual factors that are related to exercise and health, including self-efficacy, control
      beliefs, and cognition.

      The 5-week study consists of a 1-week baseline, where participants are asked to wear a Fitbit
      to document the number of steps taken that day to establish an objective measurement of steps
      before the intervention began. In the intervention condition, after the baseline week, during
      weeks 2 to 5, this condition is prompted with an email each evening for four weeks to review
      their schedules for the following day and identify time slots where they could add activity.
      They are given instructions for providing a detailed calendar of appointments and open slots
      for the next day using a simple daily planner. The planning intention manipulation involves
      recording specific information about when, where, and how they will add steps to their day.
      They are provided with maps near their home and work with specific information about
      distances, estimated time to walk between different points, and number of steps for specific
      routes to help them in planning for specific routes.The control condition is matched for how
      much contact they have with the research staff (called and emailed the same amount of times)
      and also wear the Fitbit daily. The only difference from the intervention group is that they
      do not get the daily planning instructions or maps for the implementation intention strategy
      treatment.

    <description>Participants will wear a Fitbit Zip for 5 weeks to record their daily step data. The first week of the study will provide a baseline measurement of steps. After this week, participants will receive maps of different routes near their home and/or work of varying distances and step counts. They will also begin receiving daily emails asking them to report their step count. Additionally, they will be asked to review their schedule for the next day and identify times when they could add steps into their schedules, and to record their daily step data in the daily questionnaire. The participants in this arm will receive all components of the intervention including: scheduling, maps, and activity goals.</description>
