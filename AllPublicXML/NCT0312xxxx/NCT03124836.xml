  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the level of methemoglobin (HbMet) will be increased in a controlled manner by
      administering sodium nitrite intravenously in healthy volunteers. The accuracy of the
      noninvasive HbMet measurement by a Pulse Oximeter Sensor will be assessed by comparison to
      blood measurements from a laboratory analyzer.

    <description>Accuracy willl be determined by comparing the noninvasive blood methemoglobin measurement (expressed as a percentage of total hemoglobin) of the pulse oximeter to that obtained from a blood sample and calculating the arithmetic root mean square(Arms) error value.In order to obtain the Arms value, the blood sample methemoglobin value is subtracted from the pulse oximeter methemoglobin value for a number of samples, the average of this difference is computed as the bias. The standard deviation of the differences is computed as the precision. The square root of the sum of the squares of bias and precision is computed as the Arms Error value.</description>
