      Non-diabetic pregnant women who undergo elective CS will be randomized into two groups: group
      I included women who has their skin closed with subcuticular interrupted mattress suture
      using non-absorbable polypropylene, and group II included women who has their skin closed
      with subcuticular continous suture using the same suture material

    <description>through visual analogue score The visual analogue scale or visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. When responding to a VAS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points.</description>
