      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of vesicular stomatitis virus-human
      interferon beta-sodium iodide symporter (VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS) in treating patients with stage IV
      endometrial cancer or endometrial cancer that has come back. The study virus,
      VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS, has been changed so that it has restricted ability to spread to tumor cells
      and not to healthy cells. It also contains a gene for a protein, NIS, which helps the body
      concentrate iodine making it possible to track where the virus goes. VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS may be
      able to kill tumor cells without damaging normal cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the optimal dose schedule, safety and tolerability as measured by the
      incidence of significant toxicity of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS in immunocompetent patients with
      metastatic and/or recurrent endometrial cancer (EC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity profile of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS. II. To determine the time course of
      viral gene expression and virus elimination, and the biodistribution of virally infected
      cells at various times points after infection with VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS using Tc-99m
      pertechnetate planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed
      tomography (CT) imaging.

      III. To assess virus replication, viremia; viral shedding in urine and respiratory
      secretions; and virus persistence after intravenous (IV) administration of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS.

      IV. To monitor humoral responses to the injected virus. V. To estimate the tumor response
      rate and overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS in patients with EC by
      measurement of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS in blood by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
      (RT-PCR).

      II. To characterize the pharmacodynamics (PD) of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS by way of measuring serum
      interferon-beta and also VSV-RT-PCR of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS listed above.

      III. Assess CD8+ T cell (both general and VSV-IFNbeta-NIS specific) and natural killer (NK)
      cell responses.

      IV. Gene expression analysis pre- and post-virotherapy. V. Evaluate transcription of
      interferon mediated genes (protein kinase R, the death receptor-TRAIL, 2'-5'
      oligoadenylate/RNAse L proteins, heat shock proteins [Hsp 60/70/90], major histocompatibility
      class antigens and IRF-7).

      VI. Assess presence of VSV in tumor and normal tissues subsequent to administration of IV
      VSV-IFNbeta-NIS.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS.

      Patients receive VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. After 3-5 days, patients
      receive technetium Tc-99m sodium pertechnetate IV, and about 30 minutes later, undergo whole
      body planar imaging and SPECT/CT imaging. If previous imaging data are positive, patients
      receive technetium Tc-99m sodium pertechnetate IV and undergo another planar and SPECT/CT
      scan 7-10 days after VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS infusion. Biopsy of accessible NIS image-positive
      tumors may occur after any imaging. Patients also undergo image-guided biopsy of accessible
      tumor on day 29.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until disease
      progression and then every 6 months for up to 5 years.
