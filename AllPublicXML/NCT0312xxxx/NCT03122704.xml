      Pregnant women at 20 0/7 to 36 6/7 weeks of gestation, conceived through ART, with signs and
      symptoms of preterm labor will be recruited.

      Anal - vaginal fluid samples will be taken by 2 cotton swabs from each participant for
      culture. Digital examination will be performed after that. Only participants fulfilling all
      the study's eligible criteria will be interviewed face-to-face with a questionnaire.

      The samples will be sent immediately to My Duc hospital laboratory or will be stored in
      Stuart-Amies medium in &lt; 4 hours. All culture results are interpreted based on Clinical and
      Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) in 2012.

      Statistical analysis was performed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) v.20
      and chi-square test. A p-value of &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
