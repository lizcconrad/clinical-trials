    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of CT053PTSA in Relapsed/refractory AML patients with FLT3 gene
      mutation.

    <textblock>
      It is a multi-center , open-label, dose escalation study conducted in 2 parts.
      Dose-escalation part: Subjects will receive oral CT053PTSA once daily repeatedly until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs, each cycle is defined as 28 days. At
      least 3 subjects will receive CT053PTSA at each dose (60, 80, 100mg) for determination of
      Maximum Tolerated Dose(MTD) and Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) Dose reduction of CT053PTSA will
      be considered if study drug-related toxicities are observed in a subject after Cycle 1.

      Expansion part:Expansion cohort might be set to further investigate the safety and efficacy
      of CT053PTSA at or lower MTD dose recommended by dose-escalation part.
