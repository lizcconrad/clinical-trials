  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the effectiveness of an upper extremity prosthesis in
      improving the upper extremity function of children with cerebral palsy who have limited use
      of their hands. Twelve children, aged 4-17 years, who have cerebral palsy and limitations in
      their ability to use their hands, will be enrolled. All participants will be fitted with a 3D
      printed arm/hand prosthesis and receive 8 occupational therapy sessions. Each subject will be
      evaluated pre-treatment, post-occupational therapy sessions and at 6 months follow-up. The
      evaluation will include assessment of (1)passive and active arm/hand movement and
      (2)functional hand skills using several standardized tests. The results from the
      pre-treatment and the two post-treatment evaluations will be compared.

    <measure>Scores on Manual Ability Classification System</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) describes how children with cerebral palsy use their hands to handle objects in daily activities. MACS describes five levels. The levels are based on the children's self-initiated ability to handle objects and their need for assistance or adaptation to perform manual activities in everyday life.</description>

    <measure>Scores Assisting Hand Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA) is a test of hand function in children with difficulties using one of their hands. The AHA measures how effectively the affected hand and arm is used in bimanual performance. An assessment is performed by observing the child's spontaneous handling of toys in a relaxed and playful session.</description>

    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>A test of unilateral upper limb function is a validated and reliable tool for evaluating quality of upper limb movement in children with neurological conditions aged 2.5 to 15 years.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Scores Pediatric Motor Activity Log</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Individuals are asked to rate Quality of Movement (QOM) and Amount of Movement (AOM) during 30 daily functional tasks (original MAL), 28 functional tasks (MAL 28) or 14 tasks (MAL 14). Target tasks include object manipulation (e.g. pen, fork, comb, and cup) as well as the use of the arm during gross motor activities (e.g. transferring to a car, steadying oneself during standing, pulling a chair into a table while sitting).
Items scored on a 6-point ordinal scale.</description>

    <measure>Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL is a brief, standardized, generic assessment instrument that systematically assesses patients' and parents' perceptions of HRQOL in pediatric patients with chronic health conditions using pediatric cancer as an exemplary model. The PedsQL is based on a modular approach to measuring HRQOL and consists of a 15-item core measure of global HRQOL and eight supplemental modules assessing specific symptom or treatment domains.</description>
