  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Training patients to alter their own therapy early in the course of a developing exacerbation
      (self-management) has been shown to improve outcomes in asthma, but there is no good evidence
      on this for patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Case management, with
      patients having an identified contact who helps them access care when necessary, has been
      shown to improve outcomes in recent studies. A combined approach, called supported
      selfmanagement, may be particularly suitable for this socially and often educationally
      disadvantaged group of patients.We propose to identify 500 patients at the time of an
      exacerbation to test this combined strategy in a randomised manner. The primary outcome
      measure will be readmission to hospital or death due to COPD, important in terms of patient
      preferences, quality of life and health costs. This will provide important information about
      intermediate care for COPD patients which should influence service provision within the NHS
      in Scotland

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There have been no randomised controlled trials from UK settings reporting either the effect
      or the costs of an intensive, individualised case- and self-management intervention for
      patients with COPD. Given new evidence from other countries (discussed above), we propose
      that a combined case- and self-management (henceforth referred to as &quot;supported
      self-management&quot;) intervention is most likely to produce measurable benefits from this
      socially and physically disadvantaged group of patients. Supported self-management involves:

        1. Individualised self-management education, delivered in the patient's own home at
           fortnightly intervals over a two-month period with monthly telephone follow-up. This
           component of the intervention is based on an intervention shown to be effective in
           Canada. It is based on the principle of empowering patients to manage their COPD
           themselves more effectively by improving disease understanding and symptom monitoring,
           and improving patients' confidence to carry out appropriate action, such as altering
           therapy early on in the evolution of an exacerbation or initiating contact with a named
           professional for telephone advice, a home visit or further hospital care (case
           management) as and when required. We believe home visits are critical to the success of
           this intervention as this group of breathless and disabled patients often default from
           clinics and rehabilitation attendance on account of exacerbations or breathlessness.

        2. To maintain the impact of self-management training, a named nurse will visit the patient
           at (a maximum interval of) six-weeks to reinforce self-management messages; this nurse
           will also be contactable by the patient, as required, prompting an earlier home visit,
           or GP or hospital attendance as appropriate.

      This supported self-management approach (intervention group) will be compared with standard
      care (control group).

      Aim: To address, via a prospective randomised controlled trial in Glasgow, whether supported
      self-management, in addition to usual care, in patients with moderate to severe COPD has a
      measurable benefit on patient morbidity and mortality compared to usual care.

    <description>Supported Self-management. This will consist of fortnightly individual patient sessions at home of approximately 40 minutes for two months, with home visits at a maximum frequency of 6 weeks thereafter for 1 year. Follow up visits will be less structured, and based on the patient's individual agenda as well as reviewing and reinforcing basic self-management messages. Patients will be provided with an individualised self-management plan and symptom diary cards to use as a monitoring aid. Patients will be trained to identify and treat exacerbations associated with purulent sputum with antibiotic and those associated with increased breathlessness, mucoid sputum and/or upper airway symptoms with Prednisolone.</description>

    <description>Usual care. The control group will receive usual care, as decided by their GP and or hospital consultant, and the patient themselves (e.g., NHS 24 helpline). They will be asked to complete diary cards and receive telephone follow up calls as an attention control, similar to the intervention group.</description>

    <description>Supported Self-management. This will consist of fortnightly individual patient sessions at home of approximately 40 minutes for two months, with home visits at a maximum frequency of 6 weeks thereafter for 1 year. Further details of the rubric of the initial training sessions are given in Appendix 1 and will use adapted versions of the Bourbeau self-management and education materials. Follow up visits will be less structured, and based on the patient's individual agenda as well as reviewing and reinforcing basic self-management messages. Patients will be provided with an individualised self-management plan and symptom diary cards to use as a monitoring aid. Patients will be trained to identify and treat exacerbations associated with purulent sputum with antibiotic and those associated with increased breathlessness, mucoid sputum and/or upper airway symptoms with Prednisolone.</description>
