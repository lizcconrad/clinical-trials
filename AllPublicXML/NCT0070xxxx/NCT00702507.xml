  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether repeated use of 0.25% miconazole nitrate
      ointment in newborns and infants with a yeast infection in the diaper area causes the yeast
      to become resistant to the drug.

    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the potential for the development of resistance
      in Candida spp. after repeated treatment courses of 0.25% miconazole nitrate ointment in
      neonates and infants up to one year of age.

    <description>OC was defined as both clinical (therapeutic) cure with total resolution of signs/symptoms (no clinical signs of infection) and microbiological cure with mycological eradication (both negative potassium hydroxide [KOH] and culture results). Participants who had OC were categorized as &quot;Successes&quot;; those without OC were categorized as &quot;Failures.&quot; Any discontinued or lost to follow-up participant was also considered a failure.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Evaluations Using the Diaper Dermatitis Severity Index Score for Initial Treatment Episode</measure>
    <time_frame>Test-of-cure visit (Day 14) of initial treatment episode</time_frame>
    <description>The diaper dermatitis severity index score was calculated as the sum of severity grades for each parameter evaluated (erythema, papules or pustules, and erosions) for the initial treatment episode. The maximum score possible for the diaper dermatitis severity index is 8. Rating scale for Erythema: 0 (none to trace), 1 (mild [pink]), 2 (moderate [red]), 3 (severe [beefy red]). Rating scale for Papules or Pustules: 0 (none to trace [0]), 1 (few [1-10]), 2 (multiple [11-20]), 3 (many [21-40]), 4 (abundant [more than 40]. Rating scale for Erosions: 0 (absent), 1 (present).</description>

    <description>The diaper dermatitis severity index score was calculated as the sum of severity grades for each parameter evaluated (erythema, papules or pustules, and erosions).

    <description>OC was defined as both clinical (therapeutic) cure with total resolution of signs/symptoms (no clinical signs of infection) and microbiological cure with mycological eradication (both negative potassium hydroxide and culture results) at TOC visit for initial episode (ep.) to third ep. Participants (par) who had OC were categorized as &quot;Successes&quot;; those without OC were categorized as &quot;Failures&quot; (discontinued/lost to follow-up par were also failures). A RE is not temporally associated with a prior episode (PE) irrespective of whether the PE involves continuing treatment with study medication.</description>
