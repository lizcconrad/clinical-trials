      The purpose of this study is to develop a blood test for major depression and measure the
      effects of ziprasidone monotherapy on these markers.

      Specific Aim: Using a multiplex biomarker assay we will measure levels of 16 biomarkers in
      patients with MDD enrolled in this ancillary study (adjunct to study NCT00555997) and compare
      these results to those of healthy controls&quot; (defined as research subjects who have not met
      criteria for any lifetime Axis-I disorder (DSM-IV)) from an existing dataset at PHB.

      This proposed study will be an ancillary study to clinical trial NCT00555997
      (www.clinicaltrials.gov) entitled: &quot;A 12-Week, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled,
      Parallel-Sequential Trial of Ziprasidone as Monotherapy for Major Depressive Disorder&quot;
      (MDD).&quot; Precision Human Biolaboratory (&quot;PHB&quot;) is attempting to develop a proprietary blood
      test intended to potentially serve as a biological marker (&quot;bio-marker&quot;) for MDD.
      Specifically, PHB's research team will employ a unique approach towards developing a
      diagnostic test for MDD: measures from multiple blood-based biological markers will be
      obtained from patients with MDD and then analyzed with the use of several interrelated
      algorithms in order to derive a single biological measure (&quot;bio-marker&quot;) with a high
      predictive value for MDD. PHBs' test panel of blood-based biological markers will consist of
      a number of cytokines, stress related hormones, and binding proteins that have each been
      linked to MDD. This innovative test panel is expected to provide general practice physicians
      with a tool to more accurately identify and classify patients with MDD which, in turn, could
      potentially , allow for the more effective monitoring of pharmacotherapy (antidepressant drug
      therapy). Thus, the development of a highly reliable biomarker for MDD could improve the
      standard of care for depression.

      For this ancillary study, 120 antidepressant-free outpatients with MDD who have been deemed
      eligible to participate in trial NCT00555997 will be recruited from participating centers.
      Participating subjects will undergo a blood draw during the baseline visit for NCT00555997.
      Values obtained will be compared with those of &quot;healthy controls&quot; (defined as research
      subjects who have not met criteria for any lifetime Axis-I disorder (DSM-IV)) from an
      existing dataset at PHB.

          -  MDD, current according to the fourth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
             for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) as diagnosed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric
             Interview (MINI; Sheehan et al, 1998).

          -  Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self-Rated (QIDS-SR- Trivedi et al,
             2004) score of at least 10 at both screen and baseline visits.
