      The purpose of the study is to evaluate tolerability and efficacy of escitalopram (Cipralex)
      treatment in doses beyond 20mg (20-40 mg/d) in patients with OCD and schizophrenia, non
      responsive or partially responsive to recommended doses (evaluation according to Y-BOCS).

      An open label, prospective study. The study will include 20 patients recruited from the
      inpatient wards and from the outpatient clinic who have a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia
      or schizoaffective disorder and OCD.

      Before entering the study all patients will be interviewed by 2 senior board certified
      psychiatrists in order to confirm the diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder
      and OCD according to DSM-IV criteria.

      After confirming the diagnosis of schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and OCD each patient
      will be evaluated by PANSS, Y-BOCS and GCI-S scales. Those patients who score above 12 points
      on the Y-BOCS will be eligible for the study.

      Rating scales (PANSS, Y-BOCS, CGI-S, CGI-I) will be completed on a weekly basis during the
      whole 13 weeks period. In addition patients will be asked to report medication side effects
      and will also be clinically evaluated for side effects by the physician. Special attention
      will be paid to worsening of psychosis or OC symptoms. All patients whose mental status will
      deteriorate or those who cannot tolerate the drug will be dropped-out and intent to treat
      analysis will be made.
