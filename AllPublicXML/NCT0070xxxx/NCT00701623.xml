  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burns are injuries caused by agents thermal, chemical, electrical or radioactive who act in
      the tissue lining of the human body and may partially or totally destroy the skin and its
      annexes, to the deeper layers, as subcutaneous tissue, muscles, tendons and bones .

      Studies show that topical heparin has, in addition to the already known anticoagulant
      activity, anti-inflammatory properties, analgesic, and neoangiogenic, stimulating blood flow
      and increasing the repair of the fabric as well as the restoration of collagen and
      reepiteliztion. Moreover, the use of heparin reduces the need for painful medical procedures,
      as debridations, surgeries and transplants The intention of this work is to verify the
      effectiveness and safety of sodium heparin in the treatment of burns of the skin.
