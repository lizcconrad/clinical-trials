  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interethnic differences in warfarin dose requirements in the Asian population have been well
      described. Our previous studies showed that warfarin maintenance doses in our multi-ethnic
      population were closely related to patient demographics and genetic polymorphisms in
      cytochrome(CYP)P4502C9 and vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1(VKORC1). A
      retrospective regression model combining these predictors accounts for 57.8% of the
      variability in warfarin dose.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that warfarin dose requirement could be more accurately predicted
      using a simplified genotyping procedure requiring the identification of a single CYP2C9
      allele and a single nucleotide polymorphism of VKORC1 to discern between the 2 major
      haplotypes H1 and H7.

      Aims: The aim is to compare the clinical benefits of genetics-guided dosing versus
      traditional trial and error dosing with protocol guided-adjustments. Two secondary objectives
      are (1) to prospectively evaluate a dosing algorithm built on demographics and genetic
      predictors; (2) to assess the feasibility of a simplified test for CYP2C9*3 and VKORC1 SNP in
      clinical practice.

      Methodology: A randomized controlled trial targeted at accruing 100 patients with indication
      for wafarin therapy. The endpoint for comparing genetics-guided dosing against traditional
      dosing method at the anticoagulant clinic is the number of dosage titrations to achieve
      targeted International Normalized Ratio (INR) at 1, 2 and 3 months of initializing warfarin.
      Upon reaching steady-state, pharmacokinetics of warfarin R- and S-isomers will be assessed
      for correlation with dose requirements based. An assay for easy identification of genetic
      polymorphisms required in this dosing regimen in a clinic setting will also be validated.

      Significance: This concerted, multi-disciplinary effort to bring pharmacogenetics-based
      therapy from bench to bedside has the potential to reduce the efforts incurred with multiple
      dose titrations of the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant. With the aid of
      mathematical modeling, a simplified and more cost-effective genotyping method could be
      implementation for the future treatment and prophylaxis of thromboembolic diseases.

    <description>1. Number of dosage titrations/adjustments required to achieve targeted International Normalized Ratio (INR) at 3 months of initializing warfarin. The number of titrations refers to the number of times warfarin dosage was adjusted when INR was out of target range (&gt;1.9 and ≤ 3.1) or in response to an adverse event or therapeutic failure. This endpoint will be compiled every 4 weeks, up to 3 months after the initialization of warfarin therapy</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Upon reaching steady-state, pharmacokinetics of warfarin R- and S-enantiomers will be determined for correlation with dose requirements and genotypes based on a single 5ml blood sample taken after achieving target INR without a change in dose for at least 3 months. Warfarin concentrations will be measured using a validated method through a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method modified from Henne et al.</description>

    <description>For patients randomized to the pharmacogenetics-guided dosing group, this 10mls of blood will be immediately sent for genotyping studies. Genotyping results will be available for pharmacogenetics-guided dosing within 3 working days, (ranging 3 to 5 days). During this period, if patients need to be initiated on anticoagulation, a low molecular weight heparin, Fraxiparine, will be given. Fraxiparine will be overlapped with warfarin for 2 to 3 days until target INR is achieved. Elective cases should have the pharmacogenetics-based warfarin dose available at the time of warfarin therapy.</description>

    <description>For patients randomized to the traditional dosing regime, the blood will be stored and genotyped retrospectively at the end of the study. Overlapping of warfarin with Fraxiparine or heparin till target INR is achieved is allowed for this group as per normal clinical practice. All warfarin dosage adjustments based on INR results will be according to the current protocol used by the NUH Anticoagulant Clinic.</description>
