  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ridaforolimus (Deforolimus, AP23573, MK-8669) is an mTor inhibitor shown to have promising
      activity in adults with a variety of solid malignancies, particularly the sarcomas. To date,
      no studies to evaluate appropriate dosing or to obtain pharmacokinetic data in pediatric
      patients have been conducted. Sarcomas are the second most common solid malignancies in
      children and young adults, and for those patients with recurrent or refractory disease, new
      therapies are needed. This initial evaluation of ridaforolimus will help define appropriate
      dosing and toxicity evaluations, as well as establish the first pharmacokinetic and biologic
      correlative data in pediatric patients treated with ridaforolimus.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female age 1 to &lt;18 years at the time of study entry for the dose escalation
             portion of the study

          -  Histologic diagnosis of a malignant lymphoma or solid tumor, including tumors of the
             central nervous system that has progressed in the opinion of the investigator despite
             standard therapy or for which no effective standard therapy is known

          -  Patients may have measurable or non-measurable disease as defined by RECIST

          -  Patients with brainstem glioma or intrinsic pontine glioma do not need biopsy proof of
             the diagnosis, but must have documentation at their local institution that there is
             agreement among the attending oncologist and/or neuro-oncologist, radiologist, and
             neurosurgeon/pediatric neurosurgeon that the diagnostic imaging studies are consistent
             with a diagnosis of brainstem or intrinsic pontine glioma

          -  Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior
             chemotherapy, immunotherapy, surgery or radiotherapy prior to entering this study

          -  Performance Status: EGOG 0-2 for patients age 16 and older; Karnofsky &gt;40% for
             patients &gt;10 years of age; Lansky Play Scale &gt;40 for children &lt; 10 years of age

          -  Life expectancy greater than or equal to 12 weeks

          -  There is no limit to the number of prior treatment regimens provided that performance
             status, organ function, and life expectancy meet the study criteria

          -  No persistent toxicities from previous therapies &gt; Grade 2 by NCI CTCAE version 3. For
             patients with CNS tumors ONLY, if baseline neurotoxicity due to primary tumor
             involvement or post-operative complications, Grade 3 neurotoxicity is allowed if
             stable

          -  Normal organ and marrow function

          -  For females of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test must be documented
             prior to enrollment

          -  Patients who enter this study and their sexual partners who are of childbearing
             potential must agree to use an effective form of contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within three (3) weeks (or six
             weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study, or those who have
             not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier

          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents or using any investigational
             devices

          -  Patients with leukemia

          -  Patients who have previously received deforolimus or other rapamycin analogs

          -  History of allergic reactions (in opinion of the investigator) attributed to compounds
             of similar chemical or biologic composition to deforolimus and its excipients used in
             administration

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects of deforolimus are not known at this time

          -  Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, known HIV-positive patients are excluded
             from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with deforolimus

          -  Autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant &lt;3 months prior to enrollment; any
             evidence of on-going graft versus host disease (GVHD), or GVHD requiring

             must be discussed with and approved by the principal investigator prior to
             registration
