    <textblock>
      Liver disease in the morbidly obese is thought to occur due to the long-term presence of fat
      deposits in the liver, resulting in inflammation and scarring of the liver over time, which
      reduces liver function. However, many of these patients are unaware that their liver is
      damaged. There is currently no consensus regarding what the long-term effects of gastric
      bypass surgery are on pre-existing liver disease in morbidly obese patients. This study will
      determine the long-term effects on the liver after this type of surgical procedure.

      Before or on the day of surgery liver function will be determined using the DDG-2001
      Analyzer. This monitor is able to detect the concentration of a dye called indocyanine green
      dye (ICG) when present in the blood stream. A dose of 0.5 mg/kg of ICG will be injected into
      an IV in the arm. Over approximately fifteen minutes the DDG-2001 Analyzer will determine how
      quickly the liver removes the dye ICG from the blood stream. This value represents how well
      the liver is functioning. Blood samples are drawn before injection of ICG to measure liver
      function using standard liver function tests.

      This same routine for injecting ICG and obtaining blood for routine liver function tests will
      happen one more time, after surgery, once the subject has lost a significant amount of the
      original weight (60% of excess weight). This amount of weight loss typically occurs between
      12 to 18 months after gastric bypass surgery. This second ICG measurement will occur during
      an outpatient follow-up visit to CCF.

      A biopsy will be taken from the liver during surgery. A second biopsy taken after the 60%
      weight loss will be compared to determine the effect of this surgery on the liver.

    <description>To compare the non-invasive measurement of ICG clearance and biochemical testing on diagnostic accuracy (including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and positive and negative predictive value) of detecting histological liver disease both before and after LGBS. Of particular interest is determining whether non-invasive measurement of ICG clearance is sufficiently sensitive to detect occult liver dysfunction in morbidly obese patients in whom no specific clinical or biochemical evidence of liver dysfunction exists.</description>
