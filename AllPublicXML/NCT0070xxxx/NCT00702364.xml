  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atomoxetine is the only medication that is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults. It has gained recent interest as an
      alternative medication for treating attentional problems related to traumatic brain injury
      (TBI), but it's effectiveness in this population has not been studied. There are a number of
      advantages of Atomoxetine over traditional neuro-stimulant medications currently used for
      attentional disorders after traumatic brain injury. This study will use a randomized
      double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design to investigate the efficacy of atomoxetine
      to improve attention, behavioral function, and depression in adults with TBI

    <measure>CDR Power of Attention</measure>
    <time_frame>Post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) Computerized Cognitive Assessment System [19] is comprised of a battery of computer-controlled tasks administered on a laptop computer with parallel forms of the tests being presented on each testing session. The Power of Attention factor of the CDR was selected as the primary outcome measure because of its strong psychometric properties in other drug studies with cognitively compromised populations.
Instead of utilizing a t-test to compare treatment and control groups, treatment and control groups for both primary and secondary outcomes were compared utilizing an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model in which repeat baseline measures taken on each respective outcome served as a covariate. This method controls for any differences that may exist between the groups at baseline. Model assumptions for conducting an ANCOVA were investigated for all primary and secondary analyses, where no violations of model assumptions were detected. Additionally,</description>

    <measure>Stroop Test Interference T-score</measure>
    <time_frame>Post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroop Color and Word Test is frequently used to study deficits of attention and executive function in individuals with TBI, and has adequate test-retest reliability. At each administration, the following scores were obtained, Word Reading, Colour Naming and Interference. Raw scores were converted to demographically-adjusted T-scores using Golden and Freshwater norm.</description>

    <measure>Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Self-Report Scale Summary Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1) is a self-report questionnaire that consists of questions involving the 18-items of the The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV- Text Revision (TR) criteria for ADHD that rate symptoms on a Likert scale ranging from 0-4 based on the frequency of symptoms (&quot;never&quot;, &quot;rarely&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot;, &quot;often&quot;, and &quot;very often&quot;). A previous study of the ASRS found the self-report to be both valid (Cronbach's alpha =.88) and reliable (ICC=.84). Scores on the 18 items were summed for a total ASRS score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurobehavioral Functioning Inventory Depression Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Neurobehavioral Functioning Inventory (NFI) was developed as a clinical and research tool to quantify a variety of post-injury behaviours and symptoms characteristic of neurologic disability and encountered in daily life. The inventory is comprised of 76 items organized into six analytically derived factor scales: Depression, Somatic, Memory/Attention, Communication, Aggression, and Motor. Respondents are asked to rate items as occurring &quot;never&quot;, &quot;rarely&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot;, &quot;often&quot;, or &quot;always&quot;. Using the standardized scoring procedures outlined in the NFI Manual, T-scores were calculated for the Depression sub-scale. Lower T-score indicates less depressive symptomotology.</description>

        <title>Stroop Test Interference T-score</title>
        <description>The Stroop Color and Word Test is frequently used to study deficits of attention and executive function in individuals with TBI, and has adequate test-retest reliability. At each administration, the following scores were obtained, Word Reading, Colour Naming and Interference. Raw scores were converted to demographically-adjusted T-scores using Golden and Freshwater norm.</description>

        <title>Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Self-Report Scale Summary Score</title>
        <description>The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1) is a self-report questionnaire that consists of questions involving the 18-items of the The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV- Text Revision (TR) criteria for ADHD that rate symptoms on a Likert scale ranging from 0-4 based on the frequency of symptoms (“never”, “rarely”, “sometimes”, “often”, and “very often”). A previous study of the ASRS found the self-report to be both valid (Cronbach’s alpha =.88) and reliable (ICC=.84). Scores on the 18 items were summed for a total ASRS score.</description>

        <title>Neurobehavioral Functioning Inventory Depression Subscale</title>
        <description>Neurobehavioral Functioning Inventory (NFI) was developed as a clinical and research tool to quantify a variety of post-injury behaviours and symptoms characteristic of neurologic disability and encountered in daily life. The inventory is comprised of 76 items organized into six analytically derived factor scales: Depression, Somatic, Memory/Attention, Communication, Aggression, and Motor. Respondents are asked to rate items as occurring &quot;never&quot;, &quot;rarely&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot;, &quot;often&quot;, or &quot;always&quot;. Using the standardized scoring procedures outlined in the NFI Manual, T-scores were calculated for the Depression sub-scale. Lower T-score indicates less depressive symptomotology.</description>
