  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients on this study have a type of lymph gland cancer called non-Hodgkin Lymphoma or
      chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. Their lymphoma or CLL has come back or has not gone away after
      treatment. Because there is no standard treatment for the cancer at this time or because the
      currently used treatments do not work fully in all cases, patients are being asked to
      volunteer to take part in a gene transfer research study using special immune cells.

      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect
      for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease:
      antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from
      infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special
      infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with
      viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with
      cancers. They have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.

      The antibody used in this study is called anti-CD19. This antibody sticks to lymphoma cells
      because of a substance on the outside of these cells called CD19. CD19 antibodies have been
      used to treat people with lymphoma and CLL. For this study, the anti-CD19 antibody has been
      changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now attached to T cells. When an
      antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These chimeric
      receptor-T cells seem to be able to kill tumors, but they don't last very long and so their
      chances of fighting the cancer are limited.

      Investigators found that T cells work better if they also attach a protein called CD28 to the
      T cells. This protein makes the T cells more active and survive longer.

      Also they found that T cells that are also trained to recognize the virus that causes
      infectious mononucleosis (called Epstein Barr Virus or EBV) can stay in the blood stream for
      many years.

      These CD19-CD28 chimeric receptor T cells and CD19 chimeric-EBV specific T cells are
      investigational products not approved by the FDA.

      The purpose of this study is to find the biggest dose of chimeric T cells that is safe to
      administer, to see how long each of the T cell populations (CD19-CD28 and CD19-EBV-specific)
      last, to assess what the side effects are, and to evaluate whether this therapy might help
      people with lymphoma or CLL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patient or their donor will give us blood to make CD19-CD28 chimeric receptor T cells and
      CD19 chimeric-EBV specific T cells in the laboratory. These cells are grown and frozen for
      the patient. Because the patient will have received cells with a new gene in them they will
      be followed for a total of 15 years to see if there are any long term side effects of gene
      transfer.

      The patient will be assigned a dose of CD19-CD28 chimeric receptor-T cells and CD19 chimeric
      receptor-EBV specific T cells. Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to
      be able to proliferate and accomplish their functions and that this may not happen if there
      are too many other T cells in circulation. Because of that, if the patient's level of
      circulating T cells is relatively high, they will receive one treatment of cyclophosphamide.
      This drug will decrease the numbers of the patient's own T cells before the infusion the CD19
      chimeric receptor T cells. Although it's not expected to have any effect on the tumor with
      the dose that the subject will receive, this drug is part of many regimens that are used to
      treat lymphoma or CLL. If the subject is already receiving chemotherapy, this may not be
      needed.

      The patient will be given an injection of cells into the vein through an IV line at the
      assigned dose. The patient will be followed in the clinic after the injection for up to 3
      hours. If after a 4-6 week evaluation period after the infusion, the patient seems to be
      experiencing a benefit (confirmed by radiological studies, physical exam and/or symptoms),
      they may be able to receive up to three additional doses of the T cells. These additional
      infusions would be at least 4-6 weeks apart and at the same dose level the patient received
      the first time.
