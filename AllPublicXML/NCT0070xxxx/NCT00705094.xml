  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For many years, researchers and doctors have studied different kinds of treatments to improve
      the survival of men with testicular cancer. However, recent research has shown that many
      years later, men who had testicular cancer appear to be at higher risk for developing heart
      disease (heart attack or heart failure), especially if they received chemotherapy. Since
      these studies were done many years after men received treatment, there was no way to know if
      other factors contributed to the health problems they experienced. This study is being done
      because it would be helpful to study heart function and cardiovascular disease risk factors
      of men who have been diagnosed with testicular cancer, before and after they receive
      chemotherapy treatment compared to men who receive treatment with surgery alone.

      The aim of this pilot study is to examine global and regional LV systolic and diastolic
      function, cardiac output, cardiac reserve, VO2peak and CVD risk profile in males recently
      diagnosed with testicular cancer treated with surgery alone or surgery and chemotherapy.
