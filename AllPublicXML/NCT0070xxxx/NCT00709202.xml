  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study attempts to evaluate a histamine analog long used for the treatment of Meniere's
      disease , betahistine, that,.shows promise in reversing the antihistaminergic effects thought
      to be involved in antipsychotic induced weight gain.

      The investigators hypotheses therefore are as follows:

        -  Youth who have gained a developmentally inappropriate amount of weight on SGAs will see
           their weight stabilize or even decrease with betahistine augmentation as compared to
           placebo augmentation.

        -  Betahistine augmentation in SGA treated youth will increase levels of satiety in a
           standardized meal situation and decrease caloric intake.as compared to placebo
           augmentation.

        -  Metabolic effects of betahistine augmentation in SGA treated youth will be reflected in
           a normalization of adipose distribution when compared to placebo augmentation, in
           particular with regards to the ratio of visceral to peripheral adipose tissue.

        -  Betahistine augmentation in this population will lead to a normalization in physiologic
           and lab values related to the development of metabolic syndrome as compared to placebo
           augmentation.

      Subjects for this study will be adolescents and young adults from age 12 to age 18. 40
      individuals ages 12-39 who have been psychiatrically stabilized on Cloz39ine, Olanzapine,
      Risperdal, or Seroquel, and have gained more than 2% of their weight in their first 6 weeks
      on these medications will be recruited to participate. Subjects will be excluded if they have
      asthma, peptic ulcer disease (diseases which may be exacerbated by a histamine analog) or are
      prescribed medications known to affect body composition or metabolism other than those
      currently being studied. Subjects will be randomized to receive either betahistine or placebo
      at a 1:1 ratio.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children and adolescents ages 12-18 with a diagnosis of Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective
             Disorder, Schizophreniform, Bipolar I, Bipolar II, Bipolar NOS or Psychotic Disorder
             NOS

          -  Patients will be currently treated with antipsychotics and will have a have a
             diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorders (including schizoaffective disorder),
             bipolar disorder, or autism spectrum disorder.

        Patients will qualify for entry if they meet the following weight criteria:

          1. The patient has gained 7% of their weight since beginning of treatment with one or
             more of the current antipsychotics.

          2. The patient has had an increase of 7% of their weight during the last year while being
             treated with antipsychotics.

          3. The patient has a BMI of 30 or more and has gained 10 lbs or more in the past 8 months
             while being treated with antipsychotic medications.

          4. The patient has a BMI of 35 or greater at the current time, and his chart shows a
             history of consistent weight gain over the past 1 to 3 years during treatment with
             antipsychotics.

             Exclusion Criteria:

               -  Subjects will be excluded if they have asthma, peptic ulcer disease (diseases
                  which may be exacerbated by a histamine analog), or history of pheochromocytoma
                  or peptic ulcer disease. Patients will be excluded if they are prescribed
                  medications known to affect body weight or glucose-lipid metabolism, such as
                  prescription or over the counter medications taken for the purpose of weight
                  reduction. Subjects who are currently treated with metformin, for less than a
                  year and have shown recent weight change on metformin. Patients on thyroid
                  replacement therapy or lipid-lowering agents whose dosage has changed by more
                  than 50 % in the past month will be excluded. If they are relatively stable doses
                  of these medications they will not be excluded. Patients who are on lipid
                  lowering medication, thyroid replacement medication, or diabetes medication,
                  (excluding metformin), must remain on these medications throughout the period of
                  the study. Females who are pregnant or breast feeding will be excluded.
