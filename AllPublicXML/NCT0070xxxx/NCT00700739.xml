    <textblock>
      The protocol underwent 3 amendments, the last of which (02APR2009) changed the study design
      from a randomized to a non-randomized and non-comparative clinical trial. All of the subjects
      were enrolled under the randomized design with the exception of the last subject. This study
      is not applicable per FDAA Title VIII, Section 801 due to the final trial design. However,
      results are submitted to clinicaltrials.gov due to the majority of study data being collected
      under a randomized (FDAA Title VIII, Section 801 applicable) trial design

    <measure>Overall Patient Success</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall success was a composite endpoint determined by the following clinical outcome measures: 1. Neck Disability Index â‰¥ 15-point improvement from baseline to 12 months post-operative, 2. No new clinically significant permanent abnormalities in neurological function (i.e. motor strength, nerve root tension signs, sensory and reflex signs) from baseline to 12 months post-operative, 3. No subsequent secondary surgical interventions (SSI) at the index level, and 4. No device-related serious events (dSAE) from intra-operative through 12-months post-operative. Please note that these time periods were intended to be from baseline to 24 months post-operative, but since the study was terminated early the 12 month time periods were utilized.</description>

        <title>Overall Patient Success</title>
        <description>Overall success was a composite endpoint determined by the following clinical outcome measures: 1. Neck Disability Index â‰¥ 15-point improvement from baseline to 12 months post-operative, 2. No new clinically significant permanent abnormalities in neurological function (i.e. motor strength, nerve root tension signs, sensory and reflex signs) from baseline to 12 months post-operative, 3. No subsequent secondary surgical interventions (SSI) at the index level, and 4. No device-related serious events (dSAE) from intra-operative through 12-months post-operative. Please note that these time periods were intended to be from baseline to 24 months post-operative, but since the study was terminated early the 12 month time periods were utilized.</description>
        <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
        <population>Overall Patient Success is composed of several outcome measures, some of which require a valid pre-operative and 12-month post-operative score. Due to withdrawals and incomplete or unavailable assessments, 18 subjects in the CTDR and 11 subjects in the ACDF treatment groups were available for the Overall Patient Success calculation.</population>

        <title>Maintenance of Disc Height Measured Radiographically at 6 Months</title>
        <description>Maintenance of disc height is measured at the index and adjacent levels to determine the effect of the treatment on restoration or maintenance of the disc height. Initial post-operative disc height is compared with subsequent post-operative visits (i.e. 6 months) to evaluate the maintenance of disc height. The height is measured in millimeters (mm).</description>

        <population>Only 2 subjects in the cTDR and 1 subject in the ACDF treatment groups were available for this outcome measure. There were 2 ACDF subjects at this endpoint, however one subject was missing the flexion extension rotation radiographic view therefore could not be included in the analysis.</population>
