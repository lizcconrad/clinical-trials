      To begin to refine development of the RSQ (Restorative Sleep Questionnaire) measure in
      subjects with NRS (Nonrestorative Sleep) by generating item content pertaining to morning
      refreshment and uncovering problems in instrument administration in subjects with
      nonrestorative sleep

      Study was terminated on January 20, 2009 due to portfolio decision by Pfizer to discontinue
      further investigation of PD200390 for non-restorative sleep. The decision was not based on
      any safety concerns.
