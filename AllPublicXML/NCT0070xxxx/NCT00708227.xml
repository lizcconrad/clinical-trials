  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will help to find out if having a certain genetic makeup influences how a person
      with asthma responds to salmeterol, one of the two drugs in Advair(R).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are being asked to take part in this research study because they have asthma. This
      clinical research study is being done to see if an asthmatic's gene make-up (DNA is made up
      of genes) affects the way they respond to a particular asthma medication called salmeterol.
      Certain genes make people tall or short. Certain genes give people brown or black hair.
      Similarly, certain genes may be associated with the way patients respond to asthma
      medications.

      Salmeterol xinafoate (a long acting bronchodilator) and fluticasone propionate (an inhaled
      corticosteroid) are the medicines contained in Advair Diskus. During this study, patients
      with asthma will receive fluticasone inhaler (called Flovent) and Advair Diskus. The
      investigators want to find out if patients with asthma with certain genes respond in
      different ways to the salmeterol in Advair Diskus. The investigators also want to find out if
      patients with asthma with certain genes who are treated with salmeterol for two weeks have
      their airways open up less than usual when they use albuterol.

      The purpose of the epigenetic substudy is to collecting blood is for exploratory research
      into epigenetic effects of salmeterol therapy. Blood was collected at Visit 2 and Visit 3.

      Steps:

        -  Obtain informed consent

        -  Label vacutainer tube with patient's study ID number, visit number, date of collection
           (use a sharpee pen)

        -  Collect 10mL blood sample into purple top tube before starting methacholine challenge
           (must be done before any albuterol is given at the visit)

        -  Immediately place tube in crushed ice or in refrigerator

        -  Spin tube; freeze tube with cells for future genotyping/methylation studies; divide
           plasma as equally as possible between the 3 cryotubes, freeze the EDTA tube and 3
           cryotubes.

          <description>The area under the curve (AUC) bronchodilator response after Visit 4 methacholine challenge. 2.5mg of albuterol was administered at the time of maximal brochoconstriction once the methacholine PC20 was reached and the change in FEV1 was measured over the next 60 minutes post albuterol administration (bronchodilator response). FEV1 was measured at the following times: 0 (immediately upon completion of nebulization) and at 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, and 60 minutes. Participants had discontinued Advair for 36 hours.</description>
