      The purpose of this study is to define the schedule and dose of oral vinorelbine (Navelbine)
      to be used with erlotinib in non-small cell lung cancer.

    <textblock>
      Additive or supraadditive activity of an EGFR TK-I with vinorelbine has been demonstrated
      in-vitro. Clinical synergism has also been described between gefitinib and vinorelbine in
      NSCLC. The use of cytotoxics in a metronomic schedule has not been well investigated in the
      clinical setting despite emerging pre-clinical data. Using an established oral cytotoxic such
      as oral vinorelbine in a metronomic dose-schedule is attractive due to the oral route of
      administration. Preclinical studies have shown that by using cytotoxics in a low-dose
      protracted manner, endothelial cells are preferentially affected via inhibition of
      proliferation and induction of apoptosis. In addition to this anti-angiogenic mechanism, an
      anti-vasculogenic process may also be involved that acts by reducing circulating endothelial
      progenitor mobilization and viability. Moreover, it has also been shown that tumours that
      were selected for high levels of acquired resistance to cytotoxics can be induced to respond
      by using metronomic doses of chemotherapy.

      Continuous administration of metronomic oral vinorelbine, given three times a week, has been
      reported as feasible and well tolerated at doses up to 180 mg total dose per week. Early
      results showed activity against refractory solid tumors such as renal cancer, NSCLC, ovarian
      cancer, prostate cancer, unknown primary and Kaposi sarcoma.

      This phase I study combines erlotinib and oral vinorelbine on two different schedules. The
      conventional schedule vinorelbine (CSV) aims to determine the MTD of conventional schedule of
      oral vinorelbine given on days 1 and 8 every 21 days plus daily erlotinib and the metronomic
      schedule vinorelbine (MSV) aims to determine the optimal metronomic dose of vinorelbine given
      3 times a week plus daily erlotinib.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC

          -  At least one or two prior lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease or locally
             advanced unresectable disease. There should be at least 4 weeks since prior
             chemotherapy or radiation therapy or 6 weeks if the last regimen included BCNU or
             mitomycin C

          -  Age &gt; 21 years.

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%, see Appendix A).

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  leukocytes &gt;3,000/mcL

               -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mcL

               -  platelets &gt;100,000/mcL

               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;2.5 X institutional ULN

               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR

               -  creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2

          -  The effects of Oral Vinorelbine on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
             reason and because vinca alkaloids as well as other therapeutic agents used in this
             trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients who have received previous vinorelbine or oral EGFR tyrosine kinase
             inhibitors

          -  Patients with progressive brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.
             However patients are eligible if they have brain metastases that have been treated
             with whole brain radiotherapy and are stable and not on corticosteroids.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to Oral Vinorelbine or other agents used in study.

          -  Prior and / or concomitant treatment with drugs known to induce or inhibit cytochrome
             P450 3A4, CYP1A1 &amp; CYP1A2 : phenytoin, carbamazepine, barbiturates, rifampicin,
             imidazole antifungals (such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole,
             metronidazole), omeprazole and ritonavir

          -  Significant malabsorption syndrome or disease affecting the gastro-intestinal tract
             function

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding or women of child-bearing potential not using effective
             contraception,

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with Oral Vinorelbine. In addition,
             these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  History of organ allograft

          -  Patients with evidence or history of bleeding diatheses or coagulopathy

          -  Serious, non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture

          -  Because of interaction risk on CYP3A4, patients with concomitant treatments with
             vitamin K antagonists such as phenprocoumon or warfarin or heparin or heparinoids
             should be excluded
