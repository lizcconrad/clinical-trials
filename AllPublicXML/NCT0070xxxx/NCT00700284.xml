    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of using a vaginal ring
      to deliver the candidate microbicide TMC120 (dapivirine). Twelve women initially underwent
      7-day exposure to a placebo ring containing no investigational agent. They then underwent
      7-day exposure to a ring containing 120 mg of TMC120 (dapivirine). Feasibility was assessed
      in terms of safety and tolerability as well as drug delivery.
