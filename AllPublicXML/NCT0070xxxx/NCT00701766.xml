  <brief_title>BI 2536 Infusional Treatment in Patients Over 60 Years of Age With Refractory or Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukaemia</brief_title>
  <official_title>An Open, Randomised Clinical Phase I/IIa Trial to Investigate the Maximum Tolerated Dose, Efficacy, Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Repeated Three-week Courses of a Single Dose i.v. BI 2536 on Day 1 in Comparison to Single Doses i.v. BI 2536 on Days 1, 2 and 3 in Patients Over 60 Years of Age With Refractory or Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukaemia</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present trial will be performed to determine the MTD and to evaluate the efficacy of BI
      2536 in the treatment of elderly patients with relapsed or refractory AML. Different
      schedules will be compared to identify the better dosing schedule for the further development
      programme of BI 2536. Dose escalation starting with the maximum tolerated dose previously
      determined in patients with advanced solid cancers will be performed to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose for AML patients.
