  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of XL765 in combination
      with Temozolomide in adults with anaplastic gliomas or glioblastoma on a stable Temozolomide
      maintenance dose. XL765 is a new chemical entity that inhibits the kinases PI3K and mTOR. In
      preclinical studies, inactivation of PI3K has been shown to inhibit growth and induce
      apoptosis (programmed cell death) in tumor cells, whereas inactivation of mTOR has been shown
      to inhibit the growth of tumor cells. Temozolomide (TMZ, Temodar®) is an orally administered
      alkylating agent with activity against malignant gliomas. It is approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration for the following indications: 1) treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma
      multiforme (GBM) patients when given concomitantly with radiotherapy and then as maintenance
      treatment; 2) refractory anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), ie, patients who have experienced
      disease progression on a drug regimen containing nitrosourea and procarbazine. Temozolomide
      is commonly used in the treatment of other anaplastic gliomas (AG) including oligodendroglial
      tumors and mixed gliomas.
