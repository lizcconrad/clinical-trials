  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to show non-inferiority of an echinacea/sage spray compared to a
      chlorhexidine/lidocaine-spray in the treatment of acute sore throat during five days of
      treatment.

      Main outcome parameter is the non-inferiority in number of responders between the two
      treatment groups. A responder is defined as a reduction by 50% of the total baseline score
      taken prior to treatment start. The symptoms are assessed with a symptom score.

      Further secondary parameters are :

      Responders during at day 4 and 5, single symptom scores during 1 to 5 days of observation,
      pain at begin and end (100mm VAS), assessment of efficacy by physician and patient,
      consumption of rescue medication

      Assessment of safety by physician and patient, frequency of adverse events

patients received additionally a placebo-spray for the synthetical comparator (chlorhexidine/lidocaine) as the study was double dummy blinded.
Patients had to apply spray every 2 hours with two puffs to the pharyngeal area up to a maximum of 10 times daily. Treatment duration was until illness was resolved or for a maximum of 5 consecutive days.
