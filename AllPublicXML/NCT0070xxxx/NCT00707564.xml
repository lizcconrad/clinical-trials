      The purpose of this study is to determine if the HemCon Dental Dressing is effective in
      stopping bleeding during dental surgeries in patients taking anticoagulant medications.

      As the HemConÂ® Dental Dressing has been FDA cleared for use as a physical barrier for
      temporary protection of oral mucosal tissue and to provide pain relief, the proposed study
      will further investigate the safety and efficacy of hemostasis of the dressing for use in
      dental surgical procedures that do not require primary closure (suturing) such as tooth
      extractions. This protocol will specifically research the safety and efficacy of hemostasis
      within a population of subjects taking anticoagulant medications.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are currently taking oral anticoagulant medications and eligible for
             surgery following standards of care

          -  Patients requiring a minimum of 2 tooth extraction procedures.

          -  Index pairing must reflect anatomically similar extraction locations

          -  14 years of age or older

          -  Available for a minimum of one post operative evaluation approximately 7 days post
             surgery

          -  Extraction sites do not require primary closure or suturing

          -  Willingness and ability to provide informed consent/ assent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Scheduled to undergo a procedure other than tooth extractions

          -  In the Investigators opinion, dental surgery may pose a serious risk of uncontrollable
             bleeding due to anticoagulant use

          -  Scheduled to undergo 2 extractions, anatomically dissimilar

          -  Extraction procedures are expected to require primary closure or suture

          -  Unwilling or unable to provide informed consent/ assent

          -  Patients undergoing bisphosphonate therapy

          -  Patients not under current treatment with an oral anticoagulant medication

          -  Patients who have discontinued the use of anticoagulant medications for a minimum of 3
             days prior to the planned surgical visit
