  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 12-month study will investigate a cognitive training augmentation of supported employment
      to improve cognitive performance and work outcomes, which are expected to result in improved
      quality of life and community integration for veterans with mild to moderate traumatic brain
      injuries. The primary hypothesis is that compared to veterans who receive enhanced supported
      employment, those who receive supported employment plus cognitive training will work more
      weeks during the 12 months.
