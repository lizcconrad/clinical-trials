      The purpose of this study is to determine the Safety, Tolerability &amp; Immunogenicity of CSL
      Limited's Influenza Virus Vaccine in a two dose primary vaccination series, with a 12-month
      booster vaccination, in a paediatric population equal to or greater than 6 months to less
      than 9 years old.
