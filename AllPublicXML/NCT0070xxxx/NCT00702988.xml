      The objective of this trial was to evaluate whether Org 36286 treatment for the induction of
      multifollicular growth in women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) for in vitro
      fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI) is safe for pregnant
      subjects and their offspring.
