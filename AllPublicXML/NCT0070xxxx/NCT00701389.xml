  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to understand the effects of migraine treatments on blood pressure in participants with
      migraine. The primary hypothesis is that the effect on semi-recumbent mean arterial pressure
      following the coadministration of telcagepant and sumatriptan is similar to that following
      administration of sumatriptan alone. That is, the true mean treatment difference (sumatriptan
      with telcagepant sumatriptan alone) in time-weighted mean arterial pressure for 2.5 hours
      following dosing is less than 5 mmHg.

    <measure>Time-weighted Mean Arterial Pressure (Sumatriptan With Telcagepant Versus Sumatriptan Alone)</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose up to 150 minutes postdose of each treatment period (up to 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>In each treatment period (1 through 4), duplicate readings of semi-recumbent blood pressure (BP) were completed using an automated blood pressure machine at predose, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 360 minutes postdose. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated as follows: MAP = Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) + (0.33 * Pulse Pressure [PP]) where PP = Systolic Blood Pressure [SBP] minus DBP. Only mean arterial pressure measurements up to and including 150 minutes postdose (including the predose measurement) were used to calculate the time-weighted averages. Time-weighted averages for each participant were obtained by calculating the area under the measurement-time curve of mean arterial pressure divided by the time period over which measurements were made (i.e. 150 minutes).</description>

    <time_frame>up to 14 days after last dose of study drug (up to 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were assessed throughout the study for adverse events. An adverse event was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which was temporally associated with the use of the product, was also an adverse event.</description>

        <title>Time-weighted Mean Arterial Pressure (Sumatriptan With Telcagepant Versus Sumatriptan Alone)</title>
        <description>In each treatment period (1 through 4), duplicate readings of semi-recumbent blood pressure (BP) were completed using an automated blood pressure machine at predose, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 360 minutes postdose. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated as follows: MAP = Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) + (0.33 * Pulse Pressure [PP]) where PP = Systolic Blood Pressure [SBP] minus DBP. Only mean arterial pressure measurements up to and including 150 minutes postdose (including the predose measurement) were used to calculate the time-weighted averages. Time-weighted averages for each participant were obtained by calculating the area under the measurement-time curve of mean arterial pressure divided by the time period over which measurements were made (i.e. 150 minutes).</description>

          <description>Participants were assessed throughout the study for adverse events. An adverse event was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which was temporally associated with the use of the product, was also an adverse event. The number of participants who were discontinued from the study due to adverse event was summarized.</description>
          <population>All Patients as Treated defined as all participants who received at least one dose of the investigational drug. Adverse events were reported by study drug taken at the time of the event and not by randomly assigned sequence.</population>
