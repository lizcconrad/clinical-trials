  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin ulcers can be defined as open injuries, loss of substances with the skin or mucous
      tissue, caused by disintegration and tissue necrosis. Chronic skin ulcer is any injury that
      heal in a period not less than 6 weeks. Several etiological causes for the emergence of skin
      ulcers. Around 73% are venous, arterial are 8%, 3% are diabetic, 2% are traumatic and 14% are
      from other causes.

      Clinical studies show that collagenase is an effective drug and presents high tolerabildade
      in the treatment of ulcerative burns and injuries of various etiologies. Evidence show
      statistically significant reduction of inflammation, the formation of granulation tissue,
      decrease in injuries and reepitelization.
