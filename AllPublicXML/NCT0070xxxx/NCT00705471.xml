  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-centre retrospective review of fistulizing Crohn's disease (CD) patient charts will
      capture data to measure health care resource utilization associated with the use of
      Infliximab for treatment of CD. Three health science centres/hospitals from Ontario are
      targeted to participate in the study, each site is expected to provide 30-40 patient charts
      with a target of 108 charts total.
