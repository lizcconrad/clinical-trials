    <textblock>
      This single arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of erlotinib + gemcitabine in
      chemotherapy-naive participants with unresectable, advanced and/or metastatic non-small cell
      lung cancer. Participants will receive erlotinib 150 mg orally (po) daily, in combination
      with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m^2 intravenously (iv) weekly for 3 weeks of each 4 week cycle. The
      anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, and the target sample size
      is &lt;100 individuals.
