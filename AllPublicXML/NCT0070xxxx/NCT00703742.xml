      The purpose of this study is:

        1. to find out the structural or functional effects of selective serotonin reuptake
           inhibitors (SSRI) in major depressive disorder (MDD);

        2. find special abnormalities in depression secondary to other disease, e.g., autoimmune
           disease like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

        3. find the relationship between the efficacy of antidepressant and the change of
           neuroimaging in MDD

        4. to find possible predispose to MDD

        5. to explore the DNA methylation status in depression;

      1. to explore the pathology of depression

        2. to identify the difference between MDD and depression secondary to other disease
           ,especially autoimmune disease

        3. to explore the effect of gene-environment interaction on the epigenetic regulation of
           the depression
