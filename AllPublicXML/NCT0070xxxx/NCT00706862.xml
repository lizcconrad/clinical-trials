      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the combination of talactoferrin,
      carboplatin and paclitaxel improves progression free survival and overall survival in
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer compared to the combination of paclitaxel and
      carboplatin alone

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that is
             unresectable

          -  At least 1 unirradiated target lesion measurable by RECIST

          -  Able to understand and sign an Informed Consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of brain metastases, unless the patient received brain irradiation, including
             adequate stereotactic radiosurgery, at least 4 weeks prior to randomization, and is
             stable, asymptomatic, and off steroids for at least 3 weeks prior to randomization

          -  Received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy for NSCLC

          -  History of allergic reactions to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition
             to talactoferrin or the chemotherapy drugs

          -  Any gastrointestinal tract disease or other medical condition resulting in the
             inability to take oral medications

          -  History of other malignancies except: (i) adequately treated basal or squamous cell

             previous radiotherapy at the indicator sites (the sites that are to be followed for
             determination of a response)

          -  Concurrent systemic corticosteroid therapy within 4 weeks prior to randomization,
             except prophylactic use of steroids prior to paclitaxel administration
