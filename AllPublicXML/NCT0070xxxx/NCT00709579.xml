      Methodology :Phase III study, single centre, double blind, versus excipient, randomised,
      controlateral design.

      Selection of the patients :Number of subjects required 60 :

        -  30 patients needing an oral corticotherapy

        -  30 patients needing a topical corticotherapy
    </textblock>

      Study conduct

      Two steps for each patient:

        1. the first step lasting 3 months : assessment of changes in mechanisms involved in ACIC
           with the RV3391A cream (M0 à M3). At the beginning of the corticotherapy, each patient
           will apply RV3391A on anterior side of a forearm and the placebo on the other side
           (randomised) for 3 months.

           Clinical exam and objective measurements will be realised.

           This step will allow us to describe and compare the evolution of cutaneous atrophy's
           markers produced by glucocorticoïds markers between M0 and M3:

             -  between topical and oral corticotherapy

             -  between RV3391A and the placebo.

        2. the second step, the cohort follow-up, leading off the end of the first step (M3 à M24)
           The period of the second step will depend on the progression of patient's disease and on
           the period of his medical follow-up. This period may lasting until the 24th month after
           the inclusion in the study.

      The patients will not apply RV3391A and the placebo anymore. They will be followed-up in the
      CHU.Assessments of the cutaneous atrophy's markers produced by glucocorticoïds will be
      realised at M6, M12, M18 and M24 with non invasive methods (clinical scoring, imaging,
      extensometry) to exactly describe on a long-term period the evolution of the ACIC. The
      assessments on forearm having received the placebo will allow us to know natural history of
      skin atrophy induced by corticotherapy.
