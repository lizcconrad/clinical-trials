  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, multi-center, Phase II study to determine the activity of
      nab-paclitaxel plus lapatinib in the first and second-line setting in women with ErbB2
      overexpressing metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Sixty subjects will be enrolled in the study.
      Subjects will receive nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m2 intravenously once weekly for 3 weeks,
      followed by a rest week in a 4-week cycle) plus lapatinib (1000 mg once daily). Subjects will
      receive treatment until disease progression or withdrawal from the study. The primary
      objective of this study is to evaluate overall tumor response rate of lapatinib in
      combination with nab-paclitaxel administered in women with ErbB2 overexpressing MBC who have
      received no chemotherapeutic regimen in the metastatic setting. Secondary objectives include
      progression-free survival, overall survival, duration of response, time to response and time
      to progression and safety. Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed at 8 and 12 week
      intervals, and at the end of treatment.

    <description>OR was defined as the percentage of participants experiencing either a confirmed complete response (CR) or a confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.0. CR is defined as the disappearance of all lesions (target and/or non-target).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following
        criteria apply:

          -  Subjects must have histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer with Stage IV
             disease at primary diagnosis or at relapse after curative-intent surgery. Where the
             disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, the neoplastic nature of the lesion should
             be confirmed by cytology or histology.

          -  Documented amplification of ErbB2 3+ by immunohistochemistry or a positive score
             (&gt;2.2) by FISH using a local laboratory result (which will be considered sufficient in
             this study with no further verification by a central laboratory).

          -  Subjects must have received no more than one prior chemotherapeutic regimen in the
             metastatic setting.

          -  If a taxane had been administered in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting,
             progression must have occurred ≥12 months after completion of this treatment.

          -  Prior therapy with radiation for this breast cancer population is permitted if it was
             administered in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant non metastatic setting. Radiotherapy given
             in the metastatic setting, prior to initiation of study medication, is allowed to a
             limited area (e.g., palliative therapy and involving less than 25% of bone marrow), if
             it is not the sole site of disease. Subjects must have completed radiation treatment
             and recovered from all acute radiation treatment related toxicities (e.g., bone marrow
             suppression) prior to commencement of combination treatment.

          -  The subject must have received all prior chemotherapy treatment at least 4 weeks prior
             to enrollment in this study and must have recovered from all related toxicities.
             Subjects who have received weekly dose of prior chemotherapy e.g. gemcitabine or
             capecitabine may enroll 2 to 3 weeks after cessation of treatment provided that they
             have recovered from all related toxicities.

          -  Prior therapy with trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting is
             permitted. The subject must have received all prior trastuzumab treatment at least 4
             weeks prior to enrollment in this study and must have recovered from all related
             toxicities.

          -  Prior endocrine therapy is permitted in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant or metastatic
             setting. The subject must have received all prior endocrine treatment at least 1 week
             prior to enrollment in this study and must have recovered from all related toxicities.

          -  Prior diagnosis of cancer is allowed as long as the subject is free of disease for 5
             years. Subjects with completely resected basal or squamous cell skin cancer, thyroid
             cancer or successfully treated cervical carcinoma in-situ will be allowed if it has
             been 1 year or greater since definitive surgery.

          -  Subjects must have measurable disease, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines; defined as at least 1 lesion that can be accurately
             measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter [LD] to be recorded) by mammogram,
             ultrasound or physical exam [Therasse, 2000].

             impairment of oviductal or uterine function that would cause sterility). This category
             includes women with oligomenorrhoea (severe), women who are perimenopausal and young
             women who have begun to menstruate. These subjects must provide a negative serum
             pregnancy test at Screening and agree to 1 of the following:

             safety.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females at any time during the study (due to the potential

             or subjects with completely resected basal or squamous cell skin cancer, thyroid
             cancer or successfully treated cervical carcinoma in situ will be eligible if it has
             been at least 1 year since definitive surgery.

          -  or rendering of informed consent.

      <pre_assignment_details>A safety cohort was designed into the study to include the first 10 participants enrolled. Enrollment was halted after the enrollment of the tenth participant to allow for this safety review. Enrollment was resumed after the review and protocol amendment.</pre_assignment_details>
