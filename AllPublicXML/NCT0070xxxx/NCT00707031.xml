  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the benefits and risks of lixisenatide (AVE0010) in
      comparison to exenatide (Byetta®), as an add-on treatment to metformin, over a period of 24
      weeks of treatment, followed by an extension.

      The primary objective is to assess the effects of lixisenatide in comparison to exenatide
      (Byetta®), as an add-on treatment to metformin, on glycemic control in terms of glycosylated
      hemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction (absolute change) at Week 24.

      The secondary objectives are to assess the effects of lixisenatide on percentage of patients
      reaching HbA1c less than 7 percent (%) or HbA1c less than or equal to (&lt;=) 6.5%, fasting
      plasma glucose (FPG), body weight; to evaluate safety, tolerability and to assess the impact
      of gastrointestinal tolerance on quality of life (QoL) (patient assessment of upper
      gastrointestinal disorders - quality of life [PAGI-QOL]).

      Patients who complete the 24-week main open-label treatment would undergo a variable
      open-label extension treatment, which ends for all patients at approximately the scheduled
      date of Week 76 visit (Visit 24) for the last randomized patient.

    <measure>Absolute Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Absolute Change = HbA1c value at Week 24 minus HbA1c value at baseline. The on-treatment period for this efficacy variable is time from the first dose of study drug and up to 3 days after the last dose of study drug, on or before Visit 11 (Week 24) or Day 169 if Visit 11 is not available, and before the introduction of rescue therapy. For a patient to be included in mITT population, both baseline and at least 1 post baseline assessment for at least 1 efficacy variable, were required.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Routine fasting self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) and central laboratory FPG (and HbA1c after week 12) values were used to determine the requirement of rescue medication. If fasting SMPG value exceeded the specified limit for 3 consecutive days, the central laboratory FPG (and HbA1c after week 12) were performed. Threshold values - from baseline to Week 8: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;270 milligram/deciliter (mg/dL) (15.0 mmol/L), from Week 8 to Week 12: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L), and from Week 12 to Week 24: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or HbA1c &gt; 8.5%.

    <time_frame>First dose of study drug up to 3 days after the last dose administration, for up to 116 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Symptomatic hypoglycemia was an event with clinical symptoms that were considered to result from a hypoglycemic episode with an accompanying plasma glucose less than 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L) or associated with prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration if no plasma glucose measurement was available. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was an event with clinical symptoms that were considered to result from hypoglycemia in which the patient required the assistance of another person and was associated with either a plasma glucose level below 36 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration, if no plasma glucose measurement was available.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life: Change From Baseline in Patient's Satisfaction to Treatment (PAGI-QOL) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>PAGI-QOL: a 30-item self-administered questionnaire to measure health related QOL of patients with upper gastrointestinal disorders during past 2 weeks. Consists of 5 sub-scales. Each item rated on a 0-5 point Likert scale (0 [none of the time] to 5 [all the time]). Sub-scale score calculated by dividing sum of all items of subscale by number of items in the sub-scale. Total score calculated by taking mean of sub-scale scores. Sub-scale score and total score ranges from 0=none of the time (lowest score) to 5=all of the time (highest score) with lower scores indicating better QOL. The on-treatment period for this variable is time from the first dose of study drug and up to 3 days after the last dose of study drug, on or before Visit 11 (Week 24) or Day 169 if Visit 11 is not available, and before the introduction of rescue therapy. For a patient to be included in mITT population, both baseline and at least 1 post baseline assessment for at least 1 efficacy variable, were required.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 122 centers in 18 countries between June 23, 2008 and November 18, 2010. The overall duration of treatment was at least 76 weeks (24 weeks main open-label treatment; variable open-label extension treatment).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 1243 patients were screened of which 604 were screen failures; main reason for screen failure was glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values being out of the defined protocol range (greater than or equal to 7% and less than or equal to 10%). A total of 639 patients were randomized.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Disorders-Quality of Life (PAGI-QOL) Total Score</title>
          <description>A 30-item self-administered questionnaire to measure health related quality of life (QOL) of patients with upper gastrointestinal disorders during past 2 weeks; consisted of 5 dimensions (subscales). Each item rated on a 0-5 point Likert scale, where 0=none of the time and 5=all the time. Subscale score was calculated by dividing sum of all items of subscale by number of items in subscale. Total score was calculated by taking the mean of subscale scores. Subscale score and total score range from 0 to 5 with lower scores indicating better quality of life.</description>

Total score calculated by taking mean of sub-scale scores. Sub-scale score and total score ranges from 0=none of the time (lowest score) to 5=all of the time (highest score) with lower scores indicating better QOL.
