    <measure>Change in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (msSBP) From Baseline to End of Study (Week 12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>At the first visit, blood pressure (BP) was measured in both arms and the arm having the higher BP reading was the arm used for all subsequent readings throughout the study. Patients were required to sit for five minutes with feet flat on the floor, with arm resting so that the bottom of the cuff was at the same level as the heart. BP was measured three times at 1 to 2-minute intervals at each visit using the correct cuff size. The mean BP was calculated from the 3 readings.</description>

        <title>Change in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (msSBP) From Baseline to End of Study (Week 12)</title>
        <description>At the first visit, blood pressure (BP) was measured in both arms and the arm having the higher BP reading was the arm used for all subsequent readings throughout the study. Patients were required to sit for five minutes with feet flat on the floor, with arm resting so that the bottom of the cuff was at the same level as the heart. BP was measured three times at 1 to 2-minute intervals at each visit using the correct cuff size. The mean BP was calculated from the 3 readings.</description>
