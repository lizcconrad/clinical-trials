      The purpose of this study is to determine the genetic basis of cardiomyopathies and heart
      failure.

      The purpose of this research study is to explore the causes and inheritances of
      cardiomyopathies. Cardiomyopathies are serious medical conditions that result in a wide range
      of cardiac problems, from no symptoms at all to heart failure. The underlying genetics of
      cardiomyopathies are poorly understood. This study will collect personal, family, and medical
      history information to create a database of participants with cardiomyopathies. This
      information will be used to identify inheritance patterns within families with
      cardiomyopathies. In addition, samples from participants will be studied in the lab to see if
      any changes in their genetic information can be identified that would cause a cardiomyopathy.
      Overall, the research study is aimed at determining the cause of these cardiac conditions so
      that tests and treatments might be developed in the future.

        We are recruiting both local participants (who have been evaluated at UCI) and remote
        participants (who have been referred from outside UCI) with familial and simplex cases of
        hypertrophic, dilated, noncompaction, restrictive, and mitochondrial cardiomyopathies. As a
        control group, we are also recruiting patients with nuclear mutations known to increase the
        risk of cardiomyopathy, but who have not themselves developed cardiomyopathy.
