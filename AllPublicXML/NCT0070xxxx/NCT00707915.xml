  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benzodiazepines (BZDs) have been reported to cause negative impacts on motor as well as
      cognitive functions, which in turn could result in lethal incidents including falls
      especially in the elderly. This notwithstanding, few trials have evaluated a feasibility and
      benefits of discontinuing BZD-derivative hypnotics in a systematic manner in this frail
      population. In this 8-week open-label study, we examined changes in motor and cognitive
      functions following the discontinuation of BZD hypnotics in older persons.

      OBJECTIVES &amp; HYPOTHESES

        1. Primary Objective The primary objective is to examine the feasibility of discontinuing
           BZD-derivative hypnotics in older people.

        2. Secondary Objectives

             1. One of the secondary objectives is to examine the magnitude of discontinuing
                BZD-derivative hypnotics in the stability of body.

             2. Another secondary objective is to examine the magnitude of discontinuing
                BZD-derivative hypnotics in cognitive function.

      Hypotheses

      1. More than 80% of the participants will complete and tolerate all the study procedures.

      2a. Participants will show an improvement in the stability of body. 2b. Participants will
      show an improvement in the cognitive function globally as well as specifically in attention.

      Benzodiazepines (BZDs) have been reported to cause negative impacts on motor as well as
      cognitive functions, which in turn could result in lethal incidents including falls
      especially in the elderly. This notwithstanding, few trials have evaluated a feasibility and
      benefits of discontinuing BZD-derivative hypnotics in a systematic manner in this frail
      population. In this study, we examined changes in motor and cognitive functions following the
      discontinuation of BZD hypnotics in older persons.

      In this 8-week open-label study, subjects aged 50 or older who receive BZD as a hypnotic and
      do not have any unstable physical illness, or neurological disorder will be recruited. The
      BZD dose will be discontinued in 4 weeks by a weekly 25% reduction.

      Following assessments will be performed at baseline 12 hours postdose and at endpoint: the
      Clinical Stabilometric Platform (CSP), the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of
      Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) and the Critical Flicker Fusion Test (CFF), the Leeds Sleep
      Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ). The CSP measures the stability of body, with the eyes opened
      or closed.

      All psychotropic agents other than the BZD-derivative hypnotics will be kept constant
      throughout the study.

      The dose reduction will be terminated if any of the following conditions are fulfilled:

        1. Clinical worsening in sleep defined as a CGI-Global Improvement score of 7

        2. Participant's request

        3. Clinical decision on the part of the physician of record or independent consulting
           physician In the event that a participant needs a dose increment for anxiety and
           insomnia, the dose will be increased back to the previous dose, and they will be
           followed for the rest of the study period. In addition, the use of trazodone (25-100
           mg/day) will be allowed anytime throughout the study period.

    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>This brief test is to assess areas of cognitive functioning and profile impairment across domains with 12 subtests, including: List Learning, Story Memory, Figure Copy, Line Orientation, Digit Span, Coding, Picture Naming, Semantic Fluency, List Recall, List Recognition, Story Recall, and Figure Recall. This assessment is repeatable and not subject to practice effects. A total scale score ranges between 40 and 160; a higher score indicates better cognitive function. A change in the score between the baseline and week 8 is defined as a secondary outcome measure.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>CSP (ANIMA® GS-7, Tokyo) measures a total length of the trunk motion by varying the resistance applied to the platform for 30 seconds with eyes closed with feet together. Change in the total length of the trunk motion from baseline to week 8 will be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Critical Flicker Fusion Test (CFF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The CFF threshold has been regarded as a functional measure of psychomotor function. Sub-threshold intermittent light is perceived as a flicker. If the frequency is gradually increased, the flicker becomes gradually less distinct until it is finally perceived as a continuous light (fusion threshold). The device (T.K.K.501c) provides luminance with a mean intensity of 500Lux±10% and a range of frequency of 20-60Hz. A change in the critical fusion frequency from baseline to week 8 will be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The LSEQ comprises 10 self-rating 100-mm-line analogue questions regarding changes in the quality of sleep and early morning behavior, following any given intervention. Scores range between 0 and 100. Scores beneath 50 indicate better sleep. This will be performed at week 8.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI rating scales are commonly used measures of symptom severity, treatment response and the efficacy of treatments in treatment studies of patients with mental disorders (Guy, W., 1976). The CGI - Improvement scale (CGI-I) is a 7 point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention. and rated as: 1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse. This will be performed at week 8.</description>

        <title>A Change in a Total Scale Score in the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), Japanese Version, From Baseline to Week 8.</title>
        <description>This brief test is to assess areas of cognitive functioning and profile impairment across domains with 12 subtests, including: List Learning, Story Memory, Figure Copy, Line Orientation, Digit Span, Coding, Picture Naming, Semantic Fluency, List Recall, List Recognition, Story Recall, and Figure Recall. This assessment is repeatable and not subject to practice effects. A total scale score ranges between 40 and 160; a higher score indicates better cognitive function. A change in the score between the baseline and week 8 is defined as a secondary outcome measure.</description>

        <title>Critical Flicker Fusion Test (CFF)</title>
        <description>The CFF threshold has been regarded as a functional measure of psychomotor function. Sub-threshold intermittent light is perceived as a flicker. If the frequency is gradually increased, the flicker becomes gradually less distinct until it is finally perceived as a continuous light (fusion threshold). The device (T.K.K.501c) provides luminance with a mean intensity of 500Lux±10% and a range of frequency of 20-60Hz. A change in the critical fusion frequency from baseline to week 8 will be recorded.</description>

        <title>Clinical Global Impression (CGI)</title>
        <description>The CGI rating scales are commonly used measures of symptom severity, treatment response and the efficacy of treatments in treatment studies of patients with mental disorders (Guy, W., 1976). The CGI - Improvement scale (CGI-I) is a 7 point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention. and rated as: 1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse. This will be performed at week 8.</description>
