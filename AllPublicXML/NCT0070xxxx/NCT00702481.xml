      The purpose of this study is to define the response and toxicities with the addition of
      Nimotuzumab to chemoradiation for head and neck cancer.

      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in Head and Neck Squamous Cell
      Carcinoma (HNSCC). EGFR pathway activation is associated with tumor growth, decreased
      apoptosis, and increased angiogenesis. These present a putative target for the use of EGFR
      inhibitors either in the form of small molecule inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies. Several
      studies have been advanced that suggest application of these targeted therapies show
      promising responses with little additional toxicity. The addition of EGFR monoclonal
      antibodies to radiation results in better response rates and locoregional control compared to
      radiation alone. Addition of EGFR monoclonal antibodies compared to chemotherapy alone also
      improves the response rates in patients with advanced HNSCC.

      Nimotuzumab is a humanized chimeric monoclonal antibody specific to the extracellular domain
      of EGFR. Several studies are ongoing and demonstrate promising efficacy of Nimotuzumab as
      monotherapy and in combination with radiation in HNSCC, and in combination with
      chemoradiation in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma. This phase II clinical trial examines the
      feasibility of EGFR inhibition using Nimotuzumab in combination with concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced unresectable HNSCC. Successful and safe incorporation
      of an EGFR monoclonal antibody into the concurrent chemoradiation paradigm used to treat
      locally advanced HNSCC will represent an important advance in the optimisation of treatment
      for this group of patients.
