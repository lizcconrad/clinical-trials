  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate neurocognitive and behavioral measures in 25 children aged 6-10 years
      diagnosed with diabetes for &gt; 5 years who have received long-term insulin pump therapy (&gt; 3
      years) compared to a group of children matched for age, sex, glycemic control, and diabetes
      duration treated with insulin injections. Outcome measures will assess: clinical variables,
      cognitive status (intelligence, neuropsychological functioning), academic achievement,
      behavior, parenting stress, and quality of life.

      It is hypothesized that long term insulin pump therapy initiated during early childhood can
      delay the progression of neurocognitive complications of diabetes, decrease parental stress,
      and improve school performance and quality of life, as compared to insulin injections.
