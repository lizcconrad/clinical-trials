      This study will test whether lovastatin helps to modify lung inflammation in patients with
      COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The impact of lovastatin, 40mg by mouth once daily on biological and clinical outcomes will
      be evaluated in an exploratory 16-week comparative treatment efficacy trial in 44 adult
      former smokers with established COPD of moderate severity. This trial employs a longitudinal
      randomized, parallel-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled design using biomarkers of airway
      inflammation as the primary outcomes of interest.
