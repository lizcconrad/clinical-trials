      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging,
      may help in learning how well dutasteride works in patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy
      and low-risk prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging in
      patients receiving dutasteride for benign prostatic hypertrophy and low-risk prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine whether there is a decrease in the extent of prostate cancer as measured by
           endorectal MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging in patients with symptomatic
           benign prostatic hypertrophy and low-risk prostate cancer treated with dutasteride for 6
           months.

      Secondary

        -  To monitor the effects of dutasteride on serum testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and
           free and total prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

        -  To monitor the effects of dutasteride on symptom and quality-of-life indices.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral dutasteride once daily for 6 months.

      Patients undergo endorectal MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging at baseline and
      at 1, 3, and 6 months.

      Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaires using the International Index of Erectile
      Function Questionnaire, American Urological Association Symptom Index, Functional Alterations
      due to Changes in Elimination, and Spitzer Quality-of-Life Index at baseline and at 1, 3, and
      6 months.

    <measure>Change in Extent of Cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of voxels consistent with prostate cancer as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI). MRSI spectra were examined and scored as healthy or cancerous. The change in cancerous volumes over time was evaluated. Because a significant decrease in citrate and polyamines on MRSI spectra was noted at 1 month compared with baseline, healthy tissue appeared to be more like cancer and thus created a false impression that the cancer had grown after 1 month. To reduce this bias, primary comparisons were made between the 1-month and 6-month scans.</description>

    <measure>Symptom Indices Over Time - IPSS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>IPSS (The International Prostate Symptom Score) is a symptom index based on seven questions concerning urinary symptoms (1 Incomplete emptying, 2 Frequency, 3 Intermittency, 4 Urgency, 5 Weak Stream, 6 Straining, 7 Nocturia) for which the patient chooses one out of six answers indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom, ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 5(Almost always). The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35 (asymptomatic to very symptomatic). Mild (symptom score less than of equal to 7); Moderate (symptom score range 8-19); Severe (symptom score range 20-35).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom Indices Over Time - IIEF-5</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) is an abridged five-item version of the original IIEF 15-item questionnaire designed to evaluate erectile function, based on a definition arrived at by the National Institutes of Health Consensus Panel. Each of 5 questions about erectile function over the past 6 months is scored by the patient from 1 (severe dysfunction) to 5 (little or no dysfunction). The IIEF-5 is scored from 5 to 25, with lower scores indicating erectile dysfunction: 22-25 = No erectile dysfunction; 17-21 = Mild erectile dysfunction; 12-16 = Mild to moderate erectile dysfunction; 8-11 = Moderate erectile dysfunction; 5-7 = Severe erectile dysfunction</description>

    <measure>Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) Indices Over Time - FACE</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Alterations due to Changes in Elimination (FACE) is a 14-item questionnaire designed to evaluate the effects of changes in urinary and bowel elimination on daily functioning. It is scored out of 56, with higher scores reflecting poorer HRQL.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Spitzer Quality of Life Index (SQLI) is a validated five-item questionnaire evaluating global HRQL. Activity, daily living, health, support of family and friends, and outlook are each rated on a 3-point scale (0 to 2), with total score ranging from 0-10, with lower score indicating poorer HRQL.</description>

T1c = a positive prostate specific antigen (PSA) test but no other clinical sign of the disease (i.e., no abnormality felt on digital rectal examination or visible on any form of imaging test).

        <description>Proportion of voxels consistent with prostate cancer as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI). MRSI spectra were examined and scored as healthy or cancerous. The change in cancerous volumes over time was evaluated. Because a significant decrease in citrate and polyamines on MRSI spectra was noted at 1 month compared with baseline, healthy tissue appeared to be more like cancer and thus created a false impression that the cancer had grown after 1 month. To reduce this bias, primary comparisons were made between the 1-month and 6-month scans.</description>

        <title>Symptom Indices Over Time - IPSS</title>
        <description>IPSS (The International Prostate Symptom Score) is a symptom index based on seven questions concerning urinary symptoms (1 Incomplete emptying, 2 Frequency, 3 Intermittency, 4 Urgency, 5 Weak Stream, 6 Straining, 7 Nocturia) for which the patient chooses one out of six answers indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom, ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 5(Almost always). The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35 (asymptomatic to very symptomatic). Mild (symptom score less than of equal to 7); Moderate (symptom score range 8-19); Severe (symptom score range 20-35).</description>

        <description>The Spitzer Quality of Life Index (SQLI) is a validated five-item questionnaire evaluating global HRQL. Activity, daily living, health, support of family and friends, and outlook are each rated on a 3-point scale (0 to 2), with total score ranging from 0-10, with lower score indicating poorer HRQL.</description>
