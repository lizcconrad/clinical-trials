      RATIONALE: Screening may help doctors find prostate cancer sooner, when it may be easier to
      treat.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at whether patients who are being screened for
      prostate cancer have been previously screened.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the degree to which patients who are being screened for prostate cancer
           have been previously screened.

      OUTLINE: Participants complete questions on a survey about prior prostate-specific antigen
      blood tests done for the purpose of screening for prostate cancer and are asked about their
      pastor, church, and how they heard about the SELECT study to determine the degree to which
      African-American men in a church-going population have been previously screened.
