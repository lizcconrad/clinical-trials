      The purpose of this study is to determine if a weaning strategy from artificial ventilation
      governs by respiratory behaviour status assessed by our method is safe enough.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current guidelines for mechanical ventilation weaning do not apply for patients with altered
      level of consciousness. One major limitation is a failure of clinical assessment of the
      respiratory behaviour status of these patients that are not able to interact appropriately
      with the examiner. We propose a non-invasive method for the respiratory behaviour assessment
      of a patient under artificial ventilation that do not requires his participation. Our
      hypothesis is that, in case of normal respiratory behaviour status, it is possible to wean
      under security a patient despite his abnormal level of consciousness.We previously
      demonstrate that patients successfully wean by the clinical team also disclose a normal
      respiratory behaviour status while patients with weaning failure had abnormal respiratory
      behaviour. In the present study, we wonder to evaluate that a weaning strategy governs by
      respiratory behaviour status assessed by our method is safe. For this purpose, in this study,
      tracheal tube withdrawal is triggered by a recognition of a normal respiratory behaviour
      status assessed daily in patients under mechanical ventilation with an altered level of
      consciousness and a good tolerance to T tube challenge.
