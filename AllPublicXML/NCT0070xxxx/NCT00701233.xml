      To compare local steroid injections to local Botulinum toxin A injection in a double-blinded
      study. The goal is to investigate if Botulinum toxin A injections are effective for Carpal
      Tunnel Syndrome compared to steroid injections in terms of pain relief and length of symptom
      alleviation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any individual with symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome and a diagnosis of CTS either
             clinically or via EMG will be included into this study. There will be a total of 20
             subjects displaying symptoms of CTS. The gender of the subjects will not determine
             enrollment. There is no requirement of male to female ratio for this study. There is
             no age cut-off or minimal age requirement to enroll in the study. No specific Racial
