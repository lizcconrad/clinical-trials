      The purpose of this study is to refine and evaluate the Preventing Recurrence of
      Thromboembolic Events through Coordinated Treatment in the District of Columbia (PROTECT DC)
      intervention. PROTECT DC is a program consisting of in-hospital education coupled with
      community-based &quot;stroke navigators&quot; and is designed to reduce the rate of vascular events or
      death in a population of underserved individuals with stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite significant advances in the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease in
      the last few decades, stroke remains the third leading cause of death and the leading cause
      of adult disability in the United States. For the population that has experienced a
      cerebrovascular event, the risk of future stroke is greatly increased. The initiation of
      effective secondary prevention strategies is most effective when implemented early (before
      disabling stroke occurs), monitored frequently, and maintained long-term after a
      cerebrovascular event.

      The Preventing Recurrence of Thromboembolic Events through Coordinated Treatment in the
      District of Columbia (PROTECT DC) intervention uses stroke navigators to help people who have
      suffered a stroke implement secondary prevention strategies. Stroke navigators are lay
      persons trained to provide education on secondary prevention behavior, and trained to
      navigate the health and human service system. The goals are to help individuals who have had
      a stroke obtain the necessary services and programs to engage in secondary prevention
      behaviors and, ultimately, to prevent the recurrence of stroke.

    <description>Participants enrolled in this group will receive education concerning primary and secondary PROTECT DC goals. Primary PROTECT DC goals adhere to the following medication directives: 1) Anti-hypertensive, 2) Lipid Lowering, 3) Anti-Coagulant, and 4) Anti-Diabetic. PROTECT DC secondary goals include the following behaviors 1) Smoking Cessation, 2) Consuming an AHA Diet, 3) Regular Exercise, and 4) Knowledge of Stroke Risk and Warning Signs. Participants will also receive assistance with overcoming resource-related barriers to the PROTECT DC goals.</description>

    <description>PROTECT DC facilitates the initiation of secondary prevention behaviors in an attempt to prevent the recurrence of stroke among participants. The program trains a lay person, called a stroke navigator, to provide participants with education on secondary prevention behavior and to navigate the health and human service system, which will assist participants in obtaining the necessary services and programs to engage in secondary prevention behaviors.</description>
