  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, multiple-dose, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded,
      parallel group trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of Ibuprofen 600
      mg Extended-Release Tablets in a study of dental pain following extraction of third molar
      teeth. The surgery will consist of surgical extraction of 1-2 impacted third molars, of which
      one must be a mandibular impaction that is partially impacted in either tissue or bone.
      Subjects will be stratified according to baseline pain intensity, as rated on an 11-point
      pain intensity numerical rating scale (PI-NRS)and gender.

    <measure>Analgesic Efficacy, as Measured by the Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to 12 hours after dose 1</time_frame>
    <description>Analgesic efficacy for the 8-12 hour measurement interval after dose 1 using Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID).
An 11-point Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS) was used to record pain intensity at baseline and 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 hours after dose 1. The scale went from 0 (no pain) to 10 (Worst possible pain). The outcome measure is based a mean of the sum of each of the five time points evaluated. The total time scale ranges from 0 to 50. Subjects were asked to select the number that best describes how much pain they had at the time of observation.</description>

    <measure>Durability of Effect as Measured by the Number of Subjects Achieving Meaningful Improvement in Pain Intensity Difference (PID) From Baseline at All Three Assessment Periods of 24, 36, and 48 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>24, 36, and 48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate measured the durability of effect and was measured by the number of subjects achieving a reduction of at least 2 points (greater than or equal to 20%) from baseline on the 11-point Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS) at all 3 assessment periods of 24, 36 and 48 hours. The scale went from 0 (no pain) to 10 (Worst possible pain). Subjects were asked to select the number that best describes how much pain they had at the time of observation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Confirmed &quot;First Perceptible&quot; Relief</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 4 hours post Dose 1</time_frame>
    <description>When the subject was administered study medication at Time 0, the Study Coordinator started 2 stopwatches. In an effort to determine the exact moment that the subject began to obtain noticeable pain relief, the subject was instructed to stop the stopwatch when &quot;initial&quot; relief was observed and again when &quot;meaningful&quot; relief was achieved. Time to confirmed first perceptible relief was defined as the time to first perceptible relief, provided that the subject also later stopped the second stopwatch indicating meaningful relief. The assigned censored time for &quot;No Pain Relief&quot; is 240 minutes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Confirmed &quot;Meaningful&quot; Relief</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 4 hours post Dose 1</time_frame>
    <description>When the subject was administered study medication at Time 0, the Study Coordinator started 2 stopwatches. To determine the exact moment that the subject began to notice pain relief, the subject was instructed to stop the stopwatch when &quot;initial&quot; relief was observed and again when &quot;meaningful&quot; relief was achieved. Time to confirmed &quot;meaningful&quot; relief was achieved if both stopwatches were stopped within the 4 hour observation period, when both &quot;initial&quot; and &quot;meaningful&quot; relief were observed. Meaningful relief is a subjective definition, based on each subjects determination of pain.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Achieving &quot;Meaningful&quot; Relief as Indicated by the Time Recorded on the Second Stopwatch Following &quot;First Perceptible&quot; Relief</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 4 hours post Dose 1</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage(%) of subjects with confirmed first perceptible relief and meaningful relief after dose 1. Subjects that achieved both &quot;first perceptible&quot; relief and &quot;meaningful&quot; relief within the time allotted. The assigned censored time for &quot;No Pain Relief&quot; is 240 minutes. Meaningful relief is a subjective definition, based on each subject's determination of pain</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Analgesic Efficacy for the 0-12, 0-4, 4-8, and 4-12 Hour Dosing Intervals After Dose 1 Using Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) and Sum of Pain Intensity Difference(SPID)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-12 hours after Dose 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Intensity Difference (PID) at each time point was derived by subtracting the pain intensity from baseline pain intensity, so that a higher value was indicative of a greater improvement. Time weighted SPID for each specified interval (scale ranges from 0 to 10; 0=no pain relief and 10= complete pain relief) was derived by first multiplying each PID score by the time from the previous time point, and adding them together for each scheduled time point within the time interval (e.g., 4-12 hours in case of SPID 4-12). Time weighted TOTPAR for each specified interval was similarly derived.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Relief After Dose 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Time to rescue or time of Dose 2 (up to 12 hours following dose 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of relief was defined as the time to treatment failure (i.e.,taking rescue medication, or withdrawing due to lack of efficacy) up to the 12-hour time point. For those withdrawing from the study due to lack of efficacy prior to taking dose 2 or rescue medication, time to treatment failure was the time from dose 1 to the last assesment time. For those discontinuing from the study for any other reason, the time to treatment failure was censored at the last assessment time.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Require Rescue Medication at or Prior to Hour 8, Hour 10, and Hour 12 After Taking Dose 1</measure>
    <time_frame>0-12 hours after taking Dose 1</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants who require rescue medication (Lortab) at or prior to hour 8, hour 10 and hour 12 were reported and 95% confidence intervals for the corresponding parameters were calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Relief and PID Scores at Individual Time Points for Dose 1</measure>
    <time_frame>24, 36, 48 hours after taking Dose 1</time_frame>
    <description>Pain relief and pain intensity difference (PID) scores at individual time points were summarized by descriptive statistics. The PID at each time point prior to dose 2 was derived by subtracting the pain intensity from the baseline pain intensity, so that a higher value was indicative of a greater improvement. Range of possible scores could be from 0 (no improvement) to 5 (greatest possible improvement)</description>

        <title>Analgesic Efficacy, as Measured by the Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID) Scale</title>
        <description>Analgesic efficacy for the 8-12 hour measurement interval after dose 1 using Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID).
An 11-point Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS) was used to record pain intensity at baseline and 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 hours after dose 1. The scale went from 0 (no pain) to 10 (Worst possible pain). The outcome measure is based a mean of the sum of each of the five time points evaluated. The total time scale ranges from 0 to 50. Subjects were asked to select the number that best describes how much pain they had at the time of observation.</description>

        <description>When the subject was administered study medication at Time 0, the Study Coordinator started 2 stopwatches. To determine the exact moment that the subject began to notice pain relief, the subject was instructed to stop the stopwatch when &quot;initial&quot; relief was observed and again when &quot;meaningful&quot; relief was achieved. Time to confirmed &quot;meaningful&quot; relief was achieved if both stopwatches were stopped within the 4 hour observation period, when both &quot;initial&quot; and &quot;meaningful&quot; relief were observed. Meaningful relief is a subjective definition, based on each subjects determination of pain.</description>

        <description>The Pain Intensity Difference (PID) at each time point was derived by subtracting the pain intensity from baseline pain intensity, so that a higher value was indicative of a greater improvement. Time weighted SPID for each specified interval (scale ranges from 0 to 10; 0=no pain relief and 10= complete pain relief) was derived by first multiplying each PID score by the time from the previous time point, and adding them together for each scheduled time point within the time interval (e.g., 4-12 hours in case of SPID 4-12). Time weighted TOTPAR for each specified interval was similarly derived.</description>
