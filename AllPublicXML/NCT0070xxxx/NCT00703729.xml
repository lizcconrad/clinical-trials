      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare clinical post-operative outcomes for
      patients using active cooling and compression device and those using ice bags and elastic
      wrap after acromioplasty or arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

            <description>The Game Ready device provides both active, continuous cold and intermittent, pneumatic compression to the post-op shoulder. The first group will use the Game Ready™ Device (CC) for one week following surgery and will use standard ice bags wrapped to the shoulder (IW) for the remainder of the study period.
Cold Compression (CC): The device is applied to the shoulder within 60 minutes of arrival to the recovery room following surgery. The device will be applied at one hour intervals (60 minutes on the shoulder, 60 minutes off) during waking hours for the first 72 hours after surgery. For the remainder of the study period, therapy will be applied for one hour treatments 2-3 times a day during waking hours.</description>

            <description>The Game Ready device provides both active, continuous cold and intermittent, pneumatic compression to the post-op shoulder. The first group will use the Game Ready™ Device (CC) for one week following surgery and will use standard ice bags wrapped to the shoulder (IW) for the remainder of the study period.
Cold Compression (CC): The device is applied to the shoulder within 60 minutes of arrival to the recovery room following surgery. The device will be applied at one hour intervals (60 minutes on the shoulder, 60 minutes off) during waking hours for the first 72 hours after surgery. For the remainder of the study period, therapy will be applied for one hour treatments 2-3 times a day during waking hours.</description>

            <description>The Game Ready device provides both active, continuous cold and intermittent, pneumatic compression to the post-op shoulder. The first group will use the Game Ready™ Device (CC) for one week following surgery and will use standard ice bags wrapped to the shoulder (IW) for the remainder of the study period.
Cold Compression (CC): The device is applied to the shoulder within 60 minutes of arrival to the recovery room following surgery. The device will be applied at one hour intervals (60 minutes on the shoulder, 60 minutes off) during waking hours for the first 72 hours after surgery. For the remainder of the study period, therapy will be applied for one hour treatments 2-3 times a day during waking hours.</description>
