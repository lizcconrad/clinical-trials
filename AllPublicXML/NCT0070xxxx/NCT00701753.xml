      An individual's genetic make-up is known to determine their response to antipsychotic
      medication. Genetic markers that determine efficacy and side effects of medication may be
      identified and used to predict treatment outcome.

      The study is a naturalistic study of routinely prescribed antipsychotics using outcome
      measures undertaken as part of the routine clinical care of the cohort. These clinical data
      are linked with genetic information obtained from DNA and RNA from blood samples undertaken
      as part of the study.

      No alteration is made to the subjects treatment regime or medication.

      The study is a two stage investigation:

        -  The first stage involves the collection of a databank of clinical information and blood
           samples for DNA and RNA extraction from patients treated with antipsychotic medication.

        -  The second stage is a molecular genetic investigation of treatment-related genetic
           factors that may contribute to response prediction and predisposition to side effects.

      From these genetic studies pharmacogenetic prediction tests will be validated and/or
      developed.
