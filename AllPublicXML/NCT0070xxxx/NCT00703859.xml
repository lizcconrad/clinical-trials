  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to see whether radiotherapy plus chemotherapy (Temozolomide) plus
      Dichloroacetate (DCA) improves overall survival and offers better control of the disease in
      patients with newly diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme Tumours.

    <textblock>
      Patients with newly diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme Tumours, once consented to the study,
      would undergo standard treatment of radiotherapy plus chemotherapy (TMZ) with DCA in pill
      form (twice a day) during the radiation phase of the study and then with TMZ for six months
      after. Other elements of the clinical trial include pharmacokinetics and MGMT genetic
      testing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  newly diagnosed GBM

          -  Diagnosis must be established by open biopsy or tumour resection

          -  Tumour must have a supratentorial component

          -  Over 18 years

          -  pre-treatment evaluations must be met

          -  study therapy to begin within 6 weeks of surgery

          -  KPS greater or equal to 70

          -  patients must sign informed consent

          -  If female, patients must not be pregnant or lactating

          -  Women of childbearing potential and male participants must practice adequate
             contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  prior invasive malignancy )except for non-melanomatous skin cancer) unless disease
             free for greater than 3 years

          -  recurrent or multifocal malignant gliomas

          -  metastatic disease of leptomeningeal spread

          -  prior chemo or radiosensitizers for cancers of the head and neck region

          -  prior RT to head and neck region except for T1 glottic cancer, resulting in overlap of
             radiation fields.

          -  Severe active co-morbidity define in protocol

          -  Pregnant of lactating women

          -  Women of childbearing potential or men who are sexually active who are not willing or
             able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception; this exclusion is necessary
             due to the treatment involved potentially being teratogenic.

          -  prior allergic reaction to temozolomide and/or dichloroacetate

          -  History of HIV/AIDS
