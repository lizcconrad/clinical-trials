  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare peoples with disease (sarcoidosis) to those without
      disease. We want to see if people with sarcoidosis have a different immune response to those
      people without disease.

      The goal of this study is to see if the nicotine patch is an anti-inflammatory treatment for
      sarcoidosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Until recently, there was no good explanation for the fact that smoking cigarettes actually
      reduces the risk of sarcoidosis. Research studies have shown that the nicotine, a common
      component of cigarette smoke, strongly suppresses the immune system and reduces the type of
      inflammation that is characteristic of sarcoidosis in the lungs. We propose that nicotine
      treatment, administered in the form of a skin patch, will reduce the severity of lung disease
      in patients with sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis patients who volunteer to participate in this study
      will submit standardized questionnaires relating to their quality of life and the severity of
      their shortness of breath before and after treatment. We will also compare objective measures
      of lung function, radiographic parameters, and the severity of lung inflammation. We predict
      that nicotine treatment will reduce the severity of sarcoidosis symptoms, improve lung
      function, and resolve lung inflammation. If our hypothesis is proven to be correct in this
      relatively small group of patients, we will perform additional studies in a larger group of
      patients and will consider the features of sarcoidosis patients that predict a favorable
      response to nicotine and other nicotine-like drugs. If nicotine is ultimately found to be an
      effective treatment for sarcoidosis, it may replace some of the existing treatments which are
      frequently ineffective and have unacceptable side-effects.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • Symptomatic (active) granulomatous lung disease (radiographic stage II or III
             disease) at least 6 months after the diagnosis. This selects patients that have the
             chronically active variant of sarcoidosis and will likely require long-term treatment
             (33).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Active smokers,

               -  Previous splenectomy,

               -  Those requiring high-dose immunosuppression [i.e., ≥ 0.2 mg/kg/day prednisone (or
                  equivalent) or &gt; 10 mg/week methotrexate or requires second line cytolytic agents
                  (e.g., cyclophosphamide, azathioprine) or anti-TNF treatments (e.g., thalidomide,
                  anti-TNF antibodies, etc.)] to control disease activity.

               -  We will also exclude patients at high risk of complications relating to the use
                  of nicotine. This will include patients with a known intolerance of nicotine or
                  those with active cardiac or central nervous system disease who are at higher
                  risk of cardiac arrhythmias or seizures.

               -  We will also exclude patients with extensive pulmonary fibrosis based upon lung
                  biopsy or high resolution CT scan criterion
