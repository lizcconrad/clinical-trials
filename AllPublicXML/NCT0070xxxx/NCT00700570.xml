  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will assess the resection rate of liver metastasis, time to disease
      progression, and safety of neoadjuvant treatment with Avastin in combination with oxaliplatin
      and capecitabine (XELOX) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with unresectable
      liver metastasis. Patients will receive Avastin 5mg/kg iv on day 1 of every 2 week cycle,
      oxaliplatin 85mg/m2 iv on day 1 of every 2 week cycle, and capecitabine 1000mg/m2 on days 1-5
      and 8-12 of every 2 week cycle. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and
      the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Conversion From Unresectable to Resectable Liver Metastases</measure>
    <time_frame>After 5 cycles of neoadjuvant treatment (10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were assessed via microscopic and macroscopic examination for tumor resectability after completion of 5 cycles of neoadjuvant treatment. Unresectable participants exhibited any of the following criteria: greater than or equal to (≥) 4 liver metastases; location and/or distribution of metastatic disease within the liver considered unsuitable for resection with clear margins; liver involvement precluding resection, in the setting of adequate parenchymal volume for otherwise viable liver function in the immediate postoperative period; and inability to maintain adequate circulation for viable liver function. Participants who had not met any of the above criteria at the end of 5 cycles underwent surgical resection. The percentage of participants with conversion from initially unresectable to resectable liver metastases was calculated as [number of participants eligible for surgical resection divided by the number analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Disease Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 3 years (at Baseline, end of Cycle 5, time of surgery, and within 4 weeks of end of treatment [EOT])</time_frame>
    <description>Objective tumor response was assessed using RECIST version 1.1. Disease progression was defined as a ≥20 percent (%) increase in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum obtained at previous tumor assessment, or the appearance of any new lesions. The percentage of participants with disease progression was calculated as [number of participants meeting the above criteria divided by the number analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Disease Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 3 years (at Baseline, end of Cycle 5, time of surgery, and within 4 weeks of EOT)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective tumor response was assessed using RECIST version 1.1. Disease progression was defined as a ≥20% increase in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum obtained at previous tumor assessment, or the appearance of any new lesions. Time to disease progression was defined as the time from first dose to time of disease progression. Participants without progression were censored at the time of last tumor assessment. Time to disease progression was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and expressed in months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Tumor Response of Complete Response (CR) or PR According to RECIST Version 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 3 years (at Baseline, end of Cycle 5, time of surgery, within 4 weeks of EOT, and at least 4 weeks after initial response)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective tumor response was assessed using RECIST version 1.1. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, and PR was defined as a ≥30% decrease in the sum of longest diameters compared to Baseline. Response was confirmed at a minimum of 4 weeks after the first documented response. The percentage of participants with confirmed CR or PR was calculated as [number of participants meeting the respective criteria divided by the number analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants by Best Overall Tumor Response According to RECIST Version 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 3 years (at Baseline, end of Cycle 5, time of surgery, within 4 weeks of EOT, and at least 4 weeks after initial response)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective tumor response was assessed using RECIST version 1.1. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, and PR was defined as a ≥30% decrease in the sum of longest diameters compared to Baseline. Response was to be confirmed at a minimum of 4 weeks after the first documented response. Stable disease (SD) was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, as well as no new target lesions. Disease progression or PD was defined as a ≥20% increase in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum obtained at previous tumor assessment, or the appearance of any new lesions. Non-evaluability for tumor assessment was also documented when applicable. The percentage of participants with each level of response was calculated as [number of participants meeting the respective criteria divided by the number analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>

          <description>Participants with unresectable liver metastases secondary to colorectal cancer (CRC) were assigned to receive neoadjuvant treatment of intravenous (IV) bevacizumab with oral (PO) capecitabine and IV oxaliplatin (XELOX). Bevacizumab was given as 5 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) on Day 1 of each 14-day cycle during Cycles 1 to 5 and/or Cycles 8 to 12. During Cycles 1 to 12, IV oxaliplatin was given as 85 milligrams per meter-squared (mg/m^2) on Day 1, and PO capecitabine as 1000 mg/m^2 twice daily on Days 1 to 5 and 8 to 12. Resectability was assessed at completion of Cycle 5. Resectable participants followed a new algorithm: complete Cycle 6 (XELOX), rest for 4 weeks, undergo surgery, rest for 4 weeks, complete adjuvant therapy during Cycles 7 (XELOX) and 8 to 12 (bevacizumab plus XELOX), and continue an additional 6 cycles with capecitabine and bevacizumab per Investigator discretion. Participants could be withdrawn at any point for unacceptable toxicity.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Conversion From Unresectable to Resectable Liver Metastases</title>
        <description>Participants were assessed via microscopic and macroscopic examination for tumor resectability after completion of 5 cycles of neoadjuvant treatment. Unresectable participants exhibited any of the following criteria: greater than or equal to (≥) 4 liver metastases; location and/or distribution of metastatic disease within the liver considered unsuitable for resection with clear margins; liver involvement precluding resection, in the setting of adequate parenchymal volume for otherwise viable liver function in the immediate postoperative period; and inability to maintain adequate circulation for viable liver function. Participants who had not met any of the above criteria at the end of 5 cycles underwent surgical resection. The percentage of participants with conversion from initially unresectable to resectable liver metastases was calculated as [number of participants eligible for surgical resection divided by the number analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>

            <description>Participants with unresectable liver metastases secondary to CRC were assigned to receive neoadjuvant treatment of IV bevacizumab with XELOX. Bevacizumab was given as 5 mg/kg on Day 1 of each 14-day cycle during Cycles 1 to 5 and/or Cycles 8 to 12. During Cycles 1 to 12, IV oxaliplatin was given as 85 mg/m^2 on Day 1, and PO capecitabine as 1000 mg/m^2 twice daily on Days 1 to 5 and 8 to 12. Resectability was assessed at completion of Cycle 5. Resectable participants followed a new algorithm: complete Cycle 6 (XELOX), rest for 4 weeks, undergo surgery, rest for 4 weeks, complete adjuvant therapy during Cycles 7 (XELOX) and 8 to 12 (bevacizumab plus XELOX), and continue an additional 6 cycles with capecitabine and bevacizumab per Investigator discretion. Unresectable participants with PR or SD, according to RECIST version 1.1, repeated neoadjuvant treatment until documented resectability or PD. Participants could be withdrawn at any point for unacceptable toxicity.</description>

          <description>Participants with unresectable liver metastases secondary to CRC were assigned to receive neoadjuvant treatment of IV bevacizumab with XELOX. Bevacizumab was given as 5 mg/kg on Day 1 of each 14-day cycle during Cycles 1 to 5 and/or Cycles 8 to 12. During Cycles 1 to 12, IV oxaliplatin was given as 85 mg/m^2 on Day 1, and PO capecitabine as 1000 mg/m^2 twice daily on Days 1 to 5 and 8 to 12. Resectability was assessed at completion of Cycle 5. Resectable participants followed a new algorithm: complete Cycle 6 (XELOX), rest for 4 weeks, undergo surgery, rest for 4 weeks, complete adjuvant therapy during Cycles 7 (XELOX) and 8 to 12 (bevacizumab plus XELOX), and continue an additional 6 cycles with capecitabine and bevacizumab per Investigator discretion. Unresectable participants with PR or SD, according to RECIST version 1.1, repeated neoadjuvant treatment until documented resectability or PD. Participants could be withdrawn at any point for unacceptable toxicity.</description>
