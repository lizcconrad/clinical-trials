  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical devices to increase the individual's bronchial hygiene are commonly used in
      patients with chronic retention of secretions and abnormal cough reflex. In this clinical
      context a new technology (namely TPEPÂ® - Temporary Positive Expiratory Pressure) has been
      recently developed with the aim to improve the respiratory condition in patients suffering
      from chronic respiratory diseases. This trial has the aim to assess the clinical efficacy of
      TPEP in patients with chronic hypersecretion and airways obstruction, but with a normal
      competence of the cough reflex

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind multicentre controlled randomized trial with consecutive recruitment.
      Randomization list by blocks will be available. Group comparison will be made between active
      therapies including TPEP added to conventional MABT (Intervention) or MABT alone (Control).
      Active therapy will last 10 consecutive daily sessions in both groups.

      Primary outcome

      Efficacy comparison on change in:

      a.arterial oxygenation (as assessed by PaO2/FiO2 ratio and/or SatO2 index)

      Secondary outcomes

      Efficacy comparison on change in:

        1. Sputum characteristics

        2. Daily sputum volume

        3. Perceived sensation

        4. Lung functions (as assessed by spirometry and RM strength)

    <description>This technique is mainly based on a continuous low-pressure insufflation in the airways, which is likely to reduce (or even avoid) the potential pressure-related damages of other commonly used devices. This device should be used only in those individuals who are showing a normal competence of their cough reflex, thus it should be considered as a means which may help those techniques normally adopted for the individual's bronchial hygiene.</description>
