    <textblock>
      The study aims to show that the candidate malaria vaccine GMZ2 is as safe as the already
      publicly used vaccine against rabies. 30 Gabonese children aged 1-5 years will be enrolled
      and randomly allocated to receive either malaria vaccine or rabies vaccine without the
      investigator or the participants knowing what they received. They will receive 3 doses each
      at one month intervals, and will be followed up for one year to evaluate safety parameters.
      30 and 100µg doses for the candidate malaria vaccine GMZ 2 will be evaluated for safety.

      This is the second time that candidate malaria vaccine GMZ 2 is being tested in Africa, the
      first time being in Gabonese adults where the product was found to be safe.

      Background. GMZ2 is a recombinant hybrid of the Glutamate Rich Protein (GLURP) and the
      Merozoite Surface Protein 3 (MSP 3).This product has been developed at State Serum
      Institute/EMVI in Denmark and Batch released by Henogen of Belgium. The phase Ia trial in
      malaria naive volunteers was done in Germany, at Tuebingen University. This phase Ia trial
      established safety of the vaccine and also assisted in selecting the best dosage (10, 30 or
      100 µg). The dosage with the best safety and immunogenicity profile will be tested for the
      phase Ib trials in Gabon, including this phase Ib trial in children.

      Objectives:

      Primary objective:

      To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of three doses of 30 and 100µg GMZ2, adsorbed on
      aluminium hydroxide, in comparison with three doses of the control vaccine (rabies), in
      healthy Gabonese children aged 1-5 years.

      Secondary objectives:

      To assess the humoral immune response to the vaccine antigens GMZ2, GLURP and MSP3 by
      measuring the total IgG concentration and IgG isotypes against GMZ2 by ELISA.

      To assess B-cell memory by memory B-cell ELISPOT.

      Exploratory Objectives:

      To assess the functionality of the immune response by measuring the Growth Inhibition of P.
      falciparum in the presence or absence of Monocytes, and by measuring the recognition of
      native antigen of P. falciparum by IFA.

      Study Design:

      Phase Ib double-blind, randomised, and controlled trial with three groups at one study site;
      rabies vaccine,30µg and 100 µg GMZ 2 vaccine.
