  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if there is a difference in quality of life (as
      measured by FACT-P) in patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for
      biochemical failure (PSA recurrence) following surgery or radiation for prostate cancer
      depending on when ADT is initiated.

        Male subjects aged 18 years or older with histologically-confirmed prostate cancer, showing
        biochemical failure (defined as a rising PSA) following definitive therapy (surgery or
        radiation) and indicated to receive hormone therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years or older

          -  Received therapy of curative intent (surgery or radiotherapy)

          -  Have a rising PSA which has doubled from a nadir value.

          -  Histologically proven prostate cancer requiring androgen deprivation therapy for at
             least 12 months

          -  Written informed consent to participate in the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to Zoladex, Casodex, ar any component of these products

          -  Prior treatment with LHRH agonist or anti-androgens in the past 12 months

          -  Any concomitant condition that would make it undesirable, in the physician's opinion,
             for the subject to participate in the trial or would jeopardize compliance with the
             protocol.
