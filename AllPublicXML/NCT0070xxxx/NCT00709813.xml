  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient-provider shared decision making and the inclusion of patients' illness experiences
      and preferences in patient care are prioritized areas in health care. CHOICE is a
      computer-based support system for patient-centered symptom management of cancer patients
      developed for this purpose. In this randomized clinical trial at Rikshospitalet-
      Radiumhospitalet HF 145 adult stem-cell transplantation and newly diagnosed lymphoma and
      leukemia patients used CHOICE for assessments of their symptoms, problems and priorities for
      care at in-and outpatient visits during treatment and rehabilitation. In the experimental
      group this information was shared with physicians an nurses for subsequent care planning, but
      not in the control group.

      This study tested effects of CHOICE on symptom- related patient care and outcomes of symptom
      relief, patients' needs for care over time and patient satisfaction;(2) analyzed how
      patients' symptoms, needs for care varied during illness/treatment stages; and (3) evaluated
      CHOICE' ease of use and user satisfaction. Controlling for gender, age, diagnosis, and
      type/stage of treatment, education, depression, health related quality of life, and social
      support, repeated measurement models were used to test differences and variations in outcome
      variables within and between groups and over time.

    <description>Both groups used CHOICE, the Computer-assisted Interactive Tailored Patient Assessment Tool (ITPA)for symptom assessments at in- and outpatient visits during and up-to nine months after treatment. In the intervention group physicians and nurses had assessment summaries available for care planning, displaying patients' symptoms, problems and concerns in rank-order of their needs for care. In the control group assessments were not available to care providers at any time.</description>
