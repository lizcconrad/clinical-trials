    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well bortezomib and vorinostat work in treating patients with
      recurrent mantle cell lymphoma or recurrent and/or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
      Bortezomib and vorinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the response rates of mantle cell and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas to
      bortezomib and vorinostat combination therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of the study regimen. II. Observe progression-free
      survival and response durations. III. Observe the relationship between pretreatment lymphoma
      cell nuclear v-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A (relA) and response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and 8-12. Patients also
      receive bortezomib intravenously (IV) over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses
      repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed mantle cell or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; histological
             material must be available for central pathological review; unstained histological
             material -- slides or blocks -- must be available for correlative studies; archived
             material from previous biopsies is acceptable, unless a patient's lymphoma has been
             known to undergo histological transformation in the past, in which case a repeat
             biopsy to confirm histology prior to enrollment is required; availability of material
             must be confirmed at the time of registration, but material may be submitted
