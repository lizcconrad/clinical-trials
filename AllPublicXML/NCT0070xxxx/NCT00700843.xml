      The purpose of this study is to obtain long-term follow-up results for bariatric patients who
      underwent medical management or surgery for treatment of morbid obesity by Ohio State
      University Medical Center (OSUMC) surgeons during the late 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Our
      hypothesis is that surgical intervention for treatment of morbid obesity leads to sustained
      weight loss and decreased obesity-related morbidity and mortality.
