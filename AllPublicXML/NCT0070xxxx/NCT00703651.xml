  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a follow-up of a previous dose-ranging study aimed at investigating 2 doses of the
      trivalent inactivated split virion influenza vaccine when administered by intradermal route
      with that of the current pharmaceutical presentation administered by intramuscular route.

      Primary Objective:

      To assess the immunogenicity of two pharmaceutical presentations of the trivalent inactivated
      split virion influenza vaccine 21 days after a single injection in subjects aged 18 to 57
      years.

      Secondary Objective:

      To evaluate the safety profile during the 21-day period following each vaccination in each
      study group

      This is an open (for the administration route) and double-blind (only for the two dosages
      administered at year 0 by using the investigational administration route) randomized trial
      conducted in subjects aged 18 to 60 years. The subjects will receive three vaccine injections
      at 1-year interval.
