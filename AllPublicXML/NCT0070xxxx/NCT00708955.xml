    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate and provide standard treatments for people with various eye
      conditions. It will provide a resource for enrollment into new research protocols throughout
      the Eye Institute and will allow institute specialists the opportunity to maintain their
      expertise and gain additional knowledge of the course of various eye disorders. The
      information obtained will allow for the evaluation of standard treatments and may lead to
      ideas for future research.

      People with diagnosed or undiagnosed eye disease and first-degree relatives of people with a
      genetic or developmental eye disease may be eligible for this study. Participants are
      evaluated and treated in the National Eye Institute. Blood or other tissue samples (e.g.,
      urine, stool, hair, saliva or cheek swab) may be collected for future laboratory studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The National Eye Institute (NEI) is conducting a study to evaluate and provide standard
      treatment to participants with various diagnosed and undiagnosed ocular conditions.

      Objectives: The primary objective of this protocol is to provide a reservoir of patients for
      enrollment into new research protocols throughout the NEI laboratories. Evaluating and
      treating participants will allow the NEI specialists to maintain their expertise and gain
      additional knowledge of the course of various eye disorders. The information obtained will
      allow for the evaluation of standard treatments of the studied eye diseases. This
      understanding may lead to ideas for future protocols. In some cases, blood or other biologic
      samples (including tear fluid, urine, saliva, hair, stool or a cheek swab) will be obtained
      for future laboratory studies.

      Study Population: The number of participants to be enrolled has no logical upper limit, but
      will be set to 5,000 patients with ocular diseases and their unaffected first-degree
      relatives.

      Design: This is an observational natural history study of multiple ocular diseases and their
      progression and physiology.

      Outcome Measures: No formal outcomes will be measured; however the clinical assessments of
      enrolled participants can be used to measure the response to standard treatment. In addition,
      DNA samples obtained may be used to identify and verify causative mutations, which may help
      establish pathogenic mechanisms and genotype-phenotype correlations.
