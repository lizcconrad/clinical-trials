  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PET CT is one of the imaging tools that are used for staging of urological malignancies.

      C11 Choline is a novel isotope with the advantage of its minimal secretion in the urine. This
      advantage makes it a potentially better metabolic marker then others such as FDG. Preliminary
      studies showed ~95% sensitivity in the diagnosis of TCC. Our Goal is to continue the
      evaluation of this method as a diagnostic and follow up tool in different urological
      malignancies.
