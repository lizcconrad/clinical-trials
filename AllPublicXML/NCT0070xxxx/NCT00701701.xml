    <textblock>
      An exploratory, open-labeled study of patients with Pompe disease, who have previously
      received Myozyme (alglucosidase alfa) treatment, to evaluate the efficacy, safety and
      clinical benefit of 2 Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) regimens in combination with Myozyme.
      Eligible patients who are currently receiving Myozyme therapy will be enrolled into the
      study, and will be followed for a minimum of 18 months on-study (a 6-month ITI treatment
      module and a 12-month follow-up module on Myozyme alone). Eligible patients will be followed
      for a minimum of 18 months on treatment or, if a patient is &lt;6 months of age at the time of
      enrollment, until the patient is 2 years of age. Both cross-reacting immunologic material
      (CRIM)-negative and CRIM-positive patients can be eligible for Regimen A depending if they
      meet the required criteria. Regimen B however, is limited to CRIM-negative patients.

             written informed consent prior to any study-related procedures that are performed;

          -  The patient must have a confirmed diagnosis of Pompe disease defined as a documented
             acid α-glucosidase (GAA) enzyme deficiency from any tissue source or 2 GAA gene
             mutations;

          -  The patient (and/or legal guardian) must have ability to comply with clinical

          -  The patient has a major congenital abnormality;

          -  The patient has used any investigational product (other than alglucosidase alfa)
             within 30 days prior to study enrollment;
