    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of different sodium fluoride (NaF)
      containing toothpastes in prevention of dental caries. Change from baseline fluoride data at
      various time points up to four hours after a single brushing with NaF containing toothpastes
      will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topical fluorides in a wide variety of delivery systems have been proven to be clinically
      effective in the prevention of dental caries. It is generally agreed that fluoride has its
      anti-caries effect mainly by decreasing the rate of enamel demineralization and enhancing the
      rate of enamel remineralization. There is a general consensus that level of fluoride in
      plaque fluid, may be directly related to the anti caries effects of fluoride. Also, fluoride
      levels in the oral fluids decrease rapidly after topical fluoride application, mainly due to
      the diluting and washing effect of saliva followed by periodic swallowing. To evaluate
      fluoride content, plaque samples will be collected from the interproximal surfaces of the
      posterior teeth of participants using a standardized approach. Plaque fluid fluoride will be
      calculated using a micro analytical method and in comparison to a standard fluoride curve
      constructed on the same day of the analysis.

Plaque fluid fluoride were calculated using a micro analytical method and in comparison to a standard fluoride curve constructed on the same day of the analysis.

Plaque fluid fluoride were calculated using a micro analytical method and in comparison to a standard fluoride curve constructed on the same day of the analysis.
