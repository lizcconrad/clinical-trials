  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The planning target volume (PTV) and planning organ at risk volume (PRV) margins used for
      pediatric radiation therapy are empiric, and quantitative assessment of these margins is
      needed to improve therapy planning and delivery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data will be gathered to develop a model to quantify the setup margin (SM) portion of the
      planning target volume (PTV) margin for pediatric tumor sites according to age, localization
      technique, treatment position, and the use of general anesthesia. Patient specific PTV and
      PRV margin recommendations will be developed based on the number of participants.
