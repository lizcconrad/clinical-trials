      Treatment options that increase immune function, such as Osteopathic Manipulation Treatment
      (OMT) lymphatic techniques, may provide improved short or long term performance of the immune
      system. However, the efficacy of OMT to boost immune function among people living with HIV
      has not yet been examined in a controlled study. Our experiment is designed to examine the
      short (45 minutes) term impact of OMT on the white blood cells counts of HIV positive men who
      are either antiretroviral therapy (ART) naïve or have not taken ART for at least 12 months
      prior to enrollment in the study.
