      The proposed study will measure the time from the end of surgery until the time patients meet
      the discharge criteria from the postoperative anesthesia care unit and the time from the end
      of surgery until the patients regained cognitive function after anesthesia.

    <textblock>
      Hypercapnia has been used in conjunction with hyperpnoea to provide a more rapid return of
      responsiveness after inhaled anesthesia. In our first clinical study with isoflurane we
      confirmed that the time from turning off the vaporizer to opening of eyes was shortened by an
      average of 62% when the minute ventilation was elevated and the end tidal carbon dioxide
      concentration was kept at 52 mmHg rather than 28 mmHg during emergence. In our second study
      we found that hypercapnia and hyperpnoea accelerated recovery proportionately for sevoflurane
      and desflurane. The benefits of accelerating subject recovery in the operating room may
      extend to the entire recovery period if the subject is more alert and easier to care for when
      they arrive in the post anesthesia care unit.

    <description>Patients received intravenous fentanyl at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist. Anesthesia was induced with a remifentanil infusion, lidocaine, propofol, and rocuronium or succinylcholine at the anesthesiologist's discretion. Maintenance anesthesia was 6% end tidal desflurane with oxygen flows of 2 L/min (though clinicians could deviate from this at their discretion). Clinicians were directed to maintain blood pressure at ±20% of baseline. A baseline remifentanil infusion was used throughout each case, and both remifentanil and fentanyl were titrated at the anesthesiologist's discretion. Ventilation was adjusted to maintain an end tidal carbon dioxide concentration (EtCO2) of 35 mmHg. Ondansetron 4 mg was given prophylactically before the end of surgery.</description>

    <description>The Quick Emergence Device is placed between the endotracheal tube and the anesthesia breathing circuit to enable hypercapnia when ventilation is increased. The end-tidal gas sampling line is connected between the device and the endotracheal tube connector. Minute ventilation is doubled and the EtCO2 is elevated to approximately 48 mmHg from the previous maintenance level of 35 mmHg.</description>
