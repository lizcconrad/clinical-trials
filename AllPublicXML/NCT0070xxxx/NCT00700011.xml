  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that, in addition to its apoptotic effect, clofarabine induces
      DNA hypomethylation. If the investigators' hypothesis is correct, findings from the present
      proposal will not only contribute to information relating to the mechanisms of action of
      clofarabine but also provide the opportunity for combined epigenetic targeting of MDS using
      clofarabine with either another hypomethylating agent or a histone deacetylase inhibitor.

      Clofarabine has demonstrated anti-cancer activity through inhibition of DNA synthesis and
      repair, induction of apoptosis, and possibly through other mechanisms. Numerous responses
      have been observed after treatment with clofarabine in heavily pre-treated
      relapsed/refractory patients with ALL, AML and high risk MDS.

      In the present proposal, the investigators will study the clinical and laboratory effects of
      2 different dosages of clofarabine in patients who have failed the hypomethylating agent,
      5-azacytidine. This study will recruit patients who have received at least six cycles of
      5-azacytidine without response or whose disease has progressed or relapsed while on
      5-azacytidine. The first cohort of patients will receive clofarabine 10 mg/m2/day for five
      days and the second cohort of patients 5 mg/m2/day for five days, both every four to six
      weeks. The investigators will determine the frequency of response to the two dosages of
      nucleoside analog in this group of patients. Measurement of responses will include
      improvement in the peripheral blood count, reduction in the blood and platelet transfusion
      need and eradication of cytogenetically abnormal clones. Successful completion of this study
      will define the position of clofarabine in MDS in the era of epigenetic targeting.

      Study Overview

      This study will recruit patients who have received at least six cycles of 5-azacytidine
      without response or whose disease has progressed or relapsed while on 5-azacytidine. The
      first cohort of patients will receive clofarabine 10 mg/m2/day for five days and the second
      cohort of patients 5 mg/m2/day for five days, both every four to six weeks. The investigators
      will determine the frequency of response to the two dosages of nucleoside analog in this
      group of patients. Measurement of responses will include improvement in the peripheral blood
      count, reduction in the blood and platelet transfusion need and eradication of
      cytogenetically abnormal clones.

        -  Primary Objectives

             1. To determine the frequency and duration of peripheral blood responses to IV
                clofarabine in MDS patients who have failed 5-azacytidine

             2. To determine the frequency and duration of bone marrow responses to IV clofarabine,
                including CR + PR

        -  Secondary Objectives

      To determine whether clofarabine exhibits a DNA hypomethylating property

    <description>The International Working Group response criteria was used. Complete remission is defined as &lt;5 % marrow blasts without evidence of dysplasia and normalization of the peripheral blood counts, including hemoglobin &gt;11 g/dL, neutrophil count of &gt;1 x 10^9/L. and platelet count of &gt;100 x 10^9/L. Patients must also be transfusion-independent and not require any recombinant erythropoietin. Partial remission (PR) is defined as: satisfying complete remission criteria if abnormal before treatment, except that blasts are reduced by 50% or more compared to pretreatment levels, but still &gt;5 %. Stable disease is defined as: failure to achieve at least a PR but without evidence of disease progression for at least 8 weeks.Progression of disease is defined as: disease progression with worsening cytopenias. Best response of these patients is used in the determination for this outcome below.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with MDS of any risk group who have, just immediately prior to being entered
             into this study, already received at least six cycles of 5-azacytidine and have
             failed, either due to no response or to disease relapse despite being still on
             5-azacytidine, or patients whose MDS has progressed while on 5-azacytidine,
             irrespective of the number of cycles the patient has received. We have specifically
             chosen to be very stringent about our patient population in order to address our
             question of whether clofarabine can be used to salvage patients who have failed
             5-azacytidine with only a small patient population, i.e. 10 patients in each cohort.

          -  ECOG Performance status of 0 - 2

          -  Recombinant erythropoietin is allowed, if the patients are already receiving
             erythropoietin. G-CSF can be given during the neutropenic stage following therapy
             since this would not affect evaluation of response because the response will be made
             based on CBC and bone marrow changes upon recovery from clofarabine.

          -  Patients must have been at least four weeks after the last course of 5-azacytidine

          -  Age over 18 years

          -  Have adequate renal and hepatic functions as indicated by the following laboratory
             values:

               -  Serum creatinine 1.0 mg/dL; if serum creatinine 1.0 mg/dL, then the estimated
                  glomerular filtration rate (GFR) must be 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 as calculated by the
                  Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation where Predicted GFR (ml/min/1.73
                  m2) = 186 x (Serum Creatinine)-1.154 x (age in years)-0.023 x (0.742 if patient
                  is female) x (1.212 if patient is black)

               -  Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL × upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Aspartate transaminase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT) 2.5 × ULN

               -  Alkaline phosphatase 2.5 × ULN

          -  Capable of understanding the investigational nature, potential risks and benefits of
             the study, and able to provide signed informed consent.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 2 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Male and female patients must use an effective contraceptive method during the study
             and for a minimum of 6 months after study treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Nursing or pregnant women

          -  Prior clofarabine therapy

          -  Life expectancy of less than 3 months due to other intercurrent illness.

          -  Current concomitant chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy other than as
             specified in the protocol.

          -  Use of investigational agents within 30 days or any anticancer therapy within 4 weeks
             before study entry with the exception of hydroxyurea. The patient must have recovered
             from all acute toxicities from any previous therapy.

          -  Have any other severe concurrent disease, or have a history of serious organ
             dysfunction or disease involving the heart, kidney, liver, or other organ system that
             may place the patient at undue risk to undergo treatment.

          -  Patients with a systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection not controlled
             (defined as exhibiting ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection and without
             improvement, despite appropriate antibiotics or other treatment).

          -  Any significant concurrent disease, illness, or psychiatric disorder that would
             compromise patient safety or compliance, interfere with consent, study participation,
             follow up, or interpretation of study results.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The recruitment period started 3/24/08 (date of consent of the first patient), to 4/8/10 which was the date IRB lists as date of study closure. All patients were consented and treated at our clinic, Texas Oncology - Amarillo. Eight patients were treated to the 10 mg/m2 arm and two patients to the 5 mg/m2 arm. Study closed due to poor recruitment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>There were no screen fails due to pre-screening thoroughly. The plan was to sign eight patients to the 10 mg/m2 arm and then eight to the 5 mg/m2 arm, but recuitment was difficult and decision was made to close study in early 2010, so only two patients were assigned to 5 mg/m2 arm.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Patients were treated with Clofarabine 10 mg/m2 daily x 5 days per cycle. Cycles were intended on being every 28 days but this was flexible due to the bone marrow neding to recover from each cycle before strting the next one. Neulasta was given on day 5 of each cycle. Patients were treated until disease progression, or intolerable toxicities.</description>

        <title>Determine Frequency and Duration of Bone Marrow Responses to IV Clofarabine</title>
        <description>The International Working Group response criteria was used. Complete remission is defined as &lt;5 % marrow blasts without evidence of dysplasia and normalization of the peripheral blood counts, including hemoglobin &gt;11 g/dL, neutrophil count of &gt;1 x 10^9/L. and platelet count of &gt;100 x 10^9/L. Patients must also be transfusion-independent and not require any recombinant erythropoietin. Partial remission (PR) is defined as: satisfying complete remission criteria if abnormal before treatment, except that blasts are reduced by 50% or more compared to pretreatment levels, but still &gt;5 %. Stable disease is defined as: failure to achieve at least a PR but without evidence of disease progression for at least 8 weeks.Progression of disease is defined as: disease progression with worsening cytopenias. Best response of these patients is used in the determination for this outcome below.</description>
