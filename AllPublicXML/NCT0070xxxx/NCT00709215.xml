  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, open-label, Phase I/II study in subjects with relapsed or refractory
      TdT-positive leukemia for which no standard therapies are expected to result in durable
      remission.

      In the first phase the Study Objectives are to:

        -  Define the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD) for administration
           of cordycepin as a 1-hour IV infusion, administered 1 hour following administration of
           an IV bolus of pentostatin, in subjects with refractory TdT-positive leukemia;

        -  Determine plasma ADA levels prior to pentostatin infusion and at 60 and 120 minutes
           after administration of pentostatin;

        -  Determine the single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of cordycepin given 1 hour
           after a fixed dose of pentostatin;

        -  Assess cordycepin pharmacodynamics by measurement of blast cell apoptosis from
           peripheral blood smears;

        -  Measure and quantitate any clinical responses in refractory TdT-positive leukemia
           patients following cordycepin/pentostatin administration.

      In the second phase, the Study Objectives are to assess the safety, PK, and clinical outcomes
      of cordycepin in combination with pentostatin, at the RD, in a 20 subject cohort

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  TdT-positive leukemia (ALL, AML, or blastic CML) that has failed at least one standard
             treatment regimen and for which no standard therapies are expected to result in
             durable remission. Leukemia is minimally defined as at least 20% blast cells present
             in marrow or peripheral blood. TdT must be expressed in at least 20% of blast cells
             present and documented either immunologically or biochemically;

          -  Age ≥18 years;

          -  Must understand and voluntarily sign informed consent;

          -  Adequate non-hematologic organ system function, defined by:

               -  Creatinine ≤1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or creatinine clearance
                  ≥60 mL/min

               -  AST and/or ALT ≤2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Total bilirubin within institutional normal range

               -  Normal EKG and LVEF &gt;40%, measured by EKG and MUGA scan, radionuclide
                  ventriculogram, or echocardiogram

          -  Life expectancy &gt;3 months;

          -  Performance status (PS) &gt;70% Karnofsky or ECOG ≤2;

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7
             days of starting study drug. A woman of child-bearing potential is a sexually mature
             woman who has not undergone a hysterectomy or who has not been naturally
             postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., who has had menses at any
             time in the preceding 24 consecutive months);

          -  Male or female of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraceptive
             methods

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Failure to meet inclusion criteria;

          -  Uncontrolled active infection;

          -  Extramedullary (CNS) disease;

          -  Serious concomitant medical illness, such as active infection, uncontrolled congestive
             heart failure, or uncontrolled diabetes or other metabolic disorder, or psychiatric
             illness;

          -  Pregnancy or lactation; females of child bearing potential must use adequate
             contraceptive methods;

          -  Less than 3 weeks since prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy.
             However, hydroxyurea is permitted up to 24 hours before the study is initiated;

          -  Less than 2 months following bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
             or treatment with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI).
