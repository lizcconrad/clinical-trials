  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a non-interventional (observational) study in Japan to confirm the safety and
      efficacy of Zetia when administered alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering drugs
      in daily medical practice throughout a 12-week period. It is being conducted as a
      post-approval commitment, in accordance with the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's
      guideline on Good Post-marketing Study Practice.

      Post-marketing surveys are not considered applicable clinical trials and thus the results of
      this survey will not be posted at its conclusion. The results will be submitted to public
      health officials as required by applicable national and international laws.
