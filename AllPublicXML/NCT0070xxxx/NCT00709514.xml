  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this Phase 2 study is to evaluate the efficacy of DCB-WH1 ointment
      in wound closure as compared to vehicle control when applied topically to chronic diabetic
      foot ulcers for 12 weeks. The secondary objective of this study is to collect safety
      information of DCB-WH1 ointment.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, vehicle-controlled, multi-center study of
      DCB-WH1 ointment applied topically to grade 1 foot ulcers (according to Wagner grading
      system) in 50 subjects with diabetes mellitus.

          2. The target ulcer is classified as a grade 1 ulcer according to a modified Wagner
             system, which includes wounds involving the epidermis, the dermis, the hypodermis or
             the subcutaneous fat but not the tendon or joint capsule. The thickness of aforesaid
             layers wounds be approximately between 0.2 mm and 8 mm and is ranging in size between
