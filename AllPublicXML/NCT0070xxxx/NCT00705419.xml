      Nonrandomized, prospective, observational, multi-site registry to assess long-term safety,
      clinical outcome, deaths, and evolution of viral tropism in HIV subjects who completed or
      discontinued participation in Phase 2 or 3 clinical trials involving vicriviroc. Subjects
      will be followed for up to 5 years.
