  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who receive a mechanical heart valve to replace a diseased heart valve must take an
      anticoagulation medicine the rest of their lives, and monitor their level of anticoagulation.
      Until recently, the testing of the level of anticoagulation was performed at medical
      laboratories or hospitals.

      The purpose of this study is to see if patients who test their level of anticoagulation by
      themselves at home and then call their doctor with the result have better control of their
      anticoagulation as compared to patients whose anticoagulation is checked only by their
      physician.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prosthetic replacement of diseased heart valves is a routine procedure, and mechanical heart
      valves have excellent hemodynamic performance and durability. However, mechanical valves are
      thrombogenic, necessitating lifelong anticoagulation. Hazards of anticoagulation include
      bleeding when it is excessive or thromboembolism when the intensity of anticoagulation is
      below the recommended level. Monitoring the level of anticoagulation is accomplished by
      analyzing the International Normalized Ratio. Until recently, this was performed at medical
      laboratories or hospitals, but recent literature suggests that patient self-testing of oral
      anticoagulation improves patient compliance, medical outcomes, and quality of life.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the time in therapeutic range of patients who
      self-test their INR compared to patients receiving the usual care. Additionally, we will
      evaluate the educational components and corollaries of self-testing.

      Two hundred consecutively enrolled adults, having undergone implantation of a mechanical
      heart valve, will be randomized to either self-testing or usual care. Those randomized to the
      self-testing group will undergo self-testing instruction prior to hospital dismissal. For
      three months after hospital discharge, subject will record their INR results obtained by
      self-testing or as prescribed by their primary physician. They will then submit the record of
      the INR results and complete a survey.

    <description>Home testing monitor to test patients INR by placing a capillary drop of blood from the finger onto a test strip. The test strip is then inserted into the INRatio point-of-care self-testing coagulometer. After approximately 2 minutes of analysis, the INR value will be presented on the meter's display.</description>

    <description>Usual care is defined as that care currently received by patients into whom mechanical heart valves are placed. Typically, these patients undergo frequent checks of their INR level until the therapeutic range is achieved. Then periodic INR levels are drawn at the discretion of the managing physician.</description>
