  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study is designed to confirm the prognostic and economic
      impact of depression in ambulatory patients with systolic or diastolic heart failure, to
      explore the impact of other psychosocial patterns such as type D personality, anxiety
      disorders, locus of control, perceived social support, anger, hopelessness, and to evaluate
      potential pathophysiological and behavioral pathways.

    <textblock>
      Studies suggest that depressive symptoms may be associated with a worse prognosis and higher
      costs of care in patients with chronic heart failure in some populations, but such data in a
      French population are missing. On the other hand, little is known of the impact of other
      psychosocial dysfunction whereas the pathophysiology of this association remains
      hypothetical.

      Main objective: to confirm the impact of depressive symptoms on cardiovascular death in
      ambulatory heart failure patients

      Other objectives:

        -  to study the impact of depressive symptoms on sudden death, non cardiovascular death,
           and hospitalization rates;

        -  to study the role of other psychosocial patterns or personality traits such as anxiety
           disorders, locus of control, perceived social support, anger, hopelessness, optimism and
           type D personality in cardiovascular and total mortality;

        -  to study the interaction with patient behaviors (drug compliance, addictions);

        -  to explore some pathophysiological pathways (chronic inflammation and chronic loss of
           myocytes),

        -  and to evaluate the impact of psychosocial distress on health care costs. Design:
           multicenter observational study with a minimum of 2 year follow up Population: 700
           ambulatory patients, aged above 18 y.o., with acute heart failure within the last 24
           months

      Methodology:

        -  psychosocial patterns and personality traits are assessed using validated
           self-administered questionnaire; use of the Beck Depression Index in this population is
           validated against the Montgomery &amp; Asberg Depression Rating Scale evaluation

        -  cardiac condition is evaluated at pre-defined time period by B-natriuretic peptide
           levels, echocardiography and 6'-walk test

      End-point criteria:

        -  primary : rate of cardiovascular death

        -  secondary : rate of total mortality and sudden death, rate of rehospitalization for
           heart failure and for any cause, total and specific health care costs.
