  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is a multifactorial disease with a strong genetic
      component. Most importantly a genetic polymorphism in the gene encoding for the complement
      factor H (CFH) has been recently identified which is highly associated with an increased risk
      of developing AMD. This Tyr402His polymorphism located on chromosome 1q31 has been implicated
      to play a role in the development of the disease.

      Given that it is known that impaired regulation of choroidal vascular tone is present in
      patients with AMD, the current study seeks to investigate whether the Tyr402His polymorphism
      is associated with altered choroidal autoregulation in healthy subjects. For this purpose a
      total of 100 healthy volunteers will be included in order to test the hypothesis that an
      impaired regulation of choroidal blood flow is present in subjects with homozygous Tyr402His
      variant.
