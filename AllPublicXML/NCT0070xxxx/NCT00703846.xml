  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extina (ketoconazole) Foam, 2% was approved for marketing in the United States (US) in June
      2007. Extina foam is indicated for topical treatment of seborrheic dermatitis in
      immunocompetent patients 12 years of age and older. The approved dosing regimen is twice
      daily for 4 weeks. The treatment of recurrent seborrheic dermatitis demands a topical
      preparation that is safe for both short-term and chronic application. This study is being
      conducted in order to obtain long-term safety data on the use of Extina (ketoconazole) Foam,
      2% in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, single-group study to assess the long-term safety of
      twice daily treatment with Extina (ketoconazole) Foam, 2% in subjects with seborrheic
      dermatitis.

      The study subjects must have seborrheic dermatitis with an Investigator's Static Global
      Assessment (ISGA) of 2, 3, or 4 at baseline. In addition, subjects must have a discrete,
      evaluable target area of at least 0.5 cm2, with a score of 2, 3, or 4 for erythema and
      scaling.

      All subjects will apply Extina (ketoconazole) Foam, 2% topically twice a day (morning and
      evening) to all seborrheic dermatitis lesions on the face, scalp, ears, neck, and chest.
      Study product should be applied at the first sign of a seborrheic dermatitis flare, and twice
      daily applications should continue until the area(s) has cleared. All symptom flares should
      be treated throughout the 12-month study period. Study visits will occur at baseline (day 1)
      and at weeks 4, 8, 16, 26, 39, and 52 (or early withdrawal). See the study flowchart (section
      3) for the assessments to be performed at each visit. Primary Objective: To assess the
      long-term safety of Extina (ketoconazole) Foam, 2% in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis.

        <description>Mean change from baseline in skin assessments for scaling was calculated as the Week 4, 8, 16, 26, 39, and 52 (or Early Termination) value minus the baseline value. The grading scale for scaling ranges from 0 to 4; 0=Normal skin with rare fine scale; 1=Minimal: occasional fine scales over less than 10% of the lesions; 2=Mild: fine scales predominate; 3=Moderate: coarse scales predominate; 4=Severe: thick tenacious scales predominate. Scaling of skin is the loss of the outer layer of the epidermis in large, scale-like flakes.</description>

          <description>Mean change from baseline in skin assessments for scaling was calculated as the Week 4, 8, 16, 26, 39, and 52 (or Early Termination) value minus the baseline value. The grading scale for scaling ranges from 0 to 4; 0=Normal skin with rare fine scale; 1=Minimal: occasional fine scales over less than 10% of the lesions; 2=Mild: fine scales predominate; 3=Moderate: coarse scales predominate; 4=Severe: thick tenacious scales predominate. Scaling of skin is the loss of the outer layer of the epidermis in large, scale-like flakes.</description>
