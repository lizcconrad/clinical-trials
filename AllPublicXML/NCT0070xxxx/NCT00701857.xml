      RATIONALE: Pemetrexed may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Cisplatin may make
      tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving pemetrexed together with cisplatin
      and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of pemetrexed when
      given together with cisplatin and radiation therapy in treating patients with stage III or
      stage IV esophageal cancer or gastroesophageal junction cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To establish the maximum tolerated dose of pemetrexed disodium in combination with
           cisplatin and standard-dose radiotherapy in patients with stage III or IV esophageal or
           gastroesophageal junction carcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  To specifically characterize the toxicity profile of this regimen.

        -  To investigate, preliminarily, the anti-tumor activity of this regimen, as measured by
           standard response criteria (RECIST criteria), in patients with measurable disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pemetrexed disodium.

      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 and cisplatin
      IV over 10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. Patients also undergo external beam
      radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for up to 6 weeks.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 30 days and then every 3 months
      for 1 year.
