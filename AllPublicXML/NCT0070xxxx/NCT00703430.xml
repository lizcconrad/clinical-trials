  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), is associated with behavioral disturbances in approximately 50% of
      AD patients in Beijing. Agitation, and aggression specifically, is considered the most
      serious noncognitive symptom experienced in patients with dementia. Memantine is a recognized
      treatment for Alzheimer's disease either alone or in combination with cholinesterase
      inhibitors. Its efficacy in vascular dementia is also established. Family members continue to
      play a central role in home care for the demented elderly in China. This proposal is to
      conduct a study in Beijing, China to investigate the efficacy and safety of Memantine in the
      treatment of agitation and aggression in AD patients. In addition, this proposal aims to
      explore the impact of memantine on caregiver burden of AD patients in Chinese culture.
