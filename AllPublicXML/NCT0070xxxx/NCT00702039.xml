  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple studies in various specialties, including ophthalmology, are reported in the
      literature that show that playing music during a procedure (dubbed music therapy) increases
      patient satisfaction and may reduce patient anxiety and stress levels.

      There is no study in the literature that assesses the effects of listening to music in
      patients undergoing intravitreal injections. This study aims to assess whether listening to
      music improves patient satisfaction or reduces their anxiety levels in subjects undergoing
      intravitreal injections.
