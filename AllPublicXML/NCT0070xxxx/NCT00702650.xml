    <textblock>
      Testosterone replacement treatment is the most effective way of treating hypogonadism in men.
      Acrux has a propriety testosterone replacement product- Testosterone MD-Lotion (cutaneous
      solution), and this study will evaluate the efficacy via pharmacokinetics of various doses of
      this product. The study will also assess safety of the product.

    <description>Participants received Testosterone Metered Dose (MD)-Lotion for 120 days. Participants started by receiving 3.0 mL (60 mg) of 2% Testosterone MD-Lotion, and based upon restoration to eugonadal levels, may have had their dose of testosterone adjusted upwards or downwards on Days 45 and 90.
Doses could be titrated to one of the following:
1.5 mL (30 mg) of 2% Testosterone MD-Lotion applied daily by 1 dose to the axilla (1.5 mL to one axilla).
3.0 mL (60 mg) of 2% Testosterone MD-Lotion applied daily by 2 doses to the axilla (1.5 mL to each axilla).
4.5 mL (90 mg) of 2% Testosterone MD-Lotion applied daily by 3 doses to the axilla (2 x 1.5 mL to one axilla and 1 x 1.5 mL to the other axilla).
6.0 mL (120 mg) of 2% Testosterone MD-Lotion applied daily by 4 doses to the axilla (2 x 1.5 mL to each axilla).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Endpoint in Draize Score</title>
        <description>Draize score is a measurement of skin irritability of the application site based on erythema/eschar and oedema. Erythema/eschar scoring ranges from 0 (no erythema) to 4 (severe erythema [beet redness] to slight eschar formation [injuries in depth]). Oedema scoring ranges from 0 (no oedema) to 4 (severe oedema [raised more than 1 millimeter and extending beyond area of exposure]. The total Draize score ranges from 0 to 8.</description>
