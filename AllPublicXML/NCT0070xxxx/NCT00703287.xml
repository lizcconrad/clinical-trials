  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to establish on a small scale the effectiveness of adding the
      physiotherapy programme developed by Jean-Pierre Bleton to the present standard treatment for
      cervical dystonia with a view to undertaking a larger UK-wide trial looking at overall
      cost-effectiveness. Specifically, the investigators wish to establish:

        1. Whether this specific physiotherapy program for cervical dystonia improves patient
           outcomes in terms of neck position, pain, disability, and quality of life compared to
           simple physiotherapy advice?

        2. What is the minimal clinically important change in the new CDIP-58 quality of life
           measure for cervical dystonia from a patient's perspective that could then be used to
           plan a definitive trial of this technique?

        3. What are the economic implications of the specialized physiotherapy programme?

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All the following inclusion criteria must be met:

          1. Any person over 16 years with primary cervical dystonia causing sufficient
             interference in lifestyle that they wish to consider physiotherapy treatment and who
             is able to give informed consent.

          2. An abnormal neck position (Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale [TWSTR]
             Part 1A &gt; 0).

          3. Patients receiving treatment with botulinum toxin (type A or B) injections (as most
             will) provided they are on a stable botulinum toxin regimen (i.e. same dose and
             injection pattern over the previous two injections). This includes those newly
             diagnosed patients who choose to have botulinum toxin injections OR patients not
             receiving botulinum toxin (either because of patient preference or previous lack of
             effect) provided they plan to remain off botulinum toxin for the one year duration of
             the trial. There will probably be few of these patients but we feel justified in
             including them because there are no other treatments on offer and because it is
             presently unknown whether physiotherapy requires botulinum toxin to weaken the muscles
             in order to have an effect. Anecdotal reports suggest that it can be effective even
             without botulinum toxin. However, the small numbers who are not receiving botulinum
             toxin will be analysed as a separate subgroup initially to check whether their
             response is significantly different to those receiving botulinum toxin.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with any of the following criteria will be excluded:

          1. Secondary cervical dystonia (e.g. acute onset following trauma or secondary to drugs)

          2. A fixed cervical dystonia which may imply a psychogenic component.

          3. Radicular or myelopathic features where cervical manipulation may be dangerous.

          4. Patients known to have fused cervical vertebrae from previous x-rays

          5. Previous use of the Bleton technique.

          6. Deep brain stimulation for cervical dystonia.

          7. Dementia.

          8. Unable to comply with visits for physiotherapy and assessment.
