    <textblock>
      This research study is for individuals who have advanced breast, colon, pancreatic, ovarian
      or bladder cancer. Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. is testing a form of immune therapy (vaccine)
      to see if it can be used to make the immune system attack the cancer. The study includes
      administration of additional treatments, in combination, thought to enhance the immune
      response effect. (CDX 1307-01)

      Protocol CDX1307-01: CDX-1307 is an investigational drug that is being tested to see if it
      can stimulate the immune system (the cells and substances that protect the body from
      infection and foreign matter) of people with certain kinds of cancer. It is believed that the
      body's immune system can attack tumor cells and kill them. It is thought that immune cells
      recognize special proteins on the surface of tumors as a signal to fight the cancer. One of
      these proteins is called human chorionic gonadotropin-beta (hCG-β) and is found on several
      types of cancers including breast, colorectal, pancreatic, bladder and ovarian. The study
      drug will be given as an injection under the skin (an intradermal or intracutaneous
      injection). In addition, the study includes combination with TLR agonists, which are thought
      to stimulate the immune response against tumor cells.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Patients must have read, understood, and provided written informed consent and HIPAA
             authorization after the nature of the study has been fully explained.

          2. Patients must be 18 years of age or older.

          3. Patients with incurable breast, colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian or bladder cancer with
             measurable or evaluable disease.

          4. Patients who have never received prior hCG-β therapy.

          5. Patients for whom therapy with potential survival benefit is available, or
             disease-specific palliation is the goal of therapy, must have received these
             appropriate standard of care therapies and experienced recurrence or progression while
             on that care. If no such therapy is available, patients with progressive disease may
             be enrolled. Patients who have refused standard of care options known to provide
             potential survival benefit or disease specific palliation are not eligible for this
             study.

          6. At least 4 weeks must have elapsed between prior therapy and first dose of the
             vaccine. Prior radiation therapy must be completed at least 4 weeks prior to the first
             vaccine dose. No prior radiopharmaceuticals within 8 weeks prior to the first vaccine
             dose. The patient must have recovered from any clinically significant toxicity
             experienced during prior treatment(s).

          7. Patients on the following medications may be enrolled into the study if the
             medications were initiated 4 weeks or longer prior to screening and if no dosing
             changes are anticipated during the study.

               1. Hormonal therapy including gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRh) agonist,
                  antiandrogens, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), aromatase
                  inhibitors, and progestins.

               2. Bisphosphonates.

          8. Patients must have an ECOG Status of 0 or 1.

          9. Patients must have a life expectancy ≥ 16 weeks.

         10. Male patients who are sexually active must agree to practice an effective form of
             barrier contraception during the course of the study.

         11. Screening laboratory values must meet the following criteria:

               -  Neutrophils ≥1.5 x109/L

               -  Platelets &gt;100 x109/L

               -  Hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL

               -  Creatinine &lt;2 mg/dL

               -  AST &lt;2 X ULN

               -  Bilirubin &lt;2 X ULN unless due to Gilbert's syndrome upper limit of normal.

        Laboratory abnormalities attributed to liver involvement with cancer but outside of the
        normal range will be allowed if they do not exceed the following limits:

          -  AST &lt;4 X ULN

          -  Bilirubin &lt;4 X ULN

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Since treatment with CDX-1307 theoretically may cause permanent sterility, women of
             childbearing potential will be excluded (women who participate in this study must be
             post-menopausal [absence of menses for at least 1 year] and/or surgically incapable of
             bearing children).

          2. Previous administration of hCG-β vaccine or therapy.

          3. Concurrent treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents.

          4. Positive tests for HIV, HBV or HCV.

          5. Patients with an active systemic infection requiring antibiotic treatment or a fever
             over 100°F within 72 hours prior to enrollment.

          6. Generalized dermatologic conditions (such as allergic reactions, infection, edema, or
             scarring) that will not allow easy access for study drug administration or evaluation
             of localized adverse events.

          7. Patients with active central nervous system metastases, unless previously treated and
             asymptomatic for 2 months and not progressive in size or number for 2 months.

          8. History of a second malignancy, except for adequately treated and cured basal or
             squamous cell skin cancer or any other cancer from which the patient has been
             disease-free for ≥ 5 years.

          9. History of anaphylactic reaction following exposure to humanized or human therapeutic
             monoclonal antibodies, or known hypersensitivity to GM-CSF, or yeast derived products.

         10. Patients with any of the following conditions: myocardial infarction within 1 year of
             screening, congestive heart failure (unless LVEF ≥ 50% as determined by MUGA within 30
             days of screening), uncontrolled hypertension (≥ 160 mm Hg/systolic and ≥ 100 mm
             Hg/diastolic), symptomatic or life-threatening arrhythmia persistent on medication at
             screening, or clinically evident chronic lung disease unless lung capacity ≥ 55% or

         11. Any underlying medical condition that in the Principal Investigator's opinion will
             make the administration of study drug hazardous to the patient or would obscure the
             interpretation of adverse events.

         12. Medical condition requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids (must be discontinued
             at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment. The use of inhaled corticosteroids is
             acceptable).
