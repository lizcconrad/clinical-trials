  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catheter associated urinary tract infection is one of the most common types of catheter
      acquired infections and adds greatly to patient morbidity, mortality and medical cost.
      Urinary catheters may readily acquire biofilms when inserted. The longer the catheter remains
      in place, the greater the tendency of these organisms to develop biofilms and result in
      urinary tract infections, which are difficult to treathe UroShield System is intended to
      prevent bacterial biofilm formation by means of the Active NanoShield technology it has
      developed. A number of scientific concepts and principles shown in prior studies have shown
      some promising results in the treatment of biofilm based sequele using ultrasound energy. The
      NanoShield technological basis of the UroShield System has taken these concepts to a level
      where acoustical waves in the ultrasound range can be created by low cost disposable
      actuators which actually create a physical coating on all of the surfaces of the catheter
      thereby interfering with the attachment of bacteria which is the initial step in biofilm
      formation.

      The UroShield™ System is comprised of 2 main components:· The Disposable UroShield Z-Patch -
      a disposable small lightweight patch that is attached to the PCN catheter, while its opposite
      side is attached directly to the patient's skin at the site of catheter entry. The patch has
      twofold function:

        1. it receives energy and a signal from the UroShield Driver allowing it to generate the
           ultrasonic waves;

        2. it acts as a fixation device for the PCN catheter.· The UroShield Driver - an external
           driver unit that is attached to the UroShield patch and contains batteries to power the
           system and electronics that control the patch unit
