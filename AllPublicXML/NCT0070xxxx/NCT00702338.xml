    <textblock>
      The objective of follow-up study P05713 is to evaluate whether corifollitropin alfa (Org
      36286) treatment for the induction of monofollicular growth in women who underwent ovulation
      induction (OI) in base study P05693 (NCT00697255) is safe for pregnant participants and their
      offspring.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Base study P05693 (NCT00697255) was planned to include two separate stages (Ia+Ib and II).

      Stage Ia was open-label and uncontrolled in a small cohort of women (n=5) to explore whether
      the intended dosing regimen of corifollitropin alfa followed by daily low dose recombinant
      Follicle Stimulating Hormone (recFSH) would provide an appropriate response in eligible
      participants meeting all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.

      Stage Ib was open-label and uncontrolled in a small cohort of women (n=3) to explore whether
      the intended dosing regimen of corifollitropin alfa followed by daily low dose Human Chorion
      Gonadotropin (hCG) would provide an appropriate response in eligible participants meeting all
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.

      Stage II was planned to be open-label and randomized (n=40) to evaluate whether the intended
      dosing regimen of corifollitropin alfa followed by low dose recFSH (n=20) or hCG (n=20) would
      provide an appropriate response in eligible participants meeting all inclusion and none of
      the exclusion criteria.

      P05713 is a follow-up (FU) study to prospectively monitor pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal
      outcome of women who became ongoing pregnant during base study P05693 (NCT00697255). For this
      trial, no study specific assessments will be required and no treatment will be administered,
      but information as obtained in standard practice will be used. Enrollment will begin when the
      first ongoing pregnancy resulting from the base study has been established (ultrasound ≥ 10
      weeks after bolus injection of hCG).

          <title>Number of Infants With AEs During Follow-up</title>
          <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>
          <population>Follow-up safety analysis was performed on the fetuses/infants delivered by the one expectant mother who received corifollitropin alfa + hCG on the base study P05693 (NCT00697255) and who enrolled on the follow-up study. There were no other eligible infants to be evaluated for safety.</population>

          <description>Eligible participants in Stage 1b of base study P05693 (NCT00697255) were administered injection(s) with SC corifollitropin alfa (30 mcg) and daily SC injections with hCG (200 IU) when the largest follicle reached a size of ≥12 mm. A bolus injection of hCG (5000 IU) was then administered if at least one follicle was ≥18 mm and in total no more than two follicles ≥15 mm were observed. Eligible mothers in this group with an ongoing pregnancy established in the base study (confirmed at ≥10 weeks after hCG bolus injection) were then followed for safety and efficacy on the current FU study (P05713) according to standard practice (no treatment administered).</description>
