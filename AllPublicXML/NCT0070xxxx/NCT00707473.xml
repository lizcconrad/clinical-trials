      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if docetaxel, 5-fluorouracil, and either
      cisplatin or carboplatin in combination, then followed by chemoradiotherapy is effective in
      controlling cancers of the paranasal sinuses.

      The Study Drugs:

      Docetaxel is designed to stop the growth of cancer cells, which may cause the cells to die.
      It is believed to be weakly effective at killing blood vessels in cancer cells as well.

      Cisplatin has an atom at its center that contains platinum. The platinum is supposed to
      poison the cancer cells, which may cause them to die.

      Carboplatin is designed to interfere with the growth of cancer cells by stopping cell
      division, which may cause the cells to die.

      5-Fluorouracil is designed to destroy cancer cells by preventing them from dividing and
      multiplying .

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive 5-fluorouracil
      through a needle in your vein, non-stop, on Days 1-4 of each 21-day study &quot;cycle&quot;. On Day 1
      only, you will receive docetaxel over 1 hour and cisplatin over 30-180 minutes. You will
      receive 2-3 cycles of therapy.

      If the study doctor thinks that it is in your best interest, you may receive carboplatin in
      place of cisplatin.

      If you are having side effects, the study doctor may schedule you to receive the study drugs
      on a longer cycle.

      Study Visits:

      During Weeks 1-3 of Cycles 1 and 2, you will have study visits during the week that you
      receive chemotherapy treatment. At these visits, the following tests and procedures will be
      performed:

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Your medical history will be recorded, including measurement of your height and weight.

        -  Your doctor will ask about any side effects you may be experiencing.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  Your skin and inside of your mouth will be examined by your doctor.

        -  You will be asked how well you are able to perform the normal activities of daily living
           (performance status evaluation).

        -  You will have a hearing test.

      Once Cycle 2 is completed, you will have the following tests and procedures performed to
      learn if the disease has responded to the therapy:

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  Your medical history will be recorded, including measurement of your height and weight.

        -  You will have a nasal endoscopy.

        -  You will have a CT or MRI scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  Your doctor will ask about any side effects you may be experiencing.

        -  Your performance status will be checked.

        -  The nerve function in your head and neck will be checked by hand.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is necessary, you will have a chest x-ray.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is necessary, you will have bone scans.

        -  If your liver tests were abnormal and your doctor thinks it it is necessary, you will
           have a CT scan of your abdomen.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is necessary, you will have a positron emission tomography
           (PET) or PET-CT.

        -  You will have an eye exam.

      Chemotherapy or Radiotherapy:

      Based on the results of the tests and procedures performed to check to see if the disease has
      responded, your doctor will decide your next treatment.

      If you respond partly or completely, you will receive a 3rd cycle of chemotherapy. You will
      follow the same schedule as you did during the first 2 cycles. Once you complete the 3 cycles
      of chemotherapy, you will begin chemoradiation. Your doctor will discuss this with you in
      more detail and you will receive a separate consent form.

      If the disease does not respond partly or completely, you will have surgery followed by
      radiotherapy. Before surgery, you will be asked to sign a separate informed consent. Risks
      will be discussed with your treating doctor and will depend on the type of surgery. Before
      radiotherapy, you will be asked to sign a separate informed consent that will describe
      possible risks.

      Additional Cycles:

      If the disease responds partly or completely, you will receive an additional (third) cycle of
      therapy. If you have the additional cycle, you will follow the same schedule as you did
      during Cycles 1 and 2. Before you receive the additional cycle, you will have a hearing test.

      Study Visit After Chemoradiation:

      If you receive chemoradiation, after your last chemotherapy treatment you will have the
      following tests and procedures performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  Your medical history will be recorded, including measurement of your height and weight.

        -  The nerve function in your head and neck will be checked by hand.

        -  You will have a nasal endoscopy.

        -  You will have an MRI.

        -  Your doctor will ask about any side effects you may be experiencing.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is necessary, you will also have a CT or positron emission
           tomography (PET)-CT scan.

      Length of Study:

      You will remain on study treatment for 16-20 weeks. You will be taken off study early if the
      disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.

      Follow-up/End-of-Treatment Visits:

      If the disease responded completely while you were on study, you will have follow-up visits
      every 3 months during Years 1-2, every 4 months during Year 3, and every 6 months during
      Years 4-5. If the disease did not respond completely and you are having side effects at the
      end-of-study visit, you will have follow-up visits every 4 weeks until the side effects go
      away. At each visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  Your complete medical history will be recorded, including measurement of your height and
           weight.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  You will have a nasal endoscopy.

        -  The nerve function in your head and neck will be checked.

        -  Your doctor will ask about any side effects you may be experiencing.

        -  Your performance status will be checked.

        -  One (1) time each year, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for a thyroid function
           test.

      If the disease responded completely while you were on study, additional tests and procedures
      will also be performed at 6 months during Year 1, then yearly during Years 1-3. The following
      tests will also be performed:

        -  You will have an eye exam.

        -  You will have a hearing test.

        -  You will have a dental exam.

        -  You will complete a questionnaire that will ask you to rate your symptoms and how much
           they may interfere with your daily activities. This will take about 10 minutes to
           complete.

        -  You will have saliva flow tests.

        -  You will have a CT or MRI scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is necessary, you will have a chest x-ray.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is necessary, you will have bone scans.

        -  If your liver tests were abnormal and your doctor thinks it it is necessary, you will
           have a CT scan of your abdomen.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is necessary, you will have a positron emission tomography
           (PET) or PET-CT.

      Additional information:

      At any time during the study, you will have an MRI if your doctor thinks it is necessary.

      This is an investigational study. Docetaxel is FDA approved for the treatment of certain
      types of breast cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer, and advanced squamous cell carcinoma
      of the head and neck.

      Cisplatin is FDA approved to be used together with other drugs to treat advanced ovarian
      cancer, testicular cancer, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck,
      late-stage cervical cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer.

      Carboplatin is FDA-approved and commercially available for the treatment of ovarian, lung,
      and head and neck cancers.

      5-fluorouracil is FDA approved to be used with other drugs to treat metastatic colorectal
      cancer, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and gastric
      adenocarcinoma.

      The use of these drugs to treat cancer of the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses is
      investigational.

      Up to 45 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have a confirmed (by a MDACC pathologist) cytologic or histological
             diagnosis of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated
             carcinoma, or sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasal cavity and/or
             paranasal sinuses.

          2. 2. Stage II-IV disease; T 2-4, N any, M0. Measurable disease is required with the
             following criteria: Measurable lesions can be accurately measured, with at least one
             diameter &gt;\= 1.0 cm by spiral CT scan or MRI. Lesions can be bidimensionally
             measurable or unidimensionally measurable. Every effort should be made to measure
             lesions in two dimensions. Measurable disease is present if the patient has one or
             more measurable lesions. Non-measurable lesions/disease are all other lesions,
             including small lesions (those with measurements &lt; 2.0 cm; or &lt; 1.0 cm with spiral
             CT).

          3. ECOG PS 0-1.

          4. Age &gt; 16 years.

          5. Patients should have adequate bone marrow function defined as an absolute peripheral

             cells/mm3;

          6. Hepatic Parameters: Total Bilirubin &lt;/= ULN; Alkaline Phosphatase &lt;/= 2 x ULN; AST and
             ALT &lt;/= 2 x ULN If the patient has a history of Gilbert's Syndrome, check direct and
             indirect bilirubin. If in the judgment of the attending medical oncologist it is safe
             to treat the patient, the patient will be considered eligible for this criteria.

          7. Hemoglobin &gt;/= 10.0g/dL

          8. Per MDACC Creatinine clearance guidelines, patients must have a Creatinine clearance &gt;
             50 ml/min determined by 24 hour collection or nomogram: CrCl male = (140 - age) x (wt
             in kg)/serum Cr x 72 CrCl female = 0.85 x (CrCl male)

          9. Patients should have uncontrolled intercurrent illness, which in the opinion of the
             attending medical oncologist, would render the patient unsuitable for the study (i.e.,
             preclude safe administration of the prescribed chemotherapy treatment).

         10. Women Of Child Bearing Potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy

          4. Prior chemotherapy (i.e., as administered strictly for cancer treatment) within the
             previous 3 years. Use of chemotherapy agents for non-cancer treatment purposes (i.e.,
             arthritis treatment, etc.) are excluded from this criterion.

          5. Prior radiotherapy to the paranasal sinus region or the upper neck (i.e., prior
             radiotherapy to another disease site is acceptable).

          6. Initial surgical resection of the paranasal sinuses or nasal cavity region rendering
             the patient clinically and radiologically disease free.

          7. Simultaneous primary invasive cancers or patients currently receiving any other
             investigational agents at time of study enrollment. Patients may have received

             contraception. Note: WOCBP must be using an adequate method of contraception
             throughout the study and for up to 3 months after the study. Adequate methods of
             contraception will include (oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal contraceptive;
             tubal ligation; intra-uterine device; barrier contraceptive with spermicide; or
             vasectomized partner).

         10. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

         11. Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel or other
