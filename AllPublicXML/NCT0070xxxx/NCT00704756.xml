    <textblock>
      This is an observational study of patients undergoing treatment with PegIntron and Rebetol
      for chronic hepatitis C in clinical practice in Belgium. Treatment will not be administered
      as part of the study. Safety parameters will be assessed retrospectively. Efficacy
      parameters, such as relapse rates and sustained virologic response rates, will be assessed
      prospectively. The objective of the study is to examine any associations between safety,
      virologic, histologic, demographic parameters and patient outcome (relapse rates and
      sustained virologic response rates).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female adult (18 years or older) subjects for whom the treating physician has
             decided to start treatment with PegIntron® and Rebetol® and reaching the
             End-of-Treatment time point.

          -  For the prospective component, evidence of treatment response at EOT after a complete
             course of therapy as per SmPC.

          -  Subjects must demonstrate their willingness to participate in the study and comply
             with its procedures by signing a written informed consent.

          -  Subjects must be diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C (genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6).

          -  Subjects must be free of any clinically significant disease that would interfere with
             study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For prospective component of the study: patients not achieving End-of-Treatment
             response after a complete course of therapy as per SmPC.
