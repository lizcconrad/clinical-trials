    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical study is to determine the optimal treatment conditions to achieve
      prostate cancer tumor ablation and to assess the effects of WST11 mediated VTP treatment in
      patients with localized prostate cancer.

      The secondary objectives is to evaluate safety and quality of life ; to assess the
      pharmacokinetic parameters and to model the relationship between concentration and effects;
      and to assess the effects, the safety and quality of life of a second WST11 VTP treatment in
      patients with persistent or recurrent localized prostate cancer after a first VTP;

      This trial is designed as a multicentre, phase II, open-labeled, single intra-venous (IV)
      dose study. The patient is to receive general anesthesia. WST11-mediated VTP will consist of
      the combination of a single IV administration of WST11 at doses of 2 mg/Kg,4mg/Kg or 6 mg/kg,
      using 753 nm laser light at a fixed power (150mW/cm) and energy (200 J/cm) delivered through
      transperineal interstitial optical fibers. If deemed necessary and in consideration of the
      results of the patients treated with 200 J/cm, alternate power (200mW/cm) and alternate
      energy (300 J/cm) might be applied after Sponsor, Steering Committee and DSMB approval.The
      fibers are introduced into transparent needles that are positioned in the prostate under
      ultra sound image guidance (using a brachytherapy like template). The tumor location is
      established using transrectal biopsy and MR imaging. The number of fibers and the total light
      energy will be adapted to each patient, taking into account the tumor localization and the
      volume of the prostate.

             template guided biopsy at 5mm intervals) a secondary pattern 4 is acceptable provided
             that it is not present in more than 3 cores from each side of the prostate and is no
