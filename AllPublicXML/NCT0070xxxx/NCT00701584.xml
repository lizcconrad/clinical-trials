  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diet has been found to influence hormone production and metabolism which in turn could affect
      the incidence of hormone related cancers. Consumption of soy-containing foods, known to be
      rich in phytoestrogens, is thought to be one of the chemoprotective factors against breast
      cancer in Asian populations. Phytoestrogens have a wide range of metabolic effects and may
      have a role in effecting breast cancer risk. Although there is mounting evidence of the
      positive influence of phytoestrogens on breast cancer risk, very little research has been
      carried out in humans as to the effects of phytoestrogens on breast cancer recurrence and
      survival. The DietCompLyf study aims to explore this effect by carrying out an observational
      study in 3,000 breast cancer women in the UK. The effects of diet, lifestyle practices and
      use of complementary treatments will also be investigated. Participants are recruited 9-15
      months post-diagnosis and followed up for 5 years. Questionnaires as well as blood and urine
      samples are collected annually.

      Women matching the eligibility criteria are consented at breast cancer follow-up hospital
      visits. Blood and urine samples are then collected and questionnaires are provided for the
      participants to take away and return within 4 weeks. The process of sample collection and
      questionnaire provision is repeated for visit at years 3 and 5.

      Year 2 and 4 study visit vary in that questionnaires including a 7 day food diary are sent to
      participants at home to be filled in 7 days before their scheduled follow-up appointment. At
      hospital, blood and urine samples are collected as usual.
