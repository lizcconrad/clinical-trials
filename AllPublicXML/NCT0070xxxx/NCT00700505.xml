      To determine the safety and efficacy of the ThermaRx heating device for the application of

      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of ThermaRx heat treatment in subjects who
      have urinary hesitancy.

      The rationale for this approach is based on anecdotal evidence and case reports suggesting
      that urinary hesitancy can be effectively reduced by external skin heating (hot tub &quot;Jacuzzi&quot;
      effect, perineal hot water spray). However, to date, there have been no formal studies of
      this non-invasive form of treatment, and the mechanism of action is still unclear.

      This is a two-day study in which each subject will receive an oral fluid load and then one
      (1) heating treatment with the device. Ultrasound-based measurements of bladder volume will
      be performed both before and after voiding. On Day 1, voiding will be performed in a standing
      position; on Day 2, voiding will be done in a sitting position.
