  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of
      Humalog (insulin lispro) or Humulin-R (recombinant human insulin) when administered as a
      single subcutaneous (SC) injection of 20 units (U) with or without coadministration of
      recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20).

      The study hypothesizes that the time required to reach maximum insulin concentration (tmax)
      when insulin is administered with rHuPH20 will be comparable or shorter than the time
      required without rHuPH20.

    <description>Time to maximum serum insulin concentration (tmax) values for participants who received Humalog or Humulin-R with or without recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20) were measured from 3 milliliter (mL) blood samples obtained during a euglycemic clamp procedure.

    <description>Area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to the time required to reach endogenous plasma glucose levels (AUC[0-t']) for participants who received Humalog or Humulin-R with or without recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20) were measured from 3 milliliter (mL) blood samples obtained during a euglycemic clamp procedure.

    <time_frame>Predose and up to 360 minutes postdose during Stage 1 or Stage 2</time_frame>
    <description>Relative bioavailability was determined by dividing the baseline-corrected geometric mean of the area under the curve (AUC) for insulin (ins) (Humalog or Humulin-R) with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20) by the baseline-corrected geometric mean of the AUC for insulin alone (AUC[insulin+rHuPH20]/AUC[insulin]).
Bioavailability values for participants who received Humalog or Humulin-R and rHuPH20 were measured from blood samples obtained during a euglycemic clamp procedure. Samples were taken 10 and 1 minute (min) prior to treatment, every 3 min from min 0 through 60, every 15 min from min 60 through 180, and every 60 min from min 180 through 360 throughout the clamp procedure.

    <description>Time to early half-maximal effect for glucose infusion rate (tGIR[early50%]) for participants who were randomized to Humalog or Humulin-R with or without recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20) were measured from blood samples obtained during a euglycemic clamp procedure. Samples were taken 10 and 1 minute (min) prior to treatment, every 3 min from min 0 through 60, every 15 min from min 60 through 180, and every 60 min from min 180 through 360 throughout the clamp procedure.

    <measure>Time to Late Half-Maximal Effect for Glucose Infusion Rate (tGIR[late50%])</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose and up to 360 minutes postdose during Stage 1 or Stage 2</time_frame>
    <description>Time to late half-maximal effect for glucose infusion rate (tGIR[late50%]) for participants who received Humalog or Humulin-R with or without recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) were measured from blood samples obtained during a euglycemic clamp procedure. Samples were taken 10 and 1 minute (min) prior to treatment, every 3 min from min 0 through 60, every 15 min from min 60 through 180, and every 60 min from min 180 through 360 throughout the clamp procedure. Means were calculated using analysis of variance with effects of participant, sequence within participant, treatment, and period.
Because the study was only 360 minutes in duration, there was not sufficient time for regular human insulin to show an effect and therefore tGIR(late50%) could not be calculated for participants receiving Humulin-R alone.</description>

        <description>Time to late half-maximal effect for glucose infusion rate (tGIR[late50%]) for participants who received Humalog or Humulin-R with or without recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) were measured from blood samples obtained during a euglycemic clamp procedure.

Means were calculated using analysis of variance with effects of participant, sequence within participant, treatment, and period.
Because the study was only 360 minutes in duration, there was not sufficient time for regular human insulin to show an effect and therefore tGIR(late50%) could not be calculated for participants receiving Humulin-R alone.</description>

          <title>Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve From Time 0 to Time to Reach Maximum Concentration (Tmax) for Serum Insulin With Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20) (AUC[0-tmaxPH20])</title>
          <description>Area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to time to reach maximum concentration (tmax) for serum insulin (Humalog or Humulin-R) with recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) (AUC[0-tmaxPH20]) for participants who received Humalog or Humulin-R and with rHuPH20 were measured from blood samples obtained during a euglycemic clamp procedure. Samples were taken 10 and 1 minute (min) prior to treatment and every 3 min from min 0 through 48 for Stage 1 and, and every 3 min from min 0 through 68 for Stage 2 during the clamp procedure. Means were calculated using analysis of variance with effects of participant, sequence within participant, treatment, and period.</description>

        <description>Relative bioavailability was determined by dividing the baseline-corrected geometric mean of the area under the curve (AUC) for insulin (ins) (Humalog or Humulin-R) with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20) by the baseline-corrected geometric mean of the AUC for insulin alone (AUC[insulin+rHuPH20]/AUC[insulin]).
Bioavailability values for participants who received Humalog or Humulin-R and rHuPH20 were measured from blood samples obtained during a euglycemic clamp procedure. Samples were taken 10 and 1 minute (min) prior to treatment, every 3 min from min 0 through 60, every 15 min from min 60 through 180, and every 60 min from min 180 through 360 throughout the clamp procedure.
