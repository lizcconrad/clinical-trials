  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is one of the most common causes of blindness in the industrialized nations. For a
      long time glaucoma has been defined as a disease in which high intraocular pressure (IOP)
      leads to irreversible optic disc damage and subsequent visual field loss. However, recent
      investigations show that IOP is not the only factor that is involved in the glaucomatous
      process leading to retinal ganglion cell death. The role of vascular factors in the
      pathogenesis of glaucoma has recently received much attention based on animal experiments and
      epidemiological studies. The main focus of glaucoma is still directed towards a decrease in
      IOP. There is, however, also considerable interest whether antiglaucoma drugs influence
      ocular perfusion. Although measurement of ocular blood flow is still difficult, a number of
      innovative techniques have been realized which cover different aspects of ocular perfusion.
      In the present study Xalacom® (latanoprost/timolol) and the fixed combination of Combigan®
      (brimonidine/timolol) will be compared with respect to their IOP lowering efficacy as well as
      their ocular hemodynamic effects.
