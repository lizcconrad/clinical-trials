    <textblock>
      Bazedoxifene (BZA) 20 mg tablet is an investigational medication (not approved by FDA) which
      is being studied for possible prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

      PREMARIN® (conjugated estrogens [CE]) is approved by FDA to treat moderate to severe symptoms
      of menopause (i.e., hot flashes, and/or vulvar and vaginal atrophy) and for the prevention of
      postmenopausal osteoporosis.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution,
      breakdown and elimination in the body) of a single dose of PREMARIN® when administered
      together with multiple doses of bazedoxifene (BZA) to healthy postmenopausal women.

      Information will also be obtained regarding the safety and tolerability of the study
      medications when given together to healthy postmenopausal women.
