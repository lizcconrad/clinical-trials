  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, efficacy and tolerability of using two
      regimens of telaprevir (with and without delayed start) with standard treatment compared to
      standard treatment alone in participants with chronic, genotype 1, hepatitis C.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial with telaprevir in
      patients with chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), genotype 1, infection who failed prior
      treatment with standard treatment. Standard treatment is defined as treatment with Peg-INF
      and RBV. The trial is designed to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 2
      regimens of telaprevir (with and without delayed start) combined with standard treatment
      versus standard treatment alone. The trial will consist of a screening period of
      approximately 4 weeks, a 48-week treatment period, and a 24-week follow-up period. Patients
      will be eligible to enroll in the trial if they (1) had an undetectable HCV Ribonucleic Acid
      (RNA) level at the end of a prior course of standard treatment but did not achieve a response
      (viral relapsers), or (2) never had an undetectable HCV RNA level during or at the end of a
      prior course of standard treatment (non-responders). Approximately 650 patients (350 prior
      relapsers and 300 prior non-responders) will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to one of 3
      treatment groups: Treatment group A will receive telaprevir with standard treatment for 12
      weeks; followed by placebo with standard treatment for 4 weeks; followed by standard
      treatment for 32 weeks. Treatment group B will receive placebo with standard treatment for 4
      weeks; followed by telaprevir with standard treatment for 12 weeks; followed by standard
      treatment for 32 weeks. Treatment group C will receive placebo with standard treatment for 16
      weeks; followed by standard treatment for 32 weeks. In both telaprevir regimens (A and B),
      patients will receive 12 weeks of 750 mg of telaprevir every 8 hours along with 48 weeks of
      standard treatment. Telaprevir or placebo will be given by mouth at a dose of 750 mg every 8
      hours for 16 weeks. Peg-INF will be given as an injection under the skin at a dose of 180 mcg
      once every week for 48 weeks. RBV will be given by mouth at a dose of either 1000 or 1200 mg
      (depending on your body weight) two times per day for 48 weeks.
