    <description>There are 6 questions in the survey, and each question has 5 responses (total score for each question can range from 6 to 13). Responses to the 6 questions were added to yield a total score that ranged from 36 to 78. Scoring is based on a norm-based method. Higher AIS scores indicated more asthma impact and poorer quality of life; mean change from baseline (Visit 3) value to average value recorded at visits during treatment period.</description>

             (ATS) for at least 6 months prior to Visit 2 and be in stable condition.

          -  FEV1, measured ≥6 hours after the last dose of short-acting β2-agonist and at least 48
             hours after LABA, of 45%-85%, inclusive, of predicted normal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has been hospitalized at least once for an asthma related condition during the 6
             months prior to Visit 2, or has required emergency treatment due to an asthma related
             condition more than once in the 3 months prior to Visit 2.

          -  Has required treatment with systemic corticosteroids (eg, oral, parenteral, ocular, or
             rectal) for any reason within the 30 days prior to Visit 2.

          -  Has a respiratory infection or other viral/bacterial illness, or is recovering from
             such an illness at the time of Visit 3 that, in the Investigator's opinion, will

      <pre_assignment_details>10 subjects were excluded from the FAS: 9 who received the incorrect study medication and 1 who was randomized to receive SYMBICORT pMDI, but never received study medication.
Therefore, 153 subjects (from 156 randomized to Symbicort) and 148 (from 155 randomized to Budesonide) were included in the FAS used to present baseline characteristics.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>There are 6 questions in the survey, and each question has 5 responses (total score for each question can range from 6 to 13). Responses to the 6 questions were added to yield a total score that ranged from 36 to 78. Scoring is based on a norm-based method. Higher AIS scores indicated more asthma impact and poorer quality of life; mean change from baseline (Visit 3) value to average value recorded at visits during treatment period.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Last Week of Treatment in Scores on the Asthma Impact Survey (AIS)</title>
          <description>There are 6 questions in the survey, and each question has 5 responses (total score for each question can range from 6 to 13). Responses to the 6 questions were added to yield a total score that ranged from 36 to 78. Scoring is based on a norm-based method. Higher AIS scores indicated more asthma impact and poorer quality of life; mean change from baseline (Visit 3) value to average value recorded at visits during treatment period.</description>
