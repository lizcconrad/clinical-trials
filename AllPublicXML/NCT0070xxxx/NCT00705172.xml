      This study is conducted in Europe. The aim of this observational study is to collect data
      from children with Prader-Willi Syndrome, who have been treated off-label with Norditropin®
      for more than 12 months to seek approval for Norditropin® treatment with Prader-Willi
      Syndrome.
