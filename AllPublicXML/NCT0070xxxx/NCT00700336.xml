  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The phase I part of the study is a dose-finding study of escalating doses of CBP501 combined
      with full-dose cisplatin and pemetrexed in patients with histologically confirmed solid
      malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative
      measures do not exist or are no longer effective or would otherwise be eligible for cisplatin
      and pemetrexed as first-line therapy. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined
      based on DLTs occurring during the first treatment cycle. Pharmacokinetics of the triplet
      combination will be assessed during the phase I part of the trial.

      The phase II part will evaluate full-dose cisplatin and pemetrexed combined with CBP501 (at
      the MTD determined in the phase I part) in previously untreated, unresectable malignant
      pleural mesothelioma patients. Patients will be randomized in a 2 : 1 ratio to pemetrexed,
      cisplatin and CBP501 (Arm A) or to pemetrexed and cisplatin (Arm B); randomization will be
      stratified according to histology and performance status.
