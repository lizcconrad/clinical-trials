      The purpose of this study was to evaluate if an intervention with smoking cessation starting
      during the acute hospitalization period and continuing during the acute postoperative phase
      of 6 weeks would reduce the frequency of overall postoperative complications and wound
      infections in patients with acute musculoskeletal injuries requiring surgical treatment. The
      secondary aims were to study the short and the long term (1 year) abstinence rate, functional
      outcome, health related quality of life as well as costs.

    <textblock>
      Tobacco smoking is a major health problem. The effect of a smoking cessation intervention
      prior to elective orthopedic surgery has been evaluated previously. However, as far as we
      know there are no prospective randomized studies investigating the effect of smoking
      cessation on complication rate in patients with acute musculoskeletal injuries.

    <description>Nurses, specifically trained for smoking cession program, contacted the patients at the orthopedic wards and initiated the intervention (stop smoking) within 1-2 days after acute hospitalization. The intervention included one or two personal meetings and weekly phone contacts during 6 weeks with a trained nurse. A phone number to a non-smoking hotline was provided for all patients. The patients were continuously encouraged not to smoke and free nicotine substitution (NicoretteÂ®) was offered those who needed it. No other drug therapy was used.</description>
