  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic macular edema is a common cause of visual loss among diabetic patients. Studies have
      demonstrated the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the pathogenesis of
      edema.

      This study designed to evaluate the effect of Intravitreal injection of a recombinant
      monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody, Bevacizumab, for treatment of diabetic macular edema.
