  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose is to improve and quicken the microbial diagnosis in severe infections,
      since only one third of the cases are documented by blood cultures and adequate
      anti-infective therapy in the 48 hours reduced mortality and morbidity.

      Our hypothesis is that detection of microbial DNA in blood by real time PCR may increase the
      number of cases diagnosed for bacteraemia or fungemia and shorten the time to positive
      results, which will provide information for an adequate anti-infectious therapy.

      We will evaluate the advantage of adding the molecular test to the microbial investigations
      usually done (blood cultures and others) in cases of febrile neutropenia, suspicion of
      infective endocarditis and severe sepsis in intensive care units.

      This is a prospective study conducted in 18 sites (7 in the Paris area and 11 all over
      France) which will enrolled about 2000 patients over 18 years. Sites are randomized for
      starting with a 6-month period performing the test or 6-month period without the test
      (control time with the standard of care).

      Primary outcome are the number of patients with documented bacteraemia or fungemia. Secondary
      outcome are (1) the number of patients with an adequate anti-infective therapy and how long
      it happens after the diagnosis, (2) mortality, (3) new complicated infection, (4) number of
      investigations (microbial and non microbial) done for the etiological diagnosis, and global
      hospitalization costs.

      The advantage of the new test will be evaluated per protocol and with an intend to treat
      analyses. We hypothesized that the new test will bring 15% more microbial diagnosis than the
      standard of care. Consequently, and according to the number of sites interested in the study,
      166 to 2500 patients will be enrolled with 480 to 750 patients with febrile neutropenia, 1000
      to 1500 patients with severe sepsis in Intensive Care Units (ICU). Patients with suspicion of
      infective endocarditis will be evaluated for the number of diagnosis of true endocarditis
      according to Duke Criteria, and the time to diagnosis.

      Health economic evaluation will compare the costs of hospitalization, microbial
      investigations including the new test, other non clinical investigations and consequences on
      the organization.

    <description>The LightCycler® SeptiFast Test, the innovative real-time PCR test from Roche Diagnostics, is designed to detect and identify the 25 most important bacterial and fungal species causing bloodstream infections within just a few hours. The LightCycler® SeptiFast Test detects the pathogenic bacteria and fungi directly from whole blood without the need for prior incubation or culture steps.
Rapid detection and identification of bacterial and fungal DNA, directly from a 1.5 ml whole blood sample, without prior incubation or culture steps in less than 6 hours.</description>

    <description>A blood culture is a test to find an infection in the blood. Most bacteria can be seen in the culture in 2 to 3 days, but some types can take 10 days or longer to show up. Fungus can take up to 30 days to show up in the culture.</description>
