  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine how quickly HIV-1 is cleared from the blood in
      treatment-experienced patients beginning a salvage therapy regimen that includes the
      integrase inhibitor raltegravir. The hypothesis is that HIV-1 is cleared as rapidly in these
      patients as in treatment-naive patients starting a raltegravir-based regimen.

      This pilot study will closely examine the viral dynamics of both HIV-1 RNA and DNA in
      treatment-experienced subjects initiating raltegravir. The data derived from this study will
      further elucidate the effects of antiviral therapy on viral decay and help refine current
      viral dynamics models. In addition, results of this study will generate hypotheses for
      further testing regarding the mechanisms of action of integrase inhibitor therapy in salvage
      regimens. Lastly, this viral dynamic study on a unique cohort will provide an opportunity to
      further validate the effectiveness of the methods of measuring rate of decrease of viral RNA
      and DNA in piloting potential potent drug regimens.

      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be tested for HIV-1 DNA levels. The cell pellets

      using real-time quantitative PCR and 2) integrated proviral DNA using Alu real-time nested

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-infected patients age 18 years or older requiring treatment with raltegravir in
             order to construct an adequately active antiretroviral regimen.

          -  Availability of at least two other drugs expected to have full activity based on
             genotypic and/or phenotypic drug resistance testing, a co-receptor tropism assay, or
             first use of a drug from a previously unused class of antiretroviral drugs (e.g.,
             first use of enfuvirtide).

          -  Plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt;10,000 copies/mL at screening (within 6 weeks of study entry).

          -  Negative serum or urine pregnancy test at screening and within 48 hours prior to entry
             for women with reproductive potential

          -  Ability and willingness of subject or legal guardian/representative to provide
             informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding.

          -  Previous treatment with any approved or investigational strand-transfer integrase
             inhibitor at any time prior to study entry.

          -  Known allergy/sensitivity or any hypersensitivity to components of study drugs or
             their formulation.

          -  Any subject with an acute AIDS-defining opportunistic infection (OI) who is not
             clinically stable or who has not been on therapy for the OI for at least 30 days prior
             to study entry. Subjects who have no evidence of active disease and are receiving
             maintenance therapy for AIDS-related OIs will be eligible.

          -  Treatment within 30 days prior to study entry with immune modulators such as systemic
             steroids, interleukins, interferons, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF),
             erythropoietin, or any investigational therapy.

        NOTE: Subjects receiving stable physiologic glucocorticoid doses, defined as prednisone ≤
        10 mg/day (or equivalent) as a stable or tapering dose, will be permitted. Subjects
        receiving corticosteroids for acute therapy forPneumocystis jaroveci pneumonia (PCP) or
        asthma exacerbation, or receiving a short course (defined as ≤ 2 weeks of pharmacologic
        glucocorticoid therapy) will not be excluded.

        • Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization until candidate
        either completes therapy or is clinically stable on therapy, in the opinion of the site
        investigator, for at least 7 days prior to study entry.

        illnesses (as judged by the site investigator) have no restriction.

        • Substance abuse that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would interfere with
        adherence to study requirements.who have limited or no treatment options due to extensive
        antiretroviral drug resistance or drug intolerance.
