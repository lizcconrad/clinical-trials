  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the quality of life of patients with advanced cancer
      and their family caregivers and to evaluate two doses of a family-based program of care
      versus control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. determine if family dyads randomly assigned to either a brief or extensive family-based
           program of care have better proximal and distal outcomes from both a clinical and
           economic perspective than dyads randomly assigned to usual care

        2. determine if the brief or extensive program of care has a differential effect on patient
           and caregiver outcomes depending on the patient's baseline risk for distress status
           (high versus low).

      A longitudinal, randomized clinical trial is being used for patients with advanced lung,
      colorectal, prostate, and breast cancer and their caregivers.
