  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, clinical benefits and safety of a
      prophylactic immunomodulatory regimen given prior to first treatment with alglucosidase alfa
      (Myozyme®) in patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease.

      The objectives were to assess the efficacy of a prophylactic immunomodulatory regimen given
      prior to first treatment with alglucosidase alfa, as assessed by anti-recombinant human acid
      alpha-glucosidase (anti-rhGAA) antibody titers, and antibodies that inhibit the activity
      and/or uptake of alglucosidase alfa; to evaluate the clinical benefit as measured by overall
      survival, ventilator-free survival, left ventricular mass index (LVMI), gross motor function
      and development, disability index and the incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse
      events (SAEs), and clinical laboratory abnormalities.

    <measure>Number of Patients With Recombinant Human Acid Alfa-glucosidase (rhGAA) Inhibitory Antibody at End of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study (up to Week 79)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients with positive anti-rhGAA IgG antibody were assessed for the presence of inhibitory antibodies (inhibition of enzyme activity and inhibition of enzyme uptake). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure inhibition of rhGAA enzymatic activity in vitro and a cell-based assay was used to measure the inhibition of the uptake of rhGAA in normal fibroblast cells by flow cytometry.</description>

    <measure>Number of Patients With Normal/Abnormal Left Ventricular Mass (LVM) Z-Score and LVM Index at End of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study (up to Week 79 or early termination)</time_frame>
    <description>LVM Z-score and LVM index were assessed by ECHO. LVM Z-Score provides an indicator of degree of standard deviations from the mean in a normal distribution. Negative values indicate a smaller LVM than mean and values higher than 0 indicate a larger LVM than the mean. The normal range for LVM Z-Score is -2 to 2. Values &lt;-2 or &gt;2 indicate abnormal LVM Z-Score. LVM index is an index value derived by normalizing LVM by body surface area. LVM index provides evidence of cardiomyopathy. LVM index values &lt;65 gram per meter^2 (g/m^2) were considered as normal and LVM index values &gt;=65 g/m^2 were considered as abnormal. End of study refers to the last post baseline observation during study period (up to Week 79).</description>

    <measure>Gross Motor Disability Assessed by Gross Motor Function Measure-88 (GMFM-88) at End of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study (up to Week 79 or early termination)</time_frame>
    <description>GMFM-88 is an 88-item measure to detect gross motor function. It consists of 5 categories: lying and rolling; sitting; crawling and kneeling; standing; walking, running and jumping. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = cannot do; 1 = initiates [&lt;10% of the task]; 2 = partially completes [10% to &lt;100% of the task]; 3 = task completion). The score for each dimension is expressed as a percentage of the maximum score for that dimension. Total score is obtained by adding the percentage scores for each dimension and dividing the sum by the total number of dimensions. Total score ranges from 0% to 100%, where higher scores indicate better motor functions. A total score of &lt;7.5% demonstrates gross motor disability. End of study refers to the last post baseline observation during study period (up to Week 79).</description>

    <measure>Motor Development Status Assessed by Alberta Infantile Motor Scale (AIMS) at End of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study (up to Week 79 or early termination)</time_frame>
    <description>AIMS is a 58-item reliable and valid measure of motor development for infants at risk for motor delay. It assesses infant movement in 4 positions (subscales): prone (reciprocal crawling); supine (moving hands to feet); sitting (sitting with arm support); and standing (pulls to stand). For each subscale, items were scored as &quot;observed&quot; or &quot;not observed&quot;. Item in the observed range create a motor window. When scoring, subscale scores are calculated by giving the child credit (1 point) for observed items within the motor window in addition to being given credit (1 point) for all of the less mature items before motor window. AIMS total score was calculated by summing the scores for 58 items and ranged from 0 to 58, with higher score indicating more mature motor development. Score was then compared with age-equivalent peers from normative sample and equivalence level age (in months) is reported. End of study refers to the last post baseline observation during study period (up to Week 79).</description>

    <measure>Disability Index Assessed by the Pompe Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (Pompe PEDI) at End of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study (up to Week 79 or early termination)</time_frame>
    <description>The Pompe PEDI is a disease specific version of the PEDI that was developed to assess functional capabilities and performance in children with Pompe disease from 2 months through adolescence. It consists of all items of the original PEDI (197 functional skill items in 3 domains: self-care; mobility; and social function) and additional items in the functional skills, mobility, and self-care domains to reflect clinically relevant functional skills for children with Pompe disease. Each domain consisted of 2 subdomains: functional skill performance and caregiver assistance scale. Norm-based scoring was developed for these additional items, and scoring algorithms for the PEDI have been adjusted to reflect additional normative data collected for the Pompe PEDI. Total score range for each domain (mean of subdomains) and subdomain ranges from 0 to 100, where higher score indicates high capability. End of study refers to the last post baseline observation during study period (up to Week 79).</description>

          <description>LVM Z-Score and LVM Index were assessed by echocardiography (ECHO). LVM Z-Score: an indicator of degree of standard deviations from mean in a normal distribution. Negative values indicate a smaller LVM than mean and values higher than 0 indicate a larger LVM than mean. Normal range is -2 to 2; values &lt;-2 or &gt;2 indicate abnormal score. LVM index: an index value derived by normalizing LVM by body surface area. LVM index provides evidence of cardiomyopathy. LVM index values &lt;65 gram per square meter (g/m^2) were considered as normal and LVM index values &gt;=65 g/m^2 were considered as abnormal.</description>

          <description>GMFM-88:an 88-item measure to detect gross motor function; consists of 5 categories: lying and rolling; sitting; crawling and kneeling; standing; walking, running and jumping. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale(0=cannot do; 1=initiates [&lt;10% of the task]; 2=partially completes [10% to &lt;100% of the task]; 3=task completion). Score for each dimension is expressed as a percentage of maximum score for that dimension. Total score=sum of percentage scores for each dimension divided by number of dimensions. Total score range: 0% to 100%, where higher scores indicate better motor functions.</description>

          <description>AIMS:58-item in 4 subscales: prone; supine; sitting; and standing. Each item is scored as observed/not observed. Item in observed range create a motor window. Subscale scores are calculated by giving child 1 point for observed items within motor window in addition to being given 1 point for all less mature items before motor window. AIMS total score=sum of scores for 58 items, range: 0-58,higher score=more mature motor development. Score was then compared with age-equivalent peers from normative sample and equivalence level age (in months) is reported. Here, number of patients analyzed = 3.</description>

        <title>Gross Motor Disability Assessed by Gross Motor Function Measure-88 (GMFM-88) at End of Study</title>
        <description>GMFM-88 is an 88-item measure to detect gross motor function. It consists of 5 categories: lying and rolling; sitting; crawling and kneeling; standing; walking, running and jumping. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = cannot do; 1 = initiates [&lt;10% of the task]; 2 = partially completes [10% to &lt;100% of the task]; 3 = task completion). The score for each dimension is expressed as a percentage of the maximum score for that dimension. Total score is obtained by adding the percentage scores for each dimension and dividing the sum by the total number of dimensions. Total score ranges from 0% to 100%, where higher scores indicate better motor functions. A total score of &lt;7.5% demonstrates gross motor disability. End of study refers to the last post baseline observation during study period (up to Week 79).</description>

        <title>Motor Development Status Assessed by Alberta Infantile Motor Scale (AIMS) at End of Study</title>
        <description>AIMS is a 58-item reliable and valid measure of motor development for infants at risk for motor delay. It assesses infant movement in 4 positions (subscales): prone (reciprocal crawling); supine (moving hands to feet); sitting (sitting with arm support); and standing (pulls to stand). For each subscale, items were scored as &quot;observed&quot; or &quot;not observed&quot;. Item in the observed range create a motor window. When scoring, subscale scores are calculated by giving the child credit (1 point) for observed items within the motor window in addition to being given credit (1 point) for all of the less mature items before motor window. AIMS total score was calculated by summing the scores for 58 items and ranged from 0 to 58, with higher score indicating more mature motor development. Score was then compared with age-equivalent peers from normative sample and equivalence level age (in months) is reported. End of study refers to the last post baseline observation during study period (up to Week 79).</description>

          <title>Motor Development Status Assessed by Alberta Infantile Motor Scale (AIMS) at End of Study</title>
          <description>AIMS is a 58-item reliable and valid measure of motor development for infants at risk for motor delay. It assesses infant movement in 4 positions (subscales): prone (reciprocal crawling); supine (moving hands to feet); sitting (sitting with arm support); and standing (pulls to stand). For each subscale, items were scored as &quot;observed&quot; or &quot;not observed&quot;. Item in the observed range create a motor window. When scoring, subscale scores are calculated by giving the child credit (1 point) for observed items within the motor window in addition to being given credit (1 point) for all of the less mature items before motor window. AIMS total score was calculated by summing the scores for 58 items and ranged from 0 to 58, with higher score indicating more mature motor development. Score was then compared with age-equivalent peers from normative sample and equivalence level age (in months) is reported. End of study refers to the last post baseline observation during study period (up to Week 79).</description>
          <population>FAS population included all enrolled patients who signed informed consent and received at least 1 dose of alglucosidase alfa. Here, numbers of patients analyzed = patients with end of study AIMS assessment.</population>

        <title>Disability Index Assessed by the Pompe Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (Pompe PEDI) at End of Study</title>
        <description>The Pompe PEDI is a disease specific version of the PEDI that was developed to assess functional capabilities and performance in children with Pompe disease from 2 months through adolescence. It consists of all items of the original PEDI (197 functional skill items in 3 domains: self-care; mobility; and social function) and additional items in the functional skills, mobility, and self-care domains to reflect clinically relevant functional skills for children with Pompe disease. Each domain consisted of 2 subdomains: functional skill performance and caregiver assistance scale. Norm-based scoring was developed for these additional items, and scoring algorithms for the PEDI have been adjusted to reflect additional normative data collected for the Pompe PEDI. Total score range for each domain (mean of subdomains) and subdomain ranges from 0 to 100, where higher score indicates high capability. End of study refers to the last post baseline observation during study period (up to Week 79).</description>
