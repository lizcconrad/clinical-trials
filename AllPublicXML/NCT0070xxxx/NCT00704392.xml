  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and highest safe doses of
      XL647 in combination with XL147 in adults with solid tumors. XL647 is a small molecule that
      potently inhibits multiple receptor kinases, including EGFR, VEGFR2 (KDR), and ErbB2. XL147
      is a new chemical entity that inhibits PI3 Kinase. Inactivation of PI3K has been shown to
      inhibit growth and induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in tumor cells.

          -  The subject has adequate organ and marrow function.

          -  The subject has a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) &lt; 120 mg/dL at screening.

          -  The subject is capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and has signed
             the informed consent document.

          -  Sexually active subjects (male and female) must agree to use accepted methods of

             protocol drug(s).

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at
             screening.

          -  Subjects in the MTD Expansion Cohort:

               -  Must have measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
                  (RECIST).

               -  Must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC (Stage IIIB or IV) OR a
