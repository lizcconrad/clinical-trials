  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify genetic determinants of susceptibility to liver
      cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. It will assist in predicting individual risks of
      disease progression and would help to clarify pathophysiologic mechanisms of liver cirrhosis
      and hepatocellular carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) usually occurs in cirrhotic liver. Only 10-30% of HCC occur in
      non-cirrhotic liver. It has been suggested that etiological factors may differ for HCC which
      develop in cirrhotic liver: HCC in non-cirrhotic liver might be less often associated with
      viral infection and chronic alcoholism than HCC in cirrhotic livers. However, in any
      individual, the factors that determine HCC with or without cirrhosis remain unknown.

      Cirrhosis is the end of fibrosis progression. The progress of liver fibrosis is a complex
      progress involving many cytokines related to activation of the hepatic stellate cells and
      progressive accumulation of extracellular matrix. The key enzymes responsible for deposition
      and degradation of all the protein component of extracellular matrix and basement membrane
      are matrix metalloproteinases.

      To assess whether genetic variations in cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases result in
      diversity of liver cirrhosis and HCC, we conduct a case-control study of single nucleotide
      polymorphism analysis.
