      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one
      drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known which
      combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying the side effects of two combination
      chemotherapy regimens and to see how well they work in treating children with newly diagnosed
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the incidence of marrow suppression with 2 methods of maintenance treatment in
           children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

        -  Compare the incidence of liver toxicity with 2 methods of maintenance treatment in these
           patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine any difference in infection rates and related hospitalizations in these
           patients.
