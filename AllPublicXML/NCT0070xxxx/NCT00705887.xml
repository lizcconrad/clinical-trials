      The specific aims of this research are:

      Aim 1 - To describe the UV protection behaviors and beliefs of young adult patients in a
      dermatology clinic.

      Aim 2 - To examine whether or not the UV protection behaviors and beliefs of young adult
      dermatology patients are associated with age, gender, level of education, marital status,
      contact with skin cancer, time outdoors, skin type, the reason for their visit, and the date
      of data collection.

      Aim 3 - To test the efficacy of a motivational enhancement approach to UV protection
      counseling for young adult dermatology patients, as manifested by favorable changes in UV
      protection stages of change, UV protection self-efficacy, and UV protection attitudes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States, it is highly
      preventable by reducing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. However, recent primary
      prevention efforts have been inadequate in evoking behavior change, as manifested by
      increasing rates of ultraviolet radiation exposure, particularly among young adults. These
      findings indicate the need to research novel approaches to skin cancer prevention.

      Motivational enhancement techniques facilitate patient-centered, directive discussions
      wherein practitioners provide clear structure and encourage patients to play an active role
      in the consultation. The use of motivational enhancement techniques for health behavior
      change in medical settings has thus far yielded encouraging results for other health behavior
      change topics, but research has not yet investigated the application of these techniques to
      skin cancer prevention discussions.
