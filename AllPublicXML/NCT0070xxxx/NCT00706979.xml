  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A sample of smokers who have no current plans to quit will be recruited for this study and
      randomized to one of two intervention conditions:

        1. Practice Quit Attempt (PQA) aided by brief advice and self-help materials, or

        2. PQA aided by advice and self-help materials plus nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).

      This study will test whether adding free nicotine replacement therapy to brief advice to
      undertake a practice quit attempt will motivate more smokers to make a serious attempt to
      stop smoking than brief advice without NRT. All treatments and assessments will be delivered
      via telephone and mailing. The primary outcome of interest is the incidence of a serious
      attempt to permanently stop smoking made over a six-month study period.

      Our specific hypotheses are as follows:

      Hypothesis 1: Helping smokers to make a practice quit attempt aided by NRT will result in a
      higher incidence of making a serious effort to quit smoking permanently, compared to an aided
      practice quit attempt without NRT. We also expect provision of NRT will increase point
      prevalence abstinence at 6 month follow-up.

      Hypothesis 2: This relationship between NRT-aided practice quit attempts and quit behaviors
      will be mediated by a) increased smoking related self efficacy, b) increased belief in the
      efficacy of NRT, c) fewer concerns about adverse events of NRT, d) increased social support
      for not smoking, and e) less withdrawal distress and craving during the practice quit
      attempt.
