      The purpose of this program is to determine the frequency of the use of Posaconazole in
      immunocompromised patients refractory to first line therapy receiving therapeutic treatment
      based on different pathogens in comparison to other antifungal therapy.

      A further objective is to determine the frequency of the use of Posaconazole in
      immunocompromised patients receiving prophylactic treatment in comparison to other antifungal
      prophylaxis.
