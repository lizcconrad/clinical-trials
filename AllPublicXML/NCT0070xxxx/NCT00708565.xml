  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if single dose administration of inhaled iloprost
      will reduce pulmonary artery pressure, reduce hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and improve
      arterial oxygenation at rest and during exercise at high altitude.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three major pathways in addition to oxygen modulate pulmonary vascular tone: 1) nitric oxide,
      2) endothelin, and 3) prostacyclin. Considerable animal data support the role of the
      prostacyclin pathway in modulating hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. In humans,
      prostacyclin and its analogs are important therapeutic agents in the treatment of pulmonary
      arterial hypertension (PAH). Despite the animal data and human data in PAH there is very
      little information about the use of iloprost to relieve hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in
      healthy humans. Inhaled iloprost is an ideal agent to study the prostacyclin pathway due to
      its short duration of action (30-90 min) and elimination half-life of only 20-30 min.
      Individuals already participating in the Nepal Medex 2008 trip will be invited to participate
      in this research. Participants will be healthy active females or males, between 18-80 years
      of age, without known pregnancy or liver disease, who have a readily measurable tricuspid
      regurgitant velocity by Doppler echocardiography. If possible, we will attempt to identify a
      cohort of HAPE susceptible patients. Participants will undergo evaluation both at sea level
      (baseline) and at high altitude. Baseline (low altitude) testing will be performed in Bangor,
      North Wales, UK, and will include evaluation of pulmonary artery systolic pressures, cardiac
      output, and oxygen saturation at rest and during submaximal exercise before and after
      inhalation of iloprost. This strategy will then be repeated at an altitude of approximately
      5000 meters in the Dhaulagiri region of Nepal.
