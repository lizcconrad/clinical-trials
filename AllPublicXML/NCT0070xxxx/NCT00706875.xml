  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect information on the effects of treatment for
      gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). We plan to use the findings from this study to
      better understand GTD survivors' health and quality of life.

      We would like to know more about the health, quality of life and pregnancies of women treated
      for GTD. This information will be used to try and improve the treatments for women who have
      this disease.
