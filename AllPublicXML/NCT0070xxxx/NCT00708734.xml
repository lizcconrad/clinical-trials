      This is a one year pilot study evaluating the feasibility of a 10 week, twice weekly, group
      functional exercise sessions in individuals with knee osteoarthritis and its effect on gait
      and balance measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Impaired gait and balance (referred to as impaired postural stability) is one of the most
      significant causes and consequences of falls. Persons with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee
      represent one of the largest patient populations with impaired postural stability.
      Specifically, knee OA has been shown to reduce walking speed, shorten stride length and
      prolong the stance phase of the gait cycle. Patients with knee OA also have less range of
      motion of the hip, knee and ankle joints. Functional Exercise Training (FET) has been shown
      to improve gait and balance, and decrease falls and associated fall-related injuries in the
      general elderly populations. While traditional exercise programs have not been well-tolerated
      in persons with knee OA (due to pain), we are interested in whether a tailored FET
      intervention would be effective in this patient population. Immediate Objectives: O1:
      Characterize the etiology and mechanisms of postural instability in persons with knee OA; O2:
      Refine the clinical protocol for FET in veterans with knee OA; O3: Refine the sampling plan;
      O4: Refine the data collection protocol. This 1-year feasibility study uses a prospective
      cohort design, including data collection at baseline and three points post intervention (10
      weeks {end of intervention}, 15 weeks, and 20 weeks). Subjects with knee osteoarthritis are
      enrolled. Inclusion Criteria: Age 60 and older; Corrected vision not worse than 20/50;
      Ability to ambulate household distances without an assistive device - minimum functional
      status for ambulation as primary mode of mobility; presence of knee OA based on clinical and
      radiological criteria. Sample size: 36 subjects. Intervention: Participants attend FET class
      twice weekly for 10 weeks. Our primary outcome is a composite measures of postural stability
      (gait and balance) and OA symptoms/physical disability. Secondary outcome measures include
      fall self-efficacy and quality of life. We also collect case histories on postural
      instability and falls as well as data on key mediating variables, including level of
      participation (dose of intervention), body mass index (BMI), analgesic use, tolerance of
      intervention, and number of joints affected by OA. Measurement tools: Balance is measured
      with Sensory Organization Test and Limits of Stability test using Neurocom Smart Balance
      Master and Berg Balance Test; Gait is measured with multiple kinetic and kinematic variables
      using VICON 3-D Motion Analysis System; OA symptoms/physical disability are measured using
      Western Ontario and McMaster University Arthritis Index (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index; Fall
      self-efficacy by Modified Fall Self Efficacy Scale; and Quality of life by Short Form 36v
      (SF-36v).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 50 and older.

          -  Corrected vision not worse than 20/50.

          -  Ability to ambulate household distances without an assistive device - minimum
             functional status for ambulation as primary mode of mobility.

          -  Presence of knee OA based on clinical and radiological criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cognitive impairment with Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) score &lt;24; Scores at or below
             24 indicate cognitive impairments, limiting ability to participate in the group and/or
             remember instructions.

          -  Metastatic cancer, since this limits ability to fully participate in the group and/or
             complete the intervention due to limited life expectancy and changing functional
             status.

          -  Central or peripheral neurological dysfunction e.g. diagnosis of hemiparesis,
             cerebellar dysfunction, Parkinson's disease , peripheral neuropathy with or without
             foot drop, as determined by medical record review and physical exam; Severe Peripheral
             Vascular Disease with claudication or Spinal Stenosis with pseudoclaudication/chronic
             low back pain; These impairments would further impair gait and balance, and would
             jeopardize safety during the intervention and/or confound the effect of the
             intervention.

          -  Lower extremity amputations, or foot deformities; Mobility limitations due to altered
             lower extremity skin integrity/ulcer, where weight-bearing would be contraindicated
             (foot ulcers), since this would affect gait and balance measures.

          -  Use of medications known to impair balance, e.g. antipsychotics, benzodiazepines,
             anti-epileptics, etc. which would affect gait and balance measures.

          -  Severe arthritis limiting basic activities of daily living (ADL) and were offered or
             are pending joint replacement, since it is unlikely that any non-pharmacological
             intervention would be effective.

          -  Total knee replacement on one or both sides, since gait and balance changes due to
             total knee replacement would confound the effect of interventions.

          -  Current involvement in physical therapy, since it would confound results.

          -  Medically unstable upon exam, i.e. poorly controlled blood pressure or blood sugar,
             unstable coronary artery disease, since group participation may compromise medical
             status.

          -  Morbid obesity (BMI&gt;40) due to potential changes in gait variables (speed, cadence,
             stride length).

          -  Weight over 300 pounds (due to limitations of Neurocom force plate).

functional exercise training: twice weekly group sessions for 10 weeks This one year feasibility study had a planned sample of 35 subjects. Of the 94 subjects that were screened, 45 did not meet criteria, and 39 declined participation after screening. Of the ten subjects enrolled, three completed the intervention and follow up sessions. The remaining seven were unable to continue participation after enrollment due to a number or reasons including vertigo, moving out of state, total knee replacement after baseline, unable to contact, scheduling conflicts, and a fall with fracture, precluding weight-bearing exercise.</description>
