  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic neurobehavioural disorder often
      diagnosed in childhood years. Complementary/alternative treatments including natural health
      products (NHPs) are used by children with ADHD despite limited information on their safety or
      usefulness. Some evidence suggests children with ADHD have a greater need for zinc,
      magnesium, vitamin B6 and vitamin C. This study will supplement a small number of children
      diagnosed with ADHD with therapeutic levels of these nutrients over 10 weeks to get a better
      understanding of the safety and possible benefit of using these nutrients to treat symptoms
      associated with ADHD.

      The is an open-label study. Children diagnosed with ADHD will be provided with a weight-based
      dose of a chewable natural health product containing zinc, magnesium, vitamin B6 and vitamin
      C for 10 weeks with an additional follow-up post intervention at 20 weeks. Severity of ADHD
      symptoms will be measured at baseline, week 5 and week 10 using the Connor-3 Parent and
      SNAP-IV validated questionnaires. Nutritional status will be monitored at baseline and week
      10 for changes in serum zinc and erythrocyte magnesium. Children will be monitored for any
      adverse reactions that may occur using the investigational product.Following the informed
      consent process, participants will undergo a structured psychiatric interview prior to
      enrollment and will have 4 30 minute study visits and 2 10 minute telephone calls throughout
      the study. Blood samples will be taken 2 times with the use of a topical anesthetic to
      decrease sensation during the blood draw. Once enrolled, children can withdraw from the study
      at any time if assent to participate is withdrawn.

             Version) will be conducted to confirm diagnosis of ADHD and assess for comorbid mental
             health disorders.

          -  Primary caregiver (parent or guardian) has given informed consent; child participant
             gives ongoing assent throughout the study.
