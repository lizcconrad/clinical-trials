  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) is a cancer that starts at the back of the nose. Without distant
      spread, NPC is sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy; however, if NPC relapses or
      spreads to other organs, treatment options are limited. This grant proposes to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of a novel treatment for patients with NPC that has either relapsed
      or spread to distant organs. Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is known to play a role in the
      development of NPC, and studies have shown that NPC tumor cells express proteins that are
      related to EBV. Some of these proteins can trigger a response from the immune system,
      specifically the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), a type of immune cell that
      might exert anti-tumor effects. In this project, we will take blood from NPC patients,
      generate CTLs targeted against EBV, and re-infuse these back into patients in an attempt to
      achieve anti-tumor activity. Patients will also receive an antibody called CD45 Mab prior to
      CTL infusion in order to allow for better expansion of the infused CTLs in the patients.

      Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) is a cancer that starts at the back of the nose. Without distant
      spread, NPC is sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, the treatment of this
      cancer can lead to later complications, including other cancers, and if NPC relapses or
      spreads to other organs, the treatment options are limited. This grant proposes to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of a novel treatment for patients with NPC that has either
      relapsed or spread to distant organs.

      Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is known to play a role in the development of NPC in individuals,
      especially those with a compromised immune system. Studies have shown that NPC tumor cells
      express proteins that are related to EBV. Some of these proteins can trigger a response from
      the immune system, specifically the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), a type of
      immune cell that might exert anti-tumor effects. In this project, we will take blood from NPC
      patients, generate CTLs targeted against EBV, and re-infuse these back into patients in an
      attempt to achieve anti-tumor activity. Patients will also receive an antibody called CD45
      Mab prior to CTL infusion in order to allow for better expansion of the infused CTLs in the
      patients.

    <description>A dose escalation schema will be employed. Three to six patients will be treated at each of the following dose levels with EBV-Specific CTLs and CD45 Mab: Dose Level I: 2 x 10^7 cells/m2. Dose Level II: 5 x 10^7 cells/m2. Dose Level III: 1 x 10^8 cells/m2. Dose escalation decisions will be made after review of the data from the current dose level. There will be no intra-patient escalation. An additional 6-10 patients with measurable disease will be treated at the recommended phase II dose to expand the experience at this dose level.</description>

          -  Any patient with EBV positive NPC, with recurrent and/or metastatic disease

          -  Patients with a life expectancy &gt; 3 months.

          -  Due to unknown effects of this therapy on a fetus, pregnant women are excluded from
             this research. Lactating women are excluded from this study. Patients and their
             partners must use an effective birth control method during the study and for 6 months
             after. Effective birth control methods are: total abstinence, oral contraceptives,
             intrauterine devices, contraceptive implants under the skin or contraceptive
             injections. If one of these methods cannot be used, contraceptive foam with a condom
             is allowed. The male partner should use a condom.
