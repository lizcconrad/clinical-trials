  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic beta-adrenoceptor blockade is known to improve outcome of high risk patients whereas
      amelioration of autonomic activity was demonstrated to be a major cause of outcome
      improvement. Therefore, perioperative beta-adrenoceptor blockade is recommended in patients
      with Revised Cardiac Risk Index score of three or greater. The investigators hypothesise that
      preoperative intravenous beta-adrenoceptor blockade for treatment of hypertension and/or
      tachycardia improves autonomic activity reflected by increase of Total Power of Heart Rate
      Variability.

      Material and Methods: After IRB approval 20 patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery
      were included into the study. Routine medication was continued throughout the study as
      recommended by the guidelines. HRV (TP and Low to High Frequency ratio (LF/HF) reflecting
      sympathetic to parasympathetic balance) was analysed prior to induction of general anesthesia
      and beta-adrenoceptor blockade in all patients (Baseline). Patients were assigned by their
      baseline hemodynamics. Patients with hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt; 140mmHg or
      diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90mmHg) or tachycardia (heart rate &gt; 80bpm) were assigned to group
      BETA-BLOCK. In this group metoprolol-boli (2mg) were administered intravenously in stepwise
      manner until hemodynamic values decreased to normal. Total dosage was recorded. After
      normalisation of hemodynamics, second HRV analysis was performed (Intervention). Normotensive
      and normocardic patients were assigned to group CONTROL. No intervention was performed.
      Statistics: Mann Whitney U test for comparison between groups and between events Baseline and
      Intervention within group BETA-BLOCK, p&lt;0.05.
