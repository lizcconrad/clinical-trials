  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer cells make proteins called antigens that act as markers for the tumor cells. These
      antigens cannot cause the cancer itself. Special white blood cells, called T cells or T
      lymphocytes, recognize and respond to antigens. In many diseases, these and other cells in
      the immune system help your body get rid of the disease. However, T cells are normally
      resting, and they need other proteins on the diseased cell surface to begin working.
      Unfortunately, cancer cells do not usually make all the other proteins that T cells need to
      work. Therefore, T cells do not normally work against the cancer cells. We think this is one
      of the reasons that cancers grow and are not rejected by the body in the first place.

      Another white blood cell, called a dendritic cell, does have most if not all of the special
      proteins needed to make T cells work to destroy cancer cells. However, dendritic cells do not
      normally have the cancer proteins on their surface. The challenge then is to combine the
      cancer markers (antigens) with these dendritic cells to make a vaccine. We think that the
      body's T cells might then react against the tumor and help destroy it. This study will see if
      putting tumor antigens made in a lab onto dendritic cells will make T cells work against
      tumor cells. We want to answer this question by injecting you with dendritic cells loaded
      with the antigens. Then we will check for a response based on lab studies and your own
      clinical course. We will compare your response against melanoma with your response against a
      common antigen, to which almost everyone has already been exposed. Flu, for example, is a
      common antigen to which most people have been exposed. We also need to test your response to
      an antigen that your body has not likely seen before. For example, we plan to use KLH
      (keyhole limpet hemocyanin), which is a pigment or color protein made from a sea creature
      known as a keyhole limpet. Each of these, the flu and KLH antigens, which should be harmless
      to you, will be used along with the dendritic cell-tumor vaccine. This will help us find out
      if the vaccine is working, based on the lab studies we will check before and after the
      vaccinations.

    <description>The vaccine will be split between as many as 10 injections, more or less. Each shot will be about 1/25th to 1/50th of a teaspoon (100 to 200 microliters). Each vaccine will be injected with a tiny needle just under your skin. This will usually cause a very small area of swelling at the injection site that may last for a few minutes to an hour or so. You will receive two additional &quot;booster&quot; doses of the same vaccine every 4-6 weeks. This would mean that you receive a total of three vaccines over about 2-3 months.
The vaccines will be given during an outpatient visit. If for some reason, you happen to be in the hospital, you can still receive the vaccines. These visits should take no longer than 15-30 minutes.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of metastatic melanoma, AJCC stage III or IV, with histologic confirmation
             by Dept. of Pathology at MSKCC.

          -  Patients must be HLA-A*0201 positive.

          -  Expected survival of greater than 3 months.

          -  Karnofsky performance status 70 or better.

          -  Patients may not have received chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation within
             approximately 4 weeks (approximately 6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin) before
             participation in this protocol.

          -  Patients should not be receiving immune modifying pharmacologics (e.g., interferon)
             for approximately 2-4 weeks before enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant (clinically documented or positive pregnancy test within approximately 2 wks
             of study entry) or lactating women, because immunization will include differentiation
             antigens shared by melanoma tumors and melanocytes, and immune responses to these
             differentiation antigens could have unknown developmental sequelae to a fetus or
             infant.

        Pregnancy tests are not required for post-menopausal women, and post-menopausal status by
        patient report should be documented accordingly.

          -  Patients requiring systemic corticosteroids or comparable exogenous immunosuppressive
             agent(s) (no exclusion for use of NSAIDs)

          -  Patients who have a known immunodeficiency (e.g., infection with HTLV-1,2, HIV-1,2;
             etc.) because of the T cell defects that would alter their responses and the
             investigators' ability to assess their outcomes accurately.

          -  Patients with preexisting retinal or choroidal eye disease.

          -  Patients with coexisting autoimmune diseases, except vitiligo.

          -  Patients with significantly impaired hematologic, hepatic, or renal function, e.g.,
             ANC &lt;1000, hgb &lt; 8.0 g/dl, plts &lt; 50,000/ul, AST &gt;3x ULN, creatinine &gt;2.0 or Cl creat
             &lt;30ml/min, all assessed within approximately two weeks of study entry.

          -  Patients with serious coexisting medical illness.

          -  Patients with organ allografts.

          -  Patients who are s/p splenectomy or s/p splenic irradiation.

          -  Patients with active brain metastases.

          -  Patients with organic brain syndrome or psychologic impairment that would preclude
             participation and compliance with this protocol.
