        <title>Percentage of Body Surface Area (BSA) Affected by Psoriasis</title>
        <description>Percentage of body surface area affected by psoriasis was estimated using the palm method: one of the participantâs palm to proximal interphalangeal and thumb = 1% of total BSA. Regions of the body were assigned specific number of palms with percentage [Head and neck = 10% (10 palms), upper extremities = 20% (20 palms), Trunk (axillae and groin) = 30% (30 palms), lower extremities (buttocks) = 40% (40 palms)]. The total BSA affected was the summation of individual regions affected. The results of this outcome measure was summarized separately for participants without drug-free interval, participants with drug-free interval and remaining participants, as per planned analysis.</description>

            <description>Participants who had moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and commenced treatment with etanercept (Enbrel) as a systemic monotherapy for the first time, received Enbrel in cycles of 24 weeks duration separated by drug-free intervals based on treating physicianâs discretion as per Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). Treatment was resumed if plaque psoriasis worsened. According to SmPC, recommended dose included etanercept 25 mg twice weekly, 50 mg once weekly or 50 mg twice weekly subcutaneous injection. Participants were observed for 60 months. This group included participants who never experienced a drug-free interval during the entire observational period.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (extreme problems). Score of each domain is transformed into a single TTO value using formula developed by Greiner et al and results in a total score range -0.205 to 0.999; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

        <title>Average Cost of Treatment by Disease Severity</title>
        <description>Average costs for treatment with etanercept up to 5 years was calculated in Euros. Disease severity was categorized as mild (0 to 10 PASI score), moderate (10.1 to 20 PASI score) and severe (20.1 to 72 PASI score) at each year. PASI: Combined assessment of lesion severity and area affected into single score. Body was divided into 4 sections: head, arms, trunk, legs. For each section, percent area of skin involved was estimated: 0= 0% to 6= 90â100%. Severity was estimated by clinical signs: erythema, induration, desquamation; scale: 0= none to 4= maximum. Final PASI = sum of severity parameters for each section*area score*weight of section (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2, body: 0.3, legs: 0.4); total possible score range: 0= no disease to 72= maximal disease.

        <description>Effect of drug free interval on DLQI was determined by comparing the scores of the sub group &quot;Participants Without Drug-Free Interval&quot; to that of the sub group &quot;Participants With Drug-Free Interval&quot;. DLQI is the dermatology-specific quality of life measure used for psoriatic population. The 10-item questionnaire has a score range of 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating poor quality of life. An estimate of the minimal clinically important difference of the DLQI total score is a 5 point improvement. Total score range: 0 (best) to 30 (worst).</description>

          <description>Effect of drug free interval on DLQI was determined by comparing the scores of the sub group &quot;Participants Without Drug-Free Interval&quot; to that of the sub group &quot;Participants With Drug-Free Interval&quot;. DLQI is the dermatology-specific quality of life measure used for psoriatic population. The 10-item questionnaire has a score range of 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating poor quality of life. An estimate of the minimal clinically important difference of the DLQI total score is a 5 point improvement. Total score range: 0 (best) to 30 (worst).</description>

EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (extreme problems). Score of each domain is transformed into a single TTO value using formula developed by Greiner et al and results in a total score range -0.205 to 0.999; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

          <title>Participant Perception of Drug-Free Interval: Reason for Returning to Practice</title>
          <description>A questionnaire was filled in by participants to evaluate their perception of drug-free interval before the start of every drug-free interval (after Cycle 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and after every drug-free interval (before Cycle 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). After the drug-free interval participants were asked, âWhy did you return to the practice today?â Responses included unscheduled visit due to new occurrence of disease, scheduled visit or other reasons (included reasons like treatment of adverse event, get a prescription or examination after external treatment). Results are reported for reasons for returning to the practice.</description>

          <title>Participant Perception of Drug-Free Interval: Duration</title>
          <description>A questionnaire was filled in by participants to evaluate their perception of drug-free interval before the start of every drug-free interval (after Cycle 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and after every drug-free interval (before Cycle 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). After the drug-free interval participants were asked, âHow would you assess the length of the current drug-free interval?â Participants responded on a scale of 1 (too long) to 5 (too short). Results are reported for participantâs perception of the duration of drug-free interval.</description>

        <title>Participant Perception of Drug-Free Interval: Disease Activity</title>
        <description>A questionnaire was filled in by participants to evaluate their perception of drug-free interval before the start of every drug-free interval (after Cycle 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and after every drug-free interval (before Cycle 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). After the drug-free interval participants were asked, âHow would you assess the activity of your disease during the first half of the drug-free interval?â and âHow would you assess the activity of your disease during the second half of the drug-free interval?â Participants responded on a scale of 1 (no activity) to 5 (strongest possible activity). Results are reported for participantâs perception of disease activity during the first half and second half of drug-free interval.</description>

            <description>Participants who had moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and commenced treatment with etanercept (Enbrel) as a systemic monotherapy for the first time, received Enbrel in cycles of 24 weeks duration separated by drug-free intervals based on treating physicianâs discretion as per Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). Treatment was resumed if plaque psoriasis worsened. According to SmPC, recommended dose included etanercept 25 milligram (mg) twice weekly, 50 mg once weekly or 50 mg twice weekly subcutaneous injection.

        <description>A questionnaire was filled in by participants to evaluate their perception of drug-free interval before the start of every drug-free interval (after Cycle 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and after every drug-free interval (before Cycle 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Before and after the drug-free interval participants were asked to respond on a scale of 1 (no agreement) to 5 (complete agreement) to the statement, âA drug-free interval reduces the risk for adverse drug reactions.â Results are reported for participantâs perception of risk of adverse drug reactions.</description>

          <title>Participant Perception of Drug-Free Interval: Recommendation of Therapy</title>
          <description>A questionnaire was filled in by participants to evaluate their perception of drug-free interval before the start of every drug-free interval (after Cycle 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and after every drug-free interval (before Cycle 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Before and after the drug-free interval participants were asked, âWould you recommend therapy with Enbrel to other patients with plaque-psoriasis?â Participants responded as yes or no to the question. Results are reported for participantâs likeliness to recommend therapy.</description>
