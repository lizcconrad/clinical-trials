  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a longitudinal follow-up of 670 primarily African-American women and their
      17-year-old firstborn children enrolled since 1990 in a highly significant randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) of prenatal and infancy home visiting by nurses. Nurses in this
      program are charged with improving pregnancy outcomes, child health and development, and
      maternal economic self-sufficiency. This follow-up examines whether earlier program effects
      on maternal and child functioning lead to less violent antisocial behavior, psychopathology,
      substance use and use-disorders, and risk for HIV; whether these effects are greater for
      those at both genetic and environmental risk; and whether program effects replicate those
      found with whites in an earlier trial.

        The Memphis trial was designed to test the effects of the program with a large sample of
        very low-income African-Americans living in a major urban area, when the program was
        administered through a local health department, and the program developers had limited
        involvement in its implementation. In this trial, 1,139 low-income pregnant women (98%
        unmarried, 67% &lt;19 years old, 92% African-American) were randomly assigned to experimental
        or comparison services; 743 were followed after delivery. The sample has resided in
        extraordinarily stressful neighborhoods and has endured extreme poverty. At registration,
        the mean level of neighborhood disorganization (assessed by census tract data at the block
        group and using the Lauritsen scale) was 3.43 SD above the national mean, i.e., the average
        level of adversity in the sample neighborhoods was among the worst in the nation (in the
        top 1000th). 85% of the sample had incomes below the federal poverty guidelines.
