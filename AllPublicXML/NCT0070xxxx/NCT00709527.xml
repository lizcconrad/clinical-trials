      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic
      profile of multiple doses of ARC1905 intravitreous injection when administered in combination
      with multiple doses of Lucentis速 0.5 mg/eye, or with one induction dose of Lucentis 0.5
      mg/eye in subjects with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization secondary to age-related
      macular degeneration (AMD).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to AMD (i.e., predominately classic,
             minimally classic or occult no classic) as documented by fluorescein angiogram.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous or concomitant therapy with intravitreous corticosteroids.

          -  Any of the following underlying diseases including:

          -  Diabetic retinopathy

          -  History or evidence of severe cardiac disease (e.g., NYHA Functional Class III or IV),
             history or clinical evidence of unstable angina, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial
             infarction or revascularization within last 6 months, ventricular tachyarrythmias
             requiring ongoing treatment.

          -  History or evidence of clinically significant peripheral vascular disease, such as
             intermittent claudication or prior amputation.

          -  Clinically significant impaired renal (serum creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dl or s/p renal
             transplant or receiving dialysis) or hepatic function. Patients with results outside
             these ranges may be enrolled in consultation with Ophthotech.

          -  Stroke (within 12 months of trial entry).

          -  Any major surgical procedure within one month of trial entry.

          -  Previous therapeutic radiation in the region of the study eye.

          -  Any treatment with an investigational agent in the past 60 days for any condition.

          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing.

          -  Known serious allergies to the fluorescein dye used in angiography, to the components
             of the ranibizumab formulation, or to the components of the ARC1905 formulation.
