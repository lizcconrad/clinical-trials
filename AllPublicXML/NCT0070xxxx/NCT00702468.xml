    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the maintenance of effect after long-term treatment
      with Sativex® in subjects with symptoms of spasticity due to Multiple Sclerosis (MS) who have
      been receiving long-term benefit from treatment with Sativex®.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This five week (one week baseline and four weeks randomised treatment period), multi-centre,
      placebo controlled, parallel group, randomized withdrawal study will evaluate the maintenance
      of effect after long-term treatment with Sativex® in subjects with symptoms of spasticity due
      to MS who have been receiving long-term benefit from treatment with Sativex®. Subjects will
      be selected from the Supply of Unlicensed Sativex® (SUS) or named patient supply programmes
      and must have been receiving Sativex® for at least 12 weeks prior to study entry. Following
      informed consent and screening, eligible subjects will enter the study (Visit 1, Day 1) and
      commence a seven day open label baseline period, before returning for a randomisation visit
      (Visit 2, Day 7), at which point they are randomised to receive either Sativex® or placebo
      (randomised withdrawal period). Subjects will return to the centre for an end of study visit
      at week five (Visit 3, Day 35) or earlier if they withdraw from treatment. Spasticity and
      sleep disruption review and dosing diaries will be completed each day from the start of the
      baseline period until completion or withdrawal.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Who Experience Treatment Failure.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1- Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>The time to treatment failure was calculated as the number of days from the first day of treatment up to the day of treatment failure. The day of treatment failure was the earliest of:the day of premature cessation of study medication;the first day of the longest period, ending on the last day of treatment, where the mean spasticity NRS had increased by at least 20% and at least 1 unit from the treatment baseline; the day of a clinically relevant increase in anti-spasticity or disease modifying medication. The number of subjects who failed treatment were calculated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mean Daily Spasticity Severity as Measured on a Spasticity Severity 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1) to Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Spasticity NRS was completed daily by answering the following question:
&quot;On a scale of '0 to 10' please indicate the average level of your spasticity over the last 24 hours&quot; with the anchors: 0 = 'no spasticity' and 10 = 'worst possible spasticity'. The change in mean spasticity severity NRS from baseline to end of study (last seven days)was calculated. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement in spasticity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Modified Ashworth Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Ashworth Scale was completed at baseline and at the end of treatment at approximately the same time of day. All 20 muscle groups were assessed for spasticity (using a 0=no increase in muscle tone to 4 scale=affected part rigid in flexion or extensions), to result in a total score out of 80. The higher the score the worse the spasticity is.
The change from baseline to end of study was assessed. The higher the score the better</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Motricity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2 and Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>The Motricity Index involves assessing three movements in both the arms and the legs. In the arm the three movements are; pinch grip, elbow flexion and shoulder abduction and the three leg movements are, ankle dorsiflexion, knee extension and hip flexion. The total arm/leg score is then the addition of the score for the three arm/leg movements. One point is then added to each limb score so that the maximum score is 100 points. The higher the score the better the limb movement.</description>

    <measure>Timed 10-metre Walk.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2 and Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>The time taken to travel 10 metres.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Daily Sleep Disruption NRS</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1- Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked: &quot;On a scale of 0-10 please indicate how your spasticity disrupted your sleep last night&quot; with the anchors 0 = 'did not disrupt sleep', 10 = 'completely disrupted (unable to sleep at all)'.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Global Impressions of Change.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>At baseline subjects will write a brief description of their spasticity caused by MS and how it affects them emotionally, physically and their ability to function with day to day activities. This will be used to aid their memory before they answer the following question which is rated on a seven-point scale.
&quot;Please assess the change in your spasticity due to MS since immediately before receiving the first course of study treatment (Baseline) using the scale below&quot; The markers are: Very much worse, Much worse, Minimally worse, No change, Minimally better, Much better, Very much better.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Carer Global Impressions of Change for Functional Ability</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>The main carer will be asked to assess the change in the subject's condition at the end of the study (completion or withdrawal). It consists of 2 question which is rated on a seven-point scale: Very much worse, Much worse, Minimally worse, No change, Minimally better, Much better, Very much better. The carer will be asked since visit 2 (baseline):
&quot;How has the subject's general functional abilities changed?&quot; &quot;How has the subject's ease of transfer?&quot; Not all subjects had carers; a total of 18 subjects from each treatment, of which 10 from Sativex and 14 from placebo completed it.</description>

All 20 muscle groups were assessed for spasticity (using a 0=no increase in muscle tone to 4 scale=affected part rigid in flexion or extensions), to result in a total score out of 80. The higher the score the worse the spasticity is.

        <description>The Motricity Index involves assessing three movements in both the arms and the legs. In the arm the three movements are; pinch grip, elbow flexion and shoulder abduction and the three leg movements are, ankle dorsiflexion, knee extension and hip flexion. The total arm/leg score is then the addition of the score for the three arm/leg movements. One point is then added to each limb score so that the maximum score is 100 points. The higher the score the better the limb movement.</description>

          <title>Change in Motricity Index</title>
          <description>The Motricity Index involves assessing three movements in both the arms and the legs. In the arm the three movements are; pinch grip, elbow flexion and shoulder abduction and the three leg movements are, ankle dorsiflexion, knee extension and hip flexion. The total arm/leg score is then the addition of the score for the three arm/leg movements. One point is then added to each limb score so that the maximum score is 100 points. The higher the score the better the limb movement.</description>

        <description>The main carer will be asked to assess the change in the subject’s condition at the end of the study (completion or withdrawal). It consists of 2 question which is rated on a seven-point scale: Very much worse, Much worse, Minimally worse, No change, Minimally better, Much better, Very much better. The carer will be asked since visit 2 (baseline):
How has the subject’s general functional abilities changed?”
How has the subject’s ease of transfer?” Not all subjects had carers; a total of 18 subjects from each treatment, of which 10 from Sativex and 14 from placebo completed it.</description>
