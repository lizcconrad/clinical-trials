  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine the feasibility of the Y-90 plaque
      applicator. The Y-90 plaque application is designed to deliver high doses of radiation to
      tumors in the spine that involve dura (the tough outer layer of the spinal cord). Tumors in
      the spine need a high dose of radiation to kill cancer cells. The nearby spinal cord is a
      sensitive area which does not safely tolerate high doses of radiation. The Y-90 plaque
      applicator is a special technique used to deliver the radiation dose to the tumor cells and
      avoid the spinal cord.

      -  The surgeon will remove the participants tumor from the outer layer of the spinal cord
           (dura). The Y-90 applicator and a &quot;dummy&quot; applicator will be brought to the surgery
           table in a protected container. A &quot;dummy&quot; applicator is the same size and shape as the
           Y-90 plaque applicator but does not contain radioactive plaque. The &quot;dummy&quot; applicator
           will be placed on the participants dura to make sure it fits properly, then it will be
           removed. The working Y-90 applicator will be placed on the dura for 10-17 1/2 minutes
           and then be removed.

        -  External beam irradiation is a type of high-energy radiation used to kill cancer cells
           and shrink tumors. This radiation will be given to the participant only if they have not
           had it prior to the study.

        -  After the treatment, participants will be asked to return for a follow-up visit 6 weeks,
           3 months, every 6 months thereafter for 4 years, then annually to year 10. At these
           visits, they will have the following: physical examination; recent medical history; MRI
           or CT scan (twice each year) and; chest x-ray or chest CT (twice each year).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathological diagnosis of malignant tumor involving spine with extraosseous extension
             or arising in paraspinal soft tissues with tumor involving or abutting the dura.
             Patients with a limited metastatic disease and tumor involving the spine or paraspinal
             soft tissues and who are judged to benefit from surgery will also be eligible.

          -  No clinical, radiographic or other evidence of distant metastatic tumor

          -  Fit for receiving the planned radiation dose to the affected site. No known genetic
             disease or medical condition associated with an abnormal radiation sensitivity.
