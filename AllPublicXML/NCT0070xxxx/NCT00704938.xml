      RATIONALE: Gene-modified lymphocytes may stimulate the immune system in different ways and
      stop tumor cells from growing. High-dose aldesleukin may stimulate lymphocytes to kill tumor
      cells. Vaccines made from a gene modified virus and a person's dendritic cells may help the
      body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Giving gene-modified lymphocytes
      together with high-dose aldesleukin and vaccine therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving gene-modified lymphocytes together
      with high-dose aldesleukin and vaccine therapy works in treating patients with progressive or
      recurrent metastatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine if the administration of anti-p53 T-cell receptor (TCR) gene-engineered
           peripheral blood lymphocytes, high-dose aldesleukin, and adenovirus p53 dendritic cell
           (DC) vaccine after a nonmyeloablative, but lymphoid-depleting, preparative regimen will
           result in clinical tumor regression in patients with metastatic cancer that
           overexpresses p53.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the in vivo survival of T-cell receptor (TCR) gene-engineered cells.

        -  Determine the ability of a dendritic cell (DC) vaccine to restimulate TCR
           gene-engineered cells in vivo.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to type of metastatic cancer (melanoma or renal
      cell cancer vs all other cancers).

        -  Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) collection: Patients undergo PBMC collection
           via leukapheresis for the generation of the adenovirus p53 dendritic cell vaccine as
           well as anti-p53 T-cell receptor (TCR) gene-engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes.

        -  Nonmyeloablative lymphocyte-depleting preparative regimen: Patients receive
           cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days -7 and -6 and fludarabine
           phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -5 to -1.

        -  Peripheral blood lymphocyte infusion: Patients receive anti-p53 TCR gene-engineered
           peripheral blood lymphocytes IV over 20-30 minutes on day 0. Patients receive filgrastim
           (growth colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)) subcutaneously (SC) once daily beginning on
           day 1 or 2 and continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  High-dose aldesleukin: Patients receive high-dose aldesleukin IV over 15 minutes three
           times daily on days 0-4 for up to 15 doses.

        -  Dendritic cell vaccine: Patients receive adenovirus p53 dendritic cell vaccine SC on
           days 0, 7, 14, and 28.

      Patients may receive one re-treatment course as above (nonmyeloablative preparative regimen,
      peripheral blood lymphocyte infusion, high-dose aldesleukin, and dendritic cell vaccinations)
      beginning 6-8 weeks after the last dose of high-dose aldesleukin.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 15 years.
