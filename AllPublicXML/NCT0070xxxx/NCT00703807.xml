  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer is the most common malignancy of the female reproductive tract. The
      majority of patients with endometrial cancer are diagnosed at an early stage and cured with
      surgery with or without adjuvant radiotherapy. However, a significant number of patients
      present with metastatic disease outside of the pelvis or develop recurrent disease after
      primary therapy.

      mTOR inhibitors have been shown to be promising agents in reducing tumor growth in vitro and
      in vivo, in several solid cancers. Inhibitors of mTOR are primarily cytostatic in cancer
      cells; combination therapy with cytotoxic chemotherapeutics and other biologic agents may
      prove to be the most advantageous use of these drugs. mTOR inhibition with a rapamycin
      analogue demonstrated in vitro antiproliferative activity on endometrial AN3 CA and HEC-1-A
      tumor cells, and this inhibition of proliferation was found to be concentration dependent.
      Topotecan is an active agent in the treatment of advanced and recurrent endometrial cancers.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically-confirmed advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer

          -  Patients must be refractory to standard therapy or for which no curative standard
             therapy exists, to be considered. Metastatic disease, if present, should not be
             progressing so as to require palliative treatment within 4 weeks of enrollment based
             on clinical assessment by the investigator.

          -  Development of new lesions or an increase in preexisting lesions on bone scintigraphy,
             CT, MRI or by physical examination. Patients in whom the sole criterion for
             progression is an increase in a biochemical marker, e.g., carcinoembryonic antigen
             (CEA), or an increase in symptoms, are not eligible.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  WHO performance status ≤ 2

          -  Adequate bone marrow function as shown by: ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L,
             Hb &gt;9 g/dL

          -  Adequate liver function as shown by:

          -  serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN

          -  INR &lt; 1.3 (or &lt; 3 on anticoagulants)

          -  ALT and AST ≤ 2.5x ULN (≤ 5x ULN in patients with liver metastases)

          -  Adequate renal function: serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x mg/dL

          -  Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fasting triglycerides ≤ 2.5 x
             ULN. NOTE: In case one or both of these thresholds are exceeded, the patient can only
             be included after initiation of appropriate lipid lowering medication.

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

             therapies within 4 weeks of the start of study drug (including chemotherapy, radiation
             therapy, antibody based therapy, etc.)

          -  Patients, who have had a major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks
             of start of study drug, patients who have not recovered from the side effects of any

             stable dosage regimen for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to the first treatment with
             RAD001. Topical or inhaled corticosteroids are allowed.

          -  Patients should not receive immunization with attenuated live vaccines within one week
             of study entry or during study period

          -  Uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases, including patients who continue to
             require glucocorticoids for brain or leptomeningeal metastases

          -  Other malignancies within the past 3 years except for adequately treated carcinoma of
             the cervix or basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin.
