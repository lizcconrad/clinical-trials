  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a pilot, phase I, two-period, fasting, bioavailability, safety,and pharmacokinetic
      study evaluating single dose of i.v. fentanyl (200 µg) and single doses of 2 mL or 3 mL
      inhaled AeroLEF (500 µg/mL) delivered by nebulization with the AeroEclipse BAN device
      administered in normal healthy non-smoking subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Period I, subjects received an intravenous dose of fentanyl (200 µg) administered over 1
      minute (Treatment A). Subjects then crossed over to Period II.

      In Period II, subjects were randomly assigned to receive either 2 mL (1000 µg fentanyl;
      Treatment B) or 3mL (1500 µg fentanyl; Treatment C) of AeroLEF delivered by nebulization with
      the AeroEclipse BAN. Subjects were instructed to continue inhalation of AeroLEF for
      approximately 1 minute beyond the point of nebulizer sputter to ensure that all aerosolized
      medication was delivered. There was at least a 1 week washout period between study periods.
