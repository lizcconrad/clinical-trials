          -  No prior systemic therapy for advanced NSCLC, prior therapy for early stage disease
             with one regimen is acceptable if it was completed at least 6 months prior to study
             entry.

          -  Palliative radiotherapy to painful bony metastases will be permitted prior to study
             entry if completed prior to initiation of study treatment, and there are no residual
             sequelae of therapy such as bone marrow suppression.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

             at least 6 months prior to study entry.

             radiological evaluation is mandatory).

          -  Prior treatment with bevacizumab or erlotinib.

          -  Minor surgical procedures, fine needle aspirations or core biopsies within 7 days
             prior to start.

          -  History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess
             within 6 months prior to start.
