          -  Patients have a history of stable body weight (not varying by &gt;2 kg in the 3 months
             prior to Visit 1).

          -  Medications for the treatment of high blood pressure are stable with respect to
             treatment regimen for 4 weeks prior to Visit 1.

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The dropout rate in the study was higher than anticipated (of 80 patients randomized, only 53 completed Study Period II), and enrollment was much slower than anticipated, leading to a decision to terminate the study early for enrollment futility.</limitations_and_caveats>
