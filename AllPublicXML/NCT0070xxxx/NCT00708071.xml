    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fibrin sealant
      with 4 IU/mL thrombin, vapor heated, solvent detergent treated (FS VH S/D 4) when used to
      reduce early postoperative bruising in participants undergoing a rhytidectomy (face-lift).

    <description>Differences are calculated as (Grade for SoC) - (Grade for FS VH S/D 4). Participants used a 10-point visual analogue scale to complete a pain assessment for each side of their face during each postoperative study visit (Days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14). The higher the number, the greater the pain experienced, i.e. 10 = worst, 1 = least.
The planned and approved SAP specified a pre-aggregation of the data whereby differences between the two sides of the face were computed first within participants to retain the inherent correlation (pairings) in the measures. Summary statistics and statistical tests were then computed on the differences between the two sides of the face using paired sample tests.</description>

    <description>Each subject received fibrin sealant with 4 IU/mL thrombin, vapor heated, solvent detergent treated containing synthetic aprotinin (FS VH S/D 4 ) to one side of the face. The dosing volume to be applied is 0.02 mL/cm2 to 0.04 mL/cm2. The study product will be applied to the subcutaneous plane in both the neck and the face area. The product will be applied using the spray device provided by the sponsor. (The other side of the face will be treated using standard of care.)</description>

        <title>Difference in Marchac Grades Using A Modified Marchac Scale (MMS) of Ecchymosis Between Two Sides of Face Assessed by 5 Independent, Blinded Reviewers- Day 1</title>
        <description>Reviewers used photographs from postoperative Day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14. Differences are calculated as (SoC Grade) - (FS VH S/D 4 Grade). MMS for Post Rhytidectomy (Facelift) Ecchymosis: Grade 0= No bruising; Grade 1= Barely perceivable (easily hidden with makeup, yellowish color and affects limited area); Grade 2= Present, minimal (yellow color and covers ≤25% of operated area); Grade 3= Moderate (yellow color and covers &gt;25% of operated area, red color, blue color but covers a very small area); Grade 4= Extensive (blue color and covers more than just a very small area, dark purple color)
The planned and approved Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) specified a pre-aggregation of the data whereby differences between the two sides of the face were computed first within participants to retain the inherent correlation (pairings) in the measures. Summary statistics and statistical tests were then computed on the differences between the two sides of the face using paired sample tests.</description>

        <title>Difference in Marchac Grades Using A Modified Marchac Scale (MMS) of Ecchymosis Between Two Sides of Face Assessed by 5 Independent, Blinded Reviewers- Day 14</title>
        <description>Reviewers used photographs from postoperative Day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14. Differences are calculated as (SoC Grade) - (FS VH S/D 4 Grade). MMS for Post Rhytidectomy (Facelift) Ecchymosis: Grade 0= No bruising; Grade 1= Barely perceivable (easily hidden with makeup, yellowish color and affects limited area); Grade 2= Present, minimal (yellow color and covers ≤25% of operated area); Grade 3= Moderate (yellow color and covers &gt;25% of operated area, red color, blue color but covers a very small area); Grade 4= Extensive (blue color and covers more than just a very small area, dark purple color)
The planned and approved SAP specified a pre-aggregation of the data whereby differences between the two sides of the face were computed first within participants to retain the inherent correlation (pairings) in the measures. Summary statistics and statistical tests were then computed on the differences between the two sides of the face using paired sample tests.</description>

        <title>Difference in Marchac Grades of Edema Between Two Sides of Face Assessed by Investigator Day 10</title>
        <description>Investigators used the modified Marchac grading to evaluate edema during participant examinations on postoperative Day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14. The evaluations were performed on both sides of the face. Differences are calculated as Grade for Standard of Care - Grade for FS VH S/D 4. Marchac Scale for Post Rhytidectomy (Facelift) Edema: Grade 1= Nil; Grade 2= Minor; Grade 3= Moderate; Grade 4= Marked/unusual amount.
The planned and approved SAP specified a pre-aggregation of the data whereby differences between the two sides of the face were computed first within participants to retain the inherent correlation (pairings) in the measures. Summary statistics and statistical tests were then computed on the differences between the two sides of the face using paired sample tests.</description>

        <title>Difference in Marchac Grades Using A Modified Marchac Scale (MMS) of Ecchymosis Between Two Sides of Face Assessed by Investigator- Day 7</title>
        <description>Investigators used MMS during examinations- postoperative Day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14. Differences are calculated as (SoC Grade) - (FS VH S/D 4 Grade). MMS for Post Rhytidectomy (Facelift) Ecchymosis: Grade 0= No bruising; Grade 1= Barely perceivable (easily hidden with makeup, yellowish color &amp; affects limited area); Grade 2= Present, minimal (yellow color &amp; covers ≤25% of operated area); Grade 3= Moderate (yellow color &amp; covers &gt;25% of operated area, red color, blue color but covers a very small area); Grade 4= Extensive (blue color &amp; covers more than just very small area, dark purple color)
The planned and approved SAP specified a pre-aggregation of the data whereby differences between the two sides of the face were computed first within participants to retain the inherent correlation (pairings) in the measures. Summary statistics and statistical tests were then computed on the differences between the two sides of the face using paired sample tests.</description>

        <title>Differences in Subjects' Assessments of Pain for Each Side of Face (SoC and FS VH S/D 4)</title>
        <description>Differences are calculated as (Grade for SoC) - (Grade for FS VH S/D 4). Participants used a 10-point visual analogue scale to complete a pain assessment for each side of their face during each postoperative study visit (Days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14). The higher the number, the greater the pain experienced, i.e. 10 = worst, 1 = least.
The planned and approved SAP specified a pre-aggregation of the data whereby differences between the two sides of the face were computed first within participants to retain the inherent correlation (pairings) in the measures. Summary statistics and statistical tests were then computed on the differences between the two sides of the face using paired sample tests.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>Baxter’s agreements with PIs may vary per requirements of the individual PI, but contain common elements. For this study, PIs are restricted from independently publishing results until the earlier of the primary multicenter publication or 1 year after study completion. Baxter requires a review of results communications (e.g., for confidential information) ≥90 days prior to submission or communication. Baxter may request an additional delay of ≤60 days (e.g., for intellectual property protection)</restrictive_agreement>
