    <textblock>
      This is a 15 week trial to determine (1) the safety and tolerability of varenicline when used
      for smoking cessation/reduction in individuals with schizophrenia; (2) if treatment with
      varenicline affects the symptoms of schizophrenia.

      Researchers are looking to recruit a total of 50 subjects at Riverview and Forensic
      Psychiatric Hospitals who would like to reduce or quit smoking cigarettes. This open label
      pilot study will gather information regarding the safety and tolerability of varenicline in
      subjects who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Consenting
      subjects will be prescribed varenicline as follows: varenicline 0.5 mg/d for days 1 to 3, 0.5
      mg twice daily for days 4 to 7, then 1 mg twice daily through week 12. The research team will
      meet with the subject once a week for twelve weeks and the subject will be interviewed and
      asked to complete questionnaires about his/her psychiatric symptoms, tobacco use and nicotine
      dependence. The measures used include the FTND, PANSS, CGI-I, CGI-S, ESRS, UKU, BARS, WSWS,
      QSU-brief, mCEQ, and the OAS-M. The CGI-SS will also be completed throughout the study as
      well as once weekly for three weeks following the completion of the study (Post-Study
      follow-up visits 1-3).
