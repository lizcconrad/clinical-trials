      This is a follow-up protocol to collect the outcome of frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycles,
      performed after the embryos are cryopreserved up to at least 1 year in Trial P05787
      (NCT00696800), to enable estimation of the cumulative pregnancy rate for each treatment
      group.

    <time_frame>Up to 1 year after embryo transfer in base trial P05787 (NCT00696800), and FTET cycles in follow up trial</time_frame>
    <description>An ongoing pregnancy is the presence of at least one fetus with heart activity at least 10 weeks after embryo transfer or confirmed by live birth.The cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate is 100 times the number of participants with an ongoing pregnancy either immediately after embryo transfer in base Trial P05787 (NCT00696800), or after one or more FTET cycles in follow-up Trial P05716 following cryopreservation, divided by the total number of participants that started treatment in base Trial P05787 (NCT00696800). Participants who did not have cryopreserved embryos, or embryo transfers in the FTET cycle(s), were considered 'not pregnant'.</description>

    <time_frame>After one or more FTET cycles, up to day of miscarriage (up to 1 year)</time_frame>

    <time_frame>After one or more FTET cycles, assessed at least 10 weeks after embryo transfer (up to 1 year)</time_frame>

Daily SC injections of Ganirelix were given from Day 5 to the day of hCG; at which time a single dose of hCG was given when 3 follicles &gt;= 17 mm. On the day of oocyte pick up (OPU) daily doses of progesterone were started, for up to 6 weeks or menses. Eligible participants from the base study were enrolled in follow up study P05716, where no study treatments were given, and embryos obtained in the base study underwent FTET cycles.</description>
