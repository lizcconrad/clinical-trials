    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Muscle Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The change in Medical Research Council (MRC) score was determined at week 24 compared to baseline using descriptive statistics and nonparametric, two-sided 95% confidence intervals based on the Hodges-Lehmann method. Data for one of the eight subjects was from week 13 as week 24 data were not available.
The 200-point MRC sum score is the sum of scores for 20 bilateral (left and right side) muscle groups, each rated between 0 (no movement) to 5 (normal movement/power). A higher MRC sum score indicates greater muscle contraction/limb movement. Positive values for change in MRC sum score indicate improvement, with a more positive value indicating greater muscle contraction/ limb movement compared with the value at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The change in disability score was determined at week 24 compared to baseline using descriptive statistics and nonparametric two-sided 95% confidence intervals based on the Hodges-Lehmann method. Data for one of the eight subjects was from week 13 as week 24 data were not available.
Disability was measured using a modified Guy's Neurological Disability Scale, which comprises subscales for upper and lower limb disability. Both subscales comprise 6 grades, numbered from 0 (no upper limb problem/walking is not affected) to 5 (unable to use either arm for any purposeful movements/usually uses a wheelchair indoors). The disability score is calculated as the sum of both subscales, resulting in a score ranging from 0 to 10. A higher disability score indicates greater disability. Negative values for change in disability score indicate improvement, with a more negative value indicating greater improvement compared with the value at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to the Completion Visit in Motor Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to the completion visit (up to week 25)</time_frame>
    <description>The change in motor function was determined at the completion visit compared to baseline using descriptive statistics and nonparametric two-sided 95% confidence intervals based on the Hodges-Lehmann method.
For each patient, four specific tasks were defined according to his/her weakened muscle group. The patient had to grade each of the tasks on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (normal function) to 4 (not possible). The overall motor function score was calculated as the sum of the 4 grades, resulting in a score ranging from 0 (optimal) to 16 (worst). The baseline motor function score was calculated as the mean of the patient's assessments at Screening and Week 1. Negative values for change in motor function score indicate improvement, with a more negative value indicating greater improvement compared with the value at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Health-Related Quality of Life at Baseline and Week 25</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and week 25</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using a questionnaire on patients' satisfaction with current immunoglobulin G (IgG) treatment, treatment at home, and treatment at the hospital/doctor's office. The questions were answered by choosing a number between 1 (extremely good) and 7 (extremely bad).
Note: No patients received IgG treatment at the hospital/doctor's office at Week 25.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction at Baseline and Week 25</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and week 25</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment satisfaction was assessed using the Life Quality Index, which comprises 15 items rated on a 7-point scale (1 = worst rating, 7 = best rating) with a possible maximum score of 105. The highest score indicates the highest satisfaction with the impact of treatment on social factors. The 15 items were summarized to 4 scales: treatment interference, therapy-related problems, therapy setting, and treatment costs. The raw scores for these scales were transformed to a score ranging from 0 to 100, with 100 being the best score achievable.</description>

    <measure>Overall Health Status at Baseline and Week 25</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 25</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Health Status was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Patients were asked to rate their overall health status by placing a mark on a 100 mm VAS, with 0 being the worst imaginable state and 100 being the best imaginable state.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Muscle Strength</title>
        <description>The change in Medical Research Council (MRC) score was determined at week 24 compared to baseline using descriptive statistics and nonparametric, two-sided 95% confidence intervals based on the Hodges-Lehmann method. Data for one of the eight subjects was from week 13 as week 24 data were not available.
The 200-point MRC sum score is the sum of scores for 20 bilateral (left and right side) muscle groups, each rated between 0 (no movement) to 5 (normal movement/power). A higher MRC sum score indicates greater muscle contraction/limb movement. Positive values for change in MRC sum score indicate improvement, with a more positive value indicating greater muscle contraction/ limb movement compared with the value at baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Disability</title>
        <description>The change in disability score was determined at week 24 compared to baseline using descriptive statistics and nonparametric two-sided 95% confidence intervals based on the Hodges-Lehmann method. Data for one of the eight subjects was from week 13 as week 24 data were not available.
Disability was measured using a modified Guy’s Neurological Disability Scale, which comprises subscales for upper and lower limb disability. Both subscales comprise 6 grades, numbered from 0 (no upper limb problem/walking is not affected) to 5 (unable to use either arm for any purposeful movements/usually uses a wheelchair indoors). The disability score is calculated as the sum of both subscales, resulting in a score ranging from 0 to 10. A higher disability score indicates greater disability. Negative values for change in disability score indicate improvement, with a more negative value indicating greater improvement compared with the value at baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to the Completion Visit in Motor Function</title>
        <description>The change in motor function was determined at the completion visit compared to baseline using descriptive statistics and nonparametric two-sided 95% confidence intervals based on the Hodges-Lehmann method.
For each patient, four specific tasks were defined according to his/her weakened muscle group. The patient had to grade each of the tasks on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (normal function) to 4 (not possible). The overall motor function score was calculated as the sum of the 4 grades, resulting in a score ranging from 0 (optimal) to 16 (worst). The baseline motor function score was calculated as the mean of the patient's assessments at Screening and Week 1. Negative values for change in motor function score indicate improvement, with a more negative value indicating greater improvement compared with the value at baseline.</description>

          <title>Health-Related Quality of Life at Baseline and Week 25</title>
          <description>Assessed using a questionnaire on patients' satisfaction with current immunoglobulin G (IgG) treatment, treatment at home, and treatment at the hospital/doctor's office. The questions were answered by choosing a number between 1 (extremely good) and 7 (extremely bad).
Note: No patients received IgG treatment at the hospital/doctor's office at Week 25.</description>
          <population>The analysis population comprised the subjects in the ITT data set (ie, all patients treated with the study drug) who had at least one post-baseline value (and if necessary a baseline value).</population>

        <description>Treatment satisfaction was assessed using the Life Quality Index, which comprises 15 items rated on a 7-point scale (1 = worst rating, 7 = best rating) with a possible maximum score of 105. The highest score indicates the highest satisfaction with the impact of treatment on social factors. The 15 items were summarized to 4 scales: treatment interference, therapy-related problems, therapy setting, and treatment costs. The raw scores for these scales were transformed to a score ranging from 0 to 100, with 100 being the best score achievable.</description>
