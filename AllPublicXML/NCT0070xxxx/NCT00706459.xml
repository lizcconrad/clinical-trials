    <textblock>
      In this study, we will use advanced and newly available MR imaging techniques at 3 Tesla
      (including in situ axial loading and quantitative T1rho, T2, and diffusion measurements) to
      assess the intervertebral discs and adjacent vertebrae in patients with lumbar back pain
      scheduled for back surgery (n=20), patients with degenerative disease without classic
      discogenic back pain (n=10), patients who had discectomies for herniated discs (n=5), and
      age-matched volunteers without back pain (n=10). In all patients standard imaging procedures
      will also be performed, including radiographs, standard MRI at 1.5 Tesla and discography. All
      patients will have specimen of the intervertebral disc harvested at surgery and pathologic
      analysis and spectroscopy of these specimen will be performed. Post-surgical findings/outcome
      combined with discography will serve as a standard of reference for the identification of the
      painful disc(s). The diagnostic performance of the new techniques in assessing the painful
      disc will be evaluated. We will collect disc specimens from 50 patients undergoing back
      surgery but did not have pre-surgical MR imaging. These disc specimens will be analyzed in
      the same manner as the specimens collected from surgical patients who had pre-surgical MRI.
      This study will serve as a pilot study for a larger project focusing on advanced imaging of
      the painful intervertebral disc.

      We hypothesis that advanced, dedicated MR examinations at 3T can identify painful degenerated
      discs in patients with chronic lumbar back pain.

      Disc specimens are taken out during back surgery and will be studied using techniques for
      tissue analysis to explain the properties and characteristics of disc tissue from patients
      with back pain.

        Potential subjects are patients seen by surgeons in the UCSF ACC Orthopedic Clinic. If a
        patient meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria, the orthopedic surgeon will talk to the
        patient about the new dedicated examinations using 3 Tesla MRI that can identify painful
        degenerated discs. When patient is comfortable with participating and has made a decision
        to go ahead with the MRI, patient can let the orthopedic surgeon's assistant know about
        his/her decision, the assistant will make sure that patient still meets the inclusion and
        exclusion criteria and will call the coordinator at the Imaging Center to set up an MRI
        appointment.

        Flyers will be posted at different UCSF campuses to recruit for normal age-matched and
        young normal volunteers.
