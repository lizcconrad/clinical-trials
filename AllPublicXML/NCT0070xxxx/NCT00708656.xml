      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of dosing mesalazine 800
      mg tablets (Asacol®) at 2.4 g once daily versus divided doses three times daily in the
      maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis.

      Study design

        -  Multicentre, randomized, single-blind, comparator-controlled, parallel-armed study

        -  One year follow-up, or until relapse (whichever shorter)

        -  40-60 UK centres

      Subject population

        -  Ulcerative colitis in remission (sigmoidoscopy score of 0 or 1 with no symptoms of
           active disease, with no treatment for active colitis) for at least 4 weeks, and for no
           more than 2 years

        -  Taking mesalazine or sulfasalazine prior to study entry

        -  Patients excluded if they have Crohn's disease, symptoms of active colitis, have used
           corticosteroids, ciclosporin or oral/enema mesalazine in the past 4 weeks, are
           intolerant to mesalazine or Asacol, are pregnant or lactating, or have known HIV,
           hepatic disease, renal impairment or other serious medical or psychiatric illness

        -  Sample size 250

        -  Gender: male or female

        -  Ethnicity: no restriction

        -  Age: over 18

      Test Product

      Once daily group: Asacol® 2.4g daily given as three 800mg tablets orally qAM

      Three times daily group: Asacol® 2.4g daily given as one 800mg tablet orally three times
      daily

      Criteria for Evaluation:

      Primary Outcome Variable: Relapse rate over 1 year in the intention to treat population, with
      the study powered to detect non-inferiority of the once-daily regimen.

      Secondary Outcome Variables: assessment of superiority of the once-daily regimen, if
      non-inferiority is demonstrated; safety analysis; per protocol analysis of relapse rate; time
      course of relapse; medication compliance; changes in modified Baron sigmoidoscopy scores
      between trial entry and relapse/12 month; impact of various factors on relapse rate (time
      from last relapse at study entry, concomitant azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine therapy;
      disease extent; disease duration; smoking status; age at diagnosis; previous dose of
      mesalazine; baseline calprotectin; baseline CRP level).
