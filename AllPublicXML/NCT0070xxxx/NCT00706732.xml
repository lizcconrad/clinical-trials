    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of the vaccine and the immune response
      to the vaccine in healthy adult volunteers 65 years of age or older. Volunteers will be
      assigned by randomization to receive either the vaccine or an inactive substance (placebo) by
      injections in the arm on two occasions over one month. The study will last approximately 10
      months and will have a total of 7 visits.
