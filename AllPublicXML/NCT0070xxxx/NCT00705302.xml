    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the long term effect of a self-help group in a patient
      education program for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation is aimed to increase the level of health of patients with COPD by
      increasing their self care ability. A recent updated systematic review concluded that
      evidence strongly supports respiratory rehabilitation as part of the spectrum of management
      of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Studies of pulmonary
      rehabilitation programs lasting up to 18 months show that effects are mainly maintained
      throughout the duration of the program. The long term effect, however, is mostly studied for
      programs of shorter durations. Some of the studies with shorter duration have found that the
      achieved benefit was lost or diminished during the follow up period, while others have found
      that the effect has been maintained up to 18 months. Our necessity in the rehabilitative
      field is to find strategies to maintain benefits during time.

    <description>Combined educational and exercise program for pulmonary rehabilitation, with (1) or without(2 a self-help group. The educational part consists firstly of two days with group meetings with information from medical doctor, pharmacist, psychologist, ergonomist, nurse, social worker, physiotherapist and a clinical nutritional physiologist. One more day will be held after 3 months and it is the participants themselves who decide on the content of these days. An experienced patient will participate throughout the course. The exercise part consists of group training twice a week for 3 months with 10-15 participants in each group. Patients will instead of five of the group training sessions, participate in a self-help group.</description>
