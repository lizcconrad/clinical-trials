      RATIONALE: Vaccines may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in
      treating women with previously treated metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Characterize the safety profile of Ad-sig-hMUC-1/ecdCD40L vaccine in women with
           metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Identify a tolerable, immunologically active dose level of this vaccine in these
           patients.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the immune function in these patients before and after treatment with this
           vaccine.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive MUC-1 vector vaccine subcutaneously on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 9 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women over the age of 18 with metastatic or non-measureable adenocarcinoma of the
             breast with marrow involvement.

          -  Elevated serum MUC-1 levels, as measured by CA 15-3 or CA 27-29

          -  Stable disease (defined as fluctuation of &lt;50U in CA15-3 or CA27-29 value) for at
             least 3 months while either on no breast-cancer therapy or while on current therapy
             (Tamoxifen, fulvestrant, exemestane, letrozole, anastrozole, bisphosphonates or
             trastuzumab chemotherapy is not allowed)

          -  ability to understand the risks, benefits, and procedures and provide written informed
             consent.

          -  less than 28 days prior to enrollment since last surgery and/or radiation therapy.

          -  performance status &lt;=2 on the ECOG performance scale and life expectancy of greater
             than 12 months

          -  NYHA cardiac function Class I or Class II and normal baseline ECG. If ECG is abnormal,
             patient must have an echocardiogram showing a left ventricular ejection fraction
             greater than the lower limits of normal.

          -  patients who do not have radiographically assessable locally recurrent or metastatic
             disease are eligible if they 1) had radiographic or biopsy proven locally recurrent or
             metastatic breast cancer in the past and 2) currently (at study entry) have an
             elevated serum MUC-1 level (as measured by CA 15-3 or CA 27-29).

          -  Acceptable pulmonary function. if questionable, a pulmonary function test will be
             performed.

          -  negative serology for hepatitis B, C and HIV.

          -  red cell mean corpuscular volume &gt;- 80 cu. mm, hemoglobin &gt;- 8g/dl, platelet count &gt;-
             100,000/dl: AST, ALT, LDH &lt;-2 times the Upper limit of normal

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.6 mg/dL

          -  for women with child bearing potential, Negative urine pregnancy test within 7 days of
             registration and willingness to use an approved contraceptive method while
             participating in this trial.

          -  Normal MUC-1 (CA 15-3 or CA 27-29)

          -  treatment with steroid or other immunosuppressive medication (for any condition )
             within 30 days of trial registration.

          -  uncontrolled diabetes mellitus

          -  unable or unwilling to undergo repeated clinical evaluations and other diagnostic
