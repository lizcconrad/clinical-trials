  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People that are infected with HIV appear to be especially susceptible to the adverse effects
      of cigarette smoking. The purpose of this study is to determine if quitting smoking by using
      a specialized smoking cessation treatment can prevent one from developing accelerated lung
      damage, particularly emphysema.

    <textblock>
      HIV-infected smokers are at increased risk for life-threatening diseases, such as pneumonia.
      To date, very little is known about the tobacco consumption characteristics of this at-risk
      population of smokers, but it has been well documented that they are at high risk for
      smoking-related co-morbidities. In addition, few effective cessation strategies have been
      described in HIV-infected populations. A specialized smoking cessation that combines
      recommendations from an existing scientifically-valid clinical guideline with Motivational
      Interviewing a new pharmacotherapeutic agent, may be an effective mechanism to apply to this
      vulnerable population of smokers. This initial, efficacy investigation has the potential to
      guide future treatment and research pertaining to tobacco cessation, respiratory illness and
      HIV.
