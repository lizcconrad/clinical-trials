      The purpose of the study is to determine whether treatment with a single 800mg dose of
      AZD9056, a medication which has been developed as a possible treatment for Rheumatoid
      Arthritis, has an effect on the function of the retina

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of a single dose of AZD9056 (800mg) on retinal function will be assessed by Electroretinography</measure>
    <time_frame>Electroretinography measurements will be performed at baseline, 6 hours post dosing at both treatment and crossover placebo treatment visits, and at post study medical follow up visits.</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of a single dose of AZD9056 (800mg) on retinal function will be assessed by measurements of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and colour vision.</measure>
    <time_frame>Visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and colour vision measurements will be performed at a training visit, at baseline, 2.5 hours post dosing at both treatment and crossover placebo treatment visits, and at post study medical follow up visits.</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of a single dose of AZD9056 (800mg) on occipital function will be assessed by measurements of visual evoked potential.</measure>
    <time_frame>Visual evoked potential measurements will be performed at a training visit, at baseline, 4 hours post dosing at both treatment and crossover placebo treatment visits, and at post study medical follow up visits.</time_frame>

    <measure>The effect of a single dose of AZD9056 (800mg) on cognitive function will be assessed by psychomotor testing.</measure>
    <time_frame>Psychomotor testing will be performed at a training visit, at baseline, 8.5 and 24 hours post dosing at both treatment and crossover placebo treatment visits, and at post study medical follow up visits.</time_frame>
