          <title>Sodium Bicarbonate Group</title>
          <description>Randomly assigned to the sodium bicarbonate group or the sodium chloride group in a single-blinded fashion. This group received an intravenous bolus injection of sodium bicarbonate with a dose of 0.5ml/kg as soon as possible before the administration of contrast medium. Afterward, the both groups were followed by an intravenous infusion of 1 ml/kg/hour sodium bicarbonate during and for 6 hours after the procedure.Nonionic, low-osmolality nonionic contrast media were used in all procedure and the volumes were left to the discretion of the operator. Emergent coronary procedures were almost performed by femoral approach. The decision to use an intra-aortic balloon pump, inotropic drugs, beta blockers, angiotensin-convertiong enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or diuretics was based on international guidelines and left to the discretion of the attending physician.</description>
