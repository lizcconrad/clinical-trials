    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of islet cell
      transplantation alone (ITA) in patients with difficult to control type I diabetes. Difficult
      to control type 1 diabetes is defined as wide swings in blood glucose that disrupt the
      patient's life and result in frequent episodes of low blood glucose despite the proper use of
      standard insulin therapy and frequent blood glucose monitoring.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is associated with the damage of a specific cell subtype of pancreatic islets
      (clusters of cells in the pancreas that produce insulin and other metabolic hormones), which
      makes patients depend on an outside source of insulin. Despite insulin treatment, type 1
      diabetes mellitus causes a significant risk of long-term problems, including damage to the
      heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys. The results of recent research studies
      suggest that these complications are caused by poor glucose control.

      Transplantation of islets offers the prospect of good glycemic (blood glucose) control
      without the major surgical risks associated with whole pancreas transplant and may result in
      not needing any insulin injections. In 2000, a group of investigators in Edmonton, Canada
      showed that islet transplantation using a combination of anti-rejection drugs to help prevent
      the rejection of transplanted islets was effective in eliminating insulin intake in 7
      subjects who were followed up to 20 months. After 5 years, more than 60 patients have been
      transplanted at Edmonton and only 1 in 10 remained off of insulin.

      This study is being performed to confirm the results of the Edmonton study to see if islet
      transplantation alone (ITA) is a safe and effective way of treating subjects with type 1
      diabetes. This study uses a few additional medications and vitamin supplements that were not
      included in the original Edmonton study. We hope this will improve the long-term outcome of
      islet transplantation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Difficult to control Type 1 diabetes mellitus (defined above). Documentation of
             negative basal and stimulated C-peptide (a basal level of &lt; 0.2 ng/ml before IV
             administration of 1 mg of glucagon, and a glucagon stimulated C-peptide &lt; 0.8 ng/ml)
             and diagnosis of diabetes for at least 5 years. When possible, patients will be
             evaluated with continuous glucose monitoring (GlucoseSensor Â®) to determine the
             frequency and extent of hypo- and hyperglycemic episodes.
