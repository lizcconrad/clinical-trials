      OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively analyze the results of ambulatory treatment on Taiwanese
      patients with primary varicosities of the lower extremities including the use of endovenous
      laser, phlebectomy, and sclerotherapy.

      METHODS: We routinely used tumescent anesthesia and ultrasound-guided approaches for the
      application of endovenous laser. Vein access was achieved by either a percutaneous or stab
      wound. The laser power was usually 10 - 20 watts; laser treatment usually was begun from 4-10
      cm below the saphenofemoral junction, and stopped around the knee, not over 10 cm below the
      knee. In the same operation, we used Mueller's phlebectomy and/or sclerotherapy if there were
      prominent branch varicosities. We instructed each patient to walk around immediately after
      the operation, to go home, and to come back 1-3 days later for follow-up. Ultrasound scan and
      venous function follow-up was scheduled at 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and then annually.
