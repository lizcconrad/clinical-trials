      lesions in an in situ model

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In situ models represent an acceptable approach for testing the anti-caries potential of
      fluoride products. This study is to evaluate the effect of fluoride dentifrice containing
      1450 parts per million fluoride (ppm F) on enamel with artificial caries lesions in an in
      situ model. The study toothpaste containing sodium fluoride (NaF) and 0.4% carbopol will be
      compared to 4 other dentifrices. Comparator toothpastes include NaF toothpaste (1400 ppm F),
      NaF toothpaste (675 ppm F), sodium monofluorophosphate (NaMFP) and NaF toothpaste (1450 ppm
      F) and placebo toothpaste (0 ppm F).

    <measure>Percentage Surface Microhardness Recovery (%SMHR) of Sound Enamel Specimens Exposed to NaF Toothpaste (1450ppmF) and NaF Toothpaste (1400ppmF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>SMH test was used to assess mineral status of partially demineralized enamel specimens using Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMH was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening/demineralization while decrease in the indentation represents rehardening/ remineralization of enamel surface. Percent SMHR was calculated from indentation values of enamel specimens at baseline(B); after intra-oral exposure(R) on Day 14; and after in-vitro demineralization(D) on Day 14 using formula [(D-R)/(D-B)]*100.</description>

        <title>Percentage Surface Microhardness Recovery (%SMHR) of Sound Enamel Specimens Exposed to NaF Toothpaste (1450ppmF) and NaF Toothpaste (1400ppmF)</title>
        <description>SMH test was used to assess mineral status of partially demineralized enamel specimens using Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMH was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening/demineralization while decrease in the indentation represents rehardening/ remineralization of enamel surface. Percent SMHR was calculated from indentation values of enamel specimens at baseline(B); after intra-oral exposure(R) on Day 14; and after in-vitro demineralization(D) on Day 14 using formula [(D-R)/(D-B)]*100.</description>

        <description>Enamel fluoride uptake was determined using the microdrill enamel biopsy technique. The amount of fluoride uptake by enamel was calculated based on the amount of fluoride (F) divided by the area of the enamel cores. The difference between treatments was calculated with respect to fluoride uptake by enamel.</description>
