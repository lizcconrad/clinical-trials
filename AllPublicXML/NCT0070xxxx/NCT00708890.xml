  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Twelve Step groups are the most available and widespread self-help groups for patients
      with alcohol or drug related disorders. In a public health perspective, self-help groups
      (SHGs) may be considered as a supplement to professional treatment and provide aftercare soon
      as professional treatment has ended.

      There is a need to investigate if U.S. findings and procedures concerning referrals from the
      health services to Twelve Step Groups (TSGs) can be replicated and accommodated to a cultural
      setting which is unfamiliar with these groups. There is also a particular need in the
      Norwegian treatment system to develop alternative treatment strategies for patients
      undergoing detoxification to improve their chances of long-term recovery, due to deficient
      formal follow-up alternatives.

      We plan to carry out a RCT-study. One hundred and sixty patients entering a detoxification
      treatment center (Addiction Unit, Sørlandet Hospital, Kristiansand, Norway) will be assigned
      to two different groups: One given standard information about TSGs (brief advice) and one
      given intensive referral (motivational sessions and contact with TSG volunteers). A follow up
      assessment is planned at 6 months to determine whether intensive referral results in more TSG
      attendance, and if this mediates less substance use and better functioning outcomes.

      This study introduces a new concept in the Norwegian health care system and relies on a
      systematic cooperation with user organizations (SHGs) and user volunteers. Thus the study
      focuses strongly on user resources.

    <description>The intensive intervention will consist of a boost motivational session on follow-up alternatives and particularly on attending TSGs. Efforts will be made to connect the patients with TSG volunteers via the AA/NA contact telephone. The patients are encouraged to invite AA/NA contact persons to visit them on the ward. The patient will then have the possibility to be followed to a meeting after treatment. The patients in the intensive referral group will get a phone call four weeks after discharge. The focus of this call will be on continued motivation to attend TSGs.</description>
