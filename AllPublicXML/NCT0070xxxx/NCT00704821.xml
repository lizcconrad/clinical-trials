  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) is important for tumor growth in advanced
      cancer. It is known that tumors make a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF). VEGF stimulates the formation of blood vessels that supply the tumor with nutrients
      and oxygen. PTC299 is an oral investigational new drug that has been shown to decrease
      production of VEGF in animal models of human cancer. In these animal models, oral PTC299
      administration decreases VEGF levels in the tumor and in the bloodstream, decreases blood
      vessel numbers in the tumor, and significantly slows or halts tumor growth. When given in
      combination with the chemotherapeutic drug, docetaxel, PTC299 increases the antitumor
      activity over use of docetaxel alone. Safety studies in research animals indicate good
      tolerability at doses and drug levels that are higher than those planned for the clinical
      studies. Results from Phase 1a studies in healthy volunteers indicate that PTC299 achieves
      levels of PTC299 in the bloodstream that are known to be active in animal models of human
      cancer. This Phase 1b study is designed to test the hypothesis that PTC299 will be tolerable
      and will show evidence of anti-VEGF and antitumor activity when administered orally to
      patients with cancer.

      The study will be conducted in 3 stages. In Stage 1 of the study, successive groups of 3 to 6
      patients will receive progressively higher PTC299 dose levels; in this stage, treatment will
      be given in repeated 6-week cycles consisting of 4 weeks of oral PTC299 twice per day
      followed by a 2-week, no-drug period. In Stage 2, additional groups of 3 to 6 patients will
      be enrolled at tolerable dose levels to receive treatment in repeated 6-week cycles
      consisting of oral PTC299 administered 2 or 3 times per day continuously (ie, without the
      2-week no-drug period as in Stage 1). In Stage 3, additional groups of 3 to 6 patients will
      be enrolled at tolerable dose levels to receive treatment in repeated 3-week cycles
      consisting of oral PTC299 administered 2 or 3 times per day continuously in combination with
      docetaxel (75 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks). All planned dose levels in all stages are
      expected to achieve circulating blood levels of PTC299 known to be active in animal models of
      human cancer. Treatment for each patient can continue as long as the therapy appears to be
      safely offering tumor control to that patient. Up to 76 evaluable patients will be accrued
      across the 3 stages.

             physical finding, ECG finding, or laboratory abnormality that, in the investigator's
             opinion, could affect the safety of the patient; alter the absorption, distribution,
             metabolism or excretion of the study drug; or impair the assessment of study results.

             docetaxel was progressive disease at first assessment). Note: This criterion applies
             to Stage 3 study candidates only.
