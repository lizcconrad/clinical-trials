  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial comparing the the effects of
      approximately 7 weeks of placebo treatment to 7 weeks of ezetimibe (10mg/day) treatment on
      several parameters of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) in men and post-menopausal women
      diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia. The primary hypothesis is that the ezetimibe treatment
      will increase the excretion of endogenous (plasma-derived) cholesterol as fecal sterols, with
      secondary hypotheses that there will be a significant increase in de novo cholesterol
      synthesis, treatment will increase cholesterol efflux from tissues into the bloodstream, and
      increase global RCT.

      The study will compare the effects of approximately 7 weeks of placebo treatment to 7 weeks
      of ezetimibe (10mg/day) on: 1) the efficiency of endogenous (plasma-derived) cholesterol
      excretion (%/day) 2) de novo cholesterol (DNC) synthesis ((%/day) 3) cholesterol efflux from
      tissues into blood (Ra), and 4) global RCT (efflux from tissues that is excreted as fecal
      sterols). Subjects will receive 7 weeks of either treatment or placebo, undergo RCT and DNC
      measurements, taking 10 days, then cross-over to the alternate placebo or treatment for an
      additional 7 weeks, followed by a second set of RCT and DNC measurements.

    <description>(Fecal excretion of plasma-derived cholesterol):The following measurements will be made following isotope infusion:
The composition of fecal neutral and acidic sterols will be measured as % of total.
The excretion rate of fecal neutral and acidic sterols will be measured as mg/day.
The isotopic enrichment of both fecal neutral and acidic sterols will be measured as atomic percent excess (% APE).
Fecal isotope excretion, or recovery, of plasma-derived cholesterol will be calculated as %/day.</description>

    <measure>Cholesterol Efflux Rate (Ra Cholesterol)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The efflux, or mobilization, rate of cholesterol from peripheral tissues into the plasma will be measured as mg/kg/hr. An IV infusion of [13C2] cholesterol mixed in 10% Intralipid® and 10 % ethanol is given piggy-backed into normal saline over 20 hours (4pm - 12 noon). This is used to determine rate of appearance (Ra) cholesterol, which will be measured by dilution of infused [13C2] cholesterol during the plateau phase of plasma enrichment (approximately the last 4 hours of the infusion), as well as to provide the plasma cholesterol that will be traced into biliary sterols.</description>

        <title>Cholesterol Efflux Rate (Ra Cholesterol)</title>
        <description>The efflux, or mobilization, rate of cholesterol from peripheral tissues into the plasma will be measured as mg/kg/hr. An IV infusion of [13C2] cholesterol mixed in 10% Intralipid® and 10 % ethanol is given piggy-backed into normal saline over 20 hours (4pm – 12 noon). This is used to determine rate of appearance (Ra) cholesterol, which will be measured by dilution of infused [13C2] cholesterol during the plateau phase of plasma enrichment (approximately the last 4 hours of the infusion), as well as to provide the plasma cholesterol that will be traced into biliary sterols.</description>
