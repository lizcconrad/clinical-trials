      Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is the most commonly performed refractive surgical
      procedure for the correction of ametropia worldwide. Infectious keratitis, although rare, is
      a potentially devastating complication of LASIK, and it can lead to horrifying outcomes.
      Previous studies on antibiotic susceptibility of preoperative ocular bacterial flora focused
      primarily on intraocular surgeries with particular interests in endophthalmitis. This study
      was aimed at refractive surgeries with special interest in infectious keratitis after LASIK.
      Intraocular surgeries for cataract, glaucoma or retinal disease are performed mostly on aged
      patients at a large hospital on an inpatient or outpatient basis; however, most refractive
      surgeries are performed on young, healthy people in private clinics on an outpatient basis.
      The patient populations are therefore quite different between these two types of surgery. The
      aim of this study is to determine the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility patterns of
      conjunctival bacterial flora isolated preoperatively from patients undergoing refractive
      surgery at an outpatient laser surgery clinic. Preoperative conjunctival swab samples are
      directly inoculated in culture media at the bedside before topical anesthetic or antibiotic
      application. Blood agar, chocolate agar, thioglycolate broth, Sabouraud dextrose agar, and
      Ogawa media are used for bacterial, fungal and mycobacterial cultures. Minimum inhibitory
      concentrations (MICs) of ofloxacin (OFX), levofloxacin (LEV), gatifloxacin (GAT),
      moxifloxacin (MOX), gemifloxacin (GEM) and other commonly used antibiotics are determined
      using an E-test.
