    <textblock>
      This study was a multicenter, randomized, PROBE-type (prospective, randomized, open label,
      blinded end-point) study of 12 weeks duration comprising four visits, carried out in patients
      with essential arterial hypertension not controlled on four weeks treatment with amlodipine 5
      mg alone.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0, after completion of screening period) and Week 8 (after 8 weeks of combination therapy)</time_frame>
    <description>Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) over a 30-hour period was carried out in all patients at two visits during the study, 72 hours before visit 2 (baseline) and visit 4 (week 8). ABPM for visit 2 was carried out prior to randomization and the first dose of the amlodipine/valsartan combination study therapy. ABPM for visit four began after 12 weeks of treatment and before the last office blood pressure was taken. Covariates included baseline level, country, up-titration + treatment*country and treatment*up-titration interactions in case statistically significant at a 0.10 level.</description>

At week 4, uncontrolled patients (msSBP &gt;= 140 mmHg and/or msDBP &gt;= 90 mmHg or msSBP &gt;= 130 mmHg and/or msDBP &gt;= 80 mmHg in the case of diabetes or renal insufficiency measured by using conventional methods) received amlodipine/valsartan 10/160 mg for 4 additional weeks. Patients who were controlled at Week 4 (msSBP &lt; 140 mmHg and msDBP &lt; 90 mmHg or msSBP &lt; 130 mmHg and msDBP &lt; 80 mmHg in the case of diabetes or renal insufficiency) continued their amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg treatment for the remaining 4 weeks of the study.</description>

        <description>Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) over a 30-hour period was carried out in all patients at two visits during the study, 72 hours before visit 2 (baseline) and visit 4 (week 8). ABPM for visit 2 was carried out prior to randomization and the first dose of the amlodipine/valsartan combination study therapy. ABPM for visit four began after 12 weeks of treatment and before the last office blood pressure was taken. Covariates included baseline level, country, up-titration + treatment*country and treatment*up-titration interactions in case statistically significant at a 0.10 level.</description>

        <description>Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) over a 30-hour period was carried out in all patients at two visits during the study, 72 hours before visit 2 (baseline) and visit 4 (week 8). ABPM for visit 2 was carried out prior to randomization and the first dose of the amlodipine/valsartan combination study therapy. ABPM for visit four began after 12 weeks of treatment and before the last office blood pressure was taken. Covariates included baseline level, country, up-titration + treatment*country and treatment*up-titration interactions in case statistically significant at a 0.10 level.</description>
