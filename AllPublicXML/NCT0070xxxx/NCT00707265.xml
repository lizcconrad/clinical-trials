      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the rhBMP-2/CRM/CD HORIZON® Spinal System as a
      method of facilitating spinal fusion in patients with degenerative disc disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the rhBMP-2/CRM/CD HORIZON® Spinal System for
      posterolateral fusion treatment of patients with symptomatic degenerative disc disease versus
      the control group of autogenous bone with the CD HORIZON® Spinal System.

      The investigational treatment was the open bilateral posterolateral implantation of the
      rhBMP-2/CRM/CD HORIZON® Spinal System. One investigational implant was placed across two
      adjacent transverse processes on each side of the spine during the spinal fusion procedure.

      The control treatment was the bilateral posterolateral implantation of the autogenous bone
      harvested from the iliac crest with the CD HORIZON® Spinal System.

    <measure>Overall Success</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>A patient will be considered an overall success if all of the following conditions are met:
fusion;
pain/disability (Oswestry) improvement;
maintenance or improvement in neurological status;
no serious adverse event classified as implant associated or implant/surgical procedure associated;
no additional surgical procedure classified as a &quot;failure.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fusion</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fusion is defined as:
Evidence of bridging trabecular bone.
No evidence of motion.
Absence of cracking, as evidenced by radiolucent lines completely through the fusion mass.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain/Disability Status</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The self-administered Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire will be used. Success will be defined as pain/disability improvement postoperatively according to the definition: Preoperative Score - Postoperative Score &gt;= 15 points</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Neurological Status</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neurological status will be assessed preoperatively and postoperatively using a neurological status scale. Neurological status is based on four types of measurements (sections): motor, sensory, reflexes, and straight leg raise. Overall measure of neurological status will be based on success statuses in the four parameters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General Health Status</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) will be used to assess general health status. The SF-36 results can be summarized into two components, a physical component summary (PCS) and a mental component summary (MCS). Success will be defined as a maintenance or improvement in status postoperatively as compared to the preoperative condition. To be classified as a success, the following criteria must be met:
PCSPostop - PCSPreop &gt;= 0; MCSPostop - MCSPreop &gt;= 0</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Back Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Numerical rating scales will be used to evaluate pain intensity and duration. The pain score (0 min, 20 Max) is derived by adding the numerical rating scores from the pain intensity (0-10, with a score of 0 representing &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 representing &quot;pain as bad as it could be.&quot;) and duration scales (0-10, with a score of 0 being &quot;pain none of the time&quot; and a score of 10 being &quot;pain all of the time&quot;). Success for back and leg pain is described as follows:
Preoperative Score - Postoperative Score &gt;=0</description>

    <description>The rhBMP-2/CRM component of the investigational device consists of recombinant human Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 (rhBMP-2) and a compression resistant matrix (CRM) carrier consisting of an absorbable collagen sponge imbedded with biphasic calcium phosphate.
The posterior spinal fixation system, the CD HORIZON® Spinal System, is a commercially available rod-based spinal system intended for temporary stabilization of the spine in order to facilitate fusion. The CD HORIZON® Spinal System is available in either titanium or stainless steel. For this study, only titanium implant components will be used.</description>
