    <textblock>
      The drug that was tested in this study is called vortioxetine. Vortioxetine is being tested
      to treat depression in people who have major depressive disorder (MDD). This study looked at
      MDD relief in people who took vortioxetine.

      The study enrolled 836 patients that had completed one of two other vortioxetine studies.
      Participants received 5 mg of vortioxetine for the first week of treatment. After completing
      the first week of treatment, the dose could be increased to 10 mg/day or decreased to 2.5
      mg/day based on participant's response as judged by the doctor.

      All participants were asked to take one encapsulated tablet at the same time each day
      throughout the study.

      This multi-center trial was conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study was up to 56 weeks. Participants made 13 visits to the clinic, and were contacted by
      telephone 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Potentially Clinically Significant Electrocardiogram (ECG) Findings</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>A standard 12-lead ECG was performed at the designated study visits. The central reader reviewed and recorded the intervals (PR, QRS, RR, QT, and corrected QT interval [QTc]), and interpreted the ECG using 1 of the following categories: within normal limits or abnormal. The number of participants with at least one post-baseline potentially clinically significant ECG finding is reported. bpm = beats per minute; QTcB = QT interval corrected using Bazett's formula; QTcF = QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first dose of open-label study drug until 4 weeks after the last dose (up to 56 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The intensity (severity) of each AE was defined as:
Mild: caused minimal discomfort and did not interfere in a significant manner with normal activities.
Moderate: sufficiently uncomfortable to produce some impairment of normal activities.
Severe: incapacitating, preventing the patient from participating in normal activities.
The causal relationship between an AE and study drug was assessed by the investigator as Probable, Possible or Not Related; Related=AEs with causality of Possibly or Probably. A serious AE (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, led to a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or was an important medical event that either jeopardized the patient, required intervention to prevent any of the SAEs defined above, a suicide attempt or an abortion.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Illness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 4, 24 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a patient is assessed on severity of mental illness on the following scale: 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline mentally ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely ill. Final Visit includes data from Week 52 or earlier for participants who didn't complete the 52 weeks.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 is a participant self-rated questionnaire that is a general measure of perceived health status comprising 36 questions, which yields an 8-scale health profile. The 8 health concepts are: 1. Limitation in physical activities because of health problems. 2. Limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems. 3. Bodily pain. 4. Limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems. 5. General mental health (psychological distress and well-being). 6. Limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems. 7. Vitality (energy and fatigue). 8. General health perception. Each scale ranges from 0 (best) - 100 (worst).</description>

          <description>The 24-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D24) is a clinician-rated 24-item scale for assessing the severity of depression symptoms. The scores for each item range from 0 to 4 or 0 to 2, where 0 represents no symptoms. The rating is based on the past 7 days prior to the time of assessment. The total score ranges from 0 to 74, where a higher score indicates a greater depressive state.</description>

        <description>A standard 12-lead ECG was performed at the designated study visits. The central reader reviewed and recorded the intervals (PR, QRS, RR, QT, and corrected QT interval [QTc]), and interpreted the ECG using 1 of the following categories: within normal limits or abnormal. The number of participants with at least one post-baseline potentially clinically significant ECG finding is reported. bpm = beats per minute; QTcB = QT interval corrected using Bazett's formula; QTcF = QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula.</description>

        <description>The HAM-D24 is a clinician-rated 24-item scale for assessing the severity of depression symptoms. The scores for each item range from 0 to 4 or 0 to 2, where 0 represents no symptoms. The rating is based on the past 7 days prior to the time of assessment. The total score ranges from 0 to 74 where a higher score indicates a greater depressive state. Final Visit includes data from Week 52 or earlier for participants who didn't complete the 52 weeks.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to the Final Visit in the Sheehan Disability Scale</title>
        <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) assesses functional impairment in 3 domains: work/school, social life or leisure activities, and home life or family responsibilities. The participant rates the extent to which each aspect is impaired on a 10-point visual analog scale, from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely). The 3 scores are added together to calculate the total score, which ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating more impairment.</description>
