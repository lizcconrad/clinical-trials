  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the safety and efficacy of a tigecycline regimen versus an
      imipenem/cilastatin regimen for the treatment of subjects who are hospitalized with
      hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). At least 70% of enrolled subjects will have
      ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Two dose levels of tigecycline will be assessed and
      compared to imipenem/cilastatin in parallel. Subjects will receive intravenous therapy from a
      minimum of 7 &amp; up to 14 consecutive days, the exact duration will be at the decision of the
      investigator based on the subject's condition. Additional protocol specified antibiotics may
      be given to ensure appropriate coverage. A final assessment at test-of-cure (TOC) visit will
      be done 10 to 21 days after the last day of therapy. The total duration of subject
      participation will be between 17 and 44 days, including a follow up period of 30 days after
      the last day of therapy for SAEs.

      Subjects will be followed for safety and efficacy. The safety assessment will include:
      physical examinations, vital signs, assessment of the clinical signs and symptoms of
      pneumonia, collection of adverse events, 12-lead ECG, collection of samples for hematology,
      serum chemistries, and coagulation parameters, &amp; a serum or urine pregnancy test before study
      entry for women of childbearing potential. The clinical and microbiological efficacy will
      both be evaluated.

      The sponsor internal decision has been taken to close the study on 15 of July 2011, due to
      difficulties in enrollment. This decision was not based on any safety issues.
