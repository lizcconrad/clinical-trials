    <textblock>
      This study was designed to assess single-dose and multiple-dose PK and safety parameters
      utilizing a dosage of 3 mL (500 µg/mL)AeroLEF delivered via nebulization with the AeroEclipse
      BAN device. The study was conducted in opioid naïve subjects who were not blocked with
      naloxone or other opioid receptor antagonists.

      Period I: Subjects received an i.v.dose of fentanyl (200 µg) (Treatment A).

      Period II: Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either a single-dose (Treatment B) or
      multi-dose (Treatment C) of AeroLEF.

      In the multi-dose Treatment C group, subjects received a dose of 3 mL AeroLEF every 12 hours
      for a total of five doses over a 3 days with a 4 week washout period before crossing over to
      Period III.

      Period III: Subjects from Period II participated in the crossover study and receive either a
      multi-dose (Treatment C, 5 doses at 12 hour intervals) or a single dose (Treatment B).
      Subjects in Treatment B or Treatment C were instructed to continue inhalation of AeroLEF for
      approximately one (1) minute beyond the point of nebulizer sputter to ensure that all
      aerosolized medication was delivered.
