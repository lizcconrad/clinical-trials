    <textblock>
      This study is designed to provide clear evidence for health and social policymakers about the
      influence of alternate service-delivery models and practices on enhancing and sustaining
      low-income family linkages to available services. A challenge faced by Canadian health and
      social service providers is to promote health for low-income families in a proactive and
      cost-effective manner. Families with low incomes experience an array of health and social
      barriers that compromise their resilience, lead to negative family outcomes, and act as
      barriers to available services. Family barriers are compounded by service delivery barriers
      and result in reduced opportunities for effective, primary-level services and in increased
      use of secondary-level services (e.g., emergency room visits, emergency intervention, police
      involvement), with the obvious increase in costs. Randomized-controlled trials are rare in
      community-based intervention research.

      This Families First Edmonton randomized-controlled trial (RCT) will enable testing of
      innovative service-delivery models and provide an opportunity for evidence-based decision
      making for Canadian policy makers. Critical information will be provided about

        1. optimizing cost effectiveness for public systems

        2. the long-term effects on the health of low-income family members

        3. mechanisms that intervene between the interventions and their effect on the health of
           low-income family members

        4. building on previous research and on community-based initiatives

        5. promoting knowledge transfer
