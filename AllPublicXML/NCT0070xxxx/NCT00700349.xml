  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves randomization of individuals who were initially rejected from a
      micro-lending organization in South Africa. Subjects were placed into two arms: (1) not
      receiving a loan; (2) being reconsidered for a &quot;second look.&quot; Of those in the second arm, 53%
      were then selected by the organization's loan officers to receive a standard loan for
      first-time borrowers. Mental health and financial data were collected at one timepoint:
      approximately 6-12 months after the subjects first applied for the loan.
