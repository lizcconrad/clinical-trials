      The purpose of this study is to confirm the safety and efficacy of temozolomide in patients
      with newly diagnosed malignant glioma (concomitant with radiotherapy and then as monotherapy)
      and relapsed malignant glioma (as monotherapy) when used in the daily medical practices.

      Post-marketing surveys are not considered applicable clinical trials and thus the results of
      this survey will not be posted at its conclusion. The results will be submitted to public
      health officials as required by applicable national and international laws.

    <description>Temozolomide treatment for newly diagnosed malignant glioma. The usual dose for adults in combination with radiotherapy is 75 mg/m2 orally once daily for 42 consecutive days. After a 4 week rest period, monotherapy at 150 mg/m2 orally once daily for 5 consecutive days per 28 day treatment cycle is administered. The dose may be increased to 200 mg/m2 for the next 28 day treatment cycle.
Temozolomide is administered as 20 mg and 100 mg capsules.</description>
