      Hypothesis: Free light chain removal haemodialysis will increase the rate of renal recovery
      in patients with cast nephropathy, severe renal failure and de novo multiple myeloma.

      This study will randomise patients with multiple myeloma and severe renal failure to
      treatment to remove free light chains by haemodialysis or not.

    <textblock>
      The EUropean trial of free LIght chain removal by exTEnded haemodialysis in cast nephropathy
      (EuLITE) trial is a prospective, randomised, multicentre, open label clinical trial to
      investigate the clinical benefit of FLC removal haemodialysis in patients with cast
      nephropathy, dialysis dependent renal failure and de novo multiple myeloma. Recruitment
      commenced in May 2008, in total 90 patients will be recruited. Participants will be
      randomised, centrally, upon enrolment, to either trial chemotherapy and FLC removal
      haemodialysis or trial chemotherapy and standard high flux haemodialysis. Trial chemotherapy
      is a modified PAD regime, consisting of bortezomib, doxorubicin and dexamethasone. FLC
      removal haemodialysis is undertaken using two Gambro HCO 1100 dialysers in series, over an
      intensive treatment schedule. The primary outcome for the study is independence of dialysis
      at 3 months. Secondary outcomes are: duration of dialysis, reduction in serum FLC
      concentrations; myeloma response and survival.
