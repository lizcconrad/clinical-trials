      This is a prospective, observational, post-marketing safety surveillance registry of UC
      subjects treated with Remicade or another standard therapy. Registry centers are targeted to
      enroll a total of 2000 subjects (1000 Remicade subjects and 1000 standard therapy subjects)
      and to follow them for a period of up to 5 years. Subjects who started the registry on
      standard therapy may switch over to Remicade.

          -  Participating in a blinded trial.

        In addition, subjects with conditions that are contraindicated in the Remicade Summary of
        Product Characteristics (SPC) should not be treated with Remicade.
