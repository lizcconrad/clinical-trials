    <textblock>
      Clinical trial objective is to collect the outcome of Frozen-Thawed Embryo Transfer (FTET)
      cycles performed after the embryos are cryopreserved in the base study P05690 in order to
      estimate the cumulative pregnancy rate for each treatment group.

      This is a follow-up protocol to collect the outcome of FTET cycles, performed after the
      embryos are cryopreserved in base study P05690 (NCT00702845), to enable estimation of the
      cumulative pregnancy rate for each treatment group.

    <description>Cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate was defined as 100 times the number of participants with an ongoing pregnancy either immediately after embryo transfer in base study P05690 (NCT00702845) or after one or more FTET cycles in follow up study P05711 following cryopreservation, divided by the total number of subjects that started treatment in base study P05690.</description>

    <description>In follow-up study, no medication or investigational product was administered. But in base study P05690 (NCT00702845), participants received single subcutaneous (SC) injection of corifollitropin alfa 100 μg (Org 36286) on Day 2 or 3 of the menstrual cycle and daily placebo-recombinant Follicle Stimulating Hormone (recFSH) injections (7 total) from Stimulation Day 1 up to and including Stimulation Day 7. Participants in base study P05690 also received open-label recFSH (up to 200 IU/day) from Stimulation Day 8 onwards, up to and including Day of Human Chorion Gonadotropin (hCG) administration. Participants also received Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) antagonist ganirelix (0.25 mg) once daily SC starting on Stimulation Day 5 up to and including the Day of hCG (10,000 or 5,000 IU/USP). Participants also received progesterone (at least 600 mg/day vaginally or 50 mg/day IM), starting on day of oocyte pick-up (OPU) and continuing for at least 6 weeks or up to menses.</description>

    <description>In this follow-up study, no medication or investigational product was administered. However, in base study P05690 (NCT00702845), participants in the reference group received a single SC injection of placebo-corifollitropin alfa administered on Day 2 or 3 of the menstrual cycle and daily SC recFSH 150 IU injections (7 total) from Stimulation Day 1 up to and including Stimulation Day 7. Participants also received open-label recFSH (up to 200 IU/day) from Stimulation Day 8 onwards, up to and including the day of hCG (10,000 or 5,000 IU/USP) administration.

Participants also received GnRH antagonist ganirelix (0.25 mg) once daily SC starting on Stimulation Day 5 up to and including Day of hCG (10,000 or 5,000 IU/USP); and progesterone (at least 600 mg/day vaginally or 50 mg/day IM), starting on Day of OPU and continuing at least 6 weeks or up to menses. Eligible participants from base study were enrolled in follow up study P05711, but no study treatments were given, and embryos obtained in base study underwent FTET cycles.</description>
