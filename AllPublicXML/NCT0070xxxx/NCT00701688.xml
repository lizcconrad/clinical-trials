  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mucositis is a well-known complication of both autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation (HSCT). Many who suffer this disorder require total parental nutrition
      and intravenous narcotics for pain control. Palifermin (Kepivance[TM]) is a human
      keratinocyte growth factor that is produced by recombinant DNA technology in E. coli.
      Palifermin is a FDA-approved, commercially available pharmacologic agent that is manufactured
      by Amgen. As keratinocyte growth factor receptors have been found within the epithelium of
      gastric mucosa, the use of palifermin has been proven to decrease the frequency and duration
      of severe mucositis in adult studies. Whereas the appropriate dosing regimen has been
      determined for adults at 60mcg/kg/day, the dosing of palifermin has not been established in
      the pediatric setting. This initial pediatric study of palifermin will determine the maximum
      tolerated dose, evaluating the use of this agent at three dose levels, below, at, and above
      the recommended adult dose. Non-hematologic, life-threatening NCI grade IV or grade V
      toxicities definitely related to the administration of palifermin from the first infusion
      until day +6 after HSCT (post palifermin administration day +3) will comprise the safety
      endpoints of the study.

      The study is designed to evaluate palifermin at 3 dose levels. The study population will be
      recipients of either a matched family member donor or matched unrelated donor HSCT. The
      pharmacokinetics of palifermin at each dose level will be described to help determine the
      appropriate dose for future studies, which will evaluate efficacy

      Secondary objectives of this study include exploring the pharmacoeconomics of palifermin in
      this particular patient population through an assessment of inpatient days, intravenous
      nutrition, and analgesia requirements within 100 days post-transplantation. We will also
      explore the research participants' rates of immune reconstitution, specifically T and
      B-lymphocytes and NK cells, within the first year of HSCT.
