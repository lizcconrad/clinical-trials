  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a common complication of stem cell transplant,
      resulting from the donor's immune cells attacking the cells of the body of the recipient. One
      effect of GVHD is fibrosis (scarring) of the skin that can lead to impaired function,
      decreased quality of life and increased risk of death. This is known as sclerotic skin
      changes of GVHD, or sclerodermatous graft versus host disease (ScGVHD).

      Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is a drug that has been approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration to treat cancer in humans and fibrosing conditions in animals.

      Objectives:

      To see if imatinib mesylate can improve ScGVHD and evaluate its effect on other GVHD symptoms

      To assess the side effects of imatinib mesylate in patients with GVHD

      To evaluate blood, body fluids and tissue samples in patients to try to better understand the
      biology of ScGVHD

      Eligibility:

      Patients 4 years of age and older with ScGVHD

      Design:

      Initial treatment: Participants take imatinib mesylate tablets once a day for up to 6 months,
      as long as their GVHD does not get worse and they do not develop unacceptable side effects of
      the drug.

      Evaluations: Participants are evaluated at 1, 3 and 6 months at the National Institutes of
      Health (NIH) Clinical Center with procedures that may include the following:

      Medical history and physical examination

      Blood and urine tests

      Lung function test

      Skin biopsy

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan

      Specialty consultations (e.g., physical or rehabilitative therapy, dentist, eye doctor,
      dermatologist)

      Electrocardiogram (EKG)

      Echocardiogram (ultrasound test of the heart)

      Muga scan (nuclear medicine test of the heart)

      Quality-of-life questionnaires

      Apheresis (procedure for collecting quantities of white blood cells)

      Office visits with local physician once a week for 1 month, then once every 2 weeks for 5
      months

      Followup visits at National Institutes of Health (NIH) every 6 months for 1 year

      Continuing treatment: Patients who improve continue to receive imatinib mesylate for up to 6
      months after their best response and are followed for up to 2 years. Patients who continue to
      respond or who become worse after stopping treatment may receive additional treatment for up
      to 2 years.

      Background:

      Chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic stem cell
      transplant (alloHSCT). The sclerotic skin manifestations of chronic cutaneous GVHD (ScGVHD)
      can lead to significant functional impairment and no satisfactory therapy exists to
      adequately treat this form of cGVHD.

      Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potent
      activity against platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signaling, a key cytokine
      pathway which has been implicated in fibrotic disease in general, and in extensive cGVHD in
      particular.

      We hypothesize that treatment with imatinib mesylate will reduce the sclerotic manifestations
      of cGVHD as assessed by quantitative range of motion assessment of an affected joint.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objective:

      To investigate whether imatinib mesylate results in clinical improvement in skin fibrosis in
      children and adults with ScGVHD using range of motion assessment of affected joints.

      To determine if imatinib mesylate 200 mg daily is tolerated by patients with cGVHD.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To assess toxicity associated with imatinib mesylate in patients with cGVHD.

      To establish outcome criteria for the evaluation of ScGVHD using multi-modality objective and
      subjective assessments, including magnetic resonance imaging, skin scoring, and patient
      self-reported measures.

      To evaluate biomarkers of disease activity and correlative response measures to treatment
      with imatinib mesylate.

      To assess quality of life and functional measures of disease activity and to evaluate changes
      through the course of therapy.

      To evaluate the response of other organ manifestations affected by cGVHD to treatment with
      imatinib mesylate.

      To evaluate steady-state pharmacokinetics of imatinib mesylate in the cGVHD patient
      population.

      Eligibility:

      Patients age 4 years of age or older with the diagnosis of ScGVHD.

      Design:

      This is an open-label, pilot study of imatinib mesylate.

      Treatment cycles are 28-day cycles with no rest period between cycles.

      A target of 10 evaluable patients will be enrolled on this trial.

    <measure>Percent Change in Absolute Range of Motion (ROM) From Baseline to 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A change in ROM is 25% or greater from baseline. A partial response required improvement in 25% or more in ROM. Progression required 25% or greater loss of ROM.Patients with negative values in the Table are those who lost ROM. Percent improvement in ROM for 1-3 target joints. For patients with &gt;1 target joint, the average ROM improvement was calculated. The average percentage change in ROM deficit from baseline to 6 months was obtained based on the number of degrees of ROM change (6 months)/total ROM deficit (baseline) at each joint.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Total skin score was graded by the National Institutes of Health Consensus Criteria. Skin score was calculated by dividing the total score by seven domains (skin, eye, oral, joint, gastrointestinal, hepatic, pulmonary) in men and 8 domains in women (previous domains noted plus gynecologic). Total skin score is a percentage of body surface area (BSA) involvement (range 0-100%). It was calculated from the sum of moveable body surface BSA and non-moveable BSA. Higher numbers = greater body surface area affected.</description>

          -  The effects of imatinib mesylate on the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose are unknown.

        For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
        contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
        entry, for the duration of study participation, and for six months following completion of
        therapy.

        Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
        study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        All patients or their legal guardian (for patients less than 18 years old) must sign an
        institutional review board (IRB) approved document of informed consent (chronic graft
        versus host disease (cGVHD) natural history or any National Cancer Institute (NCI) protocol
        allowing for screening procedures) prior to performing studies to determine patient
        eligibility.

        After confirmation of patient eligibility all patients or their legal guardian must sign
        the protocol-specific informed consent.

        Pediatric patients will be included in age appropriate discussions and age appropriate
        assent will be obtained in accordance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines.

          -  Durable Power of Attorney (DPA): All patients 18 years of age at the time of
             enrollment will be offered the opportunity to assign DPA so that another person can
             make decisions about their medical care if they become incapacitated or cognitively
             impaired.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy within 4 weeks (6
             weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have
             not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks
             earlier.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents, including
             extracorporeal photopheresis.

        Patients may not have received monoclonal antibody therapy within 6 weeks.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to imatinib mesylate.

          -  Patients receiving any of the following medications or substances that are inhibitors
             or inducers of P450 3A4 are ineligible.

        Use of the following medications must be discontinued at least two weeks prior to starting
        therapy:

          -  Alfuzosin

          -  Aprepitant

          -  Carbamazepine

          -  Clarithromycin

          -  Eletriptan

          -  Erythromycin

          -  Pimozide

          -  St John's Wort

          -  Warfarin

          -  A list of medications and substances known or with the potential to interact with the
             P450 3A4 isoenzyme is provided in Section 8.

        Imatinib mesylate is likely to increase the blood level of drugs that are substrates of
        CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5.

        Close monitoring is warranted when using agents metabolized by these enzymes. Grapefruit
        juice should not be consumed while on therapy.

          -  Prior treatment with imatinib mesylate or other tyrosine kinase inhibitor after the
             date of transplant.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, pulmonary, hepatic, or other organ dysfunction, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements or
             compromise the patient's ability to tolerate protocol therapy.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because imatinib mesylate is an agent with
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.

        Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
        secondary to treatment of the mother with imatinib mesylate, breastfeeding should be
        discontinued if the mother is treated with imatinib mesylate.

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             imatinib mesylate and the possibility of associated severe immunosuppression.

          -  Patients with active hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection as defined by seropositivity
             for hepatitis C or hepatitis B (HepBSAg) and elevated transaminases, as GVHD
             manifestations involving the liver will be indistinguishable and drug-toxicity
             uninterpretable.

          -  Persistent malignancy, requiring ongoing therapy.

        <title>Percent Change in Absolute Range of Motion (ROM) From Baseline to 6 Months</title>
        <description>A change in ROM is 25% or greater from baseline. A partial response required improvement in 25% or more in ROM. Progression required 25% or greater loss of ROM.Patients with negative values in the Table are those who lost ROM. Percent improvement in ROM for 1-3 target joints. For patients with &gt;1 target joint, the average ROM improvement was calculated. The average percentage change in ROM deficit from baseline to 6 months was obtained based on the number of degrees of ROM change (6 months)/total ROM deficit (baseline) at each joint.</description>

        <title>Total Skin Score at Baseline and 6 Months</title>
        <description>Total skin score was graded by the National Institutes of Health Consensus Criteria. Skin score was calculated by dividing the total score by seven domains (skin, eye, oral, joint, gastrointestinal, hepatic, pulmonary) in men and 8 domains in women (previous domains noted plus gynecologic). Total skin score is a percentage of body surface area (BSA) involvement (range 0-100%). It was calculated from the sum of moveable body surface BSA and non-moveable BSA. Higher numbers = greater body surface area affected.</description>

        <title>Lung Function Score at Baseline and 6 Months</title>
        <description>Lung function was graded by the National Institutes of Health Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease organ response criteria. The Lung function score = forced expiratory volume 1 (FEV1) score + carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) score, with a possible range of 2 (better outcome)-12 (worst outcome). The percent predicted FEV1 and DLCO (adjusted for hematocrit but not alveolar volume) should be converted to a numeric score as follows: &gt;80% =1; 70-79% = 2; 60-69% = 3; 50-59% = 4; 40-49% = 5; &lt;40% = 6.</description>
