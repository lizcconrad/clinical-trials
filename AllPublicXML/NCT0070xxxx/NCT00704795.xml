  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to evaluate the potential role of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in the
      postprandial hyperglucagonemia, which characterizes type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) (as well
      as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)), we wish to investigate the secretion of glucagon in
      patients with T1DM without residual beta-cell function during 50-g oral glucose tolerance
      test (OGTT) and during isoglycemic iv glucose infusion. By evaluating C-peptide negative
      patients with T1DM we aim to describe the glucagon response to glucose (+/-stimulation of the
      GI tract) independently of the potentially very important regulation of glucagon secretion by
      endogenous insulin secretion. A more detailed understanding of the inappropriate glucagon
      secretion in T1DM is highly needed in order to establish new intervention strategies in the
      future treatment of the growing numbers of T1DM patients.
