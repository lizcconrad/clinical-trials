    <textblock>
      In this trial, all subjects were (pre)treated daily with subcutaneous triptorelin, a GnRH
      agonist which is known to provide profound suppression of endogenous LH and FSH. It was
      evaluated whether these down-regulated subjects show an appropriate ovarian response to 100
      μg or 150 μg Org 36286 during the first week of stimulation. To evaluate this, follicular
      growth was measured by USS, and serum inhibin-B and E2 levels were assessed.
