    <textblock>
      Na誰ve patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) of any genotype will be treated with a standard
      treatment regimen (pegylated interferon and ribavirin) according to routine clinical practice
      in Russia. The objective of this study is to examine the influence of insulin resistance on
      the safety and efficacy of treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin and to determine
      the prevalence of insulin resistance in different populations of CHC patients.

    <description>Sustained Virological response (SVR) was assessed at the end of the study (Visit 4) to investigate the presence or absence of SVR. SVR was defined as undetectable plasma hepatitis C virus RNA (HCV-RNA) at 24 weeks after termination of treatment.

    <description>Virological relapse (VR) was assessed at the end of the study (Visit 4) by HCV genotype (I, II, III, or other) and presence of insulin-resistance at baseline (defined as HOMA-IR &gt;3) to investigate the percentage of participants who demonstrated VR. VR was defined as undetectable plasma HCV-RNA (RFT +) at end of treatment (Visit 3- considered Week 24 or Week 48 after treatment start depending on treatment duration), but lost RFT (considered sustained non-Responders) at end of study (Visit 4- considered Week 48 or Week 72 depending on a treatment duration of 24 or 48 weeks respectively).</description>

    <description>Early Virological response (EVR) was assessed at 12 weeks after treatment start (Visit 2) by HCV genotype (I, II, III, or other) and presence of insulin-resistance at baseline (defined as HOMA-IR &gt;3) to investigate the percentage of participants who achieved EVR. EVR was defined as a substantial (greater than 2 log10) decrease in viral load (measured as International Units/milliliter) and/or negative Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based viral load qualitative result as assessed at visit 2 of the study.</description>

SVR was defined as undetectable plasma HCV-RNA at 24 weeks after termination of treatment. Visit 4 was considered Week 48 or Week 72 depending on a treatment duration of 24 or 48 weeks respectively.</description>

Each dose of pegylated interferon was administered as a subcutaneous injection calculated as 1.5 mcg/kg once a week. The doses were corrected in case adverse events related to pegylated interferon registered. Ribavirin was taken orally as 200 mg gelatinous capsules. The daily dose varied from 800 to 1200 mg (depending on patient's body weight) twice daily in the morning and in the evening with meal. Therapy duration varied from 24 to 48 weeks depending on HCV genotype, viral load, activity and stage of hepatitis C.</description>

            <description>Subgroup of na誰ve patients with CHC of any genotype and a presence of insulin resistance at baseline treated with a standard treatment regimen of pegylated interferon and ribavirin according to routine clinical practice in Russia. Each dose of pegylated interferon was administered as a subcutaneous injection calculated as 1.5 mcg/kg once a week. The doses were corrected in case adverse events related to pegylated interferon registered. Ribavirin was taken orally as 200 mg gelatinous capsules. The daily dose varied from 800 to 1200 mg (depending on patient's body weight) twice daily in the morning and in the evening with meal. Therapy duration varied from 24 to 48 weeks depending on HCV genotype, viral load, activity and stage of hepatitis C.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Early Virological Response as Assessed at Visit 2 by HCV Genotype and Presence of Insulin-Resistance at Baseline</title>
          <description>Early Virological response (EVR) was assessed at 12 weeks after treatment start (Visit 2) by HCV genotype (I, II, III, or other) and presence of insulin-resistance at baseline (defined as HOMA-IR &gt;3) to investigate the percentage of participants who achieved EVR. EVR was defined as a substantial (greater than 2 log10) decrease in viral load (measured as International Units/milliliter) and/or negative Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based viral load qualitative result as assessed at visit 2 of the study.</description>
          <population>Completer set for the primary analysis (N=223) included all participants who were administered at least one dose of the study treatment and provided the SVR data at end of study. Of the 223 participants in this population, 210 participants demonstrated early virological response (N=158 and N=50). 2 participants of the 210 had missing values.</population>
