    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the low-density
      lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering in an Indonesian population treated with ezetimibe
      co-administered with a statin in routine daily practice. In addition, the study will
      investigate whether and to what extent the target levels set by the participating doctors are
      achieved by the co-administration therapy.
