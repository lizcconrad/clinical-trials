  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that IV or SQ Treprostinil can improve 6 minute walk distance, hemodynamics
      and quality of life in patients with interstitial lung disease and severe secondary pulmonary
      arterial hypertension.

      Patients with pulmonary hypertension complicating pulmonary fibrosis are at increased risk of
      death. There are no therapies proven to be effective in this population, targeting the
      pulmonary hypertension. The purpose of this study is to evaluate parenteral treprostinil in
      an open-label fashion in patients with pulmonary fibrosis and an advanced PH phenotype.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Eligible subjects must have IPF and severe PAH documented on standard of care right-heart
        catheterization (RHC) and planned to receive therapy with treprostinil as recommended by
        the treating physician.

          1. All subjects must have high resolution CT scan (HRCT) diagnostic of IPF (performed as
             part of standard of care evaluation) or if available, biopsy proven histological usual
             interstitial pneumonia (UIP).

          2. Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension defined as a resting mean pulmonary artery
             pressure (mPAP) &gt; 35 mm Hg; AND pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) &gt; 3 woods-units;
             AND pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) &lt; 18 mm Hg by right-heart
             catheterization (RHC) performed as part of standard of care evaluation.

          3. All subjects must be planned to receive treprostinil therapy as recommended by their
             treating physician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute or chronic impairment other than dyspnea (e.g. angina pectoris, intermittent
             claudication) limiting the ability to perform standard of care six-minute walk tests
             (6MWT).

          2. Six-minute walk distance (6MWD) &lt; 50 meters at screening or baseline standard of care
             evaluations

          3. Standard of care pulmonary function test (PFT) showing forced expiratory volume in one
             second (FEV1)/ forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio &lt; 0.65

          4. Standard of care pulmonary function test (PFT) showing a residual volume &gt;120%
             predicted

          5. Standard of care high-resolution chest computed tomography (HRCT) showing emphysema
             extent &gt; 30%

          6. Any investigational therapy as part of a clinical trial for any indication with 30
             days before screening

          7. Change in dose of treatment for IPF - investigational agent (gamma interferon-1b,
             pirfenidone, etanercept, and any other investigational agent intended to treat IPF),
             corticosteroids, or cytotoxic agents, within 30 days before screening. That is,
             subjects can be on any of these agents provided the dose is stable for at least 30
             days prior to enrollment.

          8. Current treatment for pulmonary hypertension with other prostaglandins (epoprostenol
             or iloprost)

          9. Change in dose of treatment for PAH - (bosentan, sitaxsentan, ambrisentan, tadalafil,
             sildenafil, vardenafil, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, digitalis), within 30 days
             before screening. That is, subjects can be on any of these agents provided the dose is
             stable for at least 30 days prior to enrollment

         10. Pulmonary rehabilitation initiated within 30 days of baseline.
