    <textblock>
      Symptoms of vaginitis are common among adolescent females, although studies have shown that
      neither experienced clinicians nor patients can accurately diagnose the cause of vaginitis
      based on symptoms alone. The purpose of this study is to investigate the accuracy and
      acceptability of self-diagnostic methods for vaginitis in adolescent females.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaginal symptoms are common among adolescent females. Vaginal symptoms can result from
      alterations in the normal flora such as candidiasis or bacterial vaginosis (BV), or from
      sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as trichomonas vaginalis (Tv). However, studies
      have shown that neither experienced clinicians or patients can accurately diagnose the
      etiology of vaginitis based on symptoms alone, and the standard evaluation (pelvic
      examination and wet mount) has limitations.

      As an alternative to the standard evaluation, there are several objective, point-of-care
      tests that can be performed on vaginal secretions, which could be useful in discriminating
      between the various causes of vaginitis. These include a rapid test for trichomonas
      vaginalis, a rapid test for bacterial vaginosis, and the vaginal pH and amine test. The aims
      of this study are to explore the feasibility, accuracy (e.g., correlation, sensitivity,
      specificity) and acceptability of self-performed versus clinician-performed tests for
      vaginitis in adolescent females.

      Approximately 300 adolescent females will undergo self- and clinician-testing for both STI
      and non-STI vaginitis. Subjects will be randomized into two groups. Group 1 will perform
      self-testing for the first half of the study before receiving clinician-testing for the
      remainder of the study. Group 2 participants will receive clinician-testing for the first
      half of the study before performing self-testing for the remainder of the study. All
      participants will have a discussion with the clinician to compare the results of
      self-performed tests with the results obtained by the clinician. Investigators will assess
      their acceptance of self- and clinician-testing before testing, after testing, and after the
      discussion with the clinician.
