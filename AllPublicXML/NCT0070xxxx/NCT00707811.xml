  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trouble breathing (dyspnea) is a nonspecific symptom associated with many diseases such as
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (lung disorder in which the flow of air to the lungs is
      blocked), asthma, pneumonia, pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs),
      congestive heart failure (fluid build-up in the lungs because the heart is not pumping
      normally) and pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs). The purpose of this study is to
      test two blood markers called ST2 and IL-33. Blood markers are proteins or other compounds in
      your blood that physicians use to diagnose different diseases and to determine what the
      course of an illness will be. In preliminary research studies, ST2 and IL-33 have been
      elevated in patients with a wide variety of diseases where the lungs are the primary organs
      involved. This research study will further investigate the ability of ST2 and IL-33 to
      predict the severity of disease and the possible use of ST2 and IL-33 in the diagnosis of
      various lung diseases.
