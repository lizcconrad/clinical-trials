    <textblock>
      West Nile virus is an emerging infectious disease in the U.S. and worldwide and has been
      identified by the CDC as a significant public health risk. Since the introduction of West
      Nile virus into the U.S. in 1999, annual outbreaks have caused severe and fatal encephalitis
      in humans and equines and death in a variety of species of feral birds throughout the U.S.
      and parts of Canada. In addition, more recent findings show evidence of West Nile virus human
      and equine infection in several countries of tropical America. The virus has now been found
      in bird populations in all 48 states of the continental U.S, and human cases of West Nile
      disease have been documented in 45 states and the District of Columbia. To date, there is no
      approved commercial vaccine available for prevention of West Nile virus disease in humans.
