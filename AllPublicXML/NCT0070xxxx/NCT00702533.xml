      Background:

      - Acid-related gastrointestinal disorders are numerous and may require chronic treatment and
      maintenance, but they are often difficult to diagnose and treat. Gastric analysis is a
      critical tool for diagnosing and treating acid-related disorders; however, at present it
      requires a technically difficult procedure, using a nasogastric tube, that is costly,
      invasive, and uncomfortable. Recently a new tool, the SmartPill, has been developed that can
      measure acid levels, temperature, and pressure throughout the stomach, small intestine, and
      colon by swallowing a small capsule. Researchers are interested in comparing current methods
      of measuring stomach acid with the SmartPill by studying both healthy volunteers and
      individuals with acid-related gastrointestinal disorders.

      Objectives:

      - To evaluate the usefulness and accuracy of the SmartPill for gastric analysis, compared
      with current procedures.

      Eligibility:

        -  Phase 1A/1B: Healthy volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age.

        -  Phase 2: Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with
           Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome or acid hypersecretion.

        -  Phase 3: Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with refractory
           gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, or idiopathic gastric
           hypersecretion.

      Design:

        -  This study involves a screening visit, a 3-day inpatient study visit, and possible
           additional outpatient visits.

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, as well
           as blood and urine samples.

        -  Phase 1A/1B: Participants will have a 3-day inpatient study visit with the following
           procedures:

        -  Imaging study of the stomach (simultaneous gastric emptying scintigraphy), followed by a
           special diet for the next day s test.

        -  Gastric analysis using a nasogastric tube to collect stomach acid secretions.

        -  SmartPill study, in which participants will ingest a SmartPill and wear a monitor for 24
           to 48 hours to collect readings.

        -  Participants in Phase 1A will have a second outpatient SmartPill study 7 days after the
           first SmartPill study. Participants in Phase 1B will not have the second SmartPill
           study.

        -  Phase 2 and Phase 3: Participants will have a 3-day inpatient study visit with the
           following procedures:

        -  Imaging study of the stomach (simultaneous gastric emptying scintigraphy), followed by a
           special diet for the next day s test.

        -  Gastric analysis using a nasogastric tube to collect stomach acid secretions.

        -  SmartPill study, in which participants will ingest a SmartPill and wear a monitor for 24
           to 48 hours to collect readings.

        -  Phase 2 and 3 participants will have outpatient study visits only if directed by the
           study researchers.

      Acid related disorders are numerous and often require chronic treatment and maintenance. Many
      of these diseases are without symptoms and therefore difficult to diagnose and treat. Gastric
      analysis is the quantitative measurement of gastric acid output and is a critical tool for
      the diagnosis of acid related disorders and the ongoing assessment of therapy response. At
      present gastric analysis requires a technically difficult procedure, using gastric aspiration
      through a nasogastric tube, that is costly, invasive, and uncomfortable for patients.
      Recently there is introduction of the SmartPill, which is a disposable pill that measures pH,
      temperature, and pressure throughout the GI tract. We propose a pilot study to validate a new
      method of gastric analysis with the ingestion of the SmartPill with a meal of a known
      buffering capacity to measure both the acidity and quantity of acid output in the stomach. We
      will validate this method by comparing it to the accepted gastric aspiration method under
      maximally stimulated conditions. We will study healthy volunteers for the validation phase
      and then study patients with known acid related disorders to assess its usefulness in
      patients. Interested subjects will report to the NIH outpatient gastrointestinal clinic for
      evaluation to be followed by a 3 day in-patient admission and 2 subsequent clinic visits.
      Subjects will have gastric analysis of basal, meal stimulated, and pharmacologically
      stimulated rates with both the conventional and study methods. Outcomes will include a
      quantitative measurement of gastric acid output in unit time, normal meal stimulated acid
      output values in healthy volunteers and patients with acid related disorders, and the
      assessment of acid suppression in patients treated with a variety of anti-secretory
      medications.
