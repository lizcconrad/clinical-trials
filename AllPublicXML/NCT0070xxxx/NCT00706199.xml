    <textblock>
      Antigen expression levels in bone marrow from volunteering donors will be analyzed. The
      results of this analysis will be used to establish a clinical test to identify cancer
      patients who could qualify to receive an investigational treatment being developed by
      GlaxoSmithKline.
