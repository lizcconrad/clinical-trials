      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Traditional Chinese Treatment(TCT)
      on insulin sensitivity and other related factors in type 2 diabetes by using an double-blind,
      randomized, parallel control and prospective study This traditional compound Chinese herb
      preparation is referred to this study, with three kinds of plants: 50 mg of Coptis Chinensis,
      30 mg of Astragalus mambranesceus and 120 mg of Lonicera Japonica, all of which are selected
      by The Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences among those traditionally considered effective and
      safe in the treatment of diabetes.

      Patients enrolled were randomized into TCT group and placebo group administrated with TCT and
      placebo respectively. Glucose disposal rate (GDR), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial
      plasma glucose (PPG), HbA1C and other metabolic components were assessed at baseline and end
      point
