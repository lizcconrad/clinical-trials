  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exogenously administered testosterone will override the normal negative feedback of
      endogenous testosterone on the hypothalamus and pituitary. Constantly, relatively high and
      constant testosterone levels will cause a drop in FSH and LH production by the pituitary.
      Since FSH and LH are signalling hormones to the testes, endogenous testosterone production
      and spermatogenesis will be down-regulated. It is expected that intranasal dosing in the
      morning will mimic the normal physiological pattern of testosterone production thereby
      avoiding negative side-effects on spermatogenesis. Trans-dermal gels give testosterone levels
      more or less constant over the day and will very likely have inhibitory effects on
      spermatogenesis.

      The main objective of this study is to show that twice daily intranasal dosing does not have,
      or has a smaller inhibitory effect on spermatogenesis in comparison to transdermal
      testosterone gels.
