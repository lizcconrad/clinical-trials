      This first phase of a two-phase study involves three components:

        1. Review of existing linkage-to-care protocols and sources of referrals for care;

        2. Semi-structured telephone or face-to-face interviews with a minimum of two personnel per
           site who are associated with linkage to medical care. (Preference will be given to
           personnel with direct experience in linkage to care); and

        3. Structured observations of referral sessions.

        Component 1: The object of study is a collection of documents on existing linkage-to-care
        protocols and does not constitute a population. Component 2: Ideally, a minimum of two
        clinical staff and/or case managers from each of 15 AMTU and a minimum of one staff member
        representing the AMTU's community partners/sites where linkage to care activities occur.
        Component 3- Structured Observations: Clinical site staff providing linkage to care
        counseling. Please note that patients are not part of this study population. See Section
        5.3 and Section 10.0 for additional details.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Component 1: Documents identified by clinical site personnel as pertaining to

             linkage to care; or persons involved in posttest counseling and linkage-to-care
             processes. Clinical staff and case managers are chosen based on direct experience in
             the assistance of HIV seropositive youth obtaining medical care. This definition
             includes, but is not limited to, physicians, nurses, psychologists, social workers,
