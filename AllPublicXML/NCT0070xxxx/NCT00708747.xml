  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from systemic inflammatory response syndrome
      (SIRS) remain high. The primary aim of the present study is to assess the efficacy of a
      standardized 5% serum-protein solution containing immunoglobulins on serum cytokine levels.
      The secondary aim is to evaluate survival of the patients.

      Out of 40 patients randomised, 18 patients received albumin, 20 patients received Biseko and
      2 patients died before receiving the complete study medication. During days 1-6 of the study
      period, serum-levels of IL-1ß were significantly lower in patients with Biseko-therapy
      compared to patients receiving albumin (IL-1ß-Area under the curve 65.04 ± 71.09 days.pg/ml
      and 111.05 ± 156.97 days.pg/ml respectively, P=0.03). No difference could be found in
      serum-levels of IL-6, TNF-α and TNF-R between both groups. While a statistically not
      significant trend towards better survival was observed in the Biseko-group on day 28, the
      survival rate on day 180 was significantly higher in the Biseko-group [9/18 (50%)] vs.
      albumin- group [2/20 (10%), (P=0.008)].

      Conclusion: Data suggest that Biseko treatment was associated with significantly lower IL-1ß
      plasma concentrations (d1 to 6) and improved long-term survival rates.

      The data provided in our study are the first to be collected in a randomized, controlled
      trial. Certainly, the small number of patients and the variety of diseases limit our study,
      however, the variety of diseases reflects the realistic large scale of morbidity in the
      medical intensive care unit.
