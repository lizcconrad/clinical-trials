      Background:

      Stroke and myocardial infarction are leading causes of death and disability in the
      industrialized countries. Multiple interactions exist between the various forms of
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and several risk factors for the development of
      stroke and major cardiovascular diseases are similar, as emphasized by the recent publication
      of a common set of guidelines for the primary prevention of both. Following myocardial
      infarction the stroke incidence is markedly increased, particular early after myocardial
      infarction. Additionally, non-stroke cardiovascular disease, especially coronary artery
      disease, is the main cause of long-term mortality in patients surviving cerebrovascular
      diseases. The history of ischemic heart disease in stroke patients is often unreliable
      because of cognitive and language impairments or simply because ischemic heart disease is
      asymptomatic. For at least 25 years myocardial damage has repeatedly been proposed as a
      consequence of an acute stroke, i.e. being neuromediated. Most prior studies were performed
      in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, and consequently only limited data regarding
      ischemic stroke, the most common cerebrovascular ailment, are available. Recently it has been
      demonstrated that highly sensitive and specific markers for the detection of myocardial
      necrosis, i.e., cardiac troponins, may be elevated in 0 % - 34 % of patients with ischemic
      stroke. However, the majority of the studies conducted have not sufficiently evaluated
      coexisting coronary artery disease. The neuromediated theory has been supported in patients
      with subarachnoid hemorrhage and elevated troponin levels due to lack of significant
      obstructive coronary artery disease evaluated by coronary angiograms. Little is known about a
      conceivable cause-effect relationship between acute ischemic stroke and myocardial necrosis,
      i.e., neuromediation, or if the elevated levels of troponin are caused by direct cardiac
      damage, i.e., AMI.

      Recently, several reports have demonstrated that levels of natriuretic peptides are increased
      in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The hormone Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) and its
      split product (NT-proBNP) derives predominantly from the myocardium and is processed as a
      response to stretch of cardiomyocytes and hemodynamic stress. The mechanism of elevated
      levels of NT-proBNP in the setting of acute ischemic stroke is unknown. Myocardial ischemia
      is known to cause release of NT-proBNP. Accordingly, levels of NT-proBNP are higher in acute
      ischemic stroke patients with ST-segment depression on 12-lead ECG than in those without.
      However, it is unknown whether levels of NT-proBNP are correlated to coronary
      arteriosclerosis and left ventricle function in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

      The current gold standard for the detection of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD),
      invasive coronary angiography (CAG), allows direct visualization of the coronary artery
      lumen. Inconvenience to patients and a small but not negligible risk of complications related
      to CAG have prompted an intensive search for alternative, reliable non-invasive means of
      coronary artery visualisation. Standard non-invasive methods such as stress testing lack
      sufficient sensitivity in detecting significant CAD. Over the last decade multislice computed
      tomography (MSCT) has emerged as a promising non-invasive method in the assessment of CAD.
      Previous studies have convincingly demonstrated a very high negative predictive value of MSCT
      coronary angiography (CTA) with CAG as the reference. Thus, a normal CTA seems to allow the
      clinician to rule out the presence of hemodynamic relevant coronary artery stenoses with a
      high degree of reliability. In addition to detecting significant coronary artery stenosis,
      recent focus has been on visualising and characterising coronary artery plaques. Both
      necropsy and coronary intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) studies have shown that &quot;normal&quot;
      vessels at CAG may in fact contain a significant amount of atherosclerotic plaques.
      Independent of the degree of coronary artery stenosis, some plaques may be at increased risk
      of erosion or rupture. The latter, unstable plaques are thought to trigger acute coronary
      ischemic events. Accordingly, the release of troponins, NT-proBNP and ECG changes observed in
      these patients could be due to CAD. So far serial investigation of CAD has never been
      performed in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

      Objective:

      The specific objectives of this thesis are in a cohort of patients with an acute ischemic
      stroke,

        1. To establish the degree of coronary arteriosclerosis.

        2. To describe left ventricular systolic and diastolic function in relation to changes of
           NT-proBNP.

      Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Age ≥ 18 years old

        2. Symptoms suggestive of an acute ischemic stroke

        3. Informed consent

      Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Present intracerebral or subarachnoid haemorrhage

        2. Present intracerebral vascular malformation

        3. Present transient ischemic attack

        4. Prior coronary bypass surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention

        5. Pacemaker

        6. Allergy to contrast

        7. Lack of cooperation

      Clinical evaluation:

      All patients included in the study will have a computed tomography scan performed at the time
      of admission. The patients included undergo a baseline clinical evaluation, a structured
      interview and examination of medical records focusing at

        -  Hypertension

        -  Dyslipidemia

        -  Diabetes mellitus

        -  Smoking

        -  Alcohol consumption

        -  Medication

        -  Atrial fibrillation

        -  Ischemic heart disease

        -  Angina Pectoris (CCS classification)

        -  Heart failure (NYHA- and KILLIP-classification)

        -  Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease

      Electrocardiography:

      A 12-lead resting ECG is obtained immediately on admission and up to each of the following
      five days in the morning. The 12-lead resting ECGs were recorded in the supine position with
      a paper speed of 25 mm/s. All ECGs are interpreted by two experienced cardiologist under
      blinded conditions. The ECG findings of interest in this thesis are horizontal or downsloping
      ST-segment depression ≥0.1 mV, T-wave inversion ≥0.1 mV in two or more contiguous leads, and
      ST-segment elevation ≥0.2 mV in leads V1-3; ST-elevation ≥0.1 mV in other leads.

      Holter monitoring:

      Holter 24-hour ECG recordings are performed with Reynolds Medical Tracker 3 and a Pathfinder
      700 (Reynolds Medical Limited, England) for analysis. An ischemic episode is defined as ≥0.1
      mV of horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression compared to baseline, measured 80 ms
      after the J-point. An episode of ST-segment depression has to last ≥2 minutes in order to
      count and two episodes have to be separated by at least two minutes. In patients with resting
      ST-segment depression additional ≥0.1 mV ST-segment depression has to be present. Every
      episode of ST-segment deviation is verified by ECG printouts (25 mm/s). Furthermore, Holter
      monitoring will be analyzed for occurrence of atrial arrhythmias. Evaluation of ischemic and
      arrhythmias episodes is interpreted visually by two cardiologist blinded to other patient
      characteristics.

      Blood Sampling:

      Blood samples are drawn immediately on admission and up to each of the following five days in
      the morning. Specimens for NT-proBNP, troponin T and I, CK-MB, myeloperoxidase, oxidated
      low-density lipoprotein, osteoprotegerin are collected. All analyses are performed at the
      Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Vejle Hospital.

      Echocardiography:

      Doppler echocardiography will be performed as soon as the patient condition allows.
      Examinations will be performed on a GE medical Vivid 7 ultrasound machine. Images will be
      obtained from the parasternal and apical windows. M-mode recordings will be done in the
      parasternal long-axis view. Pulsed Doppler measurements of mitral inflow will be obtained
      with the transducer in the apical four-chamber view, with a 1-2 mm Doppler sample volume
      placed between the tips of mitral leaflets during diastole. Tissue Doppler imaging of the
      mitral annulus will be obtained from the apical 4-chamber view with a 1.5-mm sample volume
      placed at the medial mitral annulus. All Doppler echocardiographic examinations are done with
      horizontal sweep set to 100 mm/s. At least 3-5 cardiac cycles will be measured. Finally color
      coded real time tissue Doppler images will be acquired in the apical windows.

        -  End-systolic, end-diastolic volume and ejection fraction will be calculated according to
           the Simpson modified biplane method.

        -  LV mass will be estimated using the recommendations of the American Society of
           Echocardiography.

        -  Maximal left atrial volume will be measured at end-systole with the use of two
           orthogonal apical views.

        -  From the pulsed wave mitral inflow signal, peak E wave velocity, peak A wave velocity,
           and mitral E-wave deceleration time will be measured. From pulsed wave Doppler recording
           of LV outflow ejection time will be recorded. From these recordings Tei index will be
           assessed.

        -  From peak tricuspid regurgitant velocity and size of inferior v. cava pulmonary arterial
           systolic pressure will be estimated.

        -  From the tissue Doppler assessment of the medial mitral annulus early (E') diastolic
           velocity will be recorded. Diastolic function will be graded in grades 0-3 and diastolic
           E/e' ratio calculated.

        -  From color coded tissue Doppler images systolic longitudinal fibre shortening will be
           assessed using tissue tracking, and systolic strain will be assessed on a regional
           basis.

      Multislice computed tomography coronary angiography:

      Examinations are performed at the Department of Cardiology, Vejle Hospital with dual source
      CT (DSCT) scanner technology (Siemens Definition; Forcheim, Germany). Tube voltage is 120kV
      for both tubes, current 560 mA with modulation and full current between 25 % - 80 % of the RR
      interval. Gantry rotation time is 330 msec, pitch is 0.20-0.44 according to the heart rate.
      Per rotation 64 slices are generated with a collimation of 0.6 mm resulting in an isotropic
      voxel size of approximately 0.6 mm. A bodyweight adapted volume of contrast agent (Iomeron
      350) is injected continuously at rate of 5 ml /sec. The scan is initiated according to a
      bolus tracking protocol (aortic root attenuation level of 100 HU). Axial images are
      reconstructed with 0.75 mm slice thickness, and a 0.5 mm increment using a medium sharp
      kernel (B26) and retrospective ECG gating. The reconstructions are performed in 5 % steps
      over the relevant part of the RR cycle using a single-segment algorithm. In case of atrial
      fibrillation, data sets were reconstructed in 50 ms steps. Using a semi-automated Hounsfield
      dependent algorithm, differentiation between contrast enhanced lumen, vessel wall and
      atherosclerotic plaques, is performed. Atherosclerotic plaques will be categorized into
      calcified (&gt;130 HU, high density plaque), non-calcified (&lt; 60 HU, low density plaque), and
      mixed-type plaques (60-130 HU, intermediate density plaque), respectively. According to an
      American Heart Association 17 segmental coronary artery model, stenoses &gt; 50 % or &gt; 75 % are
      registered. Main coronary vessels (left main, left anterior descending artery, circumflex,
      and the right coronary artery) and side branches with a lumen diameter &gt; 1, 5 mm are
      analysed. Image quality will be assessed as good (no artefacts related to motion,
      calcification or noise), satisfactory (artefacts present, but assessment of artery stenosis
      possible), or unsatisfactory (artefacts compromising the evaluation of artery stenosis).
      Images are analysed by two independent observes without knowledge of the patient history.
