  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current trial was designed to investigate the effects of 4.0 mg.kg-1 of sugammadex on
      efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics in subjects with severe renal impairment in comparison
      to subjects with normal renal function.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The results of previous trials showed that the safety profile of sugammadex

      observed in subjects with impaired renal function are not appreciably different from subjects
      with normal renal function. Reoccurrence of neuromuscular blockade was not observed, and
      sugammadex was safe and generally well tolerated in subjects with severe renal impairment. In
      a previous trial, subjects (n=15) with severe renal impairment received a dose of 2.0 mg.kg-1
      of sugammadex. The effects of the other proposed recommended dose for routine reversal, 4.0
      mg.kg-1, on efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics had not been studied thus far in subjects
      with severe renal impairment. The objectives of this trial were to assess equivalence with
      respect to the efficacy of sugammadex in subjects with normal renal function or severe renal
      impairment, to evaluate the safety of sugammadex in these subject groups and to compare the
      pharmacokinetic profiles.

this dose, maintenance doses of 0.1 - 0.2 mg.kg-1

neuromuscular blockade has to be maintained at 1-2 post-tetanic counts (PTC). After the last dose of rocuronium has been administered, the subject will receive a single bolus dose of 4.0 mg.kg-1 sugammadex at a target depth of blockade of 1-2 PTC.</description>

        <description>Neuromuscular functioning was monitored by applying repetitive train of four (TOF) electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. Nerve stimulation continued until the ratio of the magnitude of the fourth twitch (T4) to first twitch (T1) reached at least 0.9. The greater the T4/T1 ratio the greater the recovery from neuromuscular blockade, with a value of 1.0 representing full recovery.</description>
