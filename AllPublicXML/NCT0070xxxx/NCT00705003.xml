      The primary objective of this study are to evaluate the synergistic effect of a combination
      product, consisting of drug BCI-024 (buspirone) and drug BCI-049 (melatonin), in reducing
      symptoms of depression in patients with Major Depressive Disorder.

      The safety and tolerability of the combination product will also be evaluated as measured by
      adverse events and vital signs.

    <measure>The Score on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impression (CGI) is a standardized, clinician-rated assessment designed to allow the clinician to rate severity of illness, change over time, and pharmacologic treatment effects with consideration of the patient's clinical condition and the severity of side effects experienced (Guy 1976). Specifically, it consists of two global subscales: Global Improvement (CGI-I) Severity of Illness (CGI-S)
The CGI-I was administered at Weeks 2, 4 and 6. The CGI-I evaluation was performed with instruction to &quot;Rate the patient's total improvement whether or not, in your judgment, it is due entirely to drug treatment.&quot; The Investigator was asked &quot;Compared to the patient's condition at the Baseline visit, please assign a rating to how much the patient changed.&quot; Responses for the CGI-I evaluation included the following categories:
0: Not Assessed
Very much improved
Much improved
Minimally improved
No change
Minimally worse
Much worse
Very much worse</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Change From Baseline in the CGI-S at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impression (CGI) is a standardized, clinician-rated assessment designed to allow the clinician to rate severity of illness, change over time, and pharmacologic treatment effects with consideration of the patient's clinical condition and the severity of side effects experienced (Guy 1976). The CGI-S is a sub-scale of the Clinical Global Impression. The Investigator was asked: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with patients with this particular population, please assign a rating to how mentally ill the subject is at this time.&quot;
Possible responses include the following:
0: Not Assessed
Normal, not ill at all
Borderline mentally ill
Mildly ill
Moderately ill
Markedly ill
Severely ill
Among the most extremely ill patients. The change from baseline CGI-S score was calculated as the baseline CGI-S score minus the post-baseline CGI-S score, such that a positive change indicated an improvement from baseline.</description>

    <measure>The Change From Baseline in the IDS-C30 at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology is a 30-item scale that assesses criteria including mood, concentration, self criticism, suicidal ideation, interest, energy/fatigue, sleep, decrease/increase in appetite or weight, psychomotor agitation or retardation, diurnal mood variation, capacity for pleasure, sexual interest, bodily aches and pains, panic or phobic symptoms, digestive problems, interpersonal rejection sensitivity, and leaden paralysis. Items are scored on a 4 point scale with 0 reflecting no symptoms and 3 reflecting symptoms of maximum severity. The total score is calculated by summing the scores from 28 of the 30 items. Only one of items 11 or 12, and only one of items 13 or 14 are scored. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 84. A score of 84 indicates maximum severity of depressive symptoms. Change from baseline is calculated as the baseline score minus the post-baseline score. A positive change indicates improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Change From Baseline in the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - 16 Item Self-Report (QIDS-SR16) at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The QIDS-SR16 is a 16 question, patient rated scale that assesses the 9 Diagnostic &amp; Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV-Text Revision criterion diagnostic symptom domains including sad mood, concentration, self criticism, suicidal ideation, interest, energy/fatigue, sleep disturbance, decrease or increase in appetite or weight, &amp; psychomotor agitation or retardation. Each item is measured on a scale of 0 to 3. To find total score, you enter:
highest score from items 1-4 (Sleep Items)
item 5 score
highest score from items 6-9 (appetite/weight)
item 10 score
item 11 score
item 12 score
item 13 score
item 14 score
highest score from items 15-16 (psychomotor) These 9 scores are summed to find total score. Total minimum score is 0 units on a scale &amp; total maximum score is 27 units, where higher scores indicate more severe depression. Change from baseline is calculated as baseline score minus Week 6 score. A positive change indicates improvement</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Change From Baseline on the HAM-A at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The 14-item HAM-A scale rates the patient's level of anxiety based on feelings of anxiousness, tension, and depression; any phobias, sleep disturbance, or difficulty in concentrating; the presence of genitourinary, cardiovascular, respiratory, autonomic or somatic symptoms; and the interviewer's assessment of the patient's appearance and behavior during the interview. Each item is to be scored on a 5 point scale with 0 reflecting no symptoms and 4 reflecting symptoms of maximum symptom severity (Hamilton 1960).
The items are summed to find the total score. The total minimum score is 0 units on a scale and the total maximum score is 56 units on a scale, where higher scores indicate more severe anxiety. Change from baseline is calculated as baseline score minus Week 6 score. A positive change indicates improvement.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be male and female subjects between the ages of 18 to 65 meeting the
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV-Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR)
             criteria for Major Depressive Disorder with a Quick Inventory of Depressive
             Symptomatology-16 Item Self Report (QIDS-SR16) score of &gt;14 at the Screening and
             Baseline Visits.

          -  Female subjects must be on a stable and medically reliable form of birth control, must
             agree to continue use of this birth control during the study, and must have negative
             urine pregnancy tests at the Screening Visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with any other psychiatric Axis-I disorder as a principal diagnosis within 6
             months of screening or subjects with a history of obsessive compulsive disorder,
             psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, or mental retardation at any time are not
             eligible for the study.

          -  Subjects who pose a suicidal risk or who have a history of eating disorder or
             substance dependence within 6 months of screening, or a history of substance abuse

        <title>The Score on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) at Week 6</title>
        <description>Clinical Global Impression (CGI) is a standardized, clinician-rated assessment designed to allow the clinician to rate severity of illness, change over time, and pharmacologic treatment effects with consideration of the patient’s clinical condition and the severity of side effects experienced (Guy 1976). Specifically, it consists of two global subscales: Global Improvement (CGI-I) Severity of Illness (CGI-S)
The CGI-I was administered at Weeks 2, 4 and 6. The CGI-I evaluation was performed with instruction to “Rate the patient’s total improvement whether or not, in your judgment, it is due entirely to drug treatment.” The Investigator was asked “Compared to the patient’s condition at the Baseline visit, please assign a rating to how much the patient changed.” Responses for the CGI-I evaluation included the following categories:
0: Not Assessed
Very much improved
Much improved
Minimally improved
No change
Minimally worse
Much worse
Very much worse</description>

        <population>142 subjects were enrolled and randomized in the study. 8 of these subjects were randomized but never received study drug. Subjects included in the MITT analysis received at least 1 dose of study drug and provided at least 1 post-baseline CGI-I assessment. Subjects included in the analysis of safety received at least 1 dose of study drug.</population>

        <title>The Change From Baseline in the CGI-S at Week 6</title>
        <description>Clinical Global Impression (CGI) is a standardized, clinician-rated assessment designed to allow the clinician to rate severity of illness, change over time, and pharmacologic treatment effects with consideration of the patient’s clinical condition and the severity of side effects experienced (Guy 1976). The CGI-S is a sub-scale of the Clinical Global Impression. The Investigator was asked: “Considering your total clinical experience with patients with this particular population, please assign a rating to how mentally ill the subject is at this time.”
Possible responses include the following:
0: Not Assessed
Normal, not ill at all
Borderline mentally ill
Mildly ill
Moderately ill
Markedly ill
Severely ill
Among the most extremely ill patients. The change from baseline CGI-S score was calculated as the baseline CGI-S score minus the post-baseline CGI-S score, such that a positive change indicated an improvement from baseline.</description>

        <title>The Change From Baseline in the IDS-C30 at Week 6</title>
        <description>The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology is a 30-item scale that assesses criteria including mood, concentration, self criticism, suicidal ideation, interest, energy/fatigue, sleep, decrease/increase in appetite or weight, psychomotor agitation or retardation, diurnal mood variation, capacity for pleasure, sexual interest, bodily aches and pains, panic or phobic symptoms, digestive problems, interpersonal rejection sensitivity, and leaden paralysis. Items are scored on a 4 point scale with 0 reflecting no symptoms and 3 reflecting symptoms of maximum severity. The total score is calculated by summing the scores from 28 of the 30 items. Only one of items 11 or 12, and only one of items 13 or 14 are scored. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 84. A score of 84 indicates maximum severity of depressive symptoms. Change from baseline is calculated as the baseline score minus the post-baseline score. A positive change indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>The Change From Baseline in the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology – 16 Item Self-Report (QIDS-SR16) at Week 6</title>
        <description>The QIDS-SR16 is a 16 question, patient rated scale that assesses the 9 Diagnostic &amp; Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV-Text Revision criterion diagnostic symptom domains including sad mood, concentration, self criticism, suicidal ideation, interest, energy/fatigue, sleep disturbance, decrease or increase in appetite or weight, &amp; psychomotor agitation or retardation. Each item is measured on a scale of 0 to 3. To find total score, you enter:
highest score from items 1-4 (Sleep Items)
item 5 score
highest score from items 6-9 (appetite/weight)
item 10 score
item 11 score
item 12 score
item 13 score
item 14 score
highest score from items 15-16 (psychomotor) These 9 scores are summed to find total score. Total minimum score is 0 units on a scale &amp; total maximum score is 27 units, where higher scores indicate more severe depression. Change from baseline is calculated as baseline score minus Week 6 score. A positive change indicates improvement</description>

        <title>The Change From Baseline on the HAM-A at Week 6</title>
        <description>The 14-item HAM-A scale rates the patient’s level of anxiety based on feelings of anxiousness, tension, and depression; any phobias, sleep disturbance, or difficulty in concentrating; the presence of genitourinary, cardiovascular, respiratory, autonomic or somatic symptoms; and the interviewer’s assessment of the patient’s appearance and behavior during the interview. Each item is to be scored on a 5 point scale with 0 reflecting no symptoms and 4 reflecting symptoms of maximum symptom severity (Hamilton 1960).
The items are summed to find the total score. The total minimum score is 0 units on a scale and the total maximum score is 56 units on a scale, where higher scores indicate more severe anxiety. Change from baseline is calculated as baseline score minus Week 6 score. A positive change indicates improvement.</description>
