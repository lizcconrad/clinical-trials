      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of first-line HIV treatment (fixed-dose
      combination of the generic antiretroviral drugs nevirapine, stavudine and lamivudine)
      provided by the Malian National HIV Treatment Program. Antiretroviral therapy has become a
      priority because of its proven effectiveness in decreasing sickness and death from HIV
      infection. Reliable information on its efficacy is needed.

      Patients 18 years of age and older who enter the Malian National HIV Treatment Program and
      have not had prior antiretroviral treatment may be eligible for this study.

      Primary Objective

      The primary objective is to measure the virologic treatment response at 24 weeks to the
      Malian-approved fixed-dose regimen (FDC) of nevirapine, stavudine and lamivudine (Triomune)
      in patients who are na(SqrRoot) ve to antiretroviral therapy in Bamako, Mali compared to a
      historical cohort as a prelude to further clinical research investigations in Mali.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To assess the association of the 24 week response with the response at one year as
           measured by suppression of viremia to less than 50 copies/mL

        2. To evaluate the baseline clinical and HIV-associated characteristics of a cohort of
           persons who are enrolled in protocol-mandated monitoring.

      Participants undergo treatment in the government-sponsored program. Clinical visits are
      scheduled at study days 0 (antiviral therapy start day) and 14, and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12
      months. Patients undergo a medical history, including all confirmed and probably diagnoses
      made since the previous visit and current status, physical examination and blood tests for
      CD4 and viral load at each visit.

      Study start date: July 2008

      This study will assess the efficacy of HIV treatment provided in accordance with the Malian
      National HIV Treatment Program. The Malian National HIV Treatment Program uses fixe dose
      coninaison (FDC) therapy, and this study will use a historical comparison from an African
      country in which the same generic antiretoviral are used. Virologic responses of patients
      enrolled in the Malian national program will be determined and, in a non-inferiority design,
      compared to these historical controls. The study will also establish the feasibility of doing
      frequent HIV virologic monitoring in this setting.

      Viral RNA and CD4 T-cell count monitoring will be performed for HIV-infected persons seen at
      study sites. All clinical decision-making and prescription will occur outside of the
      protocol. Decisions about whether antiretroviral therapy is appropriate, the prescription of
      antiretroviral therapy, and the monitoring of treatment will be done by Malian health-care
      providers outside of the scope of the protocol. Viral RNA monitoring will be used to assess
      the endpoint of viral RNA suppression below the limit of detection (50 copies/mL).

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        HIV-infected adults (age greater than or equal to 18 years) naive to treatment with
        antiretroviral medications, who are to begin the regimen of government-sponsored
        antiretroviral treatment program or an alternate regimen in the case of HIV1 and HIV2
        coinfected individuals.

        The sole exception to naive will be a history of use of peripartum single-dose nevirapine.

        Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 8 g/dL

        Ability and willingness to provide informed consent and ability to comply with study
        requirements and visit schedule.

        Must be willing to allow stored samples to be used in the future for studying HIV disease
        and immune function.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Serologic evidence of HIV-2 infection mono-infection.

        Tuberculosis of any form for which the patient is currently undergoing treatment with or
        requires a recommended regimen containing a rifamycin antibiotic.

        Baseline medical conditions that preclude the use of the Malian fixed-dose regimen, such as
        peripheral neuropathy of any etiology and pancreatic disease.
