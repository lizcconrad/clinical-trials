  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Information on the mechanisms of zinc is still in developing phase. Ecological and biological
      implications of long term zinc supplementation at population level requires assessment. The
      trial aims to assess the impact of routine supplementation of zinc among young growing
      children and evaluate its impact on intestinal microbial flora and relationship with gut
      mucosa integrity and co-morbidities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      WHO has recommended the use of zinc for the treatment of acute diarrhea. Literature supports
      up-scaling of zinc supplementation programs to prevent childhood illnesses, such as diarrhea
      and respiratory infections, and its subsequent co-morbid conditions. As the potential
      mechanisms of action of zinc still remains to be established, this trial is proposed to
      evaluate the relationship of intestinal microbial flora, intestinal permeability, morbidity
      patterns and response to various enteric pathogens in a representative birth cohort randomly
      allocated to receive daily zinc and micronutrients from 6-18 months of age, and a control
      population.
