  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of common eye diseases such as retinal artery and vein occlusion, diabetic
      retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and anterior ischemic optic
      neuropathy are associated with ocular perfusion abnormalities. Although this is well
      recognized there is not much possibility to improve blood flow to the posterior pole of the
      eye in these diseases.

      Since many years, moxaverine is used in the therapy of perfusion abnormalities in the brain,
      the heart and the extremities. This is based on a direct vasodilator effect of the drug, but
      also on the rheological properties of red blood cells. Whether moxaverine affects blood flow
      in the eye is unknown. The present study aims to investigate whether moxaverine may improves
      blood flow in the eye after systemic administration.
