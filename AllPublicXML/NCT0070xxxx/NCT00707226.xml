  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After focusing many years only on intraocular pressure (IOP) as the primary risk factor,
      recently the impact of ocular blood flow is getting more consideration for the
      pathophysiology of glaucoma. The circadian change of intraocular pressure (IOP) is well
      investigated, but diurnal variations in ocular blood flow are yet to be evaluated, especially
      in glaucomatous eyes.

      This study is performed to investigate circadian variation of ocular blood flow assessed by
      laser interferometric fundus pulsation amplitude (FPA) and laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) in
      glaucomatous eyes during topical antiglaucoma therapy at 8:00, 12:00, 17:00 and 21:00, to
      compare these circadian variation of ocular blood flow in glaucomatous eyes with variations
      in healthy eyes and to relate blood flow variations with IOP variations.

          -  Normal findings in the medical history and physical examination unless the
             investigator considers an abnormality to be clinically irrelevant

        For the age matched control subjects:

          -  Normal findings in the medical history and physical examination unless the
             investigator considers an abnormality to be clinically irrelevant

          -  Normal laboratory values unless the investigator considers an abnormality to be
             clinically irrelevant
