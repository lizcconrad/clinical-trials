    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the effect of fluoride dentifrices on enamel with artificial caries
      lesions in an in situ model.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topical fluorides have been proven to be clinically effective in the prevention of dental
      caries. It is generally agreed that anti-caries effect of fluoride (F) is mainly by
      decreasing the rate of enamel demineralization and enhancing the rate of enamel
      remineralization. An in-situ Surface Micro-hardness (SMH) test is widely used to evaluate
      enamel demineralization and remineralization during the caries process. The aim of this study
      was to evaluate the efficacy of toothpaste formulations containing fluoride from different
      sources [sodium fluoride (NaF) and sodium monofluorophosphate (NaMFP)] using an in situ
      caries model.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Percentage Surface Microhardness Recovery (%SMHR) of Enamel Specimens Exposed to NaF/Carbopol Toothpaste (1400 ppmF), NaF Toothpaste (1350ppmF) Compared to NaMFP/NaF Toothpaste (1450ppmF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>%SMHR test was used to assess mineralization status of enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. %SMHR was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening while decrease in the indentation length represents rehardening of enamel surface. %SMHR was calculated from indentation values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), after intra-oral exposure (R) and after in-vitro demineralization (D) using formula: [(D-R)/ (D-B)]*100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Enamel Fluoride Uptake</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Enamel fluoride uptake was determined using the microdrill enamel biopsy technique. The amount of fluoride uptake by enamel was calculated based on the amount of fluoride (F) divided by the area of the enamel cores and expressed as ug F/cm2. The difference between treatments was calculated with respect to fluoride uptake by enamel.</description>

        <description>%SMHR test was used to assess mineralization status of enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. %SMHR was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening while decrease in the indentation length represents rehardening of enamel surface. %SMHR was calculated from indentation values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), after intra-oral exposure (R) and after in-vitro demineralization (D) using formula: [(D-R)/ (D-B)]*100.</description>

          <description>%SMHR test was used to assess mineralization status of enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. %SMHR was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens.
