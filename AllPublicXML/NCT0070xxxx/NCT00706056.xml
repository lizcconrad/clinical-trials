      The objective of this study is to determine whether systemic blood pressure in the body is
      related to the development and progression of normal tension glaucoma in the eye. The study
      aims to clarify whether subjects with episodes of hypotension (low blood pressure) at night
      are at increased risk for sight loss and the development of normal tension glaucoma.

      Glaucoma is an eye disease that leads to damage of the optic nerve, visual field loss and can
      progress to blindness. Traditionally, glaucoma and its treatment have been closely linked to
      intraocular pressures. In normal tension glaucoma, damage to the optic nerve occurs without
      any increase in intraocular pressure. Normal tension glaucoma most often occurs in the
      elderly and can lead to loss of sight and significant disability. Subjects with progressive
      visual field loss are often a highly motivated group of subjects, ready to take an active
      part in the treatment of their condition. Investigating the risk factors that contribute to
      the development of normal-tension glaucoma may shed light on the progression of the disease.

      Subjects with normal tension glaucoma will have their demographic and clinical
      characteristics recorded and their eyes examined at baseline, 6-months and 12 months.
      Subjects will wear an external blood pressure cuff for 48 hours that will record blood
      pressure every 30 minutes. This same blood pressure recording procedure will be performed at
      baseline, at 6 months, and at 12 months. At these same time intervals, visual fields will
      also be measured, as per routine clinical care, by the treating ophthalmologist. The results
      of the visual field testing will be recorded. The primary outcome of the study will be visual
      field abnormalities and their relationship to dips in systemic blood pressure. Results will
      be published and will be used as a base for future projects that may impact treatment and the
      understanding of risk factors of normal tension glaucoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The IOP must be less than or equal to 21 mmHg without treatment and must have never
             been higher than 24 mmHg, without treatment.

          2. Gonioscopically open angles.

          3. Typical glaucomatous optic disc changes, including: rim thinning, cupping, rim
             notching, disc hemorrhage, nerve fiber layer defect, vertical cup/disc asymmetry â‰¥0.2.

          4. A reproducible visual field defect must have been demonstrated on at least three prior
             visual fields, as observed using standard automated perimetry with Swedish Interactive
             Threshold Algorithm (SITA-STANDARD) from the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer using the
             24-2 test pattern.

          5. There must have been progression of glaucomatous loss with the past 36 months,
             specifically, two or more adjacent non-peripheral points changed by 10dB relative to
             the average baseline value for the points, confirmed by two subsequent fields.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with a visual field defect attributable to conditions other than glaucoma,
             such as a history of intra-cranial or ENT mass lesion.

          2. Occludable narrow angles.

          3. Subjects with intermittent elevation of intraocular pressure associated with another
             form of glaucoma, including intermittent angle closure, inflammatory glaucoma, old
             pigmentary glaucoma, psedoexfoliation or uveitis.

          4. Subjects who cannot complete follow-up testing every six months for any reason.

          5. Subjects who are unable to provide informed consent or who refuse or whose physicians
             do not wish for the subjects to participate for any reason.
