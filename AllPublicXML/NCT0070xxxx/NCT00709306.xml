  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed project is to investigate the efficacy and longevity of two novel
      approaches to changing skin protection behaviors: 1) UV-detect photos that reveal currently
      existing skin damage and 2) motivational interviewing (MI), a person-centered, yet directive
      counseling style used to enhance internal motivation to change health behaviors. The proposed
      investigations include a pilot study to refine the methodology; a small formal randomized
      controlled efficacy trial; and a dismantling study. These studies will also expand current
      knowledge and research in several major ways: 1) the use of UV-detect photos will enable
      highly salient and personalized feedback, 2) MI will be used in a previously untried health
      domain (skin cancer prevention), 3) objective skin color changes will be measured using
      state-of-the-art skin reflectance spectrophotometry, and 4) the proposed studies will test
      aspects of several major psychological theories (e.g., Transtheoretical Model,
      Prototype/Willingness Model) to identify moderators/mediators of outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Teens and young adults are at high risk for overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a
      leading factor in the development of skin cancer. The majority of these individuals continue
      to protect themselves minimally and tan intentionally, including significant increases in
      tanning booth use recently. Such care-free behaviors exist despite widespread
      education/awareness about UV radiation and skin cancer. The purpose of the proposed project
      is to investigate the efficacy and longevity of two novel approaches to changing skin
      protection behaviors: 1) UV-detect photos that reveal currently existing skin damage and 2)
      motivational interviewing (MI), a person-centered, yet directive counseling style used to
      enhance internal motivation to change health behaviors. The proposed investigations include a
      pilot study to refine the methodology; a small formal randomized controlled efficacy trial;
      and a dismantling study. These studies will also expand current knowledge and research in
      several major ways: 1) the use of UV-detect photos will enable highly salient and
      personalized feedback, 2) MI will be used in a previously untried health domain (skin cancer
      prevention), 3) objective skin color changes will be measured using state-of-the-art skin
      reflectance spectrophotometry, and 4) the proposed studies will test aspects of several major
      psychological theories (e.g., Transtheoretical Model, Prototype/Willingness Model) to
      identify moderators/mediators of outcome. Therefore, the studies should provide useful
      information about process and outcome for skin cancer prevention researchers and clinicians.

    <description>Participants met with a trained counselor who reviewed any personalized feedback of risk derived from the baseline assessments (e.g., history of sunburns, self-reported UV exposure, protective behaviors). Counselors utilized the basic motivational interviewing skills of open-ended questions, reflection of participant statements, affirmations/positive feedback, and summation of major points throughout the discussion. These sessions took about 22 minutes.</description>

    <description>Participants were shown a regular black and white photo and a black and white UV-filtered photo of their face. Participants were told that &quot;Any dark, spotted, freckled, wrinkled, uneven, or pitted areas indicate existing underlying skin damage that is difficult to reverse. However, protecting the skin from UV radiation can prevent future damage.&quot; Participants were asked what they noticed about the photos, what their reactions were, and how this might affect their behavior. These sessions took 12 minutes on average.</description>

Participants were told that “Any dark, spotted, freckled, wrinkled, uneven, or pitted areas indicate existing underlying skin damage that is difficult to reverse. However, protecting the skin from UV radiation can prevent future damage.” Participants were asked what they noticed about the photos, what their reactions were, and how this might affect their behavior.

          <description>The Sun Stage of Change (SOC) Scale has 4 items asking participants whether they have been protecting their skin for the past year (maintenance), if they protect their skin now (action), whether they intend to protect their skin in the next 30 days (preparation), whether they intend to protect their skin in the next year (contemplation), or none of the above (pre-contemplation).</description>

    <reported_events>
      <time_frame>Because this protocol involves low risk assessments and interventions (e.g., survey, brochure, UV picture, MI counseling, spectrophotometry), adverse event data were not collected. Because discussing cancer risk and looking at photos of UV damage may be upsetting, participants were monitored for distress at the time of baseline/intervention and any participants, however, no participants exhibited undue anxiety or concern during their participation.</time_frame>

        <group group_id="E1">
          <title>Education Control</title>
          <description>Participants were given a packet of standard skin cancer prevention educational brochures and handouts from major professional organizations to review independently for 10-15 minutes.</description>
        </group>
        <group group_id="E2">
          <title>Motivational Interviewing</title>
          <description>Participants met with a trained counselor who reviewed any personalized feedback of risk derived from the baseline assessments (e.g., history of sunburns, self-reported UV exposure, protective behaviors). Counselors utilized the basic motivational interviewing skills of open-ended questions, reflection of participant statements, affirmations/positive feedback, and summation of major points throughout the discussion. These sessions took about 22 minutes.</description>

        <group group_id="E3">
          <title>UV-detect Photos</title>
          <description>Participants were shown a regular black and white photo and a black and white UV-filtered photo of their face. Participants were told that “Any dark, spotted, freckled, wrinkled, uneven, or pitted areas indicate existing underlying skin damage that is difficult to reverse. However, protecting the skin from UV radiation can prevent future damage.” Participants were asked what they noticed about the photos, what their reactions were, and how this might affect their behavior. These sessions took 12 minutes on average.</description>

          <description>Participants met with a trained counselor who reviewed any personalized feedback of risk derived from the baseline assessments (e.g., history of sunburns, self-reported UV exposure, protective behaviors). Counselors utilized the basic motivational interviewing skills of open-ended questions, reflection of participant statements, affirmations/positive feedback, and summation of major points throughout the discussion. In addition to baseline feedback, participants were also interviewed about the black &amp; white and UV-filtered photos of their faces. These sessions took about 25 minutes.</description>
