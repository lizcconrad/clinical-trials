  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Levamisole as an immunomodulator drug has been demonstrated to improve the immune response to
      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination in hemodialysis patients. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the effect of levamisole supplementation on tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccine response
      rate in hemodialysis patients.

      Levamisole as an immunomodulator drug has been demonstrated to improve the immune response to
      HBV vaccination in hemodialysis patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of
      levamisole supplementation on Td vaccine response rate in hemodialysis patients. In this
      randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial 40 hemodialysis patients who had not
      received tetanus vaccination in a year before investigation and had unprotective anti-tetanus
      immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels (&lt;0.1 International Unit [IU]/ml) were enrolled. These patients
      were randomized into two equal groups to receive one dose of intramuscular Td vaccine
      supplemented with either levamisole 100 mg or placebo daily, six days before and six days
      after vaccination. The anti-tetanus IgG levels were measured 1 and 6 months after
      vaccination.
