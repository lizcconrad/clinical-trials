      The purpose of this study is to determine if an immune modifying drug (Ontak) alone or as
      part of a vaccine therapy will produce remissions in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.
      This research is being done because we want to find new therapies for treatment of relapsed
      or refractory (resistant to ordinary treatment) ovarian cancer. The use of ONTAK and vaccine
      therapy is research.

      A new experimental approach for treating refractory or relapsed ovarian cancer involves using
      the patients own immune system to kill the cancer cells. These immune cells are called
      monocytes and are harvested from blood. The process of Leukapheresis collects the monocytes
      called Dendritic Cells. This is usually a 3 hour process done in the comfort of a hospital
      bed in the apheresis lab, similar to giving blood for donation. Approximately 300cc's are
      collected during this process, the equivalent of about 10 ounces of blood. Once these
      dendritic cells are collected - a special laboratory grows and processes them into a vaccine
      using a patient's own tumor cells. This preparation is then given back to the patient
      hopefully to stimulate the immune system to kill cancer cells. This type of treatment is
      considered biological research.

      This study also involves a drug called ONTAK, which is made using certain proteins from
      diphtheria toxins and interleukin-2 (chemotherapy drug). This drug will act on immune
      suppressing cells normally present in your body making vaccine therapy possibly less
      effective. Ontak helps set up your immune system to be boosted by the vaccine injections. The
      use of Ontak followed by the vaccine to stimulate your tumor killing immune cells has not
      been done in ovarian cancer before and is research.

      Patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma who have failed initial curative chemotherapy
      attempts will be evaluated at the time of relapse for tumor debulking surgery prior to the
      initiation of salvage chemotherapy. If appropriate, samples will be collected for tumor
      lysate preparation for vaccination as per the existing Loyola protocol. Lysates may also be
      produced by the collection of malignant effusions as performed for palliation of symptoms.
      Patients will then receive palliative chemotherapy to a maximum tumor cytoreduction. Patients
      from whom sufficient tumor cells have been collected for DC-based vaccine production will
      undergo a leukapheresis for DC cell production. Once completed, these patients will be
      randomly assigned one of two treatment groups: Cohort (Group) 1 - Administration of a single
      dose of Ontak at 18 μg/kg followed by DC vaccination with 1 x 106 tumor lysate and KLH-loaded
      immature DCs into inguinal nodes identified by ultrasound guidance for a total of three
      injections at two week intervals; or Cohort (Group) 2 - Identical DC vaccination as in Group
      1 without Ontak pre-treatment. Patients for whom collection of tumor cells for lysate
      preparation is not possible will be assigned to Cohort (Group) 3, with administration of
      Ontak at the same dose without vaccination. In this pilot study we plan to treat 12 patients
      in each group over a two-year period of time. Therapy will begin four weeks after
      chemotherapy completion, given to achieve maximum cytoreduction prior to protocol therapy
      initiation

               -  albumin &gt;3.0 mg/dl

          -  If patients have had recent surgery, then they must be fully recovered from the
             effects of that surgery.

          -  The effects of Ontak on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose
             are unknown. Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.

        Additional eligibility requirements for vaccine therapy initiation:

          -  Patients are eligible after tumor collection for the vaccine strategy, or for those
             selected to receive ONTAK alone (group 3) because tumor is not available can enroll at
             ay time they fulfill the Eligibility Criteria. Pre-vaccination the goal is to
             establish a Minimal Residual Disease state (MRD maximum tumor diameter of any residual
             disease ≤ 1cm). This can be achieved with surgery and/or salvage chemotherapy. Ontak
             administration and/or vaccine therapy will commence at least 4 weeks after the
             completion of the last day of any of the aforementioned therapies

          -  Patients to be randomized to groups 1 and 2 must have tumor available for preparation
             of tumor lysate vaccine

          -  Women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients who have received prior anti-tumor vaccines are ineligible

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to monocolonal antibodies from Murine sources

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, active bleeding, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled bronchospasm, hypertension, hyperglycemia,
             or hypercalcemia; or psychiatric illness/social situations that in the opinion of the
             investigators would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate this treatment or
             affect compliance

          -  Pregnant and lactating women are excluded from this study. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with Ontak. These potential risks may also apply
             to other agents used in this study

          -  Patients with HIV infection, AIDS, or hepatitis B surface antigen positivity, are
             excluded from this trial. Patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are
             ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions. In addition,
             these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy

          -  History of corticosteroid use in the four weeks preceding entry onto the clinical
             trial, or the requirement for ongoing corticosteroid use during the study period

          -  Patients who are expected to require therapeutic anticoagulation during the trial
             period

          -  Patients with known brain metastases
