  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The impact of different coordination patterns on team performance during anesthesia
      inductions are analyzed using videotapes. These records are examined using various
      categorization systems (ETHZ), focussing on changes of coordinative behaviour with shifting
      situational requirements. A rating system comprising multiple categories is used to evaluate
      team performance. An integrated simulator study facilitates validation of the rating system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Video tapes and vital parameter readings are recorded with a setup allowing synchronized
      recordings. Thus, exact timing between events on different data channels can be determined.
      Data are analyzed for unforeseen events, technical performance, and team coordination /
      non-technical performance.
