      There are few therapies suitable for the treatment of psoriasis on the face and skin folds.
      As these areas are sensitive, irritation and other adverse reactions are more common than
      elsewhere on the body. The purpose of the study is to monitor the effect of once daily
      treatment for up to 8 weeks of an ointment containing calcipotriol 25 mcg/g plus
      hydrocortisone 10 mg/g on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and on the calcium
      metabolism in patients with psoriasis vulgaris on the face and on the intertriginous areas
