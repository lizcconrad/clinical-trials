  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of
      pneumococcal vaccines in young adults. Subjects will be vaccinated twice with an interval of
      two months.

      This amendment was due to

        -  The addition of secondary endpoints for safety. The collection of data related to these
           secondary safety endpoints was already planned and the corresponding statistical
           analyses were described in the statistical section.

        -  The addition of an exclusion criterion regarding the administration of immunoglobulins
           and blood products. It is already included in the elimination criteria section. It
           impacts only immunogenicity.
