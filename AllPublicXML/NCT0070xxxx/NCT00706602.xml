    <textblock>
      Background: COPD is a systemic illness; morbidity and mortality due to this disease are on
      the increase, and it has great impact on patients' lives. Most COPD patients are managed by
      general practitioners (GP). GPs base their initial assessment of patients' disease severity
      mainly on lung function and then inform patients about adequate treatment. However, lung
      function correlates poorly with COPD-specific health-related quality of life and exacerbation
      frequency. Preventive cardiology embraced risk index-guided treatment successfully. COPD
      disease severity indices that better represent the clinical manifestations of COPD are needed
      that can be used to guide risk-stratified treatment.

      Objectives: (1) The development and validation of a practical COPD disease severity index to
      predict the course of health-related quality of life over time. (2) The validation of the
      ADO-Index (Age, Dyspnea, Obstruction) to predict 3-year mortality in COPD patients in primary
      care. (3) Link evidence on treatment effects to the COPD risk indices to guide COPD treatment
      selection.

      Methods: We are in the process of conducting two linked prospective cohort studies with 413
      COPD patients (GOLD stages 2-4) from GPs in Switzerland and the Netherlands. We performed a
      sound baseline assessment including detailed patient history, lung function, measurement of
      exercise capacity and blood sampling. During the follow-up of at least five years, we update
      the patients' profile by registering health status, exacerbations and health-related quality
      of life and, after 2 years, lung function and measurement of exercise capacity. For aim 1, we
      will identify the best combination of variables predicting the course of health-related
      quality of life over time using multivariable regression analysis. For aim 2, we will assess
      discrimination and calibration of the ADO index to predict 3-year mortality. For aim 3, we
      will estimate treatment effects for individual patient profiles using complex statistical
      models such as Markov models.

      Significance of project: After this study, different risk scores will be available for use in
      primary care so that general practitioners can estimate what impact COPD will have on the
      patients. By linking these risk scores to evidence form treatment studies, it will be
      possible to show for an individual patient how COPD and different treatments impacts on
      mortality, symptoms and exacerbations. Thereby, patients and physicians can make more
      informed treatment decisions balancing the benefits and downsides of different treatments.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients ≥40 years of age with COPD in GOLD stage II to IV (postbronchodilator
             FEV1/FVC≤0.70, postbronchodilator FEV1≤80% predicted) are eligible if in- or
             outpatient treatment of their last exacerbation ended ≥4 weeks ago.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who received mechanical ventilation in the previous 12 months (because of
             extremely poor prognosis), patients with co-morbidities associated with a life
             expectancy of ≤12 months, patients diagnosed with dementia, psychosis or other
             psychiatric illness that invalidate assessment of patient-reported parameters and
             patients who cannot complete thr baseline assessment due to language difficulties.
