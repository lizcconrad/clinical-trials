    <textblock>
      This 14-week non-interventional study will observe patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
      who are being treated with infliximab for the first time, in order to learn about their
      disease characteristics. Patients in this study will be treated for RA with infliximab and in
      a usual manner as decided by their physician.
