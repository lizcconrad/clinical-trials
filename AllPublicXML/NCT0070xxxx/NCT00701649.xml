  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CYT006-AngQb is a vaccine that induces a B-cell mediated immune response characterized by the
      generation of specific antibodies (IgG and IgM) against Angiotensin II. The vaccine is
      administered by subcutaneous injection.

      The objectives of the study are:

        -  To evaluate safety and tolerability of 5 s.c. injections of 300µg CYT006-AngQb with
           Alhydrogel™ in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (hypertension Grade
           I and II).

        -  To assess pharmacodynamic effects, i.e. anti-Ang II immune response and renin-
           angiotensin system (RAS) biomarkers.

        -  To explore the effect on blood pressure using ABPM.

             with:

          -  grade III hypertension (mean sitting office SBP ≥180mmHg and/or mean sitting
             DBP≥110mmHg)

          -  history or presence of established cardiovascular or renal disease:
