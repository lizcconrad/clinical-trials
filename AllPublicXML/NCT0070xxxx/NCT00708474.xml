      This study compares the fill of bone graft sites in the knee. It is hypothesized that harvest
      sites, voids, and defects caused by trauma that are treated with the OsseoFit™ Porous Tissue
      Matrix™ device will achieve a better fill grade than those treated with the conventional
      method.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The OsseoFit™ Porous Tissue Matrix™ is intended to be gently packed into the bony
             voids or gaps of the extremities and pelvis caused by trauma or surgery and are not
             intrinsic to the stability of the bony structure. These defects may be created from
             repetitive motion or traumatic injury to the bone or surgically created osseous
             defects for the harvest of bone. The device is a bone void filler that resorbs and is
             replaced with bone during the healing process. The device may be combined with sterile
             fluids such as saline or autogenous blood products such as blood, platelets, or bone
             marrow aspirate. The addition of these autogenous blood products does not compromise
             the performance of the device. Hydration with biologically beneficial sterile fluids
             can potentially have a positive influence on the healing and replacement of the device
             with bone.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Infection at site

          -  Hypercalcemia

          -  Known allergies to bovine collagen

          -  Current osteomyelitis at operative site

          -  Systemic conditions which affect bone and/or wound healing

          -  Known severe allergies manifested by history of anaphylaxis

          -  Desensitization treatment injections to meat products, as injections may contain
             bovine collagen

          -  Severe degenerative bone disease
