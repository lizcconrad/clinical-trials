  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether genotyping for CYP2D6 and 2C19
      polymorphisms or intense clinical monitoring of treatment and adverse effects improves the
      antipsychotic treatment in patients with schizophrenia. This study is designed as a
      three-armed prospective randomized controlled clinical trial and includes 300 patients with
      schizophrenia. Patients are followed for a period of one year.

      During the study period the following effect measures are registered:

        -  Time to discontinuation of all antipsychotic medications

        -  Number of changes in medication dose

        -  Number of changes in medication

        -  Compliance (patients´ adherence to medical treatment)

        -  Clinical symptoms

        -  Adverse effects

    <description>In this study arm (1) the genotype information is given to the physician in charge of treatment and can be used to direct the pharmacological treatment in accordance with the current guidelines from Sct. Hans hospital. In the guidelines the genotype is translated to the clinical designation &quot;normal&quot;, &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;fast&quot; metabolizer of CYP2D6 or &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;slow&quot; metabolizer of CYP2C19. Different treatment options for the different genotypes are described in the clinical guidelines.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Other</arm_group_type>
    <description>In this study arm (2) the genotype information is not revealed. The intervention consists of an intensified clinical monitoring of treatment effect, side effects and patient perspective. Staffpersonnel is trained in the use of a clinical manual that builds on a selection of validated questions from the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), Side effect score (Udvalg af Kliniske Undersøgelser (UKU) and Rating of Medical Influences (ROMI). The manual has to be used at least once in a quarter (every third month), which is monitored by the study personnel. Data registered by the patients primary contact person are not used as outcome measures in the study but only as intervention tool for the optimisation of the medical antipsychotic treatment.</description>
