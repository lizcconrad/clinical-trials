    <textblock>
      The investigators performed a prophylactic peroperative linear lesions connecting the
      tricuspid annulus with a right atriotomy and the atriotomy with the inferior caval vein to
      prevent atrial flutter on 15 consecutive adult patients undergoing surgery for congenital
      heart disease. Conduction time between electrodes placed on both sides of the lesions is
      measured on the second postoperative day. Coronary angiography and electrophysiology study
      using an electroanatomic mapping system to assess conduction across the line are performed
      three month after the operation.

      We perform a prophylactic peroperative linear lesions connecting the tricuspid annulus with a
      right atriotomy (surgical dissection plus cryoablation) and the atriotomy with the inferior
      caval vein (cryoablation alone) to prevent atrial flutter on 15 consecutive adult patients
      undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease. Conduction times between electrodes placed
      on both sides of the lesions are measured on the second postoperative day. Coronary
      angiography and electrophysiology study using an electroanatomic mapping system to assess
      conduction across the line and to try to induce atrial flutter are performed three month
      after the operation.
