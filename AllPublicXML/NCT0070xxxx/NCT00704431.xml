      Subjects will receive their first dose of darapladib in the clinical research unit (CRU), and
      the remaining 9 days of dosing will occur at home. Subjects will record any adverse events
      throughout the dosing period in a paper diary. Subjects will return to the CRU 10-14 days
      after the last dose of darapladib for a follow-up visit. The total study duration for each
      subject including the screening, treatment and follow-up periods will be approximately 4
      weeks.

             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and ECG.

             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented

                  in the protocol for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product
                  label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the
                  risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception
                  until the follow-up visit.

             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  QTcB or QTcF &lt; 450 msec; or QTc &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  History of drug abuse.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  History of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions and severe allergic responses.

          -  History of adult asthma manifested by bronchospasms in the past 6 months or currently
