      This study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a daily, oral dose of 10 mg RAD001 in
      patients with Mantle Cell Lymphoma who are refractory or intolerant to Velcade® therapy and
      who have received at least one prior antineoplastic agent other than Velcade®, either
      separately or in combination with Velcade® (see inclusion criteria). Intolerance to Velcade®
      therapy is determined by the study investigator based on clinical evaluations. Patients are
      considered refractory to Velcade® if they have documented radiological progression on or
      within 12 months of the last dose of Velcade® when given alone or, on or within 12 months of
      the last dose of the last component of a combination therapy which included Velcade®.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients (&gt; 18 years old) with Mantle Cell Lymphoma that has been confirmed by
             central pathology review (archival diagnostic tumor specimen required)

          -  Patients with mantle cell lymphoma who have documented refractory disease to
             bortezomib (Velcade®) or who have documented intolerance to Velcade® therapy.
             Intolerance to Velcade® is determined by the study investigator based on clinical
             evaluations. Patients are considered refractory to Velcade® if they have documented
             radiological progression on or within 12 months of last dose of Velcade® when given
             alone or, on or within 12 months from the last dose of the last component of a
             combination therapy which included Velcade®). Patients are considered refractory to
             Velcade®, if Velcade® is part of a combination treatment for the disease.

          -  Patients must have received at least one prior antineoplastic agent, other than
             Velcade® either separately or in combination with bortezomib (Velcade®).

          -  At least one site of measurable nodal disease at baseline &gt;2.0 cm in the longest
             transverse diameter and clearly measurable in at least two perpendicular dimensions,
             as determined by CT scan (or MRI, only if CT scan can not be performed)

          -  ECOG performance status = 0, 1 or 2

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 3 months

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function

          -  Platelets ≥ 75 x 109/L (untransfused platelets)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are currently receiving anticancer therapies or have received anticancer
             therapies within 4 weeks of the start of study drug (including chemotherapy,
             radiation, antibodies, targeted therapy etc.) are not eligible

          -  Previous treatment with mTOR inhibitors (e.g. everolimus, sirolimus, temsirolimus,
             etc)

          -  Patients with prior allogeneic stem cell transplant

          -  Grade 3 or 4 unresolved toxicity from prior antineoplastic therapies

          -  Currently taking other investigational agents or received other investigational drugs
             within 4 weeks of the start of study drug

          -  Patients with CNS lymphoma are not eligible; head MRI (or CT if MRI is not available)
             is required prior to study entry

          -  Use of chronic, systemic corticosteroids or another immunosuppressive agent, except
             prednisone ≤ 20 mg daily (or equivalent) for adrenal insufficiency (must have been on
             a stable dosage regimen for ≥ 4 weeks prior to the first treatment with RAD001)

          -  HIV positive patients are not eligible; (HIV testing is not required for study entry;
             review of previous medical records is required)

          -  Uncontrolled hyperlipidemia (≥ Grade 3 hyperlipidemia despite optimal supportive
             medical therapy)

          -  Active, bleeding disorders or major surgery within 4 weeks of starting study drug

          -  Severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions such as symptomatic congestive heart
             failure (NYHA Class III or IV), unstable angina, myocardial infarction within 6 months
             or study start, severely impaired lung function, cirrhosis, chronic active/persistent
             hepatitis.

          -  History of another primary malignancy ≤ 3 years prior to study entry
