                  malignancies)

               -  Absolute lymphocyte count ≥1000/µL

               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/µL (≥ 50,000/µL for patients with hematologic malignancies)

               -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

                  above institutional normal.

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for

          -  Uncontrolled brain metastases or malignancy.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to rapamycin.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
