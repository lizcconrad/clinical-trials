  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to assess the effectiveness of a family-based therapy
      (Attachment based family therapy-ABFT) for Norwegian adolescents (13-17 years) referred to
      specialist mental heath clinics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a major public health concern among adolescents. Research suggests that it not
      only is prevalent among adolescents (as many as 20% of adolescents have a depressive episode
      by the age of 18), but its effects last well into adulthood. Although available studies of
      psychosocial and pharmacological interventions show promise, there are concerns regarding
      their effectiveness and possible side effects like increase in suicidal ideation. Family
      conflict is not only an effect of depression, but also a risk factor for depression. High
      conflict and dysfunction, have consistently been shown to increase risk for depression. As
      such, family treatments that target risk and protective factors (e.g., quality of
      parent-child interaction, parental monitoring) for depression seem promising to reduce
      depression. The current study is a randomized clinical trail aimed at assessing the
      effectiveness of a 12-week family based intervention for depressed adolescents (Attachment
      based family therapy- ABFT). Adolescents referred to specialist mental health hospital in
      south-west Norway (Stavanger University Hospital) will be randomized to either ABFT or
      treatment as usual (TAU). Therapists administering both the experimental and control group
      intervention are regular staff clinicians. Outcome assessments would be carried out at
      baseline, 6, 12 and 26 weeks by raters blind to the condition of the treatment.
