  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent endothelium-derived vasodilatator that plays a major role in
      the control of ocular blood flow. Endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is one of three isoforms of
      NOS producing NO through hydroxylation of L-arginine. The eNOS gene is located on the long
      arm of chromosome 7, and different polymorphic variations have been identified. These single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (sNPÂ´s) have the ability to change transcription activity and
      therefore enzyme levels. Recent data indicate that the T -786C polymorphism (especially the
      homozygous variant) is associated with reduced eNOS activity and consequently impaired NO
      production.

      In the present study the investigators want to investigate if the T -786C eNOS gene
      polymorphism determines choroidal and optic nerve head blood flow.
