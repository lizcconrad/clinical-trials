      RATIONALE: Sorafenib and pemetrexed may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Sorafenib may also stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving sorafenib together with pemetrexed and cisplatin may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of sorafenib when
      given together with pemetrexed and cisplatin in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of sorafenib tosylate when given in combination
           with pemetrexed disodium and cisplatin in patients with advanced non-squamous cell solid
           tumor malignancy including, but not limited to, breast, lung, colon, pancreatic,
           prostate, or head and neck cancer or sarcoma.

      Secondary

        -  To characterize the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  To obtain preliminary information about the antitumor activity of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of sorafenib tosylate.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate once daily on days 1-21 and cisplatin IV over 1-2
      hours and pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days, every 8 weeks until
      disease progression, and then every 3 months for up to 6 months.

             pancreatic, prostate, head and neck, or sarcoma

          -  Must have failed or become intolerant to prior standard therapy and is no longer
             likely to respond to such therapy except for patients diagnosed with mesothelioma.
             Mesothelioma patients may be enrolled with no prior therapy requirements since

                  involvement)

               -  Renal: serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 and calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 45.

        The creatinine clearance is determined by the Cockcroft-Gault formula:

             (mg/dL)

          -  Patients receiving anti-coagulation treatment with an agent such as warfarin or
             heparin may be allowed to participate. For patients on warfarin, the INR should be
             measured prior to initiation of sorafenib and monitored at least weekly, or as defined
             by the local standard of care, until INR is stable.
