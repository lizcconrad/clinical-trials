    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a chronic disease of the lung blood vessels resulting in
      constriction and high pressures. Treatment is given with a variety of drugs including the
      prostanoid class (e.g. epoprostenol, iloprost and the phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors
      (e.g. sildenafil).

      Although these drugs are known to be effective alone, little is known about combining them
      together in various combinations.

      In this trial we will add a long-acting PDE-5 inhibitor to the treatment of patients with
      pulmonary arterial hypertension who currently are receiving only a prostanoid drug.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must satisfy current diagnostic criteria for pulmonary artery
             hypertension based on their historical right heart catheter data (within 3 years of
             study enrollment): Mean PAP &gt;25mmHg at rest or &gt;30mmHg with exercise, by a PCWP&lt;
             15mmHg and by PVR &gt;3 Wood Units.

          -  Currently stable for at least 3 months on prostanoid monotherapy (epoprostenol iv or
             iloprost inhaled).

          -  Willing and able to participate in all study follow-up procedures.

          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II-IV.

          -  Six minute walking distance between 100-450 meters at the baseline assessment.

          -  Women of child-bearing age must demonstrate adequate contraception or undergo a
             pregnancy test.

          -  Patients with congenital heart disease are eligible for inclusion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Functional Class NYHA Class I.

          -  PAH due to chronic pulmonary thromboembolic disease, left heart disease, chronic lung
             diseases (VC or FEV1 &lt; 60% of predicted) or chronic hypoxia.

          -  Acute intercurrent illness requiring hospital admission in the month proceeding
             screening.

          -  Any non-PAH medical condition likely to interfere with participation in evaluation of
             study endpoints, e.g. musculoskeletal disorders.

          -  Any uncontrolled or terminal non-PAH medical condition likely to interfere with
             completion of the study, according to the judgment of the study physician.

          -  Concomitant therapy with drugs known to interact adversely with the study drug.

          -  Chronic renal failure - creatinine clearance &lt;50ml/min as calculated with the
             Cockcroft equation.

          -  Current participation in another clinical trial.

          -  Pregnancy or planned pregnancy during the study period.
