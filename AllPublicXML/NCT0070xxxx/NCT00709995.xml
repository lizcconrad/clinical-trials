  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, Phase 2 study of enzastaurin and sunitinib versus placebo and
      sunitinib as first-line therapy in participants with metastatic renal cell carcinoma,
      containing 2 parts. Part 1 is a safety lead-in study with 12 participants and possible dose
      escalation. Part 2 is a randomized, double-blind, Phase 2 study in 110 participants.

    <description>Part 1: Dose escalation.
Enzastaurin (Cohort 1): Cycle 1, Day 1 loading dose 250 milligram (mg) administered by mouth (po), twice a day (BID), followed by 125 mg, po, BID on Days 2-42 of 6 week cycle.
Enzastaurin (Cohort 2) Cycle 1, Day 1 loading dose 375 mg administered po three times a day (TID), followed by 250 mg, po, BID continuously until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or discontinuation from the study for any other reason.
Sunitinib (Cohort 1 and 2): 50 mg administered po, every day (QD), on Days 1-28, then rest (no drug given) on Days 29-42.
Part 2: Randomized Double-Blind: Dosing for Part 2 will be determined by outcome of Part 1.
Phase 2 was not activated per recommendation of safety review committee.
Enzastaurin: Cycle 1, Day 1 loading dose 375 mg administered po, TID, followed by Phase 1 dose BID on Days 2-42 of 6 week cycle.
Sunitinib: 50 mg administered po, QD, on Days 1-28, then rest Days 29-42.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) who have not received prior
             treatment with systemic (adjuvant or neoadjuvant) therapy for RCC (including targeted
             therapy such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors or bevacizumab, immunotherapy,
             chemotherapy, hormonal, or investigational therapy)

          -  Histologically confirmed RCC with metastases with a component of clear (conventional)
             cell histology

          -  Evidence of unidimensional measurable disease, measured by computed tomography (CT)
             scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

          -  Primary tumor has been surgically removed by nephrectomy or nephron-sparing surgery

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1

          -  Participants must sign an informed consent document

          -  Have received prior treatment with sunitinib or enzastaurin

          -  Have received treatment within the last 30 days with a drug that has not received
             regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry

          -  Have had any of the following within 12 months prior to study drug administration:

               -  severe/unstable angina,

               -  coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft,

               -  symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF),

               -  cerebrovascular accident,

               -  pulmonary embolism

          -  Note: Ongoing treatment with therapeutic doses of Coumadin® (warfarin) or a derivative
             of Coumadin or phenprocoumon is not allowed, but prophylactic, low-dose Coumadin (≤ 2
             mg daily) for deep vein thrombosis is allowed. In such cases, prothrombin
             time/international normalization ratio (PT/INR) should be very closely monitored as
             clinically indicated
