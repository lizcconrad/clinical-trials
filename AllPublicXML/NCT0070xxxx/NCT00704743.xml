    <textblock>
      Displaced fractures of the distal radius requiring closed reduction (otherwise known as
      Colles fractures) are common in the emergency department. The purpose of the study is to
      determine if there is any difference between 3 methods of immobilization for these fractures:
      circumferential cast, volar-dorsal splint, and modified sugar tong splint. Maintenance of
      position was assessed at 4 weeks after the injury and wrist strength and function were
      assessed at 2 months and 6 months. We hypothesize that there will not be a clinically
      important difference between these methods of immobilizing for displaced fractures of the
      distal radius requiring closed reduction.

      Extended description of the protocol, including information not already contained in other
      fields.

      Objectives:

      Primary: To determine the effectiveness of three immobilization methods (circumferential cast
      [CC], volar dorsal splint [VDS], modified sugar-tong [MST] splint) in maintaining the
      position of displaced distal radius fractures after successful closed reduction.

      Secondary to assess long term functional outcomes associated with fiberglass splint
      immobilization versus standard cylindrical casting in patients maintaining initial
      non-operative reductions.

      Design: Randomized prospective single blind controlled trial Patients/Participants: Patients
      over 18 years of age who presented to the emergency department with a displaced fracture of
      the distal radius, requiring closed reduction.

      Outcome Measurements: Loss of reduction (radiological slippage or the need for surgical
      fixation during the 3-4 week primary immobilization period after initial successful
      reduction). Secondary outcomes were DASH score, return to work, activities of daily living
      (ADL), wrist pain, range of motion (ROM) and grip strength.
