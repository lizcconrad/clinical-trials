  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to help us study a vaccine treatment for patients with
      prostate cancer. A vaccine is a medicine that teaches the body to destroy harmful infections
      and other diseases, such as cancer. Your immune system is made up of many different types of
      cells which fight infection and disease in your body. A vaccine may stimulate the immune
      system to destroy the cancer cells. It may also help to slow the growth of the cancer. The
      vaccine is a solution given as an injection into or under the skin. It is made up of several
      parts. The first part is PSMA, a protein present in many cancers, especially prostate cancer.
      It is referred to as rsPSMA when made in a laboratory for this study and is mixed with a
      material called Alhydrogel® (aluminum hydroxide suspension) which helps the immune system to
      make more cancer-fighting cells.

    <description>The assigned dose of rsPSMA protein plus Alhydrogel® vaccine will be administered subcutaneously to random sites on the upper arm and upper leg at weekly intervals for 3 weeks. This will be followed by a 4-week break and then a fourth vaccination during week 7. The vaccination site will rotate to a different quadrant with each administration.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-castrate metastatic patients must have biochemically progressive disease as
             defined by serial changes in PSA (with a serum testosterone &gt; or = to 180
             ng/mL)following definitive primary therapy such as prostatectomy or radiation.
             Castrate metastatic patients must have biochemically progressive disease in the
             absence of radiographic evidence of disease progression with rising PSA values despite
             castrate (&lt;50 ng/mL) levels of testosterone following an adequate course of hormonal
             therapy. An adequate course of hormonal therapy is treatment with an LH-RH analog
             (with or without an anti-androgen) or orchiectomy.

          -  Prostate cancer must be histologically confirmed by the Department of Pathology at
             MSKCC.

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt;70%.

          -  Patients must have adequate organ function as defined by:

          -  WBC &gt; or = to 3000/mm3, neutrophils &gt; or = to1000/mm3, platelet count &gt; or = to
             l00,000 mm3

          -  Bilirubin &lt;2.0 mg/dl

          -  Alkaline Phosphatase and SGOT &lt;3.0 times the upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine &lt; or = to 2.0 mg/dl

          -  Hemoglobin &gt;9.0 g/dl

          -  ALT &lt;2.5 times the upper limit of normal

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age

          -  Expected survival must be &gt;6 months

          -  Patients must sign informed consent.

          -  Non-castrate metastatic patients must have a serum testosterone &gt;180 ng/mL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Radiographic evidence of disease progression.

          -  Clinically significant cardiac disease (New York Heart Association Class III/IV or
             severe debilitating pulmonary disease).

          -  Active CNS or epidural tumor.

          -  An infection requiring antibiotic treatment.

          -  Lymphopenia defined by lymphocytes &lt;1000/mm3.

          -  Cancer related pain requiring the use of opioid containing analgesics.

          -  Positive stool guaiac, excluding hemorrhoids or documented radiation-induced
             proctitis.

          -  Concurrent treatment with nutritional or herbal supplements (e.g., PC SPES or similar
             agents) which could potentially confound the interpretation of study results.

          -  History of an active secondary malignancy except for non-melanoma skin cancer.
