      The purpose of this randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, multicenter study is to
      evaluate ocular surface effects after the administration of travoprost with SofZia®
      preservative system or Xalatan once daily for 12 weeks.

    <measure>Mean Change at 12 Weeks (Day 84) From Baseline (Day 0) in Tear Film Break Up Time (TBUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks (Day 84)</time_frame>
    <description>Tear film break-up time was assessed by the same examiner both visits using the same slitlamp/settings. Examiner instilled fluorescein onto the patient's eye, after which the patient blinked several times, then kept the eye open. Immediately thereafter, the examiner used a stopwatch to time the occurrence of the first break in the fluorescein film. Three consecutive measurements were taken and averaged for actual TBUT. TBUT at Baseline (Day 0) was subtracted from TBUT at 12 weeks (Day 84) and reported as change. A higher number represents a lengthening in the tear film break up time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change at 12 Weeks (Day 84) From Baseline (Day 0) in Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks (Day 84)</time_frame>
    <description>The OSDI is a 12-question validated questionnaire (resultant overall 0-100 score) used to measure ocular symptoms, visual function, and environmental factors that may affect a patient's vision, where 0 = normal and 100 = severe. The OSDI questionnaire was administered at both visits and completed by the patient with no assistance from the office staff, physician, or anyone else. The baseline OSDI score was subtracted from the 12-week OSDI score and reported as change. A negative number represents a perceived improvement in ocular health.</description>

        <title>Mean Change at 12 Weeks (Day 84) From Baseline (Day 0) in Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) Score</title>
        <description>The OSDI is a 12-question validated questionnaire (resultant overall 0-100 score) used to measure ocular symptoms, visual function, and environmental factors that may affect a patient's vision, where 0 = normal and 100 = severe. The OSDI questionnaire was administered at both visits and completed by the patient with no assistance from the office staff, physician, or anyone else. The baseline OSDI score was subtracted from the 12-week OSDI score and reported as change. A negative number represents a perceived improvement in ocular health.</description>
