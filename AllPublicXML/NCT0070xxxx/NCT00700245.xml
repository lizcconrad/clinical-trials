  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human adipose and muscle -tissue produce and release a number of bioactive proteins which
      contributes to the chronic low grade of inflammatory status which is associated with obesity
      and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular
      diseases.

      Study 1: Our aim is to investigate if exercise has independent and additive effects in
      combination with diet-induced weight loss on circulating levels of inflammatory markers and
      mRNA levels in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and skeletal muscle tissue (SM.

      Study 2: Our aim is to investigate whether gender and weight status plays a role in the
      metabolic response during two hours of acute exercise

    <description>The exercise intervention for subjects in the EXO consisted of supervised aerobic exercise three times per week with a duration of 60 -75 minutes pr. training session, with an estimated energy expenditure of 500-600 kcal per session. The subjects could choose between different modes of exercise; stationary bicycling, jogging on a treadmill or stair stepping.</description>
