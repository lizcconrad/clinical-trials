      This is a multicenter open-label phase II trial of high dose imatinib mesylate in patients
      with AML in first or second relapse, or with refractory disease. Daily dosing of imatinib 600
      mg/day is planned for one month or until progression of disease. Dose increase to 800 mg/ day
      imatinib is permitted for 2 additional months in the event of response failure. Response is
      assessed after 1, 2 and 3 months of treatment by bone marrow aspirate.
