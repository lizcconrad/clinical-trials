  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, single-blind study designed to evaluate the influence of
      individual approach on bowel preparation quality for colonoscopy. The investigators compare
      split-dose polyethylene glycol solution (PEG, Fortrans, Beaufour Ipsen) to modified
      split-dose PEG regarding predictors of inadequate preparation for colonoscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 22% of patients are not good prepared for colonoscopy and it is caused of aborted
      procedures and increased costs. There are identified predictors of inadequate bowel
      preparation before colonoscopy, but we still don't know if an individual approach improve the
      quality of preparation.

    <description>The volume of polyethylene glycol solution depends on risk factors presented in each patient. Time of administration of second dose will be confirmed according to the time of colonoscopy. In case of constipation an enema before colonoscopy will be administered. All patients will give educational booklet of preparation before colonoscopy</description>
