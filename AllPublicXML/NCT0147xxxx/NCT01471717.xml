  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the potential for a pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction
      between INX-08189 and Victrelis, a Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled study in thirty-two 18 to 55 year
      old, male and female, healthy adult volunteers.

      Primary Objectives:

      Pharmacokinetic

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of INX-08189 and INX-08032 when
           INX-08189 is dosed alone as compared to when dosed in combination with Victrelis

        -  To characterize the PK profile of Victrelis when dosed alone as compared to when dosed
           in combination with INX-08189

      Safety

      - To evaluate the safety of INX-08189 and Victrelis when dosed alone and when dosed in
      combination

         13. Use of chronic prescription medications within 3 months, acute prescription
             medications within 14 days, or systemic over-the-counter (OTC) medications, including
             vitamins, within 7 days of starting the study;

         14. Received an investigational drug or vaccine within 30 days or 5 half lives, whichever
             is longer, from the receipt of a small molecule or 90 days or 5 half lives, whichever
             is longer, from the receipt of a large biological molecule prior to Study Day 0, or
             used an investigational medical device within 30 days prior to Study Day 0, or having
