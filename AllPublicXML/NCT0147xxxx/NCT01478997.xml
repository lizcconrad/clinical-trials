      Primary efficacy variable:

      Number of patients showing 20% reduction from baseline in the WOMAC - pain subscale

      Secondary efficacy variables:

        -  Number of patients showing a 50% reduction from baseline in the WOMAC - pain subscale

        -  Number of patients showing a 20% reduction from baseline in VAS-pain

        -  Number of patients showing a 50% reduction from baseline in VAS- pain

        -  Mean change (percentage reduction) in WOMAC scores for pain, stiffness and physical
           function from baseline, as compared to placebo

        -  Mean change (percentage reduction) in VAS - pain, as assessed at clinic visits and by
           daily records in patient diary (First two weeks only)

        -  Consumption of rescue medication

        -  Investigator's Global assessment of efficacy
