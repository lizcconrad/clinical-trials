    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety in Japanese adult
      subjects with Intra-abdominal/Pelvic infections receiving Metronidazole IV 1,500-2,000 mg/day
      in combination with ceftriaxone sodium.

    <measure>Clinical Response: Response Rate (Data Review Committee Assessment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to EOT (up to 14 days), TOC</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response was evaluated by the data review committee as effective (cured or improved), ineffective (not meeting &quot;effective&quot; criteria), or indeterminate at the end of treatment (EOT) and the test of cure (TOC: 7 days after EOT) based on clinical symptoms, ultrasound images and necessity of other treatment. TOC was the primary analysis of this outcome measure. Cured = clinical symptoms and abnormal findings at the start of the study were disappeared and considered other antibiotics were not required during the study and after the assessment time point. Improved = clinical symptoms and abnormal findings at the start of the study were improved and considered other antibiotics were not required during the study and after the assessment time point. Response rate was calculated from the following formula; &quot;number of participants evaluated as effective&quot; over &quot;total number of participants that excluding ones evaluated as indeterminate&quot; multiplied by 100.</description>

    <description>The appropriateness of treatment continuation was evaluated on Day 4 by the investigator as continuation, discontinuation or indeterminate based on the clinical response.

    <description>Bacteriological response was evaluated as eradication (eradication, presumed eradication or colonization), persistence, or indeterminate by the data review committee, at Day 4, at the end of treatment (EOT), and the test of cure (TOC: 7 days after EOT). Eradication Rate was calculated from the following formula, &quot;number of participants with bacteria eradication, presumed eradication or colonization&quot; over &quot;total number of participants that excluding ones evaluated as indeterminate&quot; multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Clinical Response: Response Rate (Data Review Committee Assessment)</title>
        <description>Clinical response was evaluated by the data review committee as effective (cured or improved), ineffective (not meeting &quot;effective” criteria), or indeterminate at the end of treatment (EOT) and the test of cure (TOC: 7 days after EOT) based on clinical symptoms, ultrasound images and necessity of other treatment. TOC was the primary analysis of this outcome measure. Cured = clinical symptoms and abnormal findings at the start of the study were disappeared and considered other antibiotics were not required during the study and after the assessment time point. Improved = clinical symptoms and abnormal findings at the start of the study were improved and considered other antibiotics were not required during the study and after the assessment time point. Response rate was calculated from the following formula; &quot;number of participants evaluated as effective&quot; over &quot;total number of participants that excluding ones evaluated as indeterminate&quot; multiplied by 100.</description>

            <description>Metronidazole was administered in combination with ceftriaxone sodium, at a dose of 500 mg three times a day (TID) or four times a day (QID) for refractory or severe infection. Ceftriaxone was administered at the dose of 1 g twice a day (BID) when metronidazole was administered TID, or at dose of 2 g BID when metronidazole was administered QID. The duration of drug administration was 3 to 14 days.</description>
