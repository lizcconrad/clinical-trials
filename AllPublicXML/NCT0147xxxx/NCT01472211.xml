  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this trial is to determine whether the use of the household-based water
      treatment device Life Straw Family (LSF) can be an effective strategy to improve zinc status
      and health status of vulnerable populations in developing country rural settings with poor
      access to potable water.

      To assess the effectiveness of the LSF strategy (a filter delivering purified and zinc
      enriched water) a double blind controlled field efficacy trial will take place over a period
      of 12 months in rural villages in the district of Natitingou, North-West Benin. In order to
      attain the research objectives the efficacy trial will envisage 3 arms: intervention (zinc
      enriching filter), placebo (filter) and control group (disinfection tables). During the trial
      the following outcomes will be monitored: zinc status and growth rate of the participating
      children, zinc status and pregnancy outcome in a sub-sample of pregnant women (pregnancy
      sub-study), diarrhea prevalence in all participating subjects, water quality, zinc enrichment
      of water, and modality and consistency of use of the LSF-device by the study population.

      The study hypotheses are: 1) the use of the LSF-device will reduce microbiological
      contamination of the household water, 2) the use of the LSF-device will increase zinc intakes
      and serum zinc concentration in preschool children, 3) the use of the LSF-device will
      increase zinc intakes and serum zinc concentration in pregnant women, 4) the achievement of 1
      and 2 will improve growth and lower frequency and length of diarrhea episodes in
      participating preschool children, 5) the achievement of 1 and 3 will improve pregnancy
      outcome and lower frequency and length of diarrhea episodes in participating pregnant women,
      6) the use of the LSF-device will lower frequency and length of diarrhea episodes in
      participating households members.

    <description>At baseline, endpoint and at a randomly assigned screening between month 1 and 11, a 6 ml whole blood sample will be collected by venipuncture in 2-5y children (N=270). The blood sample will be used to determine concentration of zinc in the serum (SZn). Inflammation indicator C-reactive protein (CRP) will be analysed to adjust SZn values.</description>
