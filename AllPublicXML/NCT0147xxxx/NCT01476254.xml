      The purpose of this study is to describe change in pulmonary function and incidence of
      respiratory complications after laparoscopic surgery.

      The investigators will include 60 women scheduled for laparoscopic hysterectomy or
      cholecystectomy. The investigators will measure the pulmonary function by different methods
      during and for 2 hours after surgery. Moreover, the incidence of respiratory complications
      including pneumonia, respiratory failure and radiologically verified atelectasis will be
      registered.
