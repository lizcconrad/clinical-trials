  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to determine the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant docetaxel and
      epirubicin (DE) with or without human recombinant endostatin (endostar) for breast cancer
      patients. The hypothesis of this protocol is that a combined angiogenesis inhibiting therapy
      to chemotherapy could further benefit breast cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled phase Ⅲ clinical trial. A total of
      800 patients with core-biopsy confirmed breast cancer, stage ⅡA to ⅢC, and to be treated with
      neoadjuvant systemic therapy are eligible for entry into this study. Patients will be
      allocated randomly to two groups to receive either 3 cycles of neoadjuvant DE and endostar or
      3 cycles of neoadjuvant DE. All cases receive mammography, contrast-enhanced ultrasound
      (CEUS), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning
      pre- and post-neoadjuvant therapy, and then undergo surgical resection. The primary endpoint
      is clinical/pathological response. The clinical response will be evaluated according to
      RECIST criteria. The parameters of tumor metabolism and blood supply, as demonstrated by PET,
      MRA and CEUS, will be collected and analysed. The secondary endpoint is (1) the number of
      participants with adverse events, (2) quality of life scores, and (3) the number of adverse
      events reported during neoadjuvant therapy. In addition, the role of mammography, CEUS, MRA
      and PET for response evaluation, as well as the angiogenic profile and biological information
      involved in tumor response will be investigated.
