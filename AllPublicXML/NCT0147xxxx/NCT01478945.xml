    <textblock>
      This study is a small pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing hand-held NB-UVB
      light devices with placebo devices. These devices will be used by the participants to treat
      their vitiligo at home for a period of four months. The main purpose of the trial is to
      provide feasibility data that can be used to inform the design of a future multi-centre RCT
      of these devices. Two hand-held UVB devices with similar manual operating system are being
      tested during this pilot study. This trial will help the investigators to establish which
      device is likely to be best for the main trial.

      Participants will be approached in a variety of ways (through secondary care, primary care
      and through direct advertising). Potential participants who contact the co-ordinating centre
      expressing an interest in the trial will be given more information about the trial, checked
      for preliminary eligibility, and sent an appointment for a screening visit at the closest
      recruiting hospital (Nottingham or Leicester).

      This screening visit will be conducted by a research nurse, but a dermatologist will also be
      present in order to confirm the diagnosis of vitiligo and to confirm the participant's
      suitability for UVB treatment at home. If eligible and willing to take part in the trial,
      participants will provide written informed consent and baseline data will be collected. In
      order to define the starting dose to be used when treating the vitiligo, a minimum erythema
      dose (MED) test will be conducted.

      An educational session will be provided by the research nurse outlining how to use the
      devices, how to assess side-effects of the treatment and how to complete the treatment diary.
      It is anticipated that the screening visit and educational session will take place on the
      same day and may take up to 1.5 hours.

      On the following day, a brief visit to the hospital will be required in order to examine the
      skin and read the MED results (if more convenient, the educational session may be delivered
      at this time). Once this has been done, participants will be given the devices to use at home
      - treatment is applied 3 times per week on alternate days. They will be followed up by
      telephone at week 1, week 2 and week 12 - in order to provide support and to monitor
      side-effects. Participants will be asked to keep a treatment diary that records when the
      treatment has been used and records side-effects experienced. Emergency contact details will
      be provided in case of urgent medical need.

      Participants will continue with treatment at home for the 16-week trial period. Two further
      hospital visits will take place in order to record outcome data

      This study is a pilot trial to determine the feasibility of conducting a subsequent large
      multi-centre RCT.

      The objectives of this pilot trial are:

      Primarily:

        1. To establish the proportion of eligible participants and their willingness to be
           randomised to home NB-UVB

           Secondarily:

        2. To establish participants' adherence and satisfaction in using home phototherapy

        3. To assess success of blinding of both participants and outcome assessors by using an
           identical placebo unit with visible light fluorescence bulb instead of NB-UVB bulb.

        4. To establish possible short term side effects i.e. if the device is suitable for home
           use with limited medical supervision

        5. To manualise the treatment intervention, i.e. prepare package educating participants in
           how to use the intervention and to deal with possible side effects.

        6. To define and test the primary and secondary outcome measures and the methods of data
           collection for the main RCT

      Trial Configuration:

      Parallel groups-Three arms study

        1. Group A: active hand held NB-UVB unit (Dermfix 1000)

        2. Group B: active hand held NB-UVB unit (Waldmann)

        3. Group C: placebo hand held NB-UVB unit (placebo Dermfix 1000) The allocation to the
           active or placebo group will be 2:1. This trial configuration will reflect the
           participants' allocation to active and placebo groups in the main RCT (75% of the
           participants will receive active treatment), as the latter is most likely to be a three
           arm or a factorial trial. Subsequently, the results obtained from this pilot trial
           regarding the participants' willingness to be randomised will be a more precise estimate
           of the main RCT.

      Setting:

      Participants will primarily be indentified in secondary care (Nottingham, Leicester, Derby
      and Mansfield) and by direct advertising. Recruitment will be extended to include primary
      care if time and resources allow.

      Sample size estimate:

      This is a pilot study, with sample size being resource driven in terms of available subjects
      in a reasonable time frame, for which no formal statistically based sample size estimate is
      applicable.

      For this pilot study, 21 participants (7 in each group) will allow the investigators to
      measure the recruitment rate from each site; n=21 will also give a reasonable estimate of
      acceptability and completeness of outcome data.

      Number of participants:

      The investigators estimate to recruit 21 participants, 7 in each group; however the
      recruitment will depend on time and resources available.

      Description of interventions:

      The hand held NB-UVB unit is a portable and light weight NB-UVB device that is slightly
      larger than a usual hairbrush.

      These units are CE marked and are being used within their licensing authorisations.

      The hand held device is held above any small area of the skin (10-12cm x 6.5-4 cm) and
      spacers are provided in order to standardise the distance from the skin. Hand held NB-UVB
      units are suitable for small lesions making phototherapy available for participants with
      limited disease, and for participants who find it difficult to attend hospital-based
      phototherapy units 2 to 3 times a week.

      The lamp is held still above the vitiliginous lesion. If the size of the lesion is bigger
      than mentioned above i.e. 10-12 cm X 6.5-4 cm, the participant (or their parent or legal
      guardian for younger participants) will be asked to move the lamp slowly above the area in
      circular movements.

      In this trial the investigators will explore 2 similar hand held NB-UVB (311nm) phototherapy
      devices with the same output, but a slighly different size of treatment window, weight of the
      device and cable length. By doing this the investigators will be able to monitor and assess
      which of the 2 units is best tolerated in terms of participants' satisfaction and
      minimisation of side effects. The information gathered will assist in the choice of device
      for the main RCT.

      Device A: Dermfix 1000 NB-UVB Device B: Waldmann UV 109 Both devices are manual units with an
      on/off switch and an external digital timer. The user of this device has to follow the
      written treatment protocol, set and re-set the timer each time manually and to keep an
      accurate diary of exposure times.

      The devices need to be connected to a socket all the time.

      Placebo Device: Placebo Dermfix 1000, same as Device A The placebo device to be used is
      identical to the active device Dermfix with the only difference that it will not emit 311nm
      NB-UVB.

      Duration of study:

      The recruitment is planned to commence as soon as approvals (ethics and R&amp;D) are in place and
      should take approximately 6 months. Each participant will participate in the study for 4
      months. Participants will be assessed at face to face visits at the beginning of the
      screening stage-baseline, 8th week and 16th week. Outcomes will be assessed at the same time
      points.

      Follow up telephone calls will be made at weeks 1, 2 and 12.

      Randomisation and blinding:

      Participants will be blinded to which device they have received, (intervention groups A or B
      or control group C).

      The research nurse will be blinded to which group the participants are allocated
      (intervention groupS A or B or control group C).

      The randomisation will be based on a computer generated pseudo-random code using random
      permuted blocks of randomly varying size, created by the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit
      (CTU) in accordance with their standard operating procedure (SOP) and held on a secure
      server. The randomisation will be stratified by 3 groups (Group A, B and C) and 2 recruiting
      sites.

      Statistical methods:

      Demographic, baseline data and measure of compliance will be summarised by descriptive
      statistics (number[n], mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum and maximum) or
      frequency tables, stratified by treatment.

      Also, calculation of the re-pigmentation rate, spread &amp; cessation of the vitiligo lesions
      will be conducted for all of the 3 devices. This information will be vital for the sample
      size calculation for the definitive trial.

    <description>Narrowband UVB is now the most common form of phototherapy used to treat skin diseases. Narrow-band refers to a specific wavelength of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, 311 to 312 nm. Hospital NB-UVB usually involves whole body cabinets suitable for extensive, generalised vitiligo i.e. large or multiple lesions. Usually the whole body is exposed to the UVB for a short time (seconds to minutes). NB-UVB is also used in the treatment of many other skin conditions including psoriasis and eczema.
Hand held phototherapy units use the same lamp as the whole body units (TLO1) but only suitable for the treatment of smaller areas of skin i.e. early and focal lesions of vitiligo.
Early reports showed that these units are also safe and effective for the treatment of psoriasis of the scalp.</description>
