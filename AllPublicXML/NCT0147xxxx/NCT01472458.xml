  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study Premature Termination of Resuscitation in Survivors of Cardiac Arrest focuses on
      using innovative knowledge translation strategies to improve appropriate neuroprognostication
      for survivors of cardiac arrest and prevent premature termination of life sustaining
      therapies. This is important because any early gains achieved during resuscitation will be
      nullified if clinicians terminate life-sustaining therapies prematurely based on inadequate
      prognostic information. An effective translation strategy for neuroprognostication will
      result in improved physician adherence to evidence-based medicine and an increase in the
      proportion of patients surviving to achieve a good neurological outcome following cardiac
      arrest.

      A stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design will be employed in order to properly
      evaluate the impact of this intervention. Each of the 18 participating hospitals will be
      randomized one of the four wedges according to a random schedule; each wedge will consist of
      4 to 5 hospitals. With this design, the implementation of the intervention will be rolled out
      sequentially to the participating hospitals over a 5 month period for each wedge. All
      hospitals will have received the intervention by the end of the study.

      Note that the study design fields provided by ClinicalTrials.gov do not allow for describing
      this type of study design; therefore, the investigators have listed the study as a single
      arm. In reality, this study will have 4 wedges, each containing randomized clusters of 4-5
      hospitals.

    <description>Our primary endpoint measures the uptake of appropriate neurological prognostication in survivors of cardiac arrest. We define appropriate neurological prognostication as the number of patients that have appropriate prognostic testing (as recommended by Advanced Life Support/ILCOR guidelines) performed before death but occurring at least 72 hours after the cardiac arrest; the denominator for this endpoint is the total number of patients admitted to hospital following cardiac arrest excluding deaths unrelated to predictions of poor neurological prognosis.</description>

    <description>This stepped-wedge cluster randomized evaluation will randomly allocate 18 hospitals into 4 groups to receive our active intervention at different sequential time points according to the randomly assigned stepped-wedge schedule. Hospitals will function as control hospitals until it is their turn to receive the active intervention, according to the stepped wedge schedule. Each wedge consists of 4-5 hospitals and will last 5 months.</description>
