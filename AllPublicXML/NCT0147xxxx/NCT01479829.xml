  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will attempt to enhance and augment the antidepressant efficacy of a commonly
      used antidepressant in poorly responding bipolar depressed patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a placebo-controlled study of patients with bipolar I disorder (BPD) utilizing a
      well-known antidepressant, escitalopram (ESC), in combination with the anti-inflammatory
      agent, celecoxib (CBX). The investigators hypothesize that combination treatment will lead to
      a qualitatively and quantitatively augmented response and will result in greater numbers of
      remitters compared to ESC monotherapy.
