  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine (1) whether ZYGK1 is safe and well tolerated, (2)
      the pharmacokinetics (what body does to ZYGK1) and (3) pharmacodynamics (what drugs does to
      the body) in the healthy and diabetic subject.

      This study will be a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study and is divided into
      four plans:

        1. Plan I: Single Ascending Dose (SAD) Study

        2. Plan II: Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD)Study

        3. Plan III: Gender Effect study

        4. Plan IV: Food Effect study

      First Plan I, Plan III and Plan IV will be conducted in healthy volunteers. After reviewing
      the results, decision shall be taken whether the multiple ascending doses shall be studied in
      healthy human volunteers or in subjects with type 2 diabetes.
