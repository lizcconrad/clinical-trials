  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is the most common recurrent headache. Current therapy of migraine headache consists
      of multiple drug groups for control of attack and prophylaxis against recurrent attacks.
      Emerging alternative medicine worldwide led investigators to evaluate the efficacy of cupping
      therapy plus SERKANGABIN syrup in treatment of migraine headache. Severity, duration and
      frequency of attacks of migraine headache evaluated in two groups during six months from
      presentation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized controlled trial investigators randomly assigned 76 patients with migraine to
      cupping therapy plus SERKANGABIN or to receive conventional medical treatment. The use of CAM
      in migraine is a growing phenomenon. Migraine patients seek and explore both conventional and
      CAM approaches. Wet cupping is an ancient medical technique still used in several
      contemporary societies. It is being used in management of hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
      and headaches, renal and biliary stones and for maintaining health. Little experimental study
      has been devoted to test its efficacy to treat migraine headache. Investigators planned this
      study for evaluation of therapeutic efficacy of wet cupping and an Iranian traditional
      medicine preparation, SERKANGABIN in treatment of migraine headache compared with current
      medicine protocols. SERKANGABIN is a preparation of honey, vinegar and distilled mint water
      that in traditional Iranian medicine is believed to have therapeutic effects in many diseases
      (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive airway
      disease, interstitial lung disease, hepatitis, fatty liver, ischemic heart disease, migraine,
      cerebrovascular diseases)
