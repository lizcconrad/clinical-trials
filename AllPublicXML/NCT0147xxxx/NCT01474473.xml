  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CACIPLIQ20 is a nanopolymer engineered to mimic glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfates.
      Glycosaminoglycans are implied 1) in the stabilization of the micro-environment of cells,
      known as extracellular matrix, by binding to structural proteins, and 2) in the cell
      communication by protecting growth factors. At the site of a lesion, glycosaminoglycans are
      degraded, thereby the extracellular matrix is disorganized and the tissue is destroyed. By
      replacing damaged glycosaminoglycans, CACIPLIQ20 provides a protective function and restores
      the matrix architecture and the cell communication, a process known as Matrix Therapy.

      As for now, three non-controlled pilot studies have been carried out on small populations.
      They have shown a substantial enhancement of chronic wounds state after treatment with
      CACIPLIQ20. Therefore, the purpose of this new controlled study is to determine whether
      CACIPLIQ20 can shorten diabetic neuropathic plantar ulcers healing when the off-loading is
      mandatory.

      The study's main hypothesis is that CACIPLIQ20 application on a non-healing diabetic plantar
      ulcer in an off-loading mandatory context would reinitiate the natural process of tissue
      regeneration and lead to total wound closure faster than following standard wound care.

      This study specifically targets diabetic patients presenting neuropathic plantar ulcers.

      Diabetic patients have a 25% risk to develop foot ulcers during their life, and one
      diabetes-induced amputation is performed every 30 seconds in the world. Textbook-case of
      perforating foot ulcer (Malum Perforans Pedis) is caused by a mechanical impairment : only a
      thoroughly observed discharge may lead to good wound care and, ultimately, healing. Thus,
      this study proposes the utilization of an nonremovable windowed Fiberglass Cast Boot, a
      technique which has led to healing in 6 to 8 weeks for 95% of neuropathic foot ulcers treated
      that way.

      As 80% of amputations are caused by non-healing ulcers, it appears obvious that enhancing
      foot wounds healing could reduce amputation rate and in that way fairly improve diabetic
      patients' quality of life.
