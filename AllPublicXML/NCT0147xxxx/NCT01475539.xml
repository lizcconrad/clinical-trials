      The purpose of this study is to generate data to support the registration extension of IMOVAX
      Polio to be used in a sequential vaccination.

      Primary objective:

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of Inactivated Poliomyelitis Vaccine (IPV)-(Oral
           Poliomyelitis Vaccine) (OPV)-OPV (Sequential 1) and IPV-IPV-OPV (sequential 2)
           poliovirus vaccine administrations versus OPV-OPV-OPV (Reference) in terms of
           seroprotection rate 28 to 42 days after the third dose of the primary vaccination
           series.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate the safety profile of the investigational vaccines after each administration
           in each group.

        -  To describe the humoral immune response to poliovirus serotypes (types 1, 2 and 3)
           before the first dose and 28 to 42 days after the third primary series dose of vaccine
           in each group.

        -  To describe the persistence of antibodies against poliovirus serotypes (types 1, 2 and
           3) after the third primary series dose administration, at 18 months of age in each
           group.

      Study participants will be randomized to receive either 3 doses of a commercially available
      Oral Poliovirus Vaccine (OPV), or 1 dose of Sanofi Pasteur's injectable Inactivated
      Poliovirus Vaccine IMOVAX Polio (IPV) followed by 2 doses of OPV, or 2 doses of IPV followed
      by 1 dose of OPV.

      These vaccines will be administered at 2, 3 and 4 months of age as primary vaccination for
      the prevention of poliomyelitis. Participants will be followed up through their 18th- to
      19th-month birthday.
