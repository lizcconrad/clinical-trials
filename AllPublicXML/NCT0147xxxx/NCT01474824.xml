  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Measurement of how much blood the heart pumps may be useful in guiding how much intravenous
      fluid to give patients during surgery. The current monitors either require special drips
      (arterial and/or central lines) or a probe inserted into the oesophagus (food pipe) which may
      limit their use. Newer monitors are available which are completely non-invasive and seem to
      work well in younger patients. Patients with hip fracture are elderly and frail. The
      investigators wish to see whether the newer non-invasive monitor works well enough compared
      to the current monitors in this group of patients. If it does this may allow more of these
      patients to be monitored in this way.

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators wish to compare the accuracy of the newer, non-invasive monitor (Nexfin)
      against a more established minimally invasive monitor (LiDCO). The LiDCO has a calibration
      system which allows the absolute accuracy of the Nexfin to be established.
