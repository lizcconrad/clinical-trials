    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the biomarkers in subjects before and after
      sports-induced traumatic brain injury. The assay will be studied in a sample population of
      subjects over the age of 18 participating in college sports.

      Concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a condition that affects hundreds of
      thousands of patients worldwide. It is a biomechanically induced neurological injury,
      resulting in an alteration of mental status, such as confusion or amnesia, which may or may
      not involve a loss of consciousness. Concussion affects about 1.6 million to 3.8 million
      athletes yearly, most commonly in contact sports such as American football and boxing. Early
      clinical effects of concussion include but are not limited to behavioral changes, impairments
      of memory and attention, headache, unsteadiness, and rarely, catastrophic severe brain injury
      (sometimes described as second impact syndrome). More recently, the consequences of
      repetitive mTBI from multiple concussions in a sports setting are becoming evident. Repeated
      concussions have been associated with greater severity of symptoms, with longer recovery
      time, and chronically with earlier onset of age-related memory disturbances and dementia. As
      a result and in contradistinction to the decades-earlier perception that these injuries were
      benign, sports medicine professionals are now increasingly being instructed to recognize and
      manage concussions as soon as they occur. &quot;Understanding the neurobiology of concussion will
      lead to development and validation of physiological biomarkers of this common injury.&quot; These
      biomarkers (e.g., laboratory tests, imaging, electrophysiology) will then allow for improved
      detection, better functional assessment and evidence-based return to play recommendations.
