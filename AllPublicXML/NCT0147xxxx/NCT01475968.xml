  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the acute health effects of concentrated ambient
      ultrafine (UF) particulate matter (PM) exposure in patients with metabolic syndrome. Without
      lifestyle changes or medical intervention these patients are at considerable risk for
      developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Subjects (25-70) were exposed to both UF PM
      and filtered air for 2hr (at least 2 week interval), physiologic endpoints were measure pre-,
      post-, and 20hr post-exposure. Our hypothesis is that PM exposure in this population will
      result in changes in vascular and endothelial response as assessed by flow-mediated
      dilatation of the brachial artery and various heart rate variability and blood endpoints.
      This study and similar studies of susceptible populations are needed to provide the EPA with
      information regarding the health risks associated with ambient levels of UF PM.
