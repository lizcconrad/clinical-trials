  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscle is composed of two fibre types which are intertwined. Skeletal muscle
      weakness, particularly of the walking muscles, is an important complication of Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) but so far the investigators do not know what mechanisms
      drive the process.

      All existing studies have investigated signalling pathways in the whole muscle so they have
      been forced to consider type I and type II fibres together. It is possible that disease
      selectively affects one fibre type, most likely type I fibres which are in fact lost in COPD
      patients. For this reason mechanisms of disease may have been overlooked by current studies.

      The applicants have acquired the technology which allows type I and type II fibres in a
      muscle specimen to be split (by laser capture microdissection) and so signalling pathways can
      be assessed separately in type II and type I fibres which is what this proposal sets out to
      do.

      The proposal therefore aims to capture well characterised clinical data from 60 COPD patients
      and 20 age matched controls, from whom a biopsy of the main walking muscle, the quadriceps,
      will be taken. In the samples the investigators will assess at a fibre specific level
      inflammatory signalling. Surplus material will be retained for subsequent fibre specific
      analysis.
