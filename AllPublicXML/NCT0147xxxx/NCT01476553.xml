      A Japanese study showed that the additional use of an &quot;Extensive Intraperitoneal Lavage&quot;
      (EIPL), i.e. an extensive washing of the abdominal cavity with water, during surgery for
      gastric cancer can lead to a significant increase in survival. However, the study was
      confined to patients in whom upon commencing surgery, free peritoneal tumor cells were
      detected, which is only a small fraction of patients.

      The primary objective of our study is to assess in all patients undergoing removal of the
      stomach and adjacent lymph nodes for stomach cancer, if EIPL can eliminate free peritoneal
      tumor cells which have been present at the beginning of the surgery or after the stomach and
      lymph node removal. Secondary objectives are to assess how often free peritoneal tumor cells
      occur in patients with stomach cancer, how often surgical resection itself leads to a release
      of tumor cells, the safety of the EIPL procedure, and disease-free and overall survival of
      patients undergoing EIPL. Based on the outcome of this japanese study we want to test with
      special laboratory methods why this lavage leads to a better outcome.

      Specifically, the trial will test the hypotheses that a) lymph node dissection causes a
      release of tumor cells in the abdominal cavity, and b) EIPL eliminates free peritoneal tumor
      cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In spite of the existence of multimodal therapy, the long-term survival of patients with
      gastric cancer remains poor. In advanced tumor stages, five-year survival rates rarely exceed
      30%. One of the factors limiting overall survival is peritoneal carcinomatosis, which
      frequently occurs after surgical treatment with curative intention.

      Peritoneal carcinomatosis is supposed to develop from peritoneal implantation of tumor cells
      already present in the abdominal cavity during primary surgery. It is assumed that both
      serosal tumor infiltration and intraoperative lymphadenectomy, which per se leads to a
      survival improvement (1) and is therefore considered standard in Europe and Japan ((2),
      http://www.jpca.jp/PDFfiles/ Guidelines2004_eng.pdf), can release tumor cells into the
      peritoneal cavity. Of note, a Japanese study found that tumor cells were released into the
      peritoneal cavity during lymphadenectomy in 14-46% of patients, depending on preoperative
      tumor stage (3).

      A randomized clinical trial from Japan (4) demonstrated that an &quot;extensive intraperitoneal
      lavage&quot; (EIPL), i.e. an irrigation of the abdominal cavity with ten times one liter of
      physiological saline solution, in combination with intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IPC) carried
      out after gastrectomy and lymphadenectomy, led to a significant improvement in overall
      survival compared to patients who received only surgery and IPC without EIPL, and those who
      received surgery alone without EIPL and IPC. These results suggest that the largest survival
      benefit is attributable to the addition of EIPL to IPC (5-year survival rate: 43.8% vs. 4.6%)
      and not to the addition of IPC to surgery alone (5-year survival rate: 4.6% vs. 0%).

      However, it is important to consider that the study included only patients in whom peritoneal
      tumor cells were detected before resection of the stomach and lymph nodes. Thus, only 90 of
      1522 (5.9%) patients operated in the participating centers throughout the study period
      fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Furthermore, the study design was not appropriate to assess
      if EIPL really leads to a reduction of free tumor cells as assumed. Regarding this
      hypothesis, the only available results stem from single patients out of smaller studies
      (4;5). To date, there is no higher level evidence from larger populations.

      The present trial, for the first time, uses EIPL as additional treatment in patients with any
      tumor stage and regardless of the detection of intraperitoneal tumor cells at the beginning
      of the operation.

      Intraperitoneal lavage fluid will be harvested and assessed for tumor cells at three
      different points of time:

      (i) before gastrectomy and lymphadenectomy (ii) after gastrectomy and lymphadenectomy,
      directly before EIPL (iii) after EIPL

      The trial will test the hypotheses that a) lymph node dissection causes a release of tumor
      cells in the abdominal cavity, and b) EIPL eliminates free peritoneal tumor cells.

    <intervention_name>Extensive Intraperitoneal Lavage (EIPL)</intervention_name>
    <description>EIPL is performed after completing resection and lymphadenectomy: the abdominal cavity has to be washed ten times with one liter Ringer's solution. Each liter has to be well dispersed manually in the abdominal cavity, and removed and disposed completely. 100 ml of the last liter of lavage fluid will be harvested and sent for analysis.
Contrary to the Japanese trial, Ringer's solution will be used instead of normal saline solution because of a presumed higher likelihood of peritoneal adhesions when employing the latter (7). Ringer's solution is the standard used for all intraperitoneal lavage procedures at the study centre. To avoid hypothermia, the lavage fluid will be warmed to body temperature (37° Celsius).</description>
