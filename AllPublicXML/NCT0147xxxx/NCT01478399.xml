      Primary objective:

      To compare the pharmacokinetic profile of Glymera (PB1023) Injection after a single dose
      administered by subcutaneous injection to subjects with normal renal function and impaired
      renal function.

      Secondary objectives:

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Glymera (PB1023) Injection administered as a
      subcutaneous injection in adult subjects with normal renal function and impaired renal
      function.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females age 18 - 79 years of age inclusive.

          -  BMI 19 - 40 kg/m2.

          -  Renally Impaired Subjects: In otherwise stable health except for Renal Disease.

          -  Healthy volunteers must have/be: eGFR as calculated by MDRD of ≥ 80 mL/min, and
             Matched to renally impaired subjects for age (± 15 years), weight (± 15 kg), and if
             possible BMI, race and gender.

          -  Subjects with renal impairment must have 2 separate eGFR that are within 20% of each
             other and clinically stable for a minimum of 6 months.

          -  No clinically relevant abnormalities in the results of the laboratory screening or
             admission evaluation other than those consistent with renal impairment or related
             disease/disorder in the appropriate subject group as determined by the Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently taking or have taken a GLP -1 agent (e.g., Byetta®, Victoza®) within the
             past year.

          -  Subjects who have previously received PB1023.

          -  Known allergy or serious adverse effect to an approved or investigational GLP-1
             receptor analog/agonist.

          -  Serious Infection within 60 days of admission.

          -  Donation or loss of greater than 400 mL of blood 56 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Unstable cardiovascular disease defined as per protocol.

          -  Clinically significant hepatic dysfunction defined as per protocol.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant or lactating.

             or have received any other investigational drug or device within 30 days or 5
             half-lives prior to dosing or are taking part in a non-drug study which in the opinion
             of the Investigator would interfere with the outcome of the study.
