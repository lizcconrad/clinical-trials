    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the performance of the Agili-C implants. The study
      hypothesis is that Agili-C implants are effective in the treatment of focal cartilage and
      cartilage-bone joint surface defects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Agili-C implant is a bi-phasic, porous resorbable tissue regeneration scaffold for the
      treatment of focal articular cartilage and for osteochondral defects. Up to 50 patients are
      to be included in the study. Patients suffering from isolated, single and focal cartilage or
      osteochondral defect at the knee joint are considered for study inclusion.

    <description>The implantation site should be created in perpendicular manner to the articular cartilage. The surrounding tissue will be cleaned and scraped to prepare a clean site. The implant will be placed in the correct orientation (drilled channels pointing towards the joint side and chamfer towards the bone).
The implant will be inserted gently in a pressed fit manner.</description>

    <description>The procedure will be conducted according to hospital practice. The implants will be positioned via open incision, depending on lesion location, and Investigator`s final decision. Related treatments during the procedure should be recorded.
Device positioning details medications and adverse events during the procedure will be recorded. MOCART (off-site), X-ray evaluation (off-site), ICRS Cartilage injury mapping system, Articular cartilage injury Classification and the Osteochondritis Dissecans classification will be recorded.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. 18 to 55 years

          2. Symptomatic, single, focal, full or near full-thickness (ICRS cartilage defect
             description grades 3 and 4) chondral or osteochondral isolated lesion of the femoral
             condyle, trochlea or the tibial plateau

               -  Defect area is less than 2 cm² after debridement. The defect is completely
                  surrounded on all sides by healthy cartilage.

               -  Osteochondral defect ICRS Cartilage defect description type 1, 2, 3, 4A. Maximal
                  defect depth should be up to 3 millimeters.

             prior to surgery or chemotherapy.

               -  Previous operative treatment of Arthroscopic marrow stimulation technique or cell
                  therapy operated within the last 6 months

               -  Any previous operation of cartilage treatment within the last 6 months

             infection, hepatitis infection or HTLV infection), known coagulopathies, severe
             vascular or neurological disease or acute injury that might compromise the patient's
             welfare.

         17. Substance abuse or alcohol abuse.

         18. Participation in another clinical trials in parallel to this study.

         19. Type I diabetes.

         20. Unable to undergo MRI or X-ray.

         21. Any reasons making the patient a poor candidate in the opinion of the investigator.
