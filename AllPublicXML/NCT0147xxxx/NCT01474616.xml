  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost 90 percent of residents living in long-term care facilities have some type of mobility
      limitation, which worsens quickly once they move into a long-term care facility. This means
      that they cannot easily walk or move around in their day-to-day lives and this can have
      serious consequences for their general health and well-being. Researchers have shown that
      exercise can help the mobility of even the oldest of adults but elderly residents in
      long-term care facilities still commonly sit or lie in bed for long periods of time, in many
      cases for most of their waking hours. The purpose of this research is to study the effect of
      a simple physical activity on the mobility and quality of life of residents in long-term care
      facilities. Researchers will introduce a sit-to-stand activity to health care aides which
      will become part of their daily routine with residents. The basic sit-to-stand movement is
      already a part of the daily activities that health care aides do with residents.
      Specifically, health care aides will ask residents to repeat the sit-to-stand activity at
      mealtimes, when using the toilet, and on other occasions of daily activity. An important part
      of this research is to find out how well the activity preserves the ability of residents to
      stay mobile and also to examine how this will improve their quality of life in the home. The
      MOVE study will demonstrate whether it is possible to delay the loss of mobility in long-term
      care residents by incorporating the sit-to-stand activity into the regular practice of health
      care aides.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-Months, 6-Months</time_frame>
    <description>The sit-to-stand action is a functional activity that has been incorporated into a number of mobility measures. We have chosen to measure mobility using the number of sit-to-stands in 30 seconds because in the frail nursing home population many residents have difficulty transferring (e.g.standing up from a chair). In our pilot study we found many residents were unable to complete more than two or three sit-to-stands. Residents will be instructed to stand up and sit down as many times as possible until they are asked to stop after 30 seconds (Jones, Rikli, &amp; Beam, 1999).</description>

    <description>The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) is an 18-item performance-based instrument which assesses the amount of assistance required to complete basic activities of daily living using a 7-point scale graded from 1 (dependent) to 7 (independent) (Jones &amp; Feeny, 2006).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-Months, 6-Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Utilities Index Mark 2 and 3 (HUI2/3) is a generic health related quality of life questionnaire based on two generic multi-attribute preference-based systems: the HUI2 and the HUI3. The HUI2 assesses capacity on six dimensions (or attributes) of health status: sensation (vision, hearing, and speech), mobility, emotion, cognition, self-care, and pain. The HUI3 consists of eight attributes: vision; hearing; speech; ambulation; dexterity; emotion; cognition; and, pain (Furlong, et al., 2011).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-Months, 6-Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease (QofL-AD) was developed to capture the domains considered important to quality of life in Lawton's broad conceptual framework: the interpersonal; environmental; functional; physical; and, psychological domains. The 13 items including physical health, energy, mood, living situation, memory, family, marriage, friends, self as a whole, ability to do chores around the house, fun, money, life as a whole scored on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (poor) to 4 (excellent) (Lawton, 1983; 1991).</description>

    <description>Health care aides will be expected to prompt residents to repeatedly stand up and sit down on four occasions throughout the day (twice on each of the day and evening shifts). The number of repetitions on each occasion will vary according to residents' ability and fatigue. The sit-to-stand activity is to be integrated into usual care routines such as when entering the dining room at mealtimes, while toileting, and on other occasions of regular activity. The timing and location will be at the discretion of the health care aide.</description>
