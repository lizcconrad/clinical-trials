        Inclusion Criteria

        All candidates for the study must meet the following inclusion criteria:

          1. Severe aortic valve stenosis determined by echocardiogram and Doppler, defined as:
             mean gradient &gt;40 mmHg or peak jet velocity &gt;4.0 m/s and an aortic valve area ≤0.8 cm2
             or aortic valve area index ≤0.5 cm2/m2

          2. Symptomatic aortic valve stenosis demonstrated by angina, congestive heart failure,
             NYHA Functional Class ≥ II, or syncope

          3. Patient is an extreme risk candidate for open surgical aortic valve repair such that
             the site Investigators (interventional cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeon) agree
             that medical factors preclude operation, based on the conclusion that the probability
             of death or serious morbidity exceeds the probability of meaningful improvement due to
             the patient's co-morbidities (such as, but not limited to, severe COPD, porcelain
             aorta, previous thorax irradiation) or logistic EuroSCORE ≥ 20

          4. ≥ 70 years old

          5. Patient has been informed of the nature of the study and has provided written informed
             consent

          6. Patient and treating physician agree that the patient will return for all required
             post-procedure follow-up visits

        Exclusion Criteria

        Candidates will be excluded from the study if any of the following criteria are present:

          1. Patient is a surgical candidate for aortic valve replacement

          2. Congenital bicuspid or unicuspid valve determined by echocardiography

          3. Native valve annulus diameter is &lt;17mm or &gt;22mm determined by the screening CT scan

          4. Extreme asymmetrical calcification of the native aortic valve determined by the
             screening CT scan

          5. Native valvular or peripheral vascular anatomy is not appropriate for the DFM
             bioprosthesis and 18F delivery system

          6. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;30% determined by resting echocardiogram

          7. Evidence of an acute myocardial infarction (Refer to Definitions in Section 8) within
             30 days prior to the study procedure

          8. Any percutaneous coronary or peripheral interventional procedure performed within 30
             days prior to the study procedure

          9. Any planned surgical or percutaneous coronary or peripheral procedure to be performed
             during the study procedure or prior to 30 day follow-up visit

         10. Need for emergency surgery for any reason

         11. Untreated clinically significant ( &gt; 70% obstruction) coronary artery disease
             requiring revascularization

         12. Prior aortic or mitral valve surgery

         13. Pre-existing prosthetic heart valve in any position

         14. Mitral insufficiency greater than moderate determined by resting echocardiography

         15. Echocardiographic evidence of intra-cardiac mass, thrombus or vegetation

         16. Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA)

         17. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) &gt;4.5 cm

         18. Presence of an endovascular stent graft for treatment of AAA or TAA

         19. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

         20. Hemodynamic instability (e.g. requiring inotropic support)

         21. Trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) is contraindicated

         22. Renal insufficiency (creatinine &gt; 3.0 mg/dL) and/or end-stage renal disease requiring
             dialysis at the time of screening

         23. Active endocarditis or sepsis within 6 months prior to the study procedure

         24. Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 6 months prior to the study procedure

         25. Cardiogenic shock within 30 days prior to the study procedure

         26. Active peptic ulcer or upper GI bleeding within 3 months prior to the study procedure

         27. Leukopenia (WBC &lt;3000/mm³), acute anemia (Hb &lt;9 g/dL), or thrombocytopenia (platelet
             count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3)

         28. History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or refusal of blood transfusions

         29. A known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin, ticlopidine or
             clopidogrel, or sensitivity to contrast media, which cannot be adequately
             pre-medicated

         30. Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device trial

         31. Previously enrolled in this study

         32. Patient refusal of surgery

         33. Life expectancy thought to be &lt;12 months

         34. Dementia (resulting in either inability to provide informed consent for the
             trial/procedure, prevents independent lifestyle outside of a chronic care facility, or
             will fundamentally complicate rehabilitation from the procedure or compliance with
             follow-up visits)
