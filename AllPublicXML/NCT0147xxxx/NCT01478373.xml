    <measure>Antitumor Activity of Dovitinib in Terms of Disease Control Rate (DCR): Complete Response+Partial Response +Stable Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of Complete Responses (CR), Partial Response (PR) and Stable Disease (SD) at 12 weeks according to RECIST (version 1.1). Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm 1;Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm2. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR or CR nor an increase in lesions which would qualify for PD.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) of Patients Treated With Dovitinib</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PFS duration: time from entry into the study to the date of the first documented progression (assessed using conventional RECIST (version 1.1) or death due to any cause. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Treatment Failure (TTF)of Patients Treated With Dovitinib</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>TTF: the date of entry into the study to the earliest date of the first objective tumor progression, date of death due to any cause, or date of discontinuation due to reasons other than 'Protocol deviation' or 'Administrative problems'.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response or Stable Disease (SD)</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response or SD: time from date of entry into study to earliest date of first objective tumor progression or death. DCR is defined as proportion of patients with best overall response of CR, PR and SD at 12 weeks according to RECIST (version 1.1). CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm 1; PR: At least a 30% decrease in sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. PD: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm2.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Tumor Progression (TTP)of Patients Treated With Dovitinib</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>TTP: time from the date of entry into the study to first documentation of tumor progression or death due to the underlying cancer. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR) of Patients Treated With Dovitinib</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome Measure Description: ORR: proportion of patients whose best overall response is either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST (version 1.1). Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm 1;Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm2. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR or CR nor an increase in lesions which would qualify for PD.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS) of Patients Treated With Dovitinib</measure>
    <time_frame>21 months (9 months of estimated treatment plus 12 months of survival follow up)</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome Measure Description: OS: time from the date of entry into the study to the date of death due to any cause. A patient who has not died by the date of the analysis cut-off would have the OS censored at the time of the last contact before the cut-off date.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>DCR (CR+PR+SD) at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 9 months of estimated treatment</time_frame>
    <description>DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR and SD at the end of dovitinib treatment according to RECIST (version 1.1). Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm 1;Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline.

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm 1;Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm2. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR or CR nor an increase in lesions which would qualify for PD.</description>

          <description>Outcome Measure Description: ORR: proportion of patients whose best overall response is either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST (version 1.1). Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm 1;Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm2. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR or CR nor an increase in lesions which would qualify for PD.</description>
