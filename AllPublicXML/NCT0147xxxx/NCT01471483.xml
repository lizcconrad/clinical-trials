  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older woman with ovarian cancer have a worse prognosis compared to younger patients. However,
      the reason is not known. Currently, the standard of care is to evaluate younger and older
      patients with cancer the same way. However, older patients with cancer often have more
      complicated issues to manage. For example, older patients often have other medical problems,
      take more medications, and be dependent on others for help and transportation. Too often, the
      medical team is unaware of these issues which can effect the patients care.

      The purpose of this study is to apply a set of questions designed specifically for patients
      with cancer who are older than 65 years of age. These questions are called a geriatric
      assessment.

      The investigators want to better understand which older patients with ovarian cancer will be
      able to tolerate the chemotherapy and surgery and why. This study will also see if a
      telephone call from a nurse who specializes in caring for older patients will improve patient
      care. This study will determine how feasible it is to perform geriatric assessments and
      telephone calls in patients with ovarian cancer.

    <description>The geriatric assessment will be completed at four time points: 1) on the day the patient receives a new chemotherapy regimen or within 30 days prior, 2) within 30 days of completion of the chemotherapy regimen (or at 12 months from study entry +/-30 days if the chemotherapy regimen is still being continued), 3) within 30 days prior to surgical debulking, and 4) 30 days after surgical debulking. The patient will receive a phone call once a week by a nurse who is an expert in caring for older patients. He/she will be asking questions about symptoms, medications and support at home. Each call is designed to last less than 30 minutes.</description>
