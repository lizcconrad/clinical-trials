    <measure>Corneal Fluorescein Staining Type at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (Baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Corneal staining type was assessed by the investigator for each of 5 regions of the cornea, i.e., four quadrants plus central. The investigator instilled fluorescein dye and examined the cornea with a slit lamp, i.e., biomicroscope and a yellow filter. Corneal staining type was recorded on a 5-point scale for each region: 0-none; 1-micropunctate; 2-macropunctate; 3-coalesced macropunctate; 4-patch (&gt;/= 1mm). The five regions were summed, for a maximum score of 20. A lower score represents a more desirable outcome.</description>

The investigator instilled fluorescein dye and examined the cornea with a slit lamp, i.e., biomicroscope and a yellow filter. The area (extent) of corneal staining for each of the five areas was estimated [i.e., 0% (no staining in the region) to 100% (staining covers entire region)], for a maximum score of 100% per eye. A lower score represents a more desirable outcome.</description>

             minimum of 8 hours per day) for at least one month prior to Visit 1;

          -  Habitual use of a multi-purpose solution containing PHMB for at least 30 days prior to
             Visit 1;

          -  Vision correctable to 20/30 (Snellen) or better in each eye at distance with pre-study
             lenses at Visit 1;

          -  Read, sign, and date IRB-approved informed consent and privacy document;

          -  Be generally healthy and have normal ocular health;

          -  Willing to follow the study procedures and visit schedule;

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Wear lenses on an extended wear basis during the study;

             products;

          -  Monocular subject;

          -  Requirestoric or multifocal contact lenses;

          -  Use of additional lens care products other than a PHMB multi-purpose solution such as
             daily or enzyme cleaners within the one week prior to Visit 1;

          -  Use of topical ocular over-the-counter (OTC) or prescribed topical ocular medications,

          -  Use of any systemic medication which has known or expected ocular or systemic side
             effects at Visit 1, that in the clinical judgment of the investigator, could affect
             the subject's participation in this study;

          -  Any systemic disease at Visit 1 that may affect the eye or be exacerabated by use of

        <title>Corneal Fluorescein Staining Area at Baseline</title>
        <description>Corneal staining was assessed by the investigator for each of five regions of the cornea, i.e., four quadrants plus central. The investigator instilled fluorescein dye and examined the cornea with a slit lamp, i.e., biomicroscope and a yellow filter. The area (extent) of corneal staining for each of the five areas was estimated [i.e., 0% (no staining in the region) to 100% (staining covers entire region)], for a maximum score of 100% per eye. A lower score represents a more desirable outcome.</description>
