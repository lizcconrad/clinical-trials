    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential for a pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug
      interaction between INX-08189 and extended release verapamil hydrochloride (verapamil HCL
      ER).

      This is a single-center, open-label, single-sequence, crossover, drug-drug interaction study
      in healthy subjects.

      Primary Objectives:

      Safety

      - To evaluate the safety of a single dose of INX-08189 (50 mg) alone and combined with
      verapamil HCL ER (240 mg) after subjects receive verapamil HCL ER QD for 6 days

      Pharmacokinetic

      - To evaluate the effect of multiple doses of verapamil HCL ER (240 mg) on the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of INX-08189 and the metabolite INX-08032, and the effect of a
      single dose of INX-08189 on the PK profile of verapamil and the metabolite norverapamil
