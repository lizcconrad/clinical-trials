    <textblock>
      This study is to see whether treating diabetic retinal swelling with ranibizumab injections
      into the eye monthly is better than treating diabetic retinal swelling with ranibizumab
      injections into the eye less frequently.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized study comparing two groups of patients with diabetic macular
      edema. One group will receive injections of ranibizumab monthly and the other group will have
      the option to receive injections of ranibizumab less frequently. That is eligible to receive
      the injections less frequently will have fewer injections given if the patients in that group
      are doing well.
