  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin A supplementation (VAS) significantly reduces all-cause mortality when given after 6
      months of age, but has a null or detrimental effect when given between 1-5 months. Studies of
      neonatal VAS (NNVAS) have produced conflicting findings. These age-pattern variations might
      result from immunological interactions between VAS and vaccines. The potential efficacy of
      NNVAS is being retested in 3 large new intervention trials with mortality as endpoint.
      Complementary mechanistic studies in animals and in human infants in The Gambia (this
      proposal) and Bangladesh have been commissioned to run in parallel.

      The investigators will use a 2-arm double blind RCT to test whether NNVAS modulates the early
      ontogeny of human immune development. Neonates, recruited through a peri-urban clinic in The
      Gambia, will receive either 50,000 International Units (IU) VAS orally within 48 hours of
      birth (intervention group, n=100) or a placebo (control group, n=100). Male and female
      neonates will be randomized separately at enrolment for later analyses by sex. All infants
      will be followed up from birth to age 1 year. A broad panel of immunological outcomes will
      examine whether NNVAS: a). normalises thymic development (thymic index by ultrasound); b).
      skews mycobacterial and recall antigen responses towards a Th2 profile; c). diminishes Th1
      and Th17 reactivity to mycobacterial and recall antigens; d). diminishes the tuberculin skin
      test (TST) response; e). causes increased innate immune reactivity; f). increases the
      frequency of circulating regulatory T cells (Tregs) expressing gut homing receptors; g).
      enhances B cell immune responses after routine vaccination (increase of B cell numbers and
      activation status); h). increases circulating IgA in mucosal immune compartment, especially
      oral polio vaccine (OPV) specific IgA post-vaccination; i). decreases bacterial
      translocation, by improving mucosal barrier function; and j). decreases markers of infection
      or inflammation. Growth and morbidity will also be assessed.
