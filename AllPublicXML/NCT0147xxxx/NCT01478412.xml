  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is to determine if prostate target delineation obtained through an ultrasound
      based system is equivalent in accuracy to the MRI image fusion, and if alignment correction
      vectors obtained from ultrasound imaging are of equivalent accuracy to orthogonal X-ray
      imaging for daily prostate positioning.

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators will also be assessing the following:

        1. Whether polymer-based markers can be adequately visualized on daily stereoscopic imaging
           compared to gold seed markers.

        2. Whether polymer-based markers are visible on ultrasound imaging.

        3. To determine if the polymer-based marker produces fewer artifacts on treatment planning
           CT scans than gold markers.
