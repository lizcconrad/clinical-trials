      An MRI study to develop a reliable methodology for 31P MRS ischaemic exercise in order to
      obtain a consistent standard of measurement of muscle metabolism while maintaining an
      acceptable level of subject comfort and use optimised method to measure and compare
      metabolism in the biceps and quadriceps of patients with COPD-related myopathy and control
      subjects

      31P Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (31P MRS) is a non-invasive method to measure muscle
      metabolism during exercise. This protocol is intended to provide information for planning
      future clinical trials applying 31P MRS as an endpoint measure for proof of pharmacology
      studies with novel therapeutic molecules. Parts A &amp; B of this study will refine imaging and
      exercise protocols for 31P MRS during brief periods of muscle ischaemia and will assess the
      test-retest variance. In Part C we will apply 31P MRS with aerobic exercise in a pilot study
      to estimate differences in skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism between age- and sex-matched
      control subjects and patients with myopathy associated with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Fit to safely tolerate procedures

          2. Male or female between 18 and 80 years of age

          3. If pre-menopausal female, non-pregnant on dipstick urinalysis

          4. Subject and responsible physician agree that the subject will be able to comfortably
             lie in scanning position in the scanner for up to 90 minutes

          5. Capable of giving written informed consent

          6. All four limbs are intact and free of disease

        The following criteria apply to patients with COPD myopathy only:

          1. Established diagnosis of COPD with a disease classification of GOLD Stage II and above
             with suspected or established diagnosis of myopathy and/or COPD with low BMI (under 20
             for men and under 19 for women) and/or MVC under 120% of the BMI.

          2. At least a 20 pack year history of smoking

          3. Resting oxygen saturation above 85% on room air

          4. Ambulant and not oxygen-dependent at rest or during mild exertion

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Ineligible for MRI/MRS scanning in accordance to local MR safety regulations

          2. Any medical condition, acute or chronic, that will lead to potential discomfort when
             lying supine in the magnet for periods up to 90 min

          3. Any medical condition that will lead to potential discomfort with repetitive movement
             of the limb being tested in the scanner

          4. Subjects undergoing ischaemic/anaerobic 31P MRS must have no history of clinically
             significant peripheral vascular disease, abnormal blood clotting, deep vein thrombosis
             or pulmonary embolism or suspected clinically significant signs of limb vascular
             disease on screening examination.

          5. Subjects undergoing ischaemic/anaerobic 31P MRS must not have taken the oral
             contraceptive pill, hormone replacement therapy, or undergone anaesthesia within past
             1 month, or have a history of recent prolonged immobility greater than 4 hours (e.g.
             air travel), or considered unfit in the opinion of the study physician

          6. Concurrent medical conditions known or suspected that in the opinion of the
             responsible physician could confound interpretation of results.

          7. A medical or psychiatric history that in the opinion of the responsible physician
             would risk safety of the subject or well-being of the subject.

        The following criteria apply to control subjects and COPD patients participating in Part C
        of the study:

          1. Oxygen saturations below 85% on room air at rest, or significant desaturation on mild
             exertion.

          2. Current or recent (&lt;4 weeks) infectious exacerbation of COPD requiring corticosteroid
             therapy at the time of screening or scanning visit day.

          3. Any significant medical illness other than COPD which, in the opinion of the study
             physician, may preclude participation or which by virtue of being associated with
             muscle weakness may cause distortion of the results (e.g. neuromuscular disease,
             severe heart failure &amp;c).

          4. Control subjects with any history of regular smoking
