    <textblock>
      This study will compare a cognitive-behavioral online self-management intervention designed
      for primary care treatment of war-related PTSD to a control intervention, &quot;optimized usual
      primary care PTSD treatment&quot;. Patients with PTSD will be trained to use the online PTSD
      treatment website and asked to do so three times per week for six weeks. They will have phone
      and email access to a nurse trained to assist them in their treatment program. Three
      scheduled phone check-ins during the six week treatment period will provide ongoing contact
      with patients during treatment. The investigators will assess PTSD symptoms, depression,
      anxiety and somatic symptoms, physical health status and occupational functioning on three
      occasions: before the intervention, at the end of the treatment period, and six weeks after
      the end of treatment.

      The study is a multi-site trial evaluating the efficacy of DESTRESS-PC (DElivery of
      Self-TRaining and Education for Stressful Situations, primary care version), a brief,
      web-based self-management intervention for PTSD designed for delivery in primary care.
      Participants randomized to DESTRESS-PC log on to a secure website for self-CBT 3 times per
      week for 6 weeks and receive RN nurse care manager (&quot;DESTRESS Nurse&quot;) contact every two
      weeks. DESTRESS Nurses introduce the approach, monitor, answer questions, and insure primary
      care provider collaboration. The control intervention is optimized usual primary care.
      Blinded raters assess PTSD symptoms, depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, physical health
      status, and occupational functioning at four timepoints. All study participants receive RN
      care management and are under the care of a primary care provider trained in evidence-based
      PTSD treatment who receives status reports from the DESTRESS nurse to include baseline
      psychiatric status.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 18 weeks post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms of PTSD were assessed using the PTSD Checklist-Military Version (PCL). The PCL is a self-report measure developed for measuring PTSD symptom severity and for estimating PTSD caseness when administration of a structured clinical interview is not feasible. Respondents rate PCL items on a 5-point scale ('not at all' through &quot;extremely') to indicate the degree to which they have been bothered by each of 17 PTSD symptoms during the past month. Possible PCL scores range from 17 to 85.</description>

    <measure>PRIME-MD PHQ</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks,12 weeks, and 18 weeks post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ is a brief self-report assessment of common mental disorders developed specifically for primary care. PHQ allows brief provisional primary care diagnoses of several disorders including major depression, panic disorder, other anxiety disorder, and multi-somatoform disorder. We used the PHQ for baseline and follow-up assessments of depression, anxiety (panic and generalized anxiety), and somatic symptom severity, assessments with excellent correspondence to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 6 wks, 12 wks, and 18wks</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a widely used measure of health related quality of life with established reliability and validity. The SF-36 was used to describe the study sample, compare functional status of the intervention groups at baseline, and assess change in functional over the course of the study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attitude Regarding Mental Health Treatments</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We used two questions from Hoge and colleagues (2004): 'I don't trust mental health professionals,' and 'Mental health care doesn't work.' Both questions are rated using a five-point Likert-type scale. We also used two questions that rate attitudes regarding psychotherapy treatment ('Psychotherapy patients are wasting money,' and 'Therapy can help an individual'). The latter two questions, rated on the same 5-point scale, were part of a longer measure used to evaluate stigma in primary care patients with anxiety disorders.</description>
