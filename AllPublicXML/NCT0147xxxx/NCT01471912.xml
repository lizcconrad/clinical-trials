  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In our experience, elongation of foveal tissue after macular hole surgery which was
      undetectable by conventional time-domain optical coherence tomography was often observed on
      spectral-domain optical coherence tomography images. Elongation of tissues inevitably induces
      some degree of disorganization of tissue microstructure.

      The purpose of the present study was to evaluate elongation profile of foveal tissue after
      macular hole surgery and to investigate its impact on visual acuity and metamorphopsia.

    <intervention_name>pars plana vitrectomy and fluid gas exchange</intervention_name>
    <description>A three-port standard pars plana vitrectomy was performed by a single surgeon using a 23-gauge vitrectomy system, either Associate®(Dutch Ophthalmic Research Center. Inc., Zuidland, The Netherlands) or Accurus®(Alcon Laboratories Inc., Fort Worth, USA), with one step scleral tunnel incision. In all cases, the peeling of the internal limiting membrane, approximately 1 disc diameter area from center of MH was conducted without assistance of dyes followed by complete fluid-gas exchange using 25% sulfur hexafluoride gas. Combined cataract surgery was performed in patients with visually significant cataracts or with incipient cataract in the subjects older than 60 years. All patients were instructed to maintain a face-down position for at least 7 days postoperatively.</description>
