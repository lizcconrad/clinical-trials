      The purpose of this study is to determine if VM202 is safe and effective in treating painful
      diabetic neuropathy.

    <textblock>
      Peripheral neuropathy is a serious complication of diabetes. This form of neuropathy carries
      a high risk of pain, trophic changes and autonomic dysfunction. There is currently no
      effective treatment for diabetic neuropathy, and good glycemic control is the only way to
      minimize the risk of occurrence. Clearly, it would be desirable to prevent, impede, or
      reverse the disrupting and often life-threatening manifestations of peripheral neuropathy by
      stimulating growth or regeneration of peripheral nerve axons.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary study endpoint is the change in the average 24 hour pain score between baseline and the 6-month follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>seven (7) days before Day 0, Day 90, and the 6 Month and 9 Month visits</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in the mean change of the 24 hour pain score will be compared between the treatment groups and the placebo arm to determine treatment effect. The average pain scores will be obtained from the Daily Pain and Sleep Interference Diary (recorded daily by subjects for 7 days during Screening prior to the first round of injections and again, before the 6 month follow-up).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in VAS score</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Day 0, Day 30, Day 60, Day 90, 6 months, and 9 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analog scale (VAS)scoring instrument is a 100-mm line, oriented horizontally, with the left end indicating &quot;no pain&quot; and the right end representing &quot;very severe pain&quot;. The patient is asked to mark a place on the line corresponding to the current pain intensity. The distance along the scale is then converted into a numeric reading by measuring the distance of the patients mark in millimeters from the beginning of the scale (the 0 mark).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean Daily Pain and Sleep Interference Diary score from baseline to Day 90, 6 months and 9 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Day 90, 6 months, 9 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to keep a Daily Pain and Sleep Interference Diary. Subjects will be asked to rate their 24-hour average daily pain intensity score (0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain). The effect of pain on the subject's ability to sleep will be assessed using the sleep interference score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in BPI-SF</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, Day 30, Day 60, Day 90, 6 months, and 9 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The brief pain inventory (BPI-SF) will be self-administered during site visits on Day 0 before the treatment (injection), on Day 30, Day 60, Day 90, at 6 months and 9 months. The Questionnaire is a patient - completed numeric rating scale that assesses the severity of pain, its impact on daily functioning, and other aspects of pain (e.g. location of pain, relief from medications).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's Global Impression of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30, Day 60, Day 90, 6 months, and 9 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's global impression of change after treatment will be measured using the Patient's Global Impression of Change (PGIC) questionnaire. This questionnaire measures a patient's perception of how treatment has affected their level of activity, symptoms, emotions, and overall quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse events (including serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation) will be described according to severity and to their relationship with the study drug and injection procedure.</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in MNSI score</measure>
    <time_frame>Screen, 6 months and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI) will be conducted at Screening in order to confirm the diagnosis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and at 6 months and 9 months to track disease progression.The MNSI is comprised of a subject questionnaire (15 questions) and of a physical evaluation which includes a foot inspection, vibration sensation testing, muscle stretch reflexes, and monofilament testing.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre treatment Day 0, pre-treatment Day 14, Day 30, 60 and 90</time_frame>
    <description>Serum HGF will be determined by ELISA and analyzed by a central laboratory.</description>
