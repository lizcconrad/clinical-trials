  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, phase Ib/ II study (two parts) with patients
      that have locally advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer. The first part (phase Ib) will
      investigate the MTD/ RP2D of the combination therapy of BEZ235 BID and weekly trastuzumab
      using a Bayesian model. Once MTD/ RP2D is established the second part (phase II) will start.
      Phase II will evaluate the efficacy and the safety of weekly trastuzumab plus BEZ235 BID
      compared to capecitabine and lapatinib.
