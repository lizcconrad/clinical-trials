      Background:

      - The drugs FdCyd (also called 5-fluoro-2'-deoxcytidine) and THU (also called
      tetrahydrouridine) are being used in a cancer treatment study. Not a lot is known about how
      FdCyd works in the body. Researchers want to look at a modified form of FdCyd using imaging
      studies to see how the drug reacts with the cancer. This study is not a treatment study. It
      is open only to people who are already on the FdCyd and THU cancer treatment study.

      Objectives:

      - To study how FdCyd affects advanced cancer cells.

      Eligibility:

      - Participants in National Cancer Institute study 09-C-0214.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have two imaging studies, one before starting FdCyd and THU treatment
           and one after starting treatment.

        -  Participants will have the modified FdCyd, known as F-18 FdCyd, with a dose of THU. The
           doses will be followed by two imaging study scans and frequent blood samples.

        -  This procedure will be repeated at a later date, during the FdCyd and THU treatment
           period.

        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study. This is an imaging study protocol
           only.

      BACKGROUND:

      - In pre-clinical models, 5-fluoro-2 -deoxycytidine (FdCyd), administered along with

      tetrahydrouridine (THU; an inhibitor of cytidine/deoxycytidine deaminase), has shown superior
      anti-tumor activity as compared with 5-fluorouracil.

      - FdCyd can be phosphorylated to 5-fluoro-2 -deoxycytidylate (FdCMP) by deoxycytidine

      kinase and the nucleotide deaminated to FdUMP by deoxycytidylate (dCMP) deaminase.

      The activity of dCMP deaminase is reported to be higher in human malignancies than in normal
      tissues, which may result in selective cytotoxicity.

        -  FdCyd is an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase and DNA methylation, resulting in
           reexpression of genes silenced by DNA hypermethylation. It is being evaluated in a phase
           II multihistology clinical trial at the Developmental Therapeutics Clinic, NCI, Clinical
           Center, NIH.

        -  While FdCyd + THU has shown preliminary evidence of activity in early phase trials not
           all patients show clinical response. The establishment of a radiolabeled form to image
           the biodistribution in vivo at baseline and during therapy may provide insight into the
           distribution of the therapeutic drug.

        -  The first step in the development of such an in vivo marker is to determine the

      biodistribution and safety of the radiolabeled form.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety of [F-18]-5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (FdCyd) administered
           intravenously with administration of tetrahydrouridine (THU).

        -  Estimate the radiation dosimetry of [F-18]-FdCyd in humans.

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Only patients enrolled in NCI Phase II Study evaluating FdCyd with THU (NCI Protocol #
           09-C-0214 (CTEP# 8351) or NCI Protocol #12-C-0066 (CTEP# 9127)) at the NIH Clinical
           Center will be eligible to participate in this study).

        -  Patients must have a target lesion greater than or equal to 10mm

        -  May not be pregnant or lactating; must be less than or equal to 350 lbs; and may not
           have known allergy to FdCyd or contraindications to PET/CT imaging.

      DESIGN:

        -  There are two arms to this study

        -  The first arm will be patients enrolling in the therapeutic Phase II 5-FdCyd/THU study
           (NCI Protocol # 09-C-0214 (CTEP# 8351) in the NCI Developmental Therapeutics Clinic

        -  The second arm will be patients enrolling in the Phase I 5-FdCyd/THU study (NCI Protocol
           #12-C-0066 (CTEP# 9127)) in the NCI Developmental Therapeutics Clinic.

        -  Patients will undergo an initial [F-18]-FdCyd + THU PET/CT imaging prior to therapeutic
           dosing on study NCI Protocol # 09-C-0214 (CTEP# 8351) or NCI Protocol #12-C-0066 (CTEP#
           9127). Repeat imaging will be performed while the patient is receiving FdCyd + THU
           therapy under the parent therapeutic protocol. This imaging must be completed 2-5 days
           after cycle start and at least 2 hours after a dose. Upon completion of repeat imaging,
           patients will be taken off this imaging study 24 hours after the last imaging session.

             with institutional, state and federal guidelines

          -  For females: Negative serum pregnancy test OR post-menopausal for at least 2 years OR
             patient has had a hysterectomy

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Participants with severe claustrophobia unresponsive to oral anxiolytics

          -  Subjects weighing &gt; 400 lbs (weight limit for scanner table), or unable to fit within
