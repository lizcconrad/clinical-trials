      Purpose: The investigators are proposing to examine the use of Savella® (Milnacipran) for
      treating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in women.

      Participants: Eligible participants will meet the Rome III diagnostic criteria for IBS.

      Procedures: This study will observe patients treated with Savella® as well as patients
      treated with a placebo (pill with no active drug). The investigators will monitor and compare
      several patient and symptom related outcomes, as well as evaluate health related quality of
      life, psychological distress and related psychosocial measures to determine if the addition
      of Savella® improves clinical pain response as well as secondary outcomes including quality
      of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized
      primarily by abdominal pain associated with bowel dysfunction. Like many other painful
      functional somatic syndromes (e.g. fibromyalgia) the pathophysiology of IBS includes abnormal
      responses to pain and dysregulation of brain-body pain pathways. IBS affects up to 10% of the
      population, is a leading reason for visits to gastroenterologists and primary care doctors,
      and, in the United States, annually accrues health care costs over $20 billion.

      In their practice the investigators use centrally acting agents to treat IBS. Historically,
      the investigators have used tricyclic antidepressants based on results of clinical trials,
      including our NIH funded trial on desipramine. Nonetheless, these agents can produce side
      effects that limit their full application. More recently the investigators have begun to use
      SNRIs because they have been shown to benefit for various pain syndromes like diabetic
      neuropathy, fibromyalgia. The initial impression is that Milnacipran helps improve IBS
      symptoms and global well being. There is now a need to systematically determine Milnacipran's
      value for IBS.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Pain Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Twelve Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores (range 0-100 mm; 0 = none, 100 = worst pain) were recorded for pain before the beginning of the study, at 6 weeks of treatment and at the end visit i.e. 10 weeks. Ideally, VAS would have been administered at the 12th week; however, subject was terminated at the 10th week visit. A positive pain response (ie pain relief) was defined as &gt;30% decrease in the VAS score between baseline and the final study visit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life ( IBS-QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Six Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>After six weeks of treatment with Milnacipran, treatment groups were compared with placebo for clinically significant improvement in IBS-QOL. 11 point reduction in IBS-QOL compared to baseline was considered as clinically significant improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Self Reported Adequate Relief of Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Twelve Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The study sought to determine if the Milnacipran arms had a greater proportion of adequate relief over the placebo group. Subjects were asked to answer 'yes' or 'no' as to whether or not they had adequate relief of pain due to irritable bowel syndrome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Efficacy Questionnaire (TEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Twelve Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment Efficacy Questionnaire is a measure of treatment effectiveness. The score ranges from 1 to 48, 1 is minimum score and 48 is the maximum score. The investigators was looking to see if the Milnacipran treatment groups have a higher proportion of subjects with significant improvement in efficacy, judged as a TEQ score of &gt;28, compared to placebo group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dose Related Incremental Benefit in Pain Reduction Based on VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator was looking to see if, for group A, when increased from 50 mg BID to 100 mg BID there is significant improvement of pain scores i.e. 30% pain reduction, and for group C, if there was significant improvement of pain scores when switched from placebo to 50 mg BID of Milnacipran</description>
