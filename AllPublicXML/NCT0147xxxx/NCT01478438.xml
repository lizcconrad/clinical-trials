  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the rate of complete tumor ablation of small breast cancers (≤
      20mm) by Novilase Interstitial Laser Therapy (ILT), and determine the sensitivity and
      specificity of imaging (MRI, mammography and ultrasound) in detecting residual tumor post ILT
      ablation as correlated to histopathology from the post-ablation excision.

An individual patient will be considered to have a complete ablation if the pathology results post excision demonstrates that no visible gross residual tumor is present.</description>

          -  Tumor is well visualized through x-ray mammography or ultrasound imaging and amenable
             to image guidance therapy (a tumor which is well visualized through imaging can be
             identified from surrounding breast tissue and does not have margins

          -  obscured by other structures or artifacts on the images)

          -  Tumor must be well visualized (as defined above) on MRI

          -  Subjects with benign lesions such as fibroadenoma, atypical ductal hyperplasia,
             sclerosing adenosis, Papilloma, fibrocystic disease of breast

          -  Subjects with DCIS with microinvasion

          -  Subjects with a cluster of microcalcifications whose diameter is larger than 10 mm.

          -  Subjects with extensive intraductal component and other characteristics not well
             visualized by imaging studies
