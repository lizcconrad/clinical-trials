  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to quantify the long-term effects of dutasteride on the
      architectural and nuclear features of benign prostate tissue, using state-of-the art digital
      image analysis techniques. The ultimate result will be a multivariable morphological
      &quot;signature&quot; that could provide a useful indicator of an individual's degree of drug response.

    <time_frame>Year 4</time_frame>
    <description>To characterize and quantify the effects of dutasteride on histological (architectural) features of benign prostate tissue via comparison of a random sample of Year 4 biopsy specimens from the dutasteride and placebo groups.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Morphometric features</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 4</time_frame>
    <description>To quantify the long-term (Year 4) effects of dutasteride on nuclear morphometric features (i.e., size, shape and texture) in benign prostatic epithelial cells.
To develop and validate a multivariable morphological score based on summarization of differences between drug- and placebo-treated tissues.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Independent changes in architecture and morphometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 4</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the degree to which drug-related changes at Year 4 in architectural and nuclear features are independent of (i.e., not explained by) changes in serum DHT, gland volume and PSA.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in cytomorphology</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 2 &amp; Year 4</time_frame>
    <description>To determine, by comparing Year 2 to Year 4 samples within individuals, whether drug-related cytomorphological changes are constant, declining or progressing.</description>
