  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Goal of VPM is the development of a recombinant urease C-deficient listeriolysin expressing
      BCG vaccine strain (VPM1002) as a safe, well tolerated and efficacious vaccine against
      tuberculosis (TB) for residents in endemic areas and persons at risk in non-endemic areas.
      The new vaccine should be at least as potent as the current strain and should be safer than
      BCG (Kaufmann, 2007a; Grode et al., 2005). The vaccine is formulated as live lyophilised
      bacteria to be re-suspended before intradermal injection. The preceding clinical trials in 80
      volunteers in Germany and 24 volunteers in Bloemfontein, South Africa indicated
      immunogenicity and safety being sufficient for proceeding with the clinical development in
      newborn infants. Hence, the current study is commenced at Stellenbosch University, South
      Africa. This is the first investigation of VPM1002 in newborn infants.
