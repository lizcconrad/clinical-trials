    <textblock>
      This is a study designed to evaluate the potential for the pradigastat (LCQ908) to impact
      cardiovascular risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study had 2 parts. Part A was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, non-confirmatory crossover study assessing response to a high-fat meal
      challenge in the setting of pradigastat versus placebo. Part A had 2 cohorts i.e. Cohort 1
      patients with stable coronary artery disease and hypertriglyceridemia and Cohort 2 patients
      with asymptomatic non-obstructive coronary artery disease or elevated coronary heart disease
      risk and hypertriglyceridemia.

      Part B was a double blinded phase designed to assess response to three months of chronic
      treatment with pradigastat versus placebo on a normal diet.

      The trial was terminated after the interim analysis of Part A, Cohort 1. The interim analysis
      results indicated that the high-fat meal challenge did not induce any impairment on either
      myocardial perfusion reserve index (MPRi) or exercise treadmill performance. Part B was never
      started.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Myocardial Perfusion Reserve Index (MPRi) Overall Mean (Part A, Cohort 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and on day 5 of each of the two treatment periods</time_frame>
    <description>MPRi (myocardial perfusion reserve index) is a measure of coronary microvascular function. Myocardial perfusion scans using 0.05 mmol/kg of gadolinium contrast were acquired at rest and under stress (pharmacological stress induced with adenosine 140 μg/kg/min for three minutes). An independent central reader performed the cardiac image analysis of all time points including the calculation of the myocardial perfusion reserve index from the ratio of the global stress myocardial blood flow divided by the resting blood flow values. Higher/increased index indicates improved flow/better outcome. This primary endpoint was only for Part A, Cohort 1 patients.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Exercise Duration (Part A, Cohort 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and on day 5 of each of the two treatment periods</time_frame>
    <description>Total exercise duration was the elapsed time between the start of exercise and termination of exercise for severe angina, dyspnea or extreme fatigue. This primary endpoint was only for Part A, Cohort 1 patients.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Onset of Angina (Part A, Cohort 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and on day 5 of each of the two treatment periods</time_frame>
    <description>Time to onset of angina was defined as the elapsed time between the start of exercise and the onset of anginal chest pain as reported by the patient and recorded by the performing investigator.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Onset of Exercise-induced Ischemia(Part A, Cohort 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and on day 5 of each of the two treatment periods</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise-induced ischemia was defined as the new development of horizontal or down-sloping ST-segment depression (≥ 1mm at 60 milliseconds after the J point) versus baseline tracings.</description>

    <description>For both each treatment period, postprandial triglycerides were measured on Day 5 i.e. on 0 hour(before breakfast), two hours and four hours post high-fat breakfast. Results are from an ANCOVA model on change from baseline in the log domain with log(baseline), treatment, sequence and period as fixed effects. Baseline is the Day -1 value within period. The data reported is ratio of geometric mean between post-treatment and baseline data.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Myocardial Perfusion Reserve Index (MPRi) Overall Mean (Part A, Cohort 1)</title>
        <description>MPRi (myocardial perfusion reserve index) is a measure of coronary microvascular function. Myocardial perfusion scans using 0.05 mmol/kg of gadolinium contrast were acquired at rest and under stress (pharmacological stress induced with adenosine 140 μg/kg/min for three minutes). An independent central reader performed the cardiac image analysis of all time points including the calculation of the myocardial perfusion reserve index from the ratio of the global stress myocardial blood flow divided by the resting blood flow values. Higher/increased index indicates improved flow/better outcome. This primary endpoint was only for Part A, Cohort 1 patients.</description>
