      This study has the following primary aim:

      - the main objective of this study is to investigate the effects of smoking cessation during
      quit attempts on sympathovagal balance. These effects will be observed in smokers quitting
      smoking with pharmacological support or without.

      Secondary aims of this study are also:

        -  the definition of MSNA in smokers and non-smokers

        -  the investigation of other parameters concerning the autonomic nervous system, like
           baroreflex-sensitivity, heart rate-variability before and during the quit attempt.

        -  the definition of withdrawal symptoms and craving before, during and after the quit
           attempt.

        -  the investigation of effects of smoking cues on craving and sympathovagal balance

        -  the investigation of relapse rates after smoking cessation in correlation with the
           parameters mentioned above.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of muscular sympathic nervous activity (MSNA) in bursts / 100 heart beats before and while smoking cessation.</measure>
    <time_frame>33 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients present 7 weeks before their personal smoking-stop-day and participate in the study until week 26 after their personal smoking-stop-day. During that time, MSNA is recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of the basal sympathetic nerve activity in smokers compared to never-smokers</measure>
    <time_frame>33 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>first MSNA is carried out 4 weeks before smoking-stop-day (respectively 6 weeks for group D). second and last MSNA is carried out two days after smoking-stop-day (respectively 2 weeks before smoking-stop-day for group D)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of craving and withdrawal symptoms during smoking cessation</measure>
    <time_frame>33 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>withdrawal symptoms data is collected by phone calls 3,2,1 days before smoking-stop-day, the day itself and 1 day and 11 (12 for group C and D) weeks after smoking-stop-day.
Also the withdrawal symptoms date is collected during each personal examination (means - Pre-Examination, Baseline, Follow I to III).
The data will be collected by reliable questionnaires</description>

    <description>smoking cues will be presented on the first follow-up-measurement to members of group A-D.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of smoking relapse rate</measure>
    <time_frame>33 weeks</time_frame>
