    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to create a test that will discriminate between malignant and
      benign ovarian mass that was diagnosed by ultrasound. The investigators will examine about
      800 women and at the end of the study the investigators will combine data from the woman's
      history, the sonographic characters of the mass and serum biological markers along with the
      woman's outcome (which means - whether the mass was malignant, benign, or disappeared or
      remained constant with no intervention).

      Patients that arrive to the sonographic unit of the gynecological department with a diagnosis
      of ovarian mass will have a sonographic examination that include: Trans-vaginal +-
      trans-abdominal ultrasound with Doppler and three dimensional sonographic exam. anamnestic
      data will be collected and serum test for CA 125, HE4 and CEA. The management of the specific
      patient will be according to the department protocol, regardless the study data. The
      investigators will collect data about operation outcome and histological results of women
      that will be operated. Women that won't be operated on will be followed up every 6 months by
      the study team.

      At the end of the study a statistical analysis will be made to create a sensitive and
      specific test for the prediction of malignancy in sonographic diagnosed ovarian mass.
