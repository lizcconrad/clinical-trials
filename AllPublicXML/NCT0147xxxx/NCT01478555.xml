             agents.

          5. Prior or anticipated concurrent use of an investigational product or device that could
             confound the findings about Dry Eye in the study eye.

          6. A condition or a situation, which in the investigator's opinion may put the subject at
             increased risk, confound study data, or interfere significantly with the subject's
             study participation

          7. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the study drug or procedural medications

          8. Participation in any other clinical trial within 30 days prior to screening
