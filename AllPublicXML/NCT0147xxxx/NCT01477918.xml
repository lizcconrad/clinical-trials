      The aim of this study is to examine the prevalence of the Metabolic syndrome(MetS) in Korean
      patients with schizophrenia.

      Primary objective:

      • To investigate the prevalence of the MetS in Korean patients with schizophrenia

      Secondary objectives:

      • To compare the prevalence of the MetS among 3 groups according to antipsychotics: typical
      antipsychotic monotherapy group, atypical antipsychotic monotherapy group, 2 or more
      antipsychotics group (polypharmacy)

    <description>MetS will be diagnosed according to NCEP ATP III with the Asian-Pacific abdominal obesity criterion (≥90 cm in men, ≥85 cm in women)
3 or more of the following criteria
fasting plasma glucose &gt;= 100 mg/dl or drug use to treat elevated glucose
serum triglyceride (TG) &gt;= 150 mg/dl or drug use to treat elevated TG
HDL cholesterol level &lt; 40mg /dl in males, &lt; 50 mg/dl in female or drug use to treat low HDL

        The study will include all patients that met the following criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of schizophrenia according to DSM-IV-TR

          2. Age between 18-65 years

        To obtain the representative results for the prevalence of the MetS in schizophrenic
        patients stratified age and gender, we plan to evaluate about one thousand patients in
        twenty nationwide centers.

          1. 20 centers were selected to provide the representative results of prevalence of the
             MetS

          2. 50 patients in each center were consecutively enrolled
