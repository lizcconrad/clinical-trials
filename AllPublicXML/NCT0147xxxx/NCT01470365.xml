    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of 3-dimensional conformal
      radiation therapy (CRT) or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in treating patients
      with recurrent tumors. Radiation therapy (RT) uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells.
      Palliative radiation therapy may help patients with recurrent tumors live more comfortably.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of reirradiation with the pulsed low dose
      rate technique.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the dosimetric tolerance of normal structures to reirradiation with the
      pulsed low dose rate technique.

      II. To determine the palliative efficacy and quality of life in patients treated on this
      protocol.

      III. To determine duration of response and time to progression.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo 3-dimensional CRT or IMRT once daily (QD), 5 days a week for 10-30 days.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every month for 6 months and
      then every 12 weeks thereafter.

    <time_frame>Up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the dose level closest to, but not over that which is predicted to result in a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) rate of 20%, the target toxicity rate. Graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. A DLT is a grade &gt;= 4 acute or grade &gt;= 3 late toxicity of an organ system within the reirradiation field in the following categories: skin or subcutaneous tissues, gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, nervous system, renal and urinary, reproductive system, vascular, or respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.</description>
