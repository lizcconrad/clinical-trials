  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be screened within 28 days before the first study treatment to confirm that
      they meet the requirements to participate in the trial. They will return to the site for two
      treatment visits, at least 12 hours each, and at least one day in between visits. At each
      visit treatment N1/3-I5 or Nicotine Inhaler 10 mg will be administered every hour for 11
      hours. The investigator (or an appropriate delegate at the investigator site) will obtain
      informed consent from each subject. Blood samples will be drawn on a special schedule. The
      total predicted amount of blood sampled from each subject is 174 mL over the whole study.
      Subjects will be required to follow specific smoking and dietary restrictions and rate their
      urges to smoke, general liking of the product, and how easy the product is to use.

      Blood for pharmacokinetic analyses will be drawn prior to the first administration and
      immediately before administration at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 hours. Thereafter
      samples will be drawn at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after the 11-hour
      administration. Easiness of use will be rated using an 8-grade ordered category scale at 10
      minutes after the start of administrations at 3, 6, and 9 hours. Overall liking will be rated
      using an 8-grade ordered category scale at 12 hours. Urges to smoke will be rated on a
      4-grade ordered category scale immediately before and at 15 minutes after the first
      administration, and as well as before and 15 minutes after the start of administrations at 3,
      6, and 9 hours, and at 12 hours. Used cartridges will be collected. Pooled samples per
      subject and treatment will be analyzed to determine the amount of remaining nicotine.
      Tolerability of the treatments will be evaluated in terms of reported and observed adverse
      events (AE).

      Since the primary objective is to compare steady-state nicotine pharmacokinetics of N1/3-I5
      with that of Nicotine Inhaler 10 mg, this study will have a multiple-dose setting. A
      crossover design has been chosen for this study in order to allow within-subject comparisons
      of treatments. Healthy habituated adults smoking at least 10 cigarettes daily for at least
      one year preceding inclusion will be included in the study, since they are expected to
      tolerate the doses of nicotine that will be administered.

* The dosing interval (τ) in this study will be one (1) hour. Consequently, Cav will have the same value as AUCτ (but with a different unit), since Cav is calculated as AUCτ divided by τ. Therefore Cav will not be displayed in results, only AUCτ.</description>

    <measure>Bioavailability [AUCτ]</measure>
    <time_frame>During last dosing interval 11-12 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>AUCτ is the area under the plasma concentration-vs.-time curve during the last dosing interval and is a measure of how much of the drug reaches the person's bloodstream. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is calculated by plotting the drug's blood levels on a graph at different times during the set period. The area under this curve is calculated as hour * nanograms (ng) per milliliter (mL).</description>
