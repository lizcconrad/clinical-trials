      A randomized versus placebo trial designed to evaluate the clinical and humoral effects of 4
      months of vildagliptin on healing of chronic ulcers in type 2 diabetes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The chronic foot ulcer is a leading cause of hospital admissions for people with diabetes in
      the developed world and is a major morbidity associated with diabetes, often leading to pain,
      suffering, and a poor quality of life for patients. Chronic diabetic foot ulcers are
      estimated to occur in 15% of all patients with diabetes and precede 84% of all
      diabetes-related lower-leg amputations.The pathophysiology of chronic diabetic ulcers is
      complex and still incompletely understood, the most important predisposing factors being
      diabetic neuropathy and vasculopathy. Both micro and macroangiopathy strongly contribute to
      development and delayed healing of diabetic wounds, through an impaired tissue feeding and
      response to ischemia. HIF-1α and VEGF, as well as the NO production from iNOS, may contribute
      to limitation of hypoxic injury by promoting angiogenesis and wound healing. Experimental and
      pathological studies suggest that suggest that he incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1
      (GLP-1) may improves VEGF generation, and promote pancreatic islet viability through the
      up-regulation of HIF1α.

      Therefore, aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of the augmentation of GLP-1, by
      inhibitors of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4), such as vildagliptin, on HIF-1α, VEGF and
      iNOS in diabetic chronic ulcers.

    <description>In the placebo group, the dose of other concomitant hypoglycemic medication was changed to obtain a similar profile of metabolic parameters. All patients had diabetes and at least one full-thickness wound below the ankle for &gt;3 months. All patients were examined weekly for the first 4 weeks (day 28) then every other week until day 120 or ulcer closure by any means. At each visit, tracings of the wound margins were made for computer planimetry to document changes in wound size, and photographs were taken for a visual record. All patients followed the regular treatment at the multidisciplinary diabetes foot clinic, included treatment of infection, debridement, off-loading, and metabolic control according to high international standards and standard good medical practice.</description>
