  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies transoral robotic surgery (TORS) in treating patients with
      benign or malignant tumors of the head and neck. TORS is a less invasive type of surgery for
      head and neck cancer and may have fewer side effects and improve recovery
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To conduct a pilot single-arm study to assess transoral robotic surgery (TORS) for oral and
      laryngopharyngeal benign and malignant lesions using the Da Vinci Robotic Surgical System.

    <description>Patients will undergo TORS for oral and laryngopharyngeal benign and malignant lesions using the Da Vinci Robotic Surgical System. After surgery regular clinical assessments will be scheduled to see how the patient is doing. Patients will be asked to answer a quality of life assessment as part of the study. If patients are unable to come to the Ohio State University Medical Center for a physician appointment they will be contacted via phone or mailed a questionnaire to complete.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must present with indications for diagnostic or therapeutic approaches for
             benign and/or malignant diseases of the oral cavity or laryngopharynx (including the
             neoplastic lesions of the tongue, tongue base, retromolar trigone, tonsils, palate,
             posterior and lateral pharynx, glottic, supraglottic and subglottic larynx)

          -  Patients must have adequate transoral exposure of the oral cavity and laryngopharynx
             for TORS instrumentation

          -  Written informed consent and/or Consent waiver by institutional review board (IRB)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unexplained fever and/or untreated, active infection

          -  Patient pregnancy

          -  Previous head and neck surgery that would preclude transoral/robotic procedures. This
             is at the investigator's discretion. This is not an exclusion criterion for the
             non-surgical arm.

          -  The presence of medical conditions contraindicating general anesthesia or transoral
             surgical approaches

          -  Inability to grant informed consent

          -  INTRAOPERATIVE EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Inability to adequately visualize anatomy to perform the diagnostic or therapeutic
             surgical approach transorally
