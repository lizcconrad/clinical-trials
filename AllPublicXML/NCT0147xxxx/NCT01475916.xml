  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood [1]. The advantage of an educational
      program in a global strategy of care has been established in asthma (decrease of nocturnal
      asthma, absence from work and school) [2, 3]. Therapeutic education of the patient permits
      the reduction of the rate of hospitalization, of the rate of emergencies visits and
      non-programmed visits. [3].

      The WHO defines quality of life as an individual's perception of its place in existence, in
      the context of culture and value system in which he lives, in relation to its objectives,
      expectations, standards and concerns [4]. The basic point of this concept is the notion of
      perception, emphasizing the perspective of the person. It is a broad concept affected in a
      complex way by the subject's physical health, psychological state, level of independence,
      social relationships, and its relations with its environment. In the field of health,
      analyzing the quality of life includes objective aspects (living conditions, functional
      health) and subjective aspects (satisfaction, happiness, well-being) that allow to understand
      the situation of people in whole.

      As defined by the WHO-Europe report published in 1996 [5], the therapeutic education aims to
      help patients acquire or maintain the competencies they need to best manage their lives with
      a chronic disease.

      It is entirely part of the management of the patient. It includes organized activities
      designed to make patients aware and informed of their disease, of care organization and
      hospital procedures, and the behaviors related to health and disease. This is to help them
      and their families understand their illness and treatment, to work together and to gain
      autonomy from their disease in order to help maintain and improve their quality of life [6].

      However, studies demonstrating the effectiveness of therapeutic patient education are still
      very few, especially in children. The need for prospective studies including the evaluation
      of the impact on quality of life was highlighted in a recent Cochrane meta-analysis [7]. It
      seems interesting for the authors to assess the improvement of the quality of life after
      educational sessions in children at school-age.
