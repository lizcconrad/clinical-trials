      Primary objective of this study was to assess the intrasession, intersession and
      interobserver variability of the Pentacam-derived posterior corneal elevation measurements in
      keratoconus eyes and eyes that underwent Corneal Collagen Cross-liknking (CxL) treatment due
      to progressive keratoconus.

      The Pentacam Classic (Oculus Optikgerate GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany, software version 1.14r04)
      was used for the sake of the study.Two study groups were formed: 1) Keratoconus group (KC)
      included patients with progressive keratoconus and 2) Collagen-Cross-linking group (CXL)
      included keratoconus patients that had been treated with uneventful CXL at least on year
      prior to their enrollment in the study.

      Three consecutive scans were obtained by two experienced operators. The same procedure was
      repeated within two weeks for the assessment of intersession variability. In all cases
      acceptable maps had at least 10.0mm of corneal coverage.All back elevation points were
      codified in order to facilitate statistical processing of data. Further to single point
      analysis, three additional parameters were evaluated: a) zone 4 parameter (z4) which derived
      by the analysis of all points at the central 4.0mm diameter zone, b) zone 8 parameter (z8)
      which derived by the analysis of all points at the central 8.0mm diameter zone, and, c)
      highest elevation point parameter (HEP), which derived by the analysis of the highest
      elevation points for all participants. Reproducibility of measurements was evaluated by means
      of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Three different ICC types were calculated: a)
      intrasession ICC for both operators (ICC1 &amp; ICC2), b) interobserver ICC, and, c) intersession
      ICC. Moreover, Bland-Altman plots were used to evaluate the level of agreement between the
      two operators.

    <description>The same surgical procedure was applied to all CXLG patients that included:
Instillation of proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5% drops for topical anaesthesia, application of a sponge saturated with 10% alcohol to the central cornea for 20-30 seconds and subsequent de-epithelialization by means of a hockey knife. Following de-epithelialization, a mixture of 0.1% riboflavin in 20% Dextran solution was instilled to the cornea for 30 minutes (2 drops every 2 minutes) prior to the irradiation. In details, an 8.0mm diameter of central cornea was irradiated for 30 minutes by UVA light with a wavelength of 370nm and an irradiance of 3mW/cm2.The UVA radiation source that was used is the UV-XTM (IROC AG, Zurich, Switzerland). Instillation of riboflavin drops (1 drop every 2 minutes) was continued during irradiation, as well.</description>
