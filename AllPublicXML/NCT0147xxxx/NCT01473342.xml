    <textblock>
      This study is focused on the development and pilot/feasibility testing of a smartphone
      application to promote a healthy diet, increase physical activity, and prevent weight gain in
      adolescent survivors of childhood cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While successful advancements in treatment for childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
      have resulted in a growing cohort of survivors, these survivors are at risk for a number of
      long-term health problems. This study proposes to develop and conduct feasibility testing for
      a smartphone application that would deliver a health behavior intervention to this
      population.

      A formative phase focused on intervention and software development will be followed by a
      pilot/feasibility test of the intervention. Participants in the intervention will receive a
      customized study-designed mobile phone app with a social networking component in which users
      will be able to support one another. They will also receive personal support from a health
      counselor to help set goals and discuss areas of concern.

    <description>The control phase will run for 8 weeks, including survey completion and accelerometer wear during Week 1 and Week 8. The intervention phase will run for the 9 weeks following the control phase; where participants are assigned a smartphone to interact with the Mila Blooms gaming app and integrated social network &amp; receive weekly supportive coaching phone calls from study staff for 8 weeks (Week 9 - Week 16) followed by accelerometer wear &amp; survey completion during the 9th and final week (Week 17).</description>

    <description>Behavioral intervention will be administered to 30 adolescent childhood cancer survivors &amp; their parents (3 blocks of 10 survivor-parent(s) groups) who serve as their own controls. The intervention phase begins at Week 9 (immediately following the 8-week control phase) and runs for 9 weeks (Weeks 9 - 17). Adolescents are assigned a smartphone installed with the Mila Blooms app to use for the first 8 weeks (Weeks 9 - 16) of the intervention. The app integrates (1) tools for tracking health behaviors (e.g., diet, physical activity, etc.); (2) an avatar system to provide virtual rewards, and (3) a social network of users for support. As part of the intervention, adolescents will also receive weekly coaching phone calls from study staff to discuss areas of concern and to encourage goal-setting &amp; participation. During the 9th week (Week 17), participants complete one final survey &amp; accelerometer wear.</description>
