  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Much of community transmission of seasonal and pandemic influenza occurs in younger
      individuals, because of their susceptibility and their social interaction
      patterns.Universities are places where transmission of influenza is facilitated because of
      the age of individuals involved, their close contact with each other, and low vaccination
      coverage. Staying home when you are sick (i.e., voluntary sequestration) has been identified
      as one of the most efficient ways to reduce influenza transmission, but there are still
      insufficient data on the effects of social distancing to be able to make recommendations for
      future pandemics or even outbreaks of seasonal influenza.

      The investigators are conducting a study on the effect of voluntary sequestration during
      illness on the transmission of influenza among social networks in University residence
      housing units at the University of Michigan. The sequestration interventions will be carried
      out during a period of influenza transmission that is defined by surveillance conducted at
      the University Health Service. Data will be collected on use of the interventions and the
      occurrence of influenza and other illnesses. In all selected residence halls, specimens will
      be collected when illness meeting a case definition for influenza-like illness occurs.

      This study in a university population will evaluate the acceptability and magnitude of effect
      that can be expected from such an intervention, and determine the number of days that
      sequestration should be practiced.
