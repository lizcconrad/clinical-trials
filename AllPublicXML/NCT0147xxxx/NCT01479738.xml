  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The capitate had a widened distal base. The distal articulation can be used for proximal
      interphalangeal (PIP) articula reconstruction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous anatomical studies have shown that the capitate had a widened distal base. The
      distal articulation was mainly with the base of the third metacarpal and partially with the
      base of the second metacarpal. The articulation was slightly flattened with a convex and
      concave dorsal articular surface. The contour stimulates our imagination and creativity to
      use a portion of the articular surface for PIP arthroplasty.

    <description>18 patients with PIP joint defects were included in the study. There were 13 male and 5 female patients with a mean age of 31 years (range, 18-47 years). The injury occurred in the right hand in 11 patients and on the left hand in 7. The injured PIP joints were in the index finger (n=7), long finger (n=9), and ring finger (n=2).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. an articular defect at the proximal aspect of the PIP joint;

          2. the defect larger than 5 mm × 5 mm in size based on intraoperative findings.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. large defects involved double joint surfaces;

          2. the size of the defect less than 5 mm × 5 mm;

          3. mult-digital articular defects that all required osteoarticular grafting;

          4. associate with infection or other diseases that restrict to use the technique.
