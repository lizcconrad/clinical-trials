  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical trial P1-SAF-301 is an open-label, single arm, monocentric, phase I/II clinical
      study evaluating the tolerance and the safety of intracerebral administration of
      adeno-associated viral vector serotype 10 carrying the human SGSH and SUMF1 cDNAs for the
      treatment of Sanfilippo type A syndrome The treatment plan consists on a direct injection of
      the investigational medicinal product SAF-301 to both sides of the brain through 6
      image-guided tracks, with 2 deposits per track, in a single neurosurgical session.

      The primary objective is to assess the tolerance and the safety associated to the proposed
      treatment through a one-year follow up.

      The secondary objective is to collect data to define exploratory tests that could become
      evaluation criteria for further clinical phase III efficacy studies.

      Four patients will be included in the clinical trial and will be followed during one year.

      The enrollment and the follow-up of the patients will take place at Bicêtre Hospital. The
      Neurosurgery will be performed at Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital.

      Safety will be evaluating on clinical, radiological and biological parameters.
