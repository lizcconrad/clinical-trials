      This randomized pilot trial studies omega-3 fatty acid in preventing joint symptoms in
      patients with stage I-III breast cancer receiving anastrozole, exemestane, or letrozole.
      Omega-3 fatty acid supplement may lessen or prevent joint stiffness or pain in patients
      receiving hormone therapy for breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of evaluating joint symptoms in postmenopausal women with breast
      cancer randomized to n-3 PUFA (omega-3 fatty acid) vs. placebo supplementation using the
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) and endocrine subscale (FACT-ES),
      Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and Stanford's Health Assessment -Disability Index (HAS) during
      the first 6 months of adjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy.

      II. To preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of n-3 PUFA vs. placebo supplementation on AI
      induced joint symptoms.

      III. To explore blood and imaging based biomarkers (plasma and red blood cell [RBC] levels of
      n-3 PUFAs, inflammatory cytokines and receptors, and intra-articular tenosynovial
      inflammation by musculoskeletal magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] imaging) of AI-induced joint
      symptoms in women on AI therapy randomized to n-3 PUFAs vs. placebo supplementation.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive omega-3 fatty acid orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

    <description>Pain scores based on FACT-B/ES, HAS and BPI will be plotted over time for each arm. Agreement between HAS, BPI-short and FACT-B/ES evaluated using Altman and Bland plot after proper data transformation. Also, Linear Mixed model used to explore if the pain scores are different at 3 and 6 months. Logistic regression models used to compare the occurrence of moderate to severe joint symptoms during the 6 month period between the two treatment groups, with potential covariates including age, body mass index, baseline pain scores (0 month), prior chemotherapy and other variables.</description>
