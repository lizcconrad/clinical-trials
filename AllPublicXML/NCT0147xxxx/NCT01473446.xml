      Is goal directed fluid therapy reducing postoperative complications in comparison to
      traditional fluid therapy for gastro surgical ASA III/IV patients?

      The investigators compare two groups of patients: one group receives goal directed fluid
      therapy guided by LiDCOrapid stroke volume variation (SVV), the other gets the &quot;traditional&quot;
      fluids, ie the current regime.

    <description>Standard monitoring. Initial optimization of fluid status is performed by pulse, BP and anaesthesiologist assessment with Ringer acetate. Followed by an infusion of 10ml/kg/t Ringer acetate. Urinary output and blood pressure is used as a surrogate parameter: the infusion rate is increased by a fall in blood pressure or urine output &lt;0.5ml/kg/t. Bleeding replaced with HES 1:1, otherwise see table for fluid therapy page 9. Vasoactive agents (noradrenaline / phenylephrine) is given if the anesthesiologist considers this necessary. Postoperative give 1000ml Glucose 5%. HES or Ringer when low blood pressure, eventually noradrenaline as vasoactive agent.</description>

    <description>Standard monitoring. The patient is connected to the LiDCOrapid monitor via an arterial line placed in a.radialis. A bolus of 500 ml Ringer acetate is given before anesthesia. If the stroke volume (SV) increases more than 10%, repeat the procedure until the SV is not increasing. After that, induction of anesthesia.
Maintenance fluid is given as Ringer acetate 2ml/kg/t. Continuous monitoring of stroke volume variation (SVV). If SVV&gt; 10%, give a fluid bolus 6ml/kg Ringer acetate. Repeat until SVV &lt;10%. Bleeding is being replaced 1:1 with hydroxyethyl starch. SAG by bleeding &gt;1000ml. By fall in blood pressure and SVV &lt;10%, start vasoactive treatment with epinephrine. Postoperative is given Glucose 5% 80ml/h.</description>
