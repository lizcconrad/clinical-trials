  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesia practice in the 21st century is increasingly outcomes-oriented and evidence-based,
      but there remain significant gaps in our knowledge, even for commonly-encountered clinical
      situations. Currently, the two most commonly used drugs used for maintenance of anesthesia in
      cardiac surgical patients are isoflurane and sevoflurane. There is a belief among many
      cardiac anesthesiologists that sevoflurane is a better cardiac anesthetic than isoflurane,
      but there is very little data to support this notion. In fact, very little is known about
      their comparative effects on important patient outcomes because there has not been a large
      head-to-head prospective randomized clinical trial. This project will supply the data
      necessary to critically compare the two anesthetics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current evidence supports the superiority of sevoflurane for myocardial protection during
      cardiac surgery when compared to total intravenous anesthesia with propofol. However, there
      is no evidence to suggest that sevoflurane is superior to isoflurane for myocardial
      protection during cardiac surgery. Sevoflurane may potentially reduce the rate of
      post-cardiac surgery atrial fibrillation and the time to tracheal extubation compared to
      isoflurane, but the literature is equivocal on these two important outcomes.
      Anesthesiologists still frequently use isoflurane for maintenance of cardiac anesthesia, and
      this is likely because there is substantial uncertainty about whether or not sevoflurane is
      superior to isoflurane, given the lack of head-to-head RCTs. A large, prospective, pragmatic
      RCT can ultimately assist clinicians by providing evidence of the non-inferiority (or,
      possibly the superiority) of one anesthetic compared to the other on important patient
      outcomes such as ICU length of stay, mortality, renal dysfunction, time to tracheal
      extubation after cardiac surgery, rates of clinically-important atrial fibrillation, and
      myocardial damage.

    <intervention_name>Volatile anesthetic</intervention_name>
    <description>The intervention in this trial is randomization to either maintenance of anesthesia with sevoflurane or maintenance of anesthesia with isoflurane. The designated volatile anesthetic will be given at a strict minimal amount throughout the entire cardiac surgery (including cardiopulmonary bypass). This regimen (administration throughout the entire operation) has proved to have the greatest efficacy. Apart from this intervention, the anesthetic for patients participating in this trial will not be substantially different from normal practice, as the intention is to allow normal practice (with the exception of the choice of volatile anesthetic agent) to maximize the applicability and external validity of the trial. The management of anticoagulation, cardiac surgical techniques, and other aspects of the procedure will be managed in an unaltered fashion.
No IV drug infusions will be permitted until after protamine administration.</description>
