  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving brentuximab vedotin together with combination
      chemotherapy works in treating older patients with previously untreated stage II-IV Hodgkin
      lymphoma (HL). Monoclonal antibody-drug conjugates, such as brentuximab vedotin, can block
      cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as doxorubicin hydrochloride, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (AVD), work in different ways to
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving brentuximab vedotin, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vinblastine, and dacarbazine
      together may kill more cancer cells.

      LEAD IN: Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      AVD CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients then receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, vinblastine IV, and
      dacarbazine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CONSOLIDATION: Patients achieving CR receive brentuximab vedotin IV over 30 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
