  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Development of a second neoplasm (SMN) during or after therapy for childhood acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a rare event generally associated with a poor prognosis. In
      this international study we analyze subtypes of SMN in relation to their initial leukemia
      characteristics and treatment, and their subsequent overall survival.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To explore epidemiology, potential risk factors and survival rates of second cancers
      occurring as the first event in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia the involved study
      groups will collect anonymous data on all such cases diagnosed within the last decades to
      form a common database with predefined variables comprising the clinical, biological, and
      cytogenetic characteristics (myeloid neoplasias only) as well as outcome. Furthermore, we
      will register the clinical, biological, and cytogenetic characteristics of the acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia as well as type of treatment given.
