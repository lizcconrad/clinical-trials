  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paper-based data collection for prospective clinical trials is associated with a poor quality
      of data collection. This typically involves missing or wrong data entry or a low recruitment
      rate, mainly due to the cumbersome and uncontrolled data collection.

      Electronic data collection is associated with improved quality of data entry in the cases of
      Electronic Patient Records (EPR) and patient handover among doctors during night and day
      shifts. However, a comprehensive direct comparison between web-based desktop personal
      computer (PC) and mobile (e.g. iPad) data collection has not yet been reported.

      The purpose of this prospective trial is to compare the users' experience with the web-based
      desktop PC and mobile data collection (iPad) tools.

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators designed a prospective randomized controlled trial where doctors from
      several randomly selected hospitals will use either a desktop PC or mobile (iPad) data
      collection tool. A validated user experience evaluation instrument will be used at the
      beginning, during interim analysis and at the end of the trial.

      The desktop-based data collection is built on Drupal, a renowned open source content
      management system (CMS). The same CMS will be used with a special interface designed for
      iOS/iPad. Both data collection platforms will be used in parallel to a prospective clinical
      trial.

    <description>The recruitment rate is defined as the proportion of patients recruited divided by the total number of patients recruited + patients missed: (rate=recruited/(recruited+missed).
The recruitment rates will be compared between the Desktop PC and Mobile (iPad) data collection tools.
PC: indicates Personal Computer</description>

    <measure>Cost-effectiveness analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is a form of economic analysis that compares the relative costs and outcomes (effects) of two or more courses of action. CEA assigns a monetary value to the measure of effect. Typically the CEA is expressed in terms of a ratio where the denominator is a gain from a measure and the numerator is the cost associated with this gain.
In this study, CEA will be calculated as: (ratio=costs/evaluation score) and (ratio=costs/recruitment rate).</description>

    <measure>Cost-benefit analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is a systematic process for calculating and comparing benefits and costs of a project for two purposes; in order to determine if it is a sound investment (justification/feasibility), and to see how it compares with alternate projects (ranking/priority assignment). It involves comparing the total expected cost of each option against the total expected benefits, to see whether the benefits outweigh the costs, and by how much. In CBA, benefits and costs are expressed in money terms, and are adjusted for the &quot;time value of money&quot;.</description>

    <description>Cost-utility analysis (CUA) is a form of financial analysis used to guide procurement decisions. The most common and well-known application of this analysis is in health technology assessment. Cost is measured in monetary units.</description>
