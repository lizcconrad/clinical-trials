      Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility and
      causes menstrual disruption in 6.6-6.8% of women in reproductive age and is characterized by
      insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hyperandrogenism and anovulation. The gaol of this

      Poly cystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder in women that affecting of

      serum glucose level in diabetic patients and anovulatory cyle in women with PCOS. The goal of
