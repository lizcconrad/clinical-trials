  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical patients are high risk for post operative infections. These post operative
      infections contribute to increased length of hospital stay, hospital costs and delay overall
      recovery time thus decreasing the quality of life. Studies have reported post operative
      complications ranging from 37% to 74%.1 The most costly complications include infectious
      complications after major Gastrointestinal (GI) surgery including wound infections, abdominal
      abscess, pneumonia, sepsis and anastomic leaks.2 Several studies have been conducted that
      show a significant reduction in infectious complications and average length of stay when
      treated with immunonutrition supplements.2-3 A review of similarly designed studies in a
      different patient population indicate that post-operative infections can be reduced by an
      average of 71% with immunonutrition.

      This study seeks to investigate the effect of Impact Advanced Recovery ® in improving
      surgical outcomes in patients receiving major gastrointestinal surgeries compared to a
      standard supplement at James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital. Providing Impact Advanced Recovery
      ® may decrease post-operative infectious complications, length of stay, and recovery time.

      Hypothesis

        1. In patients receiving elective gastrointestinal surgery (esophageal, gastric, pancreatic
           or colon resections) there will be a significant decrease of at least 60% in
           post-operative infections as listed below for patients who consume 15 servings of Impact
           Advanced Recovery® pre-operatively compared to patients who consume 15 servings of a
           standard supplement.

           Complications to be considered: anastomatic leak, post-op wound development, post-op
           abdominal abscess, sepsis, pneumonia, post-op ileus, intestinal fistula, obstruction,
           urinary tract infections, peritonitis or bowel necrosis.

        2. In patients receiving elective gastrointestinal surgery (esophageal, gastric, pancreatic
           or colon resections) there will be a significant decrease in hospital and NPO days for
           patients who consume 15 servings of Impact Advanced Recovery ® pre-operatively.
