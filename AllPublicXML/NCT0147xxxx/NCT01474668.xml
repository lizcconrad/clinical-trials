        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Within BMI range 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2, inclusive

          -  In good health, determined by no clinically significant findings from medical history,
             12-lead ECG, and vital signs

          -  Clinical laboratory evaluations within the reference range for the test laboratory

          -  Negative test for selected drugs of abuse at Screening and at Check-in

          -  Negative hepatitis panel (including hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], hepatitis C
             virus antibody [anti-HCV]) and negative HIV antibody screens

          -  Subjects will either be sterile or agree to use an approved form of contraception from
             Check-in until 45 days following Study Completion/ET

          -  Agree not to donate sperm from Screening throughout the study period and for at least
             3 months (90 days) after the last dose of study drug

          -  A minimum of 1 to 2 bowel movements per day

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant history or clinical manifestation of any significant metabolic, allergic,
             dermatological, hepatic, renal, hematological, pulmonary, cardiovascular,
             gastrointestinal, neurological, or psychiatric disorder

          -  History of significant hypersensitivity, intolerance, or allergy to any drug compound,
             food, or other substance

          -  History of stomach or intestinal surgery or resection that would potentially alter
             absorption and/or excretion of orally administered drugs (except that appendectomy and
             hernia repair will be allowed)

          -  History of Gilbert's Syndrome

          -  History of diabetes mellitus and/or elevated fasting glucose at baseline

          -  History of alcoholism or drug addiction within 1 year prior to Check-in

          -  Participation in more than one other radiolabeled investigational study drug trial
             within 12 months prior to Check-in. The previous radiolabeled study drug must have
             been received more than 6 months prior to Check-in for this study and the total
             exposure from this study and the previous study will be within the recommended levels
             considered safe

          -  Exposure to significant radiation within 12 months prior to Check-in

          -  Use of any tobacco-containing or nicotine-containing products within 6 months prior to
             Check-in or positive urine drug screen for cotinine

          -  Participation in any other investigational study drug trial in which receipt of an
             investigational study drug occurred within 5 half-lives or 30 days, whichever is
             longer, prior to Check-in

          -  Use of any prescription medications/products within 14 days prior to Check-in, unless
             deemed acceptable by the Investigator

          -  Use of any over-the-counter (OTC), non-prescription preparations (including vitamins,
             minerals, and phytotherapeutic/herbal/plant derived preparations) within 7 days prior
             to Check-in

          -  Use of alcohol-, grapefruit-, or caffeine-containing foods or beverages within 72
             hours prior to Check-in, unless deemed acceptable by the Investigator

          -  Poor peripheral venous access

          -  Donation of blood from 30 days prior to Screening or of plasma from 2 weeks prior to
             Screening

          -  Receipt of blood products within 2 months prior to Check-in

          -  Any acute or chronic condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would limit
             the subject's ability to complete and/or participate in this clinical study
