      The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a moderated physical exercise
      program called Blooming Exercise Program (BEP) developed during pregnancy in order to control
      excessive maternal weight gain and its consequences. Additionally, other objectives of the
      study were to analyse the influence of BEP on urinary incontinence, on the other pregnancy
      outcomes and on the perception of the pregnant's health

      BACKROUND: Pregnancy and delivery can condition significantly women's health. In particular,
      an excessive gain of weight during pregnancy constitutes a risk factor which may lead to (i)
      different alterations during pregnancy such as gestational diabetes or hypertension, (ii)
      foetus health problems (macrosomia), (iii) delivery complications (dystocia, prolonged labour
      and increased number of caesareans) and (iv) future health disorders for the woman
      (overweight, obesity and cardiovascular alterations). Furthermore, during pregnancy pelvic
      floor health problems, such as urinary incontinence (IU) may arise or worsen.

      OBJECTIVES: The main aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a moderate physical
      exercise program called Blooming Exercise Program (BEP) developed during pregnancy in order
      to control excessive maternal weight gain and its consequences. Additionally, other
      objectives of the study were to analyse the influence of BEP on urinary incontinence, on the
      other pregnancy outcomes (maternal and foetal) and on the perception of the pregnant's
      health.

      DESIGN: A randomized, controlled trial called has been conducted. 300 healthy pregnant women
      were recruited and divided into an intervention group (IG, n=100) and a control group (CG,
      n=200). The IG participated in BEP as from week 10-12 of gestation (at least 56 sessions
      through 22 weeks. 3 sessions per week). The CG did not participate in any supervised program
      addressed to pregnant women but received regular health care. Pregnancy outcomes regarding
      the mother and the new born, urinary incontinence and women's habits data were obtained and
      registered through initial interviews, medical records and two specific questionnaires on
      health and urinary incontinency (ICIQ-SF and King's).
