  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intestinal inflammation seen in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results from an altered
      mucosal immune response to luminal bacterial antigens. Current research suggests that an
      inappropriate and persistent immune response against commensal intestinal bacterial flora
      plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of chronic Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). It has
      been also proposed that the signs and symptoms of IBD may be mediated by the increased
      intestinal permeability secondary to low grade inflammation in the gut mucosa. Increased
      intestinal permeability results in further exposure of underlying intestinal mucosa to
      luminal bacteria and antigens perpetuating the intestinal inflammation. Thus restoring
      intestinal permeability rather than only reduction of mucosal inflammation would thus be a
      desirable endpoint in the restoration of mucosal integrity and would be the harbinger of
      better long term outcome. Many clinical trials have shown that probiotics may have beneficial
      effect on IBD patients. Probiotics are hypothesized to work by several mechanisms though they
      are not clearly established. The role of probiotics in improving intestinal permeability has
      not been evaluated. The probiotic VSL #3 is easily available, cheap, effective and safe
      alternative or substitute for the existing therapeutic agents will be evaluated in this study
      for their efficacy, tolerability, compliance in inducing clinical response in patients with
      Ulcerative colitis. This will be a double blind randomized placebo controlled study to
      determine the clinical efficacy of 12 weeks of oral probiotics (VSL#3) in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease. The objectives of this study are to determine the efficacy of
      probiotics on clinical endoscopic and histological improvement, to find the improvement in
      faecal, serum and intestinal tissue inflammatory markers, improvement in intestinal
      permeability, improvement in Quality of life parameters.
