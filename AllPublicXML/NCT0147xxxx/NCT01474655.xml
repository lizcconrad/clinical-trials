    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the changes in visual acuity, metamorphopsia, and
      thickness of retinal layers after epiretinal membrane removal and to investigate factors
      associated with visual function.

      Eyes with idiopathic Epiretinal Membrane Removal (ERM) scheduled to underwent ERM removal
      were included. Changes in visual acuity, metamorphopsia score (M-score) using M-chart, and
      parafoveal thickness of each retinal layer were evaluated preoperatively and at 2-month and
      6-month postoperative follow-up visits. Factors associated with visual acuity and M-score
      were investigated.

    <intervention_name>Pars plana vitrectomy and removal of epiretinal membrane</intervention_name>
    <description>A three-port standard pars plana vitrectomy was performed by a single surgeon using a 23-gauge vitrectomy system, either Associate®(Dutch Ophthalmic Research Center. Inc., Zuidland, The Netherlands) or Accurus®(Alcon Laboratories Inc., Fort Worth, USA), with one step scleral tunnel incision. Visualization of the fundus was achieved using a wide-angle viewing system. After core vitrectomy, induction of a posterior vitreous detachment was conducted using a 23-gauge angulated dissecting needle in cases without presence of a posterior vitreous detachment. The epiretinal membrane and internal limiting membrane was removed in all eyes. In most cases, internal limiting membrane was removed without the assistance of staining dye. Indocyanine green dye was used to facilitate the removal of internal limiting membrane in some of the cases.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who were diagnosed with idiopathic epiretinal membrane and were scheduled for
             epiretinal membrane removal

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  evidence of ocular inflammation, diabetic retinopathy, hypertensive retinopathy, and
             retinal vasculitis, media opacity that would influence visual acuity or preclude
             acquisition of clear spectral domain optical coherence tomography images,

          -  presence of cataract judged to affect visual function, -6.0 diopters or more of
             spherical equivalent, prominent staphyloma, history of intraocular surgery other than
             uncomplicated cataract surgery, history of retinal detachment, other ocular diseases
             that may influence the macular microstructure or visual function, immeasurable fovea
             location on the spectral domain optical coherence tomography image due to severe
             retinal contraction, and indistinct intraretinal structure on spectral domain optical
             coherence tomography images.

          -  patients who underwent combined epiretinal membrane removal and cataract extraction,
             less than six months follow-up after epiretinal membrane removal, who had occurrence
             or progression of cataract after the surgery judged to affect visual function, or who
             experienced recurrence of epiretinal membrane during the follow-up period
