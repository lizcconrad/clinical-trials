  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a blinded randomized controlled trial in patients undergoing laparoscopic colon
      surgery. The aim of this study is to assess whether spinal analgesia with a mixture of
      bupivacaine and morphine provides better pain relief than systemic morphine in a group of
      patients undergoing colonic resection and using the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)
      program.

      Twenty patients will receive spinal analgesia and twenty patients will receive only Patient
      Control Analgesia (PCA).
