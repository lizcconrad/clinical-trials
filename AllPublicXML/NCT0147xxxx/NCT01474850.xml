      The aim of this study is to examine chest wall volume changes monitored by opto-electronic
      plethysmography during recovery from anesthesia and early postoperative period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is prospective, randomized clinical trial in subjects undergoing elective surgery
      requiring general anesthesia.

      Opto-electronic plethysmography (OEP) has been developed as a non-invasive method for the
      analysis of chest wall motion, allowing highly accurate measurements of chest wall volume
      changes of different respiratory compartments in various conditions.

      The investigators set out to use this technology to study chest wall volume changes during
      recovery from total intravenous anesthesia (from discontinuing the anesthetic agent till
      extubation) and early postoperative period.

      The study protocol compares two different approaches:

        1. The group receiving recruitment maneuver (RM) immediately after intubation and positive
           end expiratory pressure (PEEP) 7 cm H20 until extubation. Inspiratory oxygen
           concentration 40% during recovery from anesthesia.

        2. The group not receiving RM, PEEP 0 cm H2O and inspiratory oxygen concentration 100%
           during recovery from anesthesia.

      The volume changes of the chest wall is monitored continuously by OEP, functional residual
      capacity (FRC) and arterial oxygenation are measured at the defined points in the protocol.
