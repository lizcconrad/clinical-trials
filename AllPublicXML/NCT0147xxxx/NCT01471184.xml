      The primary objective of this study is to assess the relative efficacy of Ectoin® Allergy Eye
      Drops and Ectoine® Allergy Nasal Spray compared to placebo, by evaluating Total Nasal Symptom
      Score (TNSS) and Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS).

      The secondary objectives are :

        -  To evaluate the relative efficacy of Ectoin® Allergy Eye Drops and Ectoin® Allergy Nasal
           Spray compared to placebo by evaluating Total Non Nasal Symptom Score (TNNSS),
           congestion symptom scores, red eye symptom scores, watery eye symptom scores, itchy eye
           symptom scores, and by evaluating the mean cross-sectional area (MCA) using acoustic
           rhinometry (AcR).

        -  To assess the change from baseline (post-EEC from pre-EEC) in inflammatory parameters of
           nasal secretions, comparing Ectoin® Allergy Eye Drops and Ectoin® Allergy Nasal Spray to
           placebo at each post-treatment visit.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have a clinical history of SAR with seasonal onset and offset of nasal
             and ocular allergy symptoms at least during each of the last two ragweed allergy
             seasons.

          2. Adults (males and females) aged 18 to 65, inclusive.

          3. Patients must have documentation of a positive skin test within 12 months of screening
             to ragweed or a positive skin prick and/or intradermal test for ragweed allergen at
             Visit 1. A positive response is defined as a wheal diameter of at least 3 mm larger
             than the negative control for the skin prick test or at least 7 mm larger than the
             negative control for the intradermal test.

          4. Non-pregnant, non-lactating women not of childbearing potential who are
             post-menopausal [defined as at least 6 months natural spontaneous amenorrhea], or are
             surgically sterile (hysterectomy; bilateral oophorectomy; bilateral tubal ligation
             with surgery at least 6 weeks prior to study initiation). Surgical sterility should be
             supported with clinical documentation.

             Females must have a confirmed absence of pregnancy according to a negative serum
             pregnancy test or urine pregnancy test at the times described in Section 11.

             Female subjects of child bearing potential must agree to use a reliable and highly
             effective method of birth control with a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year)
             when used consistently and correctly (e.g. implants, injectables, combined oral
             contraceptives, some IUDs, sexual abstinence or vasectomised partners) during the
             trial, as judged by the investigator. For subjects using a hormonal contraceptive
             method, information regarding the product under evaluation and its potential effect on
             the contraceptive should be addressed.

          5. In generally good health on the basis of medical history and physical examination.

          6. Willingness to attend all study visits.

          7. Capable of following and understanding instructions.

          8. Willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study
             procedures, including initiation of washout of any concomitant medications.

             be included).

          2. Current smoker and ex-smokers with more than 10 pack years smoking history. One pack
             year is defined as 20 cigarettes/day for 1 year. Smoking must have been stopped more
             than 6 months ago

          3. History of lower or upper airway infection in the last four weeks prior to screening.

          4. Clinically significant physical findings of nasal anatomical deformities causing
             greater than 50% obstruction based on the clinical estimate of the investigator,
             including nasal polyps, septal defects or other clinically significant respiratory
             tract malformations, nasal piercing, recent nasal biopsy, nasal trauma, or surgery and
             atrophic rhinitis or rhinitis medicamentosa within 60 days prior to the Screening
             Visit.

          5. Pregnancy or breastfeeding, or plans to become pregnant or donate gametes (ova or
             sperm) for in vitro fertilization during the study period, or for 30 days following
             the study period.

          6. Currently participating in a clinical trial or has been exposed to an investigational
             treatment within the 30 days prior to the Screening Visit.

          7. A known or suspected hypersensitivity, and/or contraindication to any of the
             ingredients of the investigational products.

          8. History of alcohol or drug abuse, as judged by the investigator, within the two years
             prior to the Screening Visit.

          9. Use of any of the prohibited medications within the identified exclusion periods (see
             Section 3.2.4)

         10. Any acute or chronic disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would affect
             the study objectives or subject safety (e.g., Diabetes mellitus type I, malignant
             neoplasia, chronic renal failure, inflammatory diseases of liver or kidneys,
             emphysema, bronchiectasis).

         11. Any clinically significant (as determined by the investigator) psychiatric and/or
             psychological disorders, including impairment of cooperation (e.g. alcohol or drug
             abuse).

         12. Patients not able to follow study procedures (e.g. language problems, psychological
             disorders).

         13. Suspected non-compliance to study protocol. Non-compliance is e.g. application of less
             than 60% (according to post treatment container's weight) or missing more than one
