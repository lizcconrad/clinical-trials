  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to check the efficiency of practicing the tools of the
      Grinberg method (GM) in reducing Low-back Pain (LBP), reducing limitations in movement as a
      result of the pain, and improving the general quality of life.

      The hypothesis suggests that by learning to perceive pain differently, the level of pain will
      reduce and general well-being improved.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research will include 140 patients, who attended the pain clinic due to chronic LBP. Any
      change in the pharmacological regimen will be done with consult of the tending doctor and the
      change will be reported.

      Tools and Methods A patient, whom volunteers to take part in the research, will be invited to
      the Ichilov Pain clinic in order to fill-in questionnaires and sign an informed consent form.

      Each participant in the experiment group will participate in a series of 6 sessions lasting 1
      hour each, extending between 6 to 8 consecutive weeks, with one of the qualified GM
      practitioners partaking in the experiment. Each participant will have all their sessions with
      the same GM practitioner throughout the experiment. Immediately after the last session, the
      participants will fill-in the same questionnaires given at the beginning of the experiment.
      The non-GM intervention group will answer the questionnaires after 6-8 weeks of
      pharmacological treatment only.

      Questionnaires:

        -  General Details and Pain Questionnaire

        -  SF-MPQ Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, Ronald Melzack

        -  RMDQ - Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire

    <description>The GM is a methodology of attention that teaches through expanding and focusing body attention to create a change and an improvement in pain and in quality of life. The method focuses on the way in which we experience pain, and offers an approach that trains people to use their attention and will in order to turn an unwanted experience that causes suffering, into a controlled experience in which they can take responsibility on the way they react to an existing pain. The method uses attention in order to learn the fixed ways in which we respond to pain in our body: where we focus our attention, what is the level of tension in our muscles, how we breathe and relax and more. It gives simple and effective tools to control all these, in order to create optimal conditions in the body to utilize its natural potential to recover and recuperate</description>
