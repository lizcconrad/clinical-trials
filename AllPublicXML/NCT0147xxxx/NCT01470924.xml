    <textblock>
      A minority of patients with adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) relapse are rescued. The
      aim of this population-based study was to assess the results of reinduction treatment and
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in second complete remission (CR) in Sweden
      2003-2007.

      This is a national, multicenter, prospective, population-based study of outcome among adult
      patients aged 19 to 65 years with ALL relapse diagnosed during 2003-2007 in Sweden. Most of
      the patients had primary treatment according to National guidelines for ALL as recommended by
      The Swedish Adult ALL Group (SVALL). The guidelines suggest two different treatment protocols
      for early relapses, and retreatment according to the initial therapy for late relapses, with
      the intention to proceed to allogeneic SCT in CR2 for eligible patients. The aim of the
      current study was to assess outcome among adult patients after first ALL relapse, and the
      utilization and efficacy of recommended protocols and of allogeneic SCT in this setting.
