  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of PCI-32765, both as a
      single agent and in combination with dexamethasone, in subjects with relapsed or relapsed and
      refractory Multiple Myeloma (MM)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is an enzyme that is present in hematopoietic cells other than
      T cells and is necessary for downstream signal transduction from various hematopoietic
      receptors including the B cell receptor as well as some Fc, chemokine, and adhesion
      receptors, and is crucial for both B cell development and osteoclastogenesis. Although
      down-regulated in normal plasma cells, Btk is highly expressed in the malignant cells from
      many myeloma patients and some cell lines. PCI 32765 is a potent and specific inhibitor of
      Btk currently in Phase 2 clinical trials. The current study is designed and intended to
      determine the effects of PCI-32765 in subjects with MM.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of symptomatic MM with measurable disease, defined here as having at least
             one of the following:

               1. Serum monoclonal protein (M-protein) ≥0.5 g/dL as determined by serum protein
                  electrophoresis (SPEP)

               2. Urine M-protein ≥200 mg/24 hrs

               3. Serum free light chain (FLC) assay: involved FLC level ≥10 mg/dL (≥100 mg/L)
                  provided serum FLC ratio is abnormal

          -  Relapsed or relapsed and refractory MM after receiving at least 2 but no more than 5
             previous lines of therapy, 1 of which must be an immunomodulator.

             nonresponsive in subjects who have never achieved a minor response (MR) or better with
             any therapy.
