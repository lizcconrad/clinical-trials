  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose for this study is to answer the following research questions:

        -  Can pemetrexed be administered safely at the participant's home, using the same
           treatment procedure as in a hospital setting?

        -  Will the participant be satisfied with home care?

        -  How might this impact the participant's quality of life?

        -  What are the required medical resources needed to give pemetrexed in a home setting?

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Adhered to Treatment Administration at Home</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1, Day 1 through Cycle 19, Day 1 and Cycle 19, Day 1 (21 days/cycle)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were considered adherent from the time of the first dose in Cycle 1 (hospital administration) until either the last day of the cycle when the participant reverted to pemetrexed hospital administration or the last day of the cycle when the participant discontinued study treatment or the study for reasons related to the home setting. The percentage of participants who adhered to treatment administration at home was estimated by a Kaplan-Meier survival analyses approach. Participants who died or discontinued the study and treatment without reverting to hospital administration were censored at the time of discontinuation.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the European Quality of Life Instrument (EQ-5D) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 4 (21 days/cycle) and 30 days post treatment discontinuation</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D scale was used to provide an estimate of the health state utility in this population. The EQ-5D scale includes a 5-dimensional descriptive system that measures each of the health state attributes: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression according to a 3-point scale (no problem, some problems, and major problems) and a VAS that allows participants to rate their present health condition from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). The change from baseline in EQ-5D VAS is reported.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D scale was used to provide an estimate of the health state utility in this population. The EQ-5D scale includes a 5-dimensional descriptive system that measures each of the health state attributes: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression according to a 3-point scale (no problem, some problems, and major problems) and a VAS that allows participants to rate their present health condition from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). The change from baseline EQ-5D Index score is reported and the EQ-5D Index score was calculated by converting health state scores into a weighted health state index according to a United Kingdom population-based algorithm. The possible values for the EQ-5D Index score range from −0.59 (severe problems in all 5 dimensions) to 1.0 (no problem in any dimension), on a scale where 1 represents the best possible health state.</description>

    <measure>Maximum Improvement Over Baseline in Individual Lung Cancer Symptoms Scale (LCSS) Item Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 of each cycle (up to Cycle 19, 21 days/cycle), and 30 days post treatment discontinuation</time_frame>
    <description>LCSS is a 9-item questionnaire; 6 items are symptom-specific measures for lung cancer (loss of appetite, fatigue, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and pain), and 3 summation items describe overall symptomatic distress, interference with activity level, and overall quality of life during the past 24 hours. Participant responses were measured using a VAS with 100-millimeter (mm) lines. Scores ranged from 0 mm (no symptoms and no impact on activities, quality of life) to 100 mm (symptoms as bad as they could be, impacting activities and quality of life).</description>

Stage III (cancer had spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes) was further differentiated based on regional lymph nodes: Stage IIIA (spread to nearby lymph nodes) and Stage IIIB (spread to distance lymph nodes). The participant with Stage IIIA disease was enrolled in study because investigator considered participant not eligible for curative treatment.</description>

          <title>Best Response to Prior Systemic Therapy</title>
          <description>Best response to prior systemic therapy was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST, version (v) 1.1] criteria. PR was having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; PD was having at least 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and minimum 5 mm increase above nadir; SD was small changes that did not meet above criteria. Participant with PD (borderline tumor increase) was considered a protocol violation.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D scale was used to provide an estimate of the health state utility in this population. The EQ-5D scale includes a 5-dimensional descriptive system that measures each of the health state attributes: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression according to a 3-point scale (no problem, some problems, and major problems) and a VAS that allows participants to rate their present health condition from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). The change from baseline in EQ-5D VAS is reported.</description>

The EQ-5D scale includes a 5-dimensional descriptive system that measures each of the health state attributes: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression according to a 3-point scale (no problem, some problems, and major problems) and a VAS that allows participants to rate their present health condition from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). The change from baseline EQ-5D Index score is reported and the EQ-5D Index score was calculated by converting health state scores into a weighted health state index according to a United Kingdom population-based algorithm. The possible values for the EQ-5D Index score range from −0.59 (severe problems in all 5 dimensions) to 1.0 (no problem in any dimension), on a scale where 1 represents the best possible health state.</description>

        <description>LCSS is a 9-item questionnaire; 6 items are symptom-specific measures for lung cancer (loss of appetite, fatigue, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and pain), and 3 summation items describe overall symptomatic distress, interference with activity level, and overall quality of life during the past 24 hours. Participant responses were measured using a VAS with 100-millimeter (mm) lines. Scores ranged from 0 mm (no symptoms and no impact on activities, quality of life) to 100 mm (symptoms as bad as they could be, impacting activities and quality of life).</description>

        <description>The time from the date of the first dose of study treatment (Cycle 1, Day 1) to the date of death from any cause, PD (clinical and objective), or discontinuation of pemetrexed due to toxicity. Response was defined using RECIST, v1.1 criteria. PD was defined as having at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions and at a minimum 5 mm increase above nadir. TTF was censored at the date of the last visit for participants who did not discontinue pemetrexed, who were still alive, and who had not progressed.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is more than 60 days but less than or equal to 180 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>A thorough literature search revealed that no specific validated questionnaire was available to assess participant and physician satisfaction with home care or resource utilization, therefore specific questions were created by the sponsor for use.</limitations_and_caveats>
