  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rates and causes of maternal mortality in Mexico have dropped only slightly; thus, reaching
      the internationally established Millennium Development Milestones (MDM) is still a distant
      goal. A fundamental part of reducing maternal and infant mortality is ensuring an adequate
      and timely response to obstetric emergencies. PRONTO2: Obstetric and Neonatal Emergency
      Training Program is an innovative training strategy based on simulations designed to train
      hospital personnel to respond to obstetric emergencies. The objective of this study is to
      implement PRONTO2 in selected hospitals to measure the effectiveness of the intervention in
      influencing key behaviors in hospital practices, as well as measuring maternal and neonatal
      outcomes in intervention versus control hospitals.

    <description>PRONTO is an intervention consisting of two training modules for medical professionals. Module 1 is delivered over 2-3 days, takes place in the hospital, and consists of high-fidelity, low-tech simulations. The curriculum employs elements of the Team STEPPS program to strengthen teamwork and leadership skills, and the use of effective communication techniques. The activities and simulations have clear objectives and use evidenced-based medical concepts. Module 2, the follow-up training, uses the same teaching methodology as Module 1 to reinforce teamwork, communication, and emergency response skills, and incorporates new topics such as preeclampsia /eclampsia, shoulder dystocia and pelvic presentation.</description>
