    <textblock>
      The CATCH-enoxaparin trial is the natural continuation of the CATCH study. It will capitalize
      on the fact that patients enrolled in the CATCH study will be specifically screened for
      asymptomatic thromboembolism (TEs) in order to answer important clinical questions.

      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to address whether, among pediatric
      patients with congenital heart defects (CHD) recovering from cardiovascular surgery and
      diagnosed with an asymptomatic venous TE, the use of enoxaparin results in a net therapeutic
      benefit?

      Primary Aim: To address whether, among pediatric patients with congenital heart defects (CHD)
      recovering from cardiovascular surgery and diagnosed with an asymptomatic venous TE, the use
      of enoxaparin results in a net therapeutic benefit. We hypothesize that enoxaparin dosed as
      per age-appropriate algorithms is associated with an increased rate of clot resolution and
      decreased rate of clot progression/long-term complications in children with CHD and
      asymptomatic venous TE. Benefits from clot resolution will outweigh the risks associated with
      the use of enoxaparin resulting in a net therapeutic benefit in favour of enoxaparin use in
      this context.

      Secondary aims of this study are to:

        1. To compare the rate of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic TE and/or
           thromboembolic events between treated and untreated patients. Hypothesis: the use of
           enoxaparin will significantly reduce the rate of conversion from asymptomatic to
           symptomatic TE.

        2. To compare the rate of objective clot progression (or regression) by serial imaging with
           ultrasound and echocardiography between treated and untreated patients. Hypothesis: the
           use of enoxaparin will significantly increase the rate of clot regression.

        3. To identify factors associated with: TE conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic,
           clot resolution and post-thrombotic syndrome in both treated and untreated patients
           separately. Hypothesis: older children with a more mature coagulation system and those
           with TEs in superficial vessels (rather than deep/systemic vessels) will have a lower
           frequency of TE complications.

        4. To establish the rate of bleeding complications (both minor and major) for patients on
           enoxaparin. Hypothesis: we expect major bleeding complications to be present in 2-3% of
           treated patients and minor bleeding complications to be frequent.

          3. Enrollment in the Heart Centre Biobank Registry

          4. Enrollment in the CATCH main study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clots associated with any of the following symptoms: swelling, edema, discoloration or
             high temperature of the affected territory.

          2. Clots in a vascular segment/location (arterial clots, intracardiac clots) or with a
             degree of vessel occlusion which obligatory warrants treatment

          3. Prosthetic heart valve

          4. Active or previous cancer history

          5. Known congenital coagulopathy or thrombophilic disorder

          6. Liver failure (AST, ALT or % bilirubin 2x normal)

          7. Need for anticoagulation for treatment or prophylaxis for other reasons (e.g. BT
             shunt, recent thrombosis requiring anticoagulation)

          8. Previous documented residual clot within the same vascular territory affected by
             current asymptomatic clot

          9. Increased bleeding risk reflected by severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count
             &lt;30,000/ml) and/or coagulopathy (INR &gt;4.0 or aPTT &gt;120s)

         10. Active bleeding or major bleeding &lt;10 days ago (not surgery related)

         11. Previous neurosurgery &lt;14 days ago

         12. Uncontrolled severe hypertension (&gt;95th percentile for age)

         13. Previous proven diagnosis of heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia (HIT) &lt;100 days ago

         14. Absolute contraindication to heparin/LMWH (e.g. severe heparin allergy)

         15. Pregnancy or breastfeeding

         16. No planned follow-up at The Hospital for Sick Children

        While most patients will be identified as part of the CATCH study during the pre-discharge
        full-body vascular ultrasound, some patients who are not enrolled in CATCH will also be
        identified if an asymptomatic clot is identified during a clinically indicated radiological
        study. For those patients who are not already enrolled in the CATCH study and the Heart
        Centre Biobank Registry, they will be approached and consent will be obtained for those
        studies prior to enrolment in the CATCH-enoxaparin study.
