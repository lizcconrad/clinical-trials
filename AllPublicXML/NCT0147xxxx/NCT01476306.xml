      The investigators will conduct a two-arm, parallel group, randomized comparative
      effectiveness study across two sites to increase specialty access and improve care for
      individuals with Parkinsonism and their caregivers. Twenty individuals with Parkinsonism will
      be recruited from Johns Hopkins University and the University of Rochester (approximately ten
      from each site). They will then be randomized to either continue their usual in-person care
      with a specialist or to receive care with their specialist via telemedicine in their home.
      Following an in-person baseline/screening visit, approximately ten individuals in the first
      arm (virtual house calls) will receive three visits with a movement disorder specialist via
      telemedicine (using web-based video conferencing) in their home. Approximately ten
      individuals in the second (control) arm will receive three in-person visits at an academic
      medical center with the same specialists. Approximately two weeks after the completion of
      each clinical visit, a nurse or coordinator will call the patient to call to address any
      questions or ensure appropriate understanding of the recommendation (for both telemedicine
      and control arms). Overall, the study - consistent with a national priority for comparative
      effectiveness research - will compare the use of telemedicine to manage Parkinsonism to usual
      care.

      1. Abstract

           The research's overall objective is to improve care for individuals with Parkinsonism.
           Parkinsonism is clinically determined as the presence of at least 2 of the following: 1)
           rest tremor, 2) bradykinesia, 3) cogwheel rigidity, or 4) difficulty with gait or
           balance. The most common cause of Parkinsonism is Parkinson disease. Parkinson disease
           is a chronic condition whose burden is growing both in the United States and globally.
           However, access to specialty care is limited chiefly to urban areas and is frequently
           inefficient. One way to remove geographic barriers to care is through the use of
           web-based video conferencing (telemedicine).

           To evaluate the study's aims, the investigators will conduct a seven-month randomized
           controlled study of twenty patients with Parkinsonism across two sites to contrast the
           comparative effectiveness of standard in-person specialty visits versus those conducted
           via web-based video conferencing (telemedicine). It is hypothesized that these &quot;virtual
           house calls&quot; will be feasible, clinically non-inferior to usual care, and economically
           valuable. This research will expand the geographic scope of specialty care and provide a
           national model for providing home-based, patient-centered, cost-effective care to those
           with Parkinsonism anywhere they live.

        2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives)

      The specific objectives of the study are as follows:

      Aim 1: To evaluate the feasibility of providing specialty care to individuals with
      Parkinsonism via web-based video conferencing (telemedicine) in their homes by calculating
      the proportion of specialty visits completed as scheduled.

      Hypothesis 1: Individuals receiving care via telemedicine in their homes will complete at
      least 80% of their visits as scheduled.

      Aim 2: To explore the clinical benefits, as measured by the change from baseline in quality
      of life as measured by the Parkinson Disease Questionnaire 39 (PDQ-39).

      Hypothesis 2: In this pilot study, the change in quality of life will be comparable between
      the two groups.

      Aim 3: To explore the economic benefit of providing specialty care via telemedicine in the
      home.

      Hypothesis 3: For patients and caregivers, travel and labor savings from receiving care in
      the home will outweigh technology costs for telemedicine visits.
