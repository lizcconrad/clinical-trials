      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence of subcutaneous (SC)
      Epoetin Hospira compared to SC Epogen (Amgen), based on maintenance of hemoglobin (Hb) levels
      and study drug dose requirements in patients treated for anemia associated with chronic renal
      failure and on hemodialysis.
