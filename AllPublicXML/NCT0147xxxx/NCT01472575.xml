      This project aims to assess the impact of rotavirus vaccine introduction on severe
      gastroenteritis in South Australian children. Prevalence of rotavirus coded hospitalisations
      and all-cause gastroenteritis hospitalisations will be compared for a two year period prior
      to introduction of the vaccine and a two year period following introduction of the vaccine.
      Severity of rotavirus coded admissions during the periods will also be assessed.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Introduction of the rotavirus vaccine will result in an 80% reduction in
           hospitalisations for rotavirus positive gastroenteritis (ICD code A0.80) in children
           less than two years of age.

        2. Introduction of rotavirus vaccine will result in an 80% reduction in Paediatric
           Emergency presentations for rotavirus positive gastroenteritis in children under two
           years of age.

        3. Introduction of the rotavirus vaccine will result in a 50% reduction in hospitalisations
           for all cause gastroenteritis (ICD codes A0.00-A0.90) in children less than two years of
           age.

        4. Introduction of the rotavirus vaccine will result in a 50% reduction in Paediatric
           Emergency presentations for all cause gastroenteritis in children less than two years of
           age.

        5. Introduction of rotavirus vaccine will result in a reduction in hospitalisation and
           Paediatric Emergency presentations in children aged four and five years with rotavirus
           positive gastroenteritis (unvaccinated cohort).

        6. There will be no difference in severity of disease as scored by the Vesikari and/or
           clark severity score prior to and post introduction of rotavirus vaccine

      This project aims to assess vaccine effectiveness in the field following introduction of the
      rotavirus vaccine in South Australian children. It is important to confirm the benefits of
      the vaccine post licensure to ensure the best health care options for children. Between July
      2007 - June 2008 at the Women's and Children's Hospital, there were approximately 2000
      gastroenteritis patient samples analysed, with approximately 200 of these confirmed as
      rotavirus positive (10%). The current vaccines available in Australia (Rotarix® and RotaTeq®
      ) are licensed for administration in infants up to six months of age as safety data is not
      yet available for older children. It is therefore important to determine whether vaccination
      according to the current Australian Standard Vaccination Schedule can also demonstrate a
      positive change (less disease and less severe disease) in the burden of rotavirus disease in
      older unvaccinated children.
