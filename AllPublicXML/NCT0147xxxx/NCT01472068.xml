  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot clinical study taking place at one site in Berlin, Germany using
      Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) to stimulate the pelvic floor muscles of 20 women
      suffering from stress urinary incontinence. This involves a 12 week, 30 minute, 5 days out of
      7 set treatment program with the device. After the 12 week treatment programme the subjects
      will be asked to perform daily set exercises for a further 14 weeks.

             program.

          -  Subjects who have been clinically diagnosed with stress urinary incontinence and

             hour post-bladder filling protocol (1-hour pad weight test). Stress urinary
             incontinence is defined as complaint of involuntary leakage on effort or exertion, or

          -  Subjects who have scored at least 18 out of 27 for the Stress Incontinence Questions
             and are confirmed as having predominant stress urinary incontinence on the Medical,
             Epidemiologic and Social Aspects of Aging Urinary Incontinence (MESA) Questionnaire
             completed at the screening assessment.

          -  Subjects with a Body Mass Index of &lt; 30 kg/m2

          -  Subjects who are able to give voluntary, written informed consent to participate in

             members of a hierarchy in case of refusal to participate. Examples are members of a

             students, subordinate hospital and laboratory personnel, employees of the
             pharmaceutical and medical device industry, members of the armed forces, and persons
             kept in detention. Other vulnerable subjects include patients with incurable diseases,
             persons in nursing homes, unemployed or impoverished persons, patients in emergency
