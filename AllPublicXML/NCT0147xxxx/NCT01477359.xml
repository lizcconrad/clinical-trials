  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent data has shown that sarcoidosis, presenting initially with cardiac manifestations (CS)
      of either conduction system disease or cardiomyopathy and sustained VT, is not uncommon. A
      Canadian physician survey found that most physicians do not investigate for CS as a
      possibility in these situations. Thus many patients with clinically important CS are going
      un-diagnosed. A study from Finland showed that missing the diagnosis of CS in these patients'
      leads to significant mortality and morbidity.

      There are no published clinical consensus guidelines on treatment of CS. Corticosteroid
      therapy is advocated by most experts. This is based on very modest data from small
      retrospective observational studies using variable definitions of clinical response. The
      effect of corticosteroid treatment on the clinical course of CS has not been studied in
      prospective studies and will be one of the aims of this project. Recent physician surveys
      regarding CS, in Canada and the US, found that current clinical practice varies widely. The
      2008 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm society
      guidelines recommend implantation of a defibrillator (Class IIa recommendation) to prevent
      sudden cardiac death. The most recent Canadian device therapy guidelines do not mention CS.

      A multi-center collaborative approach to study CS is greatly needed.&quot; The investigators
      propose exactly that i.e. a multi-center prospective cohort to start to answer clinical
      questions. The investigators have formed the CANADIAN CARDIAC SARCOIDOSIS RESEARCH GROUP. The
      group includes respirologists with an interest in sarcoidosis, cardiac electrophysiologists,
      cardiac imaging specialists with extensive experience in imaging of sarcoidosis and
      biostatisticians. The research will be in two phases; a registry of current diagnostic
      approaches, treatment and prognosis, and a randomized clinical trial of the effect of
      corticosteroid treatment on the clinical course of cardiac sarcoidosis.

      Baseline assessment of Clinically Manifest CS patients consists of: history, echocardiogram,
      ECG, chest CT scan, FDG-PET scan, blood for biomarkers within 2 months of the PET scan,
      cardiac MRI and possibly a signal average ECG and biopsy (encouraged-either endomyocardial or
      extra-cardiac).

      Follow-up and clinical management of clinically manifest patients diagnosed with CS will
      occur at 3-6 months with a repeat FDG-PET scan and blood biomarkers. Follow-up will then be
      annually with an echo and ECG. Treatment with steroids/immunosuppressants and device therapy
      will be at the discretion of the treating physician.

      Baseline assessment of patients diagnosed with extra-cardiac sarcoidosis and being screened
      for CS consists of: history, echocardiogram, ECG, holter, chest CT scan, biopsy, and cardiac
      MRI (CMR). If the CMR is suggestive of CS the patient will be have a FDG-PET scan done and be
      followed as a Clinically Silent patient. They will be contacted every 2 years. If the CMR is
      negative the patient will be followed as a extra-cardiac sarcoidosis patient with no evidence
      of CS and be in the control group. They will be contacted at 5 years and at the time of study
      completion.

      All patients will be followed until the last patient recruited has been followed for 4 years.

      The occurrence of the primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed in treated and
      untreated patients.

      There will be 2 imaging core labs. The PET core lab will be located at UOHI under the
      direction of Dr. Robert Beanlands. The CMR core lab will be under the direction of Dr.
      Mathias Friedrich (McGill University). All scans will be read in the core labs by physicians
      who are blinded to the clinical details of the patients.

      The Biomarker core lab will be at The University of Ottawa Heart Institute under the
      leadership of Dr P Liu.
