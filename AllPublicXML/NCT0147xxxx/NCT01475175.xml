  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AdOPT Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) study is an acute, prospective,
      multi-center, non-randomized investigational study designed to compare indices of cardiac
      function at device settings optimized using the investigational Adaptive CRT (aCRT) algorithm
      versus nominal programming. The comparison will be performed during rest, atrial pacing and
      sub-maximal exercise. AdOPT CRT is a sub study of the Adaptive CRT Study (NTC00980057) being
      conducted in Europe.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adaptive CRT is an implantable heart failure device feature that attempts to optimize CRT
      without echocardiographic testing.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Decision was made to stop the study based on a pre-planned interim analysis that the sample
    size would unlikely be sufficient to satisfy the primary objective.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Volume at Rest</measure>
    <time_frame>Test day visit (within 14 days of enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in stroke volume (SV) between BiV pacing with aCRT settings and BiV pacing with nominal settings at rest. Biventricular pacing is a type of pacing that paces both the right and left ventricles of the heart. Stroke volume is the volume of blood pumped from a ventricle in one heart beat.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Volume During Atrial Pacing.</measure>
    <time_frame>Test day visit (within 14 days of enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in SV between BiV pacing with aCRT settings and BiV pacing with nominal settings during atrial pacing. Atrial pacing occurs at 20 beats-per-minute (bpm) above the subject's resting heart rate.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Volume During Sub-maximal Exercise.</measure>
    <time_frame>Test day visit (within 14 days of enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in SV between BiV pacing with aCRT settings and BiV pacing with nominal settings during sub-maximal exercise. Sub-maximal exercise is exercise performed at a level below maximum effort. The subject will perform sub-maximal exercise to achieve target heart rate close to 75% of the age-predicted maximal heart rate.</description>

    <time_frame>Test day visit (within 14 days of enrollment)</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Electrical Conduction at Rest.</measure>
    <time_frame>Test day visit (within 14 days of enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Electrical conduction will be evaluated at rest by measuring the subject's intrinsic atrio-ventricular (AV) interval. The AV interval is the amount time between the start of atrial contraction and the start of ventricular contraction.</description>

        <description>Difference in stroke volume (SV) between BiV pacing with aCRT settings and BiV pacing with nominal settings at rest. Biventricular pacing is a type of pacing that paces both the right and left ventricles of the heart. Stroke volume is the volume of blood pumped from a ventricle in one heart beat.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>In most cases, contracts allow investigators to publish study results per the protocol and publication plan following Medtronic's review to determine whether confidential information (CI) is disclosed. Any such CI is deleted prior to publication/presentation. Medtronic may not censor/interfere with the publication except as described. Investigators may not publish any single-site publications until the main multi-site study publication has occurred.</restrictive_agreement>
