  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to find out if it is possible to enroll minority women with breast
      cancer in a study of how chemotherapy may affect their ability to answer certain questions
      and perform certain tasks that measure brain activity. The investigators want to look at
      thinking and brain activity in patients to see if cancer treatments can cause any brain
      changes. For this study, women without cancer, are being asked to participate in order to
      compare the answers to the questions and the brain wave activity measured in the women with
      cancer to women who don't have cancer.

    <description>Participants will complete a medical/psychiatric history questionnaire, and a standardized battery of neuropsychological (NP) tests and psychological instruments. EEG recording will be made as participants engage in tasks of basic perceptual or pre-attentive processes and selective attention. Following chemotherapy (and a matched interval for the no-chemotherapy and healthy control groups), the standardized battery of NP tests, psychological instruments, and EEG will be repeated.</description>
