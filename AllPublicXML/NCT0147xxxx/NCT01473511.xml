  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Strongest Families (formerly Family Help)is an evidence-based, distance health education
      model for families who have children with behavioural difficulties. The principal research
      question is &quot;Does Strongest Families, a 12-week, home-based program of interactive readings,
      instructional videos, homework projects, and weekly &quot;coaching&quot; telephone calls out perform
      the care families typically experience when referred to a mental health service?&quot;. The
      investigators hypothesize that children randomized to Strongest Families intervention will
      show a significantly greater reduction in externalizing behaviour problems than those
      randomized to a Control (usual care). In addition, parents randomized to Family Help will
      report a greater improvement in parenting skills and a greater reduction in symptoms of
      emotional distress (i.e., feeling of anxiety, depression, and stress) than parents in the
      Control condition. Finally, families randomized to Family Help will use fewer mental health
      services than Controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our project is designed to help families and children with mild or moderate symptoms early,
      before problems become worse and more difficult to treat.

      The Strongest Families Program is a distance parenting program that was developed at the
      Centre for Research in Family Health at the IWK Health Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Most
      families are able to manage these problems if they are given the skills to do so. The
      Strongest Families &quot;Parenting the Active Child&quot; Distance Program is done over the telephone;
      families do not have to travel to a centre to receive help. This program includes a handbook,
      videos and weekly phone calls between the parent and non-professional'coach'. The coach
      provides support to families, answer questions and guide parents as they learn the skills.
      Strongest Families has helped hundreds of families in Nova Scotia.
