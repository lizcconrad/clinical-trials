      The overall goal of the present study is to provide evidence of concordant test results using
      the Identigene STD Test Collection Kit for self-collection and transport of specimens to a
      qualified testing laboratory. It is expected that this method will aid in detection of CT and
      NG and that offering a method of self-collection of a male urine or female vaginal swab
      specimen will encourage testing for CT and NG and improve the overall detection of reporting
      of these STDs by allowing persons who suspect they have the infection to be tested in a
      discrete and confidential manner. The reporting of CT and NG are underestimated and many
      subjects will not visit a clinic or obtain treatment if gone undetected. Thus, allowing a
      self-collection kit that is more convenient may result in improved reporting, identification
      of CT and NG positive individuals, and subsequent treatment to help prevent the spread of
      these diseases.

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the Identigene STD Test Collection Kit and
      labeled instructions for use instructions provide test results that are concordant (at least
      95% or better) with test results obtained using the Gen-Probe APTIMA Combo 2 specimen
      collection and transport methods performed under the supervision of a healthcare provider.
      The laboratory technology and test method used for the IDTG-100.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study involving asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects who are at risk
      or suspect possible exposure to CT and/or NG. Approximately five (5) clinics will participate
      in the study. The clinics selected will be located in diverse geographical regions in order
      to represent populations with both high and low incidences of CT and NG and to represent
      different extremes in climate. The initial phase of the study enrolled approximately 500
      qualifying subjects. An interim analysis was performed to determine whether changes in the
      study protocol were necessary. Changes to the protocol were identified and are incorporated
      in this amendment (amendment 4) of the study protocol. Specifically, males in the study will
      still collect urine specimens whereas women will now self-collect a vaginal swab specimen.
      Study subjects will only undergo one clinic visit rather than two as indicated in prior
      versions of the study protocol. The proposed study phases outlined in this amendment of the
      study protocol will include at least 200 qualifying subjects with intermittent suspension of
      the study to allow data analysis. The present study will continue until 200 CT positive test
      results (approximately 100 male and 100 female) are obtained. Of these 200 positive results,
      approximately 50% will be from symptomatic subjects and 50% from asymptomatic subjects. Since
      the positivity rate is presumably lower for asymptomatic subjects, the ration of symptomatic
      to asymptomatic subject enrollment for each study phase will be determined by the sponsor and
      will be made known in writing to each study site.

      It is expected that approximately 3,000 subjects will be required to meet the overall study
      objectives. It is anticipated that the total number of subjects enrolled for testing
      throughout the study will yield approximately 30 positive NG samples (approximately 15 males
      and 15 females) with no requirement for a specific ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic
      subjects. Subjects who are at high risk of exposure or suspect exposure to CT or NG, but are
      not currently being treated, will be recruited for enrollment.

    <description>The Identigene STD Test Collection Kit is an at-home kit that allows individuals to utilize the Gen-Probe technology to test for CT and NG in privacy and in a more convenient manner. The primary technology is the approved Gen-Probe APTIMA Combo 2 assay, which is repackaged into the Identigene kit for use by consumers. As such, the laboratory technology and testing method is identical to that of the Gen-Probe APTIMA Combo 2 assay, which has been cleared for in vitro diagnostic use.</description>
