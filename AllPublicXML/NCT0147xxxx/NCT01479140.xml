  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite a relatively high prevalence of non-atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (NACAD)
      among young women, the majority of these abnormalities were misdiagnosed in this population,
      and thus treatments were not targeted adequately in this patient population. Furthermore, the
      short and long-term cardiovascular outcomes of young women with NACAD have not been
      evaluated. Given the importance of NACAD in young women, the challenges of diagnosis and
      subsequent treatment, and unknown outcomes with NACAD, we propose a prospective registry to
      further evaluate this population. We propose to evaluate young women (age &lt; or equal to 55)
      presenting with myocardial infarction (MI) prospectively, to diagnose the etiology of MI
      differentiating atherosclerotic versus NACAD, to correlate the prevalence of FMD in other
      vascular territory, and to evaluate the long-term outcome of young women with NACAD in
      comparison to those with atherosclerotic CAD over a 5-year follow-up.

      All women aged 55 or younger having a coronary angiogram for acute coronary syndrome (ACS)
      will be approached prior to their procedure. A pregnancy test will be performed (standard for
      pre-menopausal women due to potential radiation exposure). If the cause of the heart attack
      is uncertain (eg no obvious infarct-related narrowing or occlusion), intravascular ultrasound
      or optimal coherence tomography will be performed within the context of the angiogram to
      better view the artery wall. A picture of the iliac and renal arteries will be accomplished
      by aortography (one dye shot down the aorta); in the case that the renal arteries are not
      well visualized, selective renal angiography will be performed (catheter at the entry to the
      renal artery). In the case of suspected non-atherosclerotic abnormalities, a head CT
      angiogram wil be performed. Referral to appropriate specialists for detected abnormality will
      occur. If symptoms continue, the subject will be followed by a cardiologist. A research
      coordinator will contact the subject at 1, 6 and 12 months and then annually to collect data
      on medications, hospitalization and symptoms.
