  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study to investigate methodological aspects that may affect glycemic index
      (GI) and insulinemic (II) values. In addition, we will measure GI and II values for typical
      Finnish carbohydrate-rich foods and provide a database of GIs for Finnish foods.

      The specific aims of this study are:

        -  to compare glycemic responses and GIs analyzed from capillary and venous blood to
           compare glucose against white bread as the reference food, and to study the effect of
           number of reference tests on GI values. For each setting of the tested parameters, we
           determined the glycemic indices of rye bread, oatmeal porridge and instant mashed potato

        -  to examine the glycaemic and insulinaemic responses of a mashed potato-based meal when a
           high fat food (rapeseed oil) or a high protein food (chicken breast) or fat, protein and
           salad together were added to the meal. Furthermore, we studied how the predicted and
           measured GI values of the mixed meal differed from each other.

        -  to examine the effects of two different coffee portions with glucose and
           caffeine-containing soft drinks on postprandial glucose and insulin responses. Further
           objectives were to study how coffee and different accompaniments affect glucose and
           insulin responses.

        -  to measure GI values for typical Finnish foods

        -  to study the effects of berries on glycemic and insulinemic responses

        -  to examine the effects of overweight and glucose tolerance on the glucose, insulin and
           lipid responses to an HGI meal and an LGI meal.Furthermore, the second aim was to study
           the effect of BMI and glucose tolerance on the GI measured.

        -  to compare methodological choices in insulin measurement

        -  to investigate the effect of alcohol on postprandial glucose and insulin responses, and
           to determine glycemic and insulinemic indices values for beer and non-alcoholic beer
