             electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests

          3. Subjects must be willing to use additional non-hormonal contraception

          4. Subjects must have used a combined oral contraceptive, combined contraceptive vaginal
             ring or combined contraceptive patch

          5. Vital signs which are within the following ranges: systolic blood pressure between
             90-140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure between 50-90 mmHg, pulse rate between 40 - 100
             bpm

          6. Subjects must have a body weight of minimally 50.0 kg with a BMI between 18.0 and 29.9
             kg/m2

          7. Able to provide written informed consent prior to study participation.

          8. Able to communicate well with the investigator and to understand and comply with the
