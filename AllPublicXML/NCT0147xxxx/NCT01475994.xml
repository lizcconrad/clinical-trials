  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a mono-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to
      assess the effect of challenges with dactylis glomerata pollen in an environmental challenge
      chamber on dermal symptoms in patients suffering from atopic dermatitis.

      After each challenge session and on Day 3, Day 4, and Day 5 blood samples will be taken for
      biomarker assessments. The severity of atopic dermatitis will be rated with the &quot;SCORing
      Atopic Dermatitis&quot; (SCORAD), with the objective SCORAD and with the assessment of itch and
      sleeplessness referring to the past 24 hours by a blinded observer (trained dermatologist) on
      each day including baseline assessments.

             last pollen challenge -, implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, hormonal
             IUDs or double-barrier methods, i.e. any double combination of IUD, condom with
