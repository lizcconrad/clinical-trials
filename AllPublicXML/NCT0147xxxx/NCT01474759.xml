  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this research is to determine the efficacy of two portion-control
      strategies to achieve sustainable dietary and behavior changes and to promote weight loss and
      maintenance. A randomized controlled trial will test two approaches to managing portion
      sizes: one that gives individuals skills and tools to help them make appropriate portion
      choices, and another that focuses on consumption of pre-portioned foods in order to limit
      exposure to large portions in the personal food environment. A third group will receive a
      basic nutritional program to promote weight loss.

      The second aim of the research is to determine the effects of the programs on knowledge and
      consumption of appropriate portions, as assessed by innovative assessment methods and
      multiple-pass dietary recalls. The third aim is to conduct exploratory analyses of individual
      factors that may influence the response to the portion-control interventions, such as
      psychosocial indicators, blood biomarkers, and measures of adherence to the interventions.
      The expected outcome of the project is that it will lead to the development of specific,
      evidence-based strategies to help control portion sizes in order to manage weight.
