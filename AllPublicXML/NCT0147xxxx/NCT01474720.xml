  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, lupus) appear to be at increased risk for
      the development of shingles, a painful reactivation of the varicella zoster virus that causes
      chicken pox.

      The investigators propose to study the immune response to commercially available Zostavax
      vaccine (shingles vaccine) in adult patients with SLE who have minimal disease activity and
      are on mild immunosuppressant medications, and to compare the immune response to that seen in
      healthy people following vaccination. Acceptable immunosuppressive drugs permitted in the
      study are those felt to be safe according to Centers for Disease Control guidelines.

      Ten healthy people and 10 SLE patients (all over 50 years of age) will be recruited to
      receive a single, standard dose of Zostavax. Blood samples and physical examination will be
      performed prior to injection, then 2,6,and 12 weeks following vaccination. All participants
      will receive active vaccine, there is no placebo group.
