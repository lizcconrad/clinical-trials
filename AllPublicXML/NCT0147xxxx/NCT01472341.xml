      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the degree of beta-cell dysfunction among
      participants with type 2 diabetes and the association between beta-cell dysfunction and

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Homeostatic Model Assessment Fasting Beta Cell Function (HOMA % B) at 4 Years</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>HOMA is a method used to quantify insulin resistance (a condition in which natural hormone insulin becomes less effective in lowering blood sugars) and beta-cell (specialized cells in the pancreas producing insulin) function. HOMA uses fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations to estimate steady state pancreatic beta cell function (%B) as a percentage of a normal reference population (normal young adults). The normal reference population was set at 100%. HOMA%B was defined as 20 x fasting insulin (mU/L)/fasting glucose (mmol/L) - 3.5.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Homeostatic Model Assessment Fasting Beta Cell Function (HOMA % B) at 4 Years</title>
        <description>HOMA is a method used to quantify insulin resistance (a condition in which natural hormone insulin becomes less effective in lowering blood sugars) and beta-cell (specialized cells in the pancreas producing insulin) function. HOMA uses fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations to estimate steady state pancreatic beta cell function (%B) as a percentage of a normal reference population (normal young adults). The normal reference population was set at 100%. HOMA%B was defined as 20 x fasting insulin (mU/L)/fasting glucose (mmol/L) - 3.5.</description>

        <title>Homeostatic Model Assessment Fasting Beta Cell Function (HOMA % B) According to Quartiles of Proinsulin/Insulin (PI/I) Ratio</title>
        <description>HOMA is a method used to quantify insulin resistance (a condition in which natural hormone insulin becomes less effective in lowering blood sugars) and beta-cell (specialized cells in the pancreas producing insulin) function. HOMA uses fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations to estimate steady state pancreatic beta cell function (%B) as a percentage of a normal reference population (normal young adults). The normal reference population was set at 100%. HOMA%B was defined as 20 x fasting insulin (mU/L)/fasting glucose (mmol/L) - 3.5. Beta-cell dysfunction was evaluated by calculating the PI/I ratio, which estimates the capacity of beta cells to convert proinsulin to insulin and may represent an acceptable method to indicate the degree of beta-cell secretion.</description>
