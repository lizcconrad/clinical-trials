      -  To delineate brain mechanisms that subserve endogenous analgesic (EA) in the healthy
           state.

        -  To identify alterations in mechanisms supporting EA in chronic pain (migraine) and their
           therapeutic relevance.

      The proposed research will use psychophysics and multiparametric MRI to (i) delineate the
      brain mechanisms that subserve and regulate endogenous analgesia (EA)in the healthy state and
      (ii) to identify alterations in mechanisms supporting EA in chronic pain and their
      therapeutic relevance. In both healthy subjects and chronic pain patients, EA will be probed
      using the DNIC (diffuse noxious inhibitory controls) and offset analgesia paradigms.
      Functional MRI will examine activation of brainstem mechanisms important in EA, while both
      functional and structural connectivity analyses will assess the regulation of these brainstem
      mechanisms by cerebral cortical regions involved in attention and affect. One pathological
      painful condition, migraine, will be examined since it allows changes in EA associated with
      chronic pain to be investigated between episodes of pain. Finally, EA and EA associated
      structural and functional parameters will be used to predict the efficacy of one compound,
      amitriptyline, to treat migraine in individual patients. Taken together, the proposed
      research will provide substantial insights into basic mechanisms supporting and regulating EA
      and can provide a foundation for mechanism-based individualized choice of therapy that may
      benefit all chronic pain patients.
