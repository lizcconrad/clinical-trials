  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This double-blind study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of morphine or
      gabapentin derived from gabapentin enacarbil (GEn) after administration of morphine and GEn
      alone and in combination as well as the tolerability of morphine administered with GEn. The
      dose of GEn will be 600 mg administered with food. Morphine/morphine placebo will be
      administered 2 hours prior to GEn/GEn placebo in the fasted state. A 60 mg dose of a
      controlled release formulation of morphine will be given. Blood samples for evaluation of
      gabapentin, morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide will be collected. The pharmacodynamic effect
      of co-administering both treatments will be assessed using visual analog scales for
      somnolence/sedation, dizziness and nausea.

             the investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures

             informed consent

             product within the following time period before the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the

          -  Subject has a creatine kinase value greater than the ULN that is not explainable by
             recent strenuous exercise and the value does not return to within reference range upon
