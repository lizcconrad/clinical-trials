  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this feasibility study is to determine whether it is possible to
      conduct a study of the ClearView scan among patients under evaluation for acute
      cardiovascular events, as well as give insight into the performance of the ClearView scoring
      algorithm with respect to this patient population. The EPICâ„¢ scan is a bio-electrographic
      tool that may assist the health care provider in rapid assessment of the systemic origin of
      the patient's presenting symptom(s). The EPIC ClearView is a potentially valuable resource
      that may benefit an emergency department (ED) by offering expedited &quot;chest pain&quot; etiologic
      differentiation capabilities. The subsequent results have the potential to include more rapid
      &quot;chest pain&quot; patient diagnosis and appropriate disposition of non-cardiac chest pain (rule
      out MI); optimized precious resource expenditure (nursing, physician, inpatient or
      observation bed, etc.); lower costs to facility, patient and insurance company; and greater
      patient satisfaction rates due to decreased ED wait time.
