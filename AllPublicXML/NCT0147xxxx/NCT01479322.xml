  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder characterized by childhood-onset
      obesity and endocrine dysfunction that leads to cardiovascular disability and early death
      within the first 3 decades of life.

      Objectives: To assess the significance of risk factors for future disabilities, carotid
      artery intima-media thickness (IMT) was measured and correlated with known atherosclerotic
      risk factors in 27 children with PWS and 24 age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)-adjusted
      controls.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Main outcome measures: Correlation of IMT with age, standard deviation score of BMI
      (BMI-SDS), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
      (LDL), C-reactive protein, HOMA-IR and ghrelin.
