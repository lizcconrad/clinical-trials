  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators previously investigated the cardioprotective effect of an
      adenosine-lidocaine cardioplegia with moderate-potassium (K+, 10.0 mmol/L) in pediatric
      cardiac surgery, which was associated with better myocardial protective effects when compared
      with conventional high-potassium cardioplegia. However, this cardioplegia could not be sucked
      back into the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit because of excessive hemodilution and
      severe systemic hypotension induced by adenosine. Therefore, the investigators supposed that
      a moderate-potassium (K+, 10.0 mmol/L) blood cardioplegia without adenosine could also arrest
      the heart and have better myocardial protective effects compared with conventional
      hyperkalamic cold blood cardioplegia during cardiac operations without excessive hemodilution
      and systemic hypotension.
