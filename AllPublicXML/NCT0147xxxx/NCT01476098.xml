    <description>AUC(0-4) is a measure of the average amount of study drug in the blood plasma over a period of 4 hours after the dose and AUC(0-t) is a measure average amount of study drug in the blood plasma over a period of last time of quantifiable concentration. Both the parameters were calculated by standard non-compartmental analysis. Blood samples for PK analysis were obtained at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10 hours post-dose.</description>

    <description>Cmax is defined as the maximum or &quot;peak&quot; concentration of a drug observed after its administration.

    <measure>Changes in the Cough Quality of Life Questionnaire (CQLQ) following a single dose of SB-705498 compared to placebo- Part B</measure>
    <time_frame>Day -1 and 14</time_frame>
    <description>It is a validated, 28-item assessment tool designed to evaluate decrements in quality of life due to chronic cough. This questionnaire measures cough-related symptoms, as well as the social implications and psychological impact. Examples of items include, &quot;I cannot sleep at night&quot; and &quot;I cough and it makes me retch.&quot; The final score is obtained by summing the responses to 28 questions, each scored on a 1-4 scale, where 1 is &quot;strongly disagree,&quot; and 4 is &quot;strongly agree.&quot; The minimum and maximum CQLQ scores are 28 and 112 respectively, with increasing score indicating more severe impairment.</description>
