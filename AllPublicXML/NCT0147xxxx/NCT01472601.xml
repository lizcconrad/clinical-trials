      This study is a parallel translational study of a Randomized Phase III trial Investigating
      the Role of Oxaliplatin duration (6 Cycles Versus 12 Cycles) in modified FOLFOX-6 Regimen as
      Adjuvant Therapy for Patients with Stage II/III Colon Cancer (MIDAS trial: protocol
      NCCCTS-467) . Patients participating in the trial will be provided with the informed consent
      of this parallel study, and peripheral blood and tumor tissue of those who signed the consent
      will be collected for germline polymorphism analysis and gene expression profile study .
