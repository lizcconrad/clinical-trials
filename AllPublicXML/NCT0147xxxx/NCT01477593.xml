    <textblock>
      Circumcision, a removal of the foreskin, is performed commonly at any age in male worldwide.
      Globally over 25% of men are circumcised. In the Middle East, circumcision is even performed
      routinely in every male newborn. The benefits from it vastly outweigh the risks. Gradually,
      more and more Chinese male are willing to undergo it with themselves and their sons. But
      there are also some complications with circumcision, such as pain, edema, infection, and
      hemorrhage. Considering of that, physicians continually manage to improve their surgical
      methods and analgesic techniques.

      In the study of Peng, a disposable minimally invasive circumcision anastomosis device named
      Shenghuan (China Wuhu Snnda Medical Treatment Application Technology Co. Ltd.) (ShD) was
      introduced to be applied in circumcision. And they concluded that method was quicker, safer
      and less pain than the conventional techniques of incision. In present study, we carry out a
      randomized controlled trail, using a different method as Peng introduced with this device in
      children's circumcision (Yan's), compared with the method as Peng used and the conventional
      technique in our hospital, and then observe the outcomes.

    <description>The foreskin is first separated from the glans.Then the inner ring is placed between them and over the glans. After adjusting the position of inner ring to retain 0.5cm inner foreskin, the operator install the outer ring over the foreskin and combine them together. Removal of excess foreskin is then performed upon the device.</description>

    <description>The foreskin is first separated from the glans. Then the inner ring is placed on the outer layer of foreskin. Next, the rim of the foreskin is clamped with blood vessel forceps at the 3, 6, 9 and 12 o'clock points. An urologist and an assistant each hold two clamps to widen the opening of the foreskin, and pull it over the inner ring. After the inner and outer layers of the foreskin and the frenulum are symmetrically positioned, the assistant install the outer ring over the foreskin and gently combine it together. Removal of excess foreskin is then performed below the device.</description>
