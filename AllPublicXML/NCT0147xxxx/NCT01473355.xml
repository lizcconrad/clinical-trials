  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical efficacy of Osseospeed™ TX 3mm
      diameter implant in a Chinese population by evaluation of marginal bone level alteration,
      implant stability and implant survival in the posterior mandible up to 3 years after loading.
      Hypothesis: Early loading of the 3 mm implant is a safe and predictable procedure.

    <time_frame>At 12 months after implant loading</time_frame>
    <description>Marginal bone level will be determined from radiographs and expressed as the distance from a reference point on the implant to the most coronal bone-to-implant contact on the mesial and distal aspect of the implant. Marginal bone level expressed in millimeters at the12 months follow-up visit will be compared to values obtained at delivery of permanent restoration i.e. loading (baseline).</description>
