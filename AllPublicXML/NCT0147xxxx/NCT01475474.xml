    <measure>Co-primary Effectiveness Endpoint: A Relative Percentage Change in Wexner Score (or Bowel Incontinence) Severity by Comparing Post-treatment Wexner Scores to Pre-treatment (End of Baseline Period) Wexner Scores.</measure>
    <time_frame>Wexner score was calculated at the end of the Baseline period (Weeks 1-4) to the end of the 12-Week Treatment Period (week 16).</time_frame>
    <description>The Wexner fecal incontinence scale takes into account five parameters that are scored on a scale from zero (absent) to four (daily) frequency of incontinence to gas, liquid, solid, use of pad, and quality of life. Full continence is a Wexner total of zero (0), whereas full incontinence is a Wexner total of 20.
This co-primary effectiveness endpoint is the mean % reduction in Wexner score from the baseline period to the end of the treatment period, which was calculated according to the following equation: % reduction in Wexner = 100% (baseline period Wexner - end treatment period Wexner) / (baseline period Wexner).</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Three (3) clinical sites participated in the US pivotal trial, enrolling a total of ninety-seven subjects. The trial consisted of a 4-week baseline evaluation period, a 12-week treatment period and a 4-week return to baseline period. The study started in December 2009 and completed in December 2011.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Renew Medical conducted a multi-center, prospective, open label, single-arm, non-randomized pivotal study designed to establish the safety, effectiveness, and tolerability of the Renew Insert in subjects with moderate-to severe bowel incontinence (defined as having a Wexner score greater than 12).</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Renew Insert for Management of Accidental Bowel Leakage</title>
          <description>The Renew Insert is designed for self-insertion to seal and help prevent involuntary leakage of stool from the rectum. The Insert is designed for single use and consists of two components: a soft, easily deformable silicone insert and a flexible plastic fingertip applicator. After self insertion into the anal canal the Insert is expelled with voluntary bowel movement or if desired, manually removed by the user.</description>

        <title>Co-primary Effectiveness Endpoint: A Relative Percentage Change in Episodes of Accidental Bowel Leakage (ABL) Determined by Comparing Treatment Results to Pre-treatment Results From the Baseline Period as Measured by Daily Diary Recordings.</title>
        <description>This co-primary effectiveness endpoint was calculated as a relative percentage of the baseline Accidental Bowel Leakage (ABL) using the following equation: % reduction in ABL = 100*(baseline period ABL - treatment period ABL) / (baseline period ABL)</description>

        <title>Co-primary Effectiveness Endpoint: A Relative Percentage Change in Wexner Score (or Bowel Incontinence) Severity by Comparing Post-treatment Wexner Scores to Pre-treatment (End of Baseline Period) Wexner Scores.</title>
        <description>The Wexner fecal incontinence scale takes into account five parameters that are scored on a scale from zero (absent) to four (daily) frequency of incontinence to gas, liquid, solid, use of pad, and quality of life. Full continence is a Wexner total of zero (0), whereas full incontinence is a Wexner total of 20.
This co-primary effectiveness endpoint is the mean % reduction in Wexner score from the baseline period to the end of the treatment period, which was calculated according to the following equation: % reduction in Wexner = 100% (baseline period Wexner - end treatment period Wexner) / (baseline period Wexner).</description>
