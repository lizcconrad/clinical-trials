  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many women experience the accidental loss of urine called urge incontinence or overactive
      bladder (OAB) incontinence. Women describe this as a sudden, strong desire to pass urine
      which results in leakage before reaching the toilet. The current usual treatments for urge
      incontinence include behavioral treatment, physical therapy, and medicines. Although these
      treatments have been found to be effective in research studies, they are less effective over
      time in general practice. Because medicines have side effects, many women stop them. The
      purpose of this study is to explore different treatments that may provide another option for
      women with urge incontinence that might be effective. This is an initial study to see if
      these treatments are at least as effective as the usual treatments.

      Hypothesis: Does Mind Based Stress Reduction(MBSR)(meditation practices)reduce urinary urge
      incontinence episodes?

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Females at least 18 years of age

          2. Five or more urge urinary incontinence episodes on a three-day voiding diary. Urge
             incontinence episodes will be determined based on voiding diary and subject indication
             of coincident urge symptoms, allowing self-characterization of incontinence type.

          3. Urge predominant (urge &gt;50% of total incontinent episodes) urinary incontinence based
             on self-reported characterization of incontinent episodes on diary.

          4. Request for treatment for urge urinary incontinence.

          5. Subject is able to complete all study related items and interviews.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any current or recent (past 4 weeks) anticholinergic medication use. Patient may
             discontinue medication and after 4 weeks may be eligible for study.

          2. Past non-pharmacologic treatment for urge incontinence such as supervised behavioral
             therapy, supervised or unsupervised physical therapy, supervised biofeedback, and
             transvaginal electrical stimulation.

          3. Current symptomatic urinary tract infection that has not resolved prior start of MBSR
             group.

          4. Symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse screened by PFDI (Pelvic Floor Disorder Inventory
             question #3) &quot;Do you have a bulge or something falling out that you can see or feel in
             the vaginal area?&quot;

          5. Previous or currently implanted neuromodulation (sacral or tibial).

          6. Surgically altered detrusor muscle, such as augmentation cystoplasty.

          7. Women with known neurologic disease believed to potentially affect urinary function
             (Multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injuries, myasthenia gravis, Charcot-Marie-Tooth
             disease).

          8. In the opinion of the investigator, inability to understand diary instructions and
             complete 3-day voiding diary.

          9. Subject has been previously diagnosed with interstitial cystitis or chronic pelvic
             pain syndrome.

         10. Currently pregnant or within 6 months postpartum (pregnancy is not excluded for safety
             reasons but for quality of data)
