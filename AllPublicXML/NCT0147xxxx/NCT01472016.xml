  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/1b open-label study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      preliminary efficacy of ABT-700 in subjects with advanced solid tumors that may have MET
      amplification or c-Met overexpression. ABT-700, previously known as h224G11 in publications,
      is an anti-c-Met antibody. The early clinical development plan for ABT-700 is based on the
      activity demonstrated in preclinical models. Up to 124 subjects will be enrolled.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject with advanced solid tumors; Dose-expansion: evidence for MET gene
             amplification.

          -  Subject must have disease: a) that is not amenable to surgical resection, or b) that
             has progressed or recurred despite standard therapy, or c) that has failed to respond
             to standard therapy, or d) for which no effective therapy exists.

          -  Subject cannot tolerate or must not be eligible for other approved therapeutic options
             with known survival advantage.

          -  Subjects enrolled on the combination therapy phase must satisfy the above inclusion
             criteria and also the following: Subjects must have inoperable, locally advanced or
             metastatic cancer and be eligible to receive docetaxel or FOLFIRI/cetuximab or
             erlotinib in combination with ABT-700.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has received anticancer therapy including chemotherapy, immunotherapy,
             radiation therapy, immunotherapy, biologic, or any investigational therapy within a
             period of 21 days, or herbal therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of ABT-700.

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled metastases of the central nervous system. Subjects with
             brain metastases are eligible provided they have shown clinical and radiographic
             stable disease after definitive therapy and have not used steroids for at least 1
             month prior to first dose of ABT-700.

          -  Subject has unresolved adverse events &gt; Grade 1 from prior anticancer therapy except
             for alopecia or anemia.

          -  Subject has had major surgery within 21 days prior to the first dose of ABT-700.

          -  Subjects enrolled on the combination therapy phase must not meet the above exclusion
             criteria and must be eligible to receive docetaxel or FOLFIRI/cetuximab or erlotinib
             per most current prescribing information, or at the discretion of the Investigator.
             Subjects with K-Ras mutation-positive colorectal cancer will be excluded from
             receiving FOLFIRI/cetuximab.
