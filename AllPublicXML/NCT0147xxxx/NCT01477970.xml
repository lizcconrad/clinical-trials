    <textblock>
      The possibility to prevent the early ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) by doubling the
      daily dose of GnRH-antagonist in women stimulated with the antagonist protocol who are at
      risk for OHSS was evaluated. Thirty-eight women of a study group who underwent ovarian
      stimulation using the GnRH-antagonist protocol and might have had their cycle cancelled
      because of OHSS were compared to 76 women of a control group. All cases of the study group
      were IVF women presenting a rapid rise of E2 ≥ 3500 pg/ml on the 7th day of stimulation or
      later while the follicles (&gt; 12mm) were &gt; 15 in total and the biggest one was ≤ 16mm in
      diameter. By decreasing the rFSH dose to 100IU a day and adding an additional dose of
      GnRH-antagonist (0.25 twice a day), estradiol levels were lowered or reached a plateau before
      hCG was given. A marked decrease or plateau of estradiol levels was observed the day of
      oocyte retrieval while the pregnancy rate was not adversely affected when compared with an
      optimum ovarian response cycles. None of the women were cancelled or developed OHSS.

      In overresponding IVF cycles, doubling the usual GnRH-antagonist daily-dose during the
      ovarian stimulation, the estradiol rise could be blocked while a minimal follicular
      stimulation may continue without the risk of OHSS or adversely affect pregnancy rate.
