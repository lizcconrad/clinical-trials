      Hypothesis: Viscosupplementation when combined with an off-loading knee brace is more
      effective in treating the symptoms of knee OA then treating with viscosupplementation alone

      A randomized prospective study to assess the effectiveness of treating knee osteoarthritis
      with either a series of three viscosupplementation injections, an off-loading knee brace, or
      a combination of viscosupplementation and an off-loading knee brace. The viscosupplementation
      and off-loading knee brace are being used in accordance with their FDA approval. Subjects
      will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups. The control group will receive a series of
      weekly (3 consecutive weeks) intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections. The second group
      will receive a series of weekly (3 consecutive weeks) intra-articular hyaluronic acid
      injections and an off loading knee brace. The third group will use the off loading knee brace
      alone. Subjects will complete the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Questionnaire (pain, stiffness,
      function) and VAS pain scale (measuring pain on movement) at baseline, day 7, day 14, 6 weeks
      and 3 months. Subjects in group 2 and 3 will be given a brace diary to record compliance.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Subjects, over the age of 18, with a diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis which is
             confirmed by radiographs.

          -  Radiographs will be obtained and patients with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis
             will qualify a subject for enrollment.

          -  Subjects will also have a documented varus deformity.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Subjects with severe arthritis as demonstrated by radiographs.

          -  In addition those subjects with a known or suspected joint infection and subjects who
             had undergone arthrocentesis and/or intra-articular injection within 3 months of the
             study will be excluded.

          -  Female patients who are pregnant or breast feeding will also be excluded.
