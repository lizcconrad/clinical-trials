      Patients with NSTEMI and multivessel disease will be scheduled to undergo early invasive
      strategy (PCI within 72 hours) of de novo native coronary artery lesions were considered for
      recruitment into the study. Inclusion criteria are the following: diagnosis of NSTEMI
      according to current guidelines presenting with multivessel disease. We will exclude patients
      with cardiogenic shock at presentation (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg despite drug
      therapy), left main coronary disease (&gt;50% diameter stenosis), previous coronary artery
      bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, patients with Syntax Score &gt;32 and candidated to by-pass
      surgery (10), severe valvular heart disease and unsuccessful procedures. Procedure success
      was defined as the achievement of an angiographic residual stenosis of less than 30% and a
      thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade III after PCI.

      Patients randomized to One-Stage group were completely revascularizated in one time PCI,
      whereas patients randomized to Multi-Staged group were completely revascularizated in more
      time PCI, during the same hospitalization. Patients received a clopidogrel loading dose of
      600 mg before the PCI (for loading dose administered more than 6 h prior to procedure).
      Post-procedural antiplatelet regimen consisted of aspirin at 100 mg/day indefinitely and
      clopidogrel 75 mg/day for at least one month.
