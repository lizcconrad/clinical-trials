    <textblock>
      Contingency management is efficacious for treating cocaine abuse, but contingency management
      interventions have rarely been applied to patients with severe and persistent mental health
      problems. This pilot project will estimate effect sizes of contingency management for
      reducing cocaine use in patients receiving psychiatric care at a large community based mental
      health program. In total, 30 cocaine abusing patients will be randomized to one of two 8-week
      treatment conditions: standard care or standard care with contingency management. Patients in
      both conditions will provide breath and urine samples for toxicology testing twice per week.
      In the contingency management condition, patients will receive the opportunity to win prizes
      for submitting cocaine negative urine samples. The investigators expect that patients
      receiving contingency management will evidence reductions in cocaine use and may show
      improvements in psychiatric symptoms and psychosocial functioning relative to patients in
      standard care. Effect size estimates obtained from this study will be used to guide larger
      scale and longer duration evaluations of contingency management for dually diagnosed
      patients.
