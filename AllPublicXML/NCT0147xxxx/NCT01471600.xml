  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In several national anaesthesia societies, clear fluids are allowed up to 2 hours before
      general anaesthesia (GA) and light meals up to 6h. Because of aspiration risk, strict fasting
      remains routine. Recently, surgical studies proved that pre-operative carbohydrate-rich drink
      reduces preoperative discomfort without affecting gastric fluid volume and acidity.The aim of
      this study was to show the effects of preanaesthetic oral fluid in patients undergoing upper
      endoscopy without emergency. The expected efficacy is a reduction of the preoperative
      discomfort. The investigators thus propose a randomised prospective open-label study to
      assess efficacy of preanaesthetic oral glucose drink in patients undergoing upper endoscopy
      without emergency. Study compare two groups : group &quot;drink&quot; (200 ml of fruit juice without
      pulp ± 200 ml of coffee or tea, 2 at 4 hours before the induction of anaesthesia) and group
      &quot;overnight fasting&quot;.Discomfort was measured at 2 hours before GA (H-2), just before GA (H0)
      and 4h after anaesthesia (H+4). Each item (anxiety, thirst, hunger, nervousness, tiredness,
      nausea) was estimated by visual analogue scale (VAS from 0 to 100mm) and handgrip strength by
      dynamometer. Gastroenterologist assessed the quality of endoscopy (VAS), gastric residual
      fluid and acidity.The main aim of this study was to assess in patients referred for upper
      endoscopy under general anaesthesia, the effect of carbohydrate drink on preanaesthetic
      discomfort. Secondary purpose were to compare quality of endoscopy, residual gastric volumes,
      gastric acidity and incidence of side effects. 118 patients will be included in the study. A
      stratification will be made on the type of endoscopy.
