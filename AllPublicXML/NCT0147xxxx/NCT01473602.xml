  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether teriparatide, given for 6 months versus placebo,
      will improve the healing of hip (femoral neck) fractures that are repaired during surgery
      using certain types of orthopedic screws. The study will enroll men and postmenopausal women
      at least 50 years of age with a recent hip (femoral neck) fracture caused by low-trauma (for
      example, fall from standing height or less).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-month, Phase 3, prospective, randomized, parallel, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, multicenter, multinational study to evaluate the effect of 6 months of
      treatment with teriparatide on fracture healing in participants who have sustained a recent
      low-trauma, unilateral, femoral neck fracture stabilized by internal fixation. The study has
      3 periods:

        1. A screening period that must be completed in ≤ 14 days after operative treatment of the
           femoral neck fracture

        2. A 6-month double-blind treatment period [teriparatide 20 (µg) or placebo given once
           daily by subcutaneous injection]

        3. A 6-month observation period.

      The primary objective is to assess the effect of 6 months of treatment with teriparatide 20
      µg/day versus placebo on the proportion of men and postmenopausal women of at least 50 years
      of age with no revision surgery 12 months after internal fixation of a low-trauma femoral
      neck fracture.

      All participants will receive supplements of calcium and vitamin D beginning at screening and
      continuing for 12 months.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Pain Control During Ambulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The worst pain numeric rating scale (NRS) was used to assess the impact of pain on a participant's life. NRS Item 3 assessed the worst musculoskeletal pain severity during the walking test. Pain was measured by an 11-point Likert scale. The following cut-points were used to categorize the NRS responses: 0 = no pain, 1 to 4 = mild pain, 5 to 6 = moderate pain, and 7 to 10 = severe pain. Higher scores indicated more severe pain. Participants with an NRS score of &lt;7 and no worsening of NRS scores &gt;2 from baseline were categorized as having no severe fracture-site pain. Percentage was calculated as: (number of participants with pain control during ambulation / total number of participants analyzed) * 100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Without Severe Fracture-Site Pain During 24 Hours Prior to Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The NRS was used to assess the impact of pain on a participant's life. Fracture-site pain severity was assessed for pain in the 24 hours preceding a visit. Pain was measured by an 11-point Likert scale. Participants with an NRS score of &lt;7 in the 24 hours preceding a visit and no worsening of NRS score &gt;2 from baseline were categorized as having no severe fracture-site pain. Percentage was calculated as: (number of participants with pain control during 24 hours preceding a visit / total number of participants analyzed) * 100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Functional Evidence of Healing</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Functional healing was defined as ability to walk with a gait speed ≥ 0.05 meters/second (m/s) with a change from baseline ≥ -0.1 m/s. The walking test involved having the participant walk a distance of 7 meters (m) at a self-selected, comfortable pace. A 4-m portion of the test was timed to determine the participant's gait speed in m/s.
Percentage was calculated as: (number of participants with functional evidence of healing / total number of participants analyzed) * 100.</description>

        <description>The worst pain numeric rating scale (NRS) was used to assess the impact of pain on a participant's life. NRS Item 3 assessed the worst musculoskeletal pain severity during the walking test. Pain was measured by an 11-point Likert scale. The following cut-points were used to categorize the NRS responses: 0 = no pain, 1 to 4 = mild pain, 5 to 6 = moderate pain, and 7 to 10 = severe pain. Higher scores indicated more severe pain. Participants with an NRS score of &lt;7 and no worsening of NRS scores &gt;2 from baseline were categorized as having no severe fracture-site pain.

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to 6 Months on European Quality of Life Questionnaire (EQ-5D) Overall Health Score</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D is a 5-item, self-reported, generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument with 5 items. Overall health state score was also self-reported using a visual analogue scale (VAS) marked on a scale scored from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). Higher scores represented better health state with 0 representing worst imaginable health state and 100 representing best imaginable health state. LS means was calculated using ANCOVA adjusted for baseline, treatment group, region.</description>
