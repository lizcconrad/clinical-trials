  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomised trial was to investigate whether hyperthermia (HT) combined with
      interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT) has any influence on local control (LC), disease-free
      survival (DFS), or acute and late side effects in patients with advanced cervical cancer.
      Vaginal symptoms were assessed by SOMA score, bladder and rectum symptoms by EORTC/RTOG
      score. Following the completion of radiochemotherapy, consecutive patients with cervical
      cancer (FIGO stage II - III) were randomly assigned to two treatment groups, either ISBT
      alone or ISBT combined with interstitial hyperthermia (ISHT). A total of 205 patients were
      included in the statistical analysis. Once a week, HT, at a temperature above 42.5°C, was
      administered for 45 minutes before and during the HDR BT. Follow-up examinations were
      scheduled at 6 weeks after the completion of BT, every 3 months during the first 2 years, and
      every 6 months throughout the next 3 years. If relapse was suspected, biopsies were obtained
      from these patients.
