  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether computerised working memory training
      improves cognitive performance, ADHD symptoms, psychosocial functioning and quality of life
      in adults with ADHD, from psychiatric outpatient clinics (N=100) as well as from a
      high-security prison facility (N=50).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to evaluate whether 5 weeks of computerised working memory training
      improves working memory capacity. Secondary aims are to explore whether improvements in
      working memory capacity will be transferred to improvements in learning abilities and fluid
      intelligence. Also, far transfer effects on executive functioning, ADHD symptoms,
      psychosocial functioning and quality of life will be explored. Finally, it will also be
      assessed to what extent improvements gained from 5 weeks of working memory training will be
      maintained 3 and 6 months post-study, respectively.
