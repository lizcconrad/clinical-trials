      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the introduction of large-scale personalized
      and technology supported telemonitoring and health coaching interventions produces benefits
      in terms of health related quality of life, health status and empowerment of patients with a
      cardiovascular disease. In addition, the trials evaluate the economical and organizational
