    <textblock>
      Infections often occur after ventricular assist devices (VADs) are placed. These infections
      can be very serious. The goal of this study is to understand why these infections occur.
      Bacteria (germs) normally live on our skin and in our noses. After surgery, they can infect
      the VAD. The investigators will collect cultures of your skin and nose before and after
      surgery. The investigators will compare these bacteria to bacteria that cause infections.
      Their genes will be compared to see which ones help the bacteria cause infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infections are one of the most serious of ventricular assist device (VAD) related
      complications. Many of these infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and
      mortality. Diagnosis of these infections is often difficult due to the complicated nature of
      the patient's medical problems, the need for rapid institution of empiric antibiotic therapy
      and the lack of established criteria that define infection. Staphylococci are among the most
      common causes of VAD infections. The basis for this high incidence is not well understood but
      is believed to be in part due to inoculation of staphylococcal commensal flora into wound
      sites at the time of surgery or thereafter. The goals of this observational study are to
      develop a better understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of Staphylococcus aureus
      and epidermidis-VAD infections as well as to develop a set of criteria that can be used to
      help diagnose the presence or absence of a VAD related infection.

      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational study to identify risk factors associated
      with the development of VAD-related infections. Patients will be followed for up to one year
      following VAD implantation, time of death or transplantation, whichever comes first. There
      will be no randomization for this observational study.
