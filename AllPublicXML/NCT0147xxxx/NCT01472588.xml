  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a significant and growing problem in the US that negatively impacts health and
      well-being of racial and ethnic minorities, people of low socioeconomic status, and persons
      living in rural communities and in the South. Obesity is a major concern in Arkansas, where
      the obesity rate for adults is higher than the rate for other adults in the nation. However
      effective weight loss programs are not typically available in these communities. Research has
      shown that the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) lifestyle intervention is effective in
      promoting weight loss in high risk individuals through changes in diet and physical activity
      that significantly reduce the chances of type 2 diabetes. Effective methods are desperately
      needed to translate the DPP to community settings, where obesity is a compelling public
      health burden. A major step in translating the DPP is to examine the efficacy of health
      professionals and community health workers (CHWs) in delivering the program in real-world
      settings. This is an important issue from the perspective of how evidence-based weight loss
      interventions can be provided to underserved, and resource constrained communities that
      typically may not have access to trained professionals for program delivery. The current
      project is a 5 year randomized controlled trial that examines DPP delivery and weight
      outcomes for individuals randomly assigned to either: (1) the DPP intervention delivered by
      CHWs or (2) the DPP intervention delivered by health professionals or (3) the Self Help
      condition. The study population consists of overweight adults (body mass index (BMI) &gt; 25)
      who reside in communities with a high proportion of African Americans. Primary outcome is
      change in body weight at 16 months. Cost effectiveness and lifestyle behaviors are also
      evaluated.
