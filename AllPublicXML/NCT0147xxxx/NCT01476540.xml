  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a challenging, chronic, refractory illness with the highest
      mortality rate of any psychiatric condition. Advances in the neuroimaging, genetics and
      neurobiology of AN has led to a greater understanding of its underlying pathophysiology,
      although few significant advances in treatment have been made in the last half-century. The
      central features of AN, which include an intense fear of gaining weight, a refusal to
      maintain a normal weight, as well as significant anxiety, anhedonia and dysphoria surrounding
      food, have been linked to dysfunction in key brain structures and circuits. Deep Brain
      Stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical procedure that involves the insertion of electrodes into
      structures believed to drive pathological behavior. The procedure is approved for the
      management of movement disorders, such as Parkinson's Disease, and has shown promising early
      results in the management of some psychiatric conditions, such as Major Depression. The
      purpose of this study is to explore the safety and initial efficacy of DBS, in patients with
      treatment resistant AN.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female or Male patients between age 20-60

          -  Diagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa, restricting or binge-purging subtype as defined by the
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IVR)

          -  Chronicity and/or Treatment Resistance as demonstrated by some or all of:

               1. A pattern of three year's duration of relentless unresponsiveness to repeated
                  voluntary hospitalizations, characterized by failure to complete treatment of
                  immediate weight relapse following treatment;

               2. pattern of increasing medical instability accompanied by refusal to participate
                  in/lack of responsiveness to intensive expert treatment and increasing medical
                  acuity, lasting at least two years and involving at least two episodes of
                  involuntary feeding;

               3. A pattern of chronic stable AN lasting at least 10 years

          -  Able to comply with all testing, follow-ups and study appointments and protocols

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any past or current evidence of psychosis

          -  Active neurologic disease such as epilepsy

          -  Alcohol or substance dependence or abuse in the last 6 months, excluding caffeine and
             nicotine

          -  Any contraindication to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Positron Emission
             Tomography (PET) scanning

          -  Likely to relocate or move during the study's one year duration

          -  BMI less than 13

          -  Presence of cardiac arrhythmias, or other cardiac, respiratory, renal or endocrine
             conditions as a result of AN or not, that will result in significant risk from a
             surgical procedure.
