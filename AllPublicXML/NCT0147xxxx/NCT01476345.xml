    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      LY2963016 compared to those of basal insulin. The study will also gather information on the
      safety and tolerability of LY2963016 in healthy participants.

      Each study period will be approximately 8.5 days (1.5 days for treatment and 7 day washout
      period). There are 4 study periods.

    <measure>Pharmacokinetics: Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to 24 Hours [AUC(0-24)] of LY2963016 and Lantus</measure>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Glucose Infusion Rate (Rmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour predose up to 24 hours postdose in all treatment periods</time_frame>
    <description>Rmax is the maximum infusion rate of glucose administered intravenously needed to maintain target blood glucose level and is used to measure the study drug action over time as measured by the euglycaemic clamp procedure. During the euglycaemic clamp procedure, blood glucose concentrations are held constant after the administration of LY2963016 or Lantus by adjusting the exogenous glucose infusion rate. Data presented were adjusted by the body weight.</description>

    <measure>Total Amount of Glucose Infused (Gtot) Over the Duration of Clamp Procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour predose up to 24 hours postdose in all treatment periods</time_frame>
    <description>Gtot is the total glucose infusion over the clamp duration and is used to measure the study drug action over time as measured by the euglycaemic clamp procedure. During the euglycaemic clamp procedure, blood glucose concentrations are held constant after the administration of LY2963016 or Lantus by adjusting the exogenous glucose infusion rate.
