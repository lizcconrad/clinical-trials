  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resveratrol has been shown to activate a protein called Notch-1. Signaling of Notch-1 has
      been shown to prevent tumor cell growth. Resveratrol has also been shown to prevent growth of
      tumors in mice. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of resveratrol and
      Notch-1 on neuroendocrine tumor tissue and to examine how people with neuroendocrine tumors
      who take resveratrol for up to three months tolerate the product.

      Patients will be treated with a dose of 5 gm/day of resveratrol orally, in two divided doses
      of 2.5 gm each without a break in therapy for a total of three cycles. All patients who
      receive at least one dose of resveratrol will be evaluated for toxicity and tolerability.
      Toxicities will be assessed every 28 days while the study drug is being taken by the patient.
      Pill bottles will be reviewed at this visit as well to ensure compliance with the study
      medication. Toxicities will be graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria. Blood
      will be drawn for a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel. In addition, one
      vial of serum will be stored at the time of each toxicity assessment for later analysis of
      resveratrol levels. This level must be drawn one hour after the morning dose and the
      participants will be instructed to alter the time of the morning dose so as to allow proper
      timing with the scheduled blood draw.

      During the third cycle of treatment, a post-treatment biopsy will be obtained for study
      related purposes and will be processed only for research related purposes.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>1. The investigators aim primarily to show that resveratrol therapy in patients with low-grade GI neuroendocrine tumors will significantly increase Notch1 activation in post-treatment tumor biopsy specimens when compared to pretreatment levels.
Endpoints: The primary endpoint will be the level of expression of full length Notch1, cleaved Notch1, HES-1, and ASCL-1, as measured by Western blot using quantitative densitometry. The pre-treatment and post-treatment biopsies will be processed and analyzed simultaneously so as to minimize inter-test variability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Demonstrate that resveratrol at 5 gm per day will be well tolerated with minimal dose limiting toxicities in this patient population.</measure>

    <description>Frequency of grade three or greater toxicities as defined by the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Describe the effect of resveratrol on tumor growth as demonstrated by standard cross sectional imaging and tumor markers.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The level of tumor markers (eg, chromogranin, 5-HIAA, gastrin, and others) pre-treatment will be compared to the post-treatment levels (collected every three months) as a measure of tumor response. In addition, serial axial imaging will be used to document tumor response rates according to standard Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).</description>

          4. Greater than four weeks must have elapsed since any previous therapy was administered
             for the neuroendocrine tumor, including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or local
             liver therapy.

          5. Octreotide use is allowed but must be initiated at least four weeks prior to
             enrollment and to the pre-treatment biopsy

          6. Able to give informed consent and willing to undergo the post-treatment research
             biopsy

          7. Must be able to take oral medications and be without GI tract obstructive symptoms

             chemotherapy or radiation, or with a malignancy for which such treatments have been
             recommended, would be excluded or withdrawn from the study.
