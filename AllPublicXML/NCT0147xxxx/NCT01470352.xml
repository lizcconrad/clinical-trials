      To delineate brain mechanisms that subserve EA in the healthy state and to identify
      alterations in mechanisms supporting EA in chronic pain and their therapeutic relevance.
      Individuals with migraine will be examined between episodes in order to assess basal
      alterations in the efficiency of spatial and temporal filtering of noxious information. This
      population provides the unique opportunity to examine such processes without confounds
      arising from ongoing pain.

      Pain is a uniquely individual experience that is powerfully shaped by the action of
      descending control mechanisms. These systems may play crucial roles in the moment-to-moment
      tuning of the sensitivity, spatial, and temporal response characteristics of nociceptive
      processing mechanisms during both acute and pathological pain states. However, these systems
      remain poorly understood in human subjects. The proposed research will use psychophysics and
      multiparametric MRI to (i) delineate the brain mechanisms that subserve and regulate
      endogenous analgesia (EA) in the healthy state and (ii) to identify alterations in mechanisms
      supporting EA in chronic pain and their therapeutic relevance. In both healthy subjects and
      chronic pain patients, EA will be probed using the DNIC (diffuse noxious inhibitory controls)
      and offset analgesia paradigms. Functional MRI will examine activation of brainstem
      mechanisms important in EA, while both functional and structural connectivity analyses will
      assess the regulation of these brainstem mechanisms by cerebral cortical regions involved in
      attention and affect. One pathological painful condition, migraine, will be examined since it
      allows changes in EA associated with chronic pain to be investigated between episodes of
      pain. Finally, EA and EA associated structural and functional parameters will be used to
      predict the efficacy of one compound, amitriptyline, to treat migraine in individual
      patients. Taken together, the proposed research will provide substantial insights into basic
      mechanisms supporting and regulating EA and can provide a foundation for mechanism-based
      individualized choice of therapy that may benefit all chronic pain patients.
