      This study will assess the safety of combining two agents (everolimus and BKM120) for the
      treatment of advanced cancer arising from solid organ in patients who are no longer
      benefiting from or unable to withstand standard treatment of these conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the combination of two anticancer drugs, everolimus
      (RAD001) and BKM120, in patients whose cancer is no longer responding to standard treatment
      or patients who are unable to tolerate the standard treatment for their cancer. The
      investigators seek to establish the safety of taking these two medications together and to
      determine the appropriate doses of the two drugs when given together as well as identify
      potential side effects when the drugs are administered together.

      Another purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness and side effects of the
      combination of RAD001 and BKM120 by looking at the patient's response to the treatment. The
      investigators want to find out what effects, good or bad, the drugs have on the patient's
      cancer.

      This study will also look at specific biomarkers in the patient's blood and in the tumor
      tissue which are involved in the growth of tumor cells and determine if the levels of these
      biomarkers are related to the patient's response to treatment or development of side effects.

      Everolimus, also known by the brand name, Afinitor, is a biologic drug approved by the Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of kidney cancer. It works by preventing
      cancer cell from multiplying and it also renders them easily susceptible to death.

      BKM120 is a new study drug that is being tested for its ability to treat cancer. However, it
      has not yet been approved by the FDA for the treatment of any specific cancer type.

    <description>BKM120 (20mg to 100mg) will be self-administered (by the patients themselves). The investigator will instruct the patient to take the study drug exactly as specified in the protocol. BKM120 will be administered on a continuous once daily dosing schedule. Patients should be instructed to take the dose of BKM120 daily in the morning, one hour after a light breakfast (morning meal) at approximately the same time each day. BKM120 should be taken with a glass of water and consumed over as short a time as possible. Patients should swallow the capsules as a whole and not chew them. Patients should continue to fast for 2 hours after the administration of each BKM120 dose.</description>

             (HCV) RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing are required at screening for all
             patients with a positive medical history based on risk factors and/or confirmation of

             of live vaccines include intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio,
             Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), yellow fever, varicella and TY21a typhoid vaccines.

             to starting study drug.

         26. Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concomitant medical conditions (e.g.,
             active or uncontrolled infection) that could cause unacceptable safety risks or
             compromise compliance with the protocol

         27. Patient is unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully with
             the investigator
