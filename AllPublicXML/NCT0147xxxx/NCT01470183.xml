      This is an exploratory study. No formal hypothesis will be tested.

      The objectives of this study are to follow Lupus Nephritis patients over a period of 12
      months to:

        -  Establish the baseline biomarker characteristics of patients

        -  Determine the variability of biomarker measures over time

        -  Correlate biomarkers with disease phenotype

        Approximately 50 adult patients, 25 with lupus nephritis 25 control patients who have
        greater than 1 gram per day proteinuria and non-SLE diagnoses, and who qualify for this
        study based upon the stated inclusion/exclusion criteria will be recruited from the
        Glomerular Center at Columbia University Medical Center.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults between 18 and 80 years of age, inclusive

          -  Diagnosis of SLE by ACR criteria and biopsy-proven ISN/RPS Class III or IV lupus
             glomerulonephritis within 2 years

          -  Persistently active nephritis defined as proteinuria greater than or equal to 1.0
             g/day for 3 months or more, AND at least 1 of the following:

               -  Hematuria (greater than or equal to 5 RBC/hpf) on 2 or more urinalyses done
                  greater than or equal to 2 weeks apart

               -  anti-dsDNA positive or anti-Smith positive, or

               -  low C3 or C4 complement level. (d) Stable immunosuppression consisting of
                  mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 13 g/day with/without corticosteroids up to
                  prednisone equivalent of 15 mg/day, or azathioprine 13 mg/kg/day with/without
                  corticosteroids up to prednisone equivalent of 20 mg/day.

          -  Stable dose of ACE inhibitor/ARB for 4 weeks prior to study enrollment, unless
             previously intolerant to or having a contraindication to ACE inhibitors and ARBs

          -  If using oral corticosteroids, must be on a stable dose equivalent to less than or
             equal to 15 mg/day of prednisone for at least 4 weeks prior to study enrollment. If
             currently not using corticosteroids, the subject must not have received oral
             corticosteroids for at least 4 weeks prior study enrollment.

          -  Clarification of inclusion criteria for controls: Any patient with an idiopathic
             glomerular disease who does not have lupus nephritis. This includes patients with
             minimal change disease, membranous nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis,
             and IgA nephropathy.

        Exclusion Criteria:
