      Oxidative stress is seen in children with asthma, but is hard to measure. The investigators
      exploring the utility of using a commercially available assay to measure oxidative stress in
      the urine in asthmatics. Additionally, the investigators will attempt to prove that oxidative
      stress is higher in children with acute asthma compared to those with stable asthma and that
      this stress is also higher in children with more severe clinical asthma exacerbations
      compared to less severe ones.
