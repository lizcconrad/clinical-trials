    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating the performance of modern CT coronar angiography with low radiation
      technique compared to conventional invasive coronar angiography. The patients recruited will
      already be accepted for invasive coronary angiography based on clinical presentation, ECG and
      biochemical parameters. An &quot;all-comers&quot; design to avoid selection bias and no additional
      B-blockers will be used prior to CT angiography. The hypothesis is that it is possible to
      rule out significant coronary artery disease with sensitivity &gt; 95 % and negative predictive
      value &gt; 95 % with very low radiation doses.

      Conventional invasive coronary angiography (CICA) is associated with few but serious
      complications. It is time consuming for the patient and incur costs to the health institution
      due to the post-procedure observation needed. Coronary computer tomography angiography (CCTA)
      is a good alternative to CICA to rule out coronary artery disease (CAD). Moderate to
      excellent sensitivity and negative predictive values have been reported with 64-slice CT
      angiography. The main ethical problem has been the radiation doses given to the patient
      during CT angiography which was high &gt;10 millisievert(mSv). With 265 or higher slice CT
      machines and radiation dose reduction techniques, it is possible to evaluate coronary anatomy
      with radiation doses below 1 mSv. Heart rate reduction with B-blockers is in most cases not
      necessary with new generation CT machines but is recommended in guidelines.

      800 patients already accepted for CICA based on clinical information will be scheduled to
      undergo CCTA prior to invasive coronary angiography. Coronary anatomy will be described
      according to American Heart Association (AHA) classification with 17 segment analysis. The
      main purpose of the study is to achieve high sensitivity and high negative predictive value
      with CT angiography. Radiation doses in relation to gender and body mass index (BMI) will be
      monitored. In addition we will measure coronary calcification (Agatson score) and look at any
      association to the Vitamin D and calcium metabolism. Patient reported quality of life
      evaluation with validated questionnaires and long term follow up (5 and 10 years) regarding
      clinical endpoints.

    <description>The results from the CT coronary angiography will be compared with the results from the conventional invasive coronary angiography which in this respect is considered the &quot;gold standard&quot;. The sensitivity and specificity for the CT angiography regarding detection of significant coronary stenosis (ie more than 50 % lumen narrowing with the angiographic result as reference) and for revascularisation will be calculated separately.</description>

    <description>The association of vitamin D levels (25OHD) and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) related to vitamin D and calcium metabolism to presence of coronary plaques and their calcium content will be analysed as well as risk of fatal and non fatal coronary events. When events are registered other new novel risk markers detected in the Tromso Study will be measured in a nested case control design.</description>
