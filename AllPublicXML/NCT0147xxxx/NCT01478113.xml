      This study aims to identify a novel enhancement strategy for residual symptoms of major
      depressive disorder (MDD) Dopamine (DA) has been viewed as a &quot;pleasure neurotransmitter&quot; for
      over 30 years. Yet recent data from animal and human studies suggest that dopamine has
      greater effects on &quot;wanting&quot; than on &quot;liking.&quot; Therefore, the investigators of this study
      have hypothesized that amphetamine/d-amphetamine (AMPH), a medication which increases
      dopamine transmission in the reward centers of the brain, may have a more powerful
      antidepressant effect in combination with well-being therapy (WBT), a specific type of
      cognitive-behavioral therapy, which helps individuals with depression to increase their
      contact with natural rewards and decrease reward-interfering thoughts.

      The investigators will test their hypothesis by randomizing 40 individuals with residual
      symptoms of depression, already taking an antidepressant that affects serotonin (e.g. Prozac,
      Paxil), to 8 weeks of treatment with either WBT in combination with AMPH, or WBT with pill
      placebo. The effectiveness of each treatment will be measured using a reliable scale, called
      the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.

      The investigators have also hypothesized that people assigned to the stimulant/WBT group will
      have greater improvements in functioning, well-being, and positive affectivity than those the
      people assigned to the WBT/placebo group.

      The study will have 11 visits occur over 8 weeks with study visits scheduled weekly or
      biweekly.

      Detailed Description:

      The study visit occurrences are as follows:

        1. Week 0- Screening Visit

        2. Week 1- Baseline Visit

        3. Week 2- one phone visit and one clinic visit in one week

        4. Week 3- one phone visit and one clinic visit in one week

        5. Week 4- one visit in one week

        6. Week 5- one visit in one week

        7. Week 6- one visit in one week

        8. Week 7- one visit in one week

        9. Week 8- one visit in one week

      WBT description Four licensed therapists, who have been trained and certified in WBT, will
      provide weekly sessions of 30 to 50 minutes in duration. Therapists will follow the
      procedures outlined in the WBT manual. The initial sessions (weeks 0-2) will be focused on
      identifying and contextualizing episodes of well-being. The intermediate sessions (weeks 3-5)
      will be focused on modifying cognitions and behaviors, which lead to premature interruption
      of well-being, and optimizing cognitions and behaviors, which have been idiographically
      linked to enhanced well-being. Final sessions (weeks 6-8) will apply the Psychological
      Well-Being scales (PWB) to refine treatment according to Ryff's dimensions of well-being.
      Additional principles and techniques of WBT include reappraisal, mood-charting, scheduling of
      activities, shaping, problem-solving, and assertiveness training.

      Medication Schedule Participants will receive treatment with the stimulant,
      amphetamine/d-amphetamine, or matched placebo.

      Participants will start at 1 pill (placebo or 5 mg amphetamine/d-amphetamine) in the morning
      and 1 pill (placebo or 5 mg amphetamine/d-amphetamine) at noon. The treatment will then be
      flexibly adjusted up or down by a study clinician based on participant's response. Dose
      ranges will be 1-3 pills (placebo or 5 mg amphetamine) in the morning and 1-3 pills (placebo
      or 5 mg amphetamine) at noon.

            <description>In the active group, participants will receive treatment with Well-being therapy and amphetamine-dextroamphetamine.
Amphetamine-dextroamphetamine (AMPH): The amphetamine-dextroamphetamine will be in a pill formulation. The dosage of the amphetamine-dextroamphetamine will be flexibly adjusted up or down by a study clinician based on the participant's response. Dose ranges will be 1-3 pills (placebo or 5 mg amphetamine) in the morning and 1-3 pills (placebo or 5 mg amphetamine) at noon.
Well-being therapy: Therapy sessions will last between 30-50 minutes. The sessions will take place at every visit after the screening visit.</description>
