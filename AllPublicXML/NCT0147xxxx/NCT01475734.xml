  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a stepped glucose clamp study designed to investigate the effect of treatment with
      albiglutide on counter-regulatory hormone responses and recovery from hypoglycemia in
      subjects with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. A single dose of albiglutide or placebo will be given
      prior to a stepped hyper- and hypoglycemic clamp. The goal of this study is to demonstrate
      that albiglutide increases insulin secretion and decreases glucagon levels in a
      glucose-dependent manner.

      This is a Phase II, single-site, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,
      placebo-controlled, stepped glucose clamp study designed to investigate the effect of
      treatment with albiglutide on counter-regulatory hormone responses and recovery from
      hypoglycemia in subjects with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. A single dose of albiglutide or
      placebo will be given 3 days before employing a stepped hyper- and hypoglycemic clamp. The
      goal of this study is to demonstrate that albiglutide increases insulin secretion and
      decreases glucagon levels in a glucose-dependent manner. In particular, this study is being
      conducted to ensure that albiglutide does not impair counter-regulatory responses during
      hypoglycemia.

    <measure>Glucagon Concentration (Nanomoles Per Liter [Nmol/L]) During the Hypoglycemic Periods of the Glucose Clamp Procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma glucagon levels were measured for the estimation of glucagon secretion during the hypoglycemic periods. Glucagon response was measured at each clamped glucose concentration: 9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) (0 hour [hr], 1hr, 1 hr 15 minutes [min]), 5 mmol/L (1 hr 45 min, 2 hr), 4 mmol/L (2 hr 45 min, 3 hr), 3.3 mmol/L (3 hr 30 min, 3 hr 45 min), and 2.8 mmol/L (4 hr 15 min, 4 hr 30 min), and clamp released (4 hr 45 min, 5 hr, 5 hr 15 min, 5 hr 30 min). Repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed on non-transformed pharmacodynamic parameters using a model with treatment, time, and treatment-by-time as fixed effects, and participant as a random effect. Values below the lower limit of quantification (0.03780 nmol/L) were set to the quantification limit for summary.</description>

    <measure>Average Albiglutide Concentration on the Day of the Clamp Procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma samples were taken from participants at two time points on Day 4 (at 0 hours and 4 hours and 45 minutes post-dose) of Week 1 of the study for albiglutide study drug level analyses. The average concentration for each participant was calculated as the mean of the concentrations at 0 hours and 4 hours 45 minutes. The clamp procedure is a glucose-controlled insulin infusion system. Variable infusions of glucose are administered to achieve various glucose target levels. It is a way of quantifying insulin secretion and resistance.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Event (SAE) and Treatment-emergent Non-serious Adverse Event (AE) During the Clamp Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time the participant consented to participate in the study through the end of the study, or the final follow-up visit for participants who discontinued active participation in the study (up to 8 study weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as those with an onset on or after study drug administration. An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

        <title>Glucagon Concentration (Nanomoles Per Liter [Nmol/L]) During the Hypoglycemic Periods of the Glucose Clamp Procedure</title>
        <description>Plasma glucagon levels were measured for the estimation of glucagon secretion during the hypoglycemic periods. Glucagon response was measured at each clamped glucose concentration: 9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) (0 hour [hr], 1hr, 1 hr 15 minutes [min]), 5 mmol/L (1 hr 45 min, 2 hr), 4 mmol/L (2 hr 45 min, 3 hr), 3.3 mmol/L (3 hr 30 min, 3 hr 45 min), and 2.8 mmol/L (4 hr 15 min, 4 hr 30 min), and clamp released (4 hr 45 min, 5 hr, 5 hr 15 min, 5 hr 30 min). Repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed on non-transformed pharmacodynamic parameters using a model with treatment, time, and treatment-by-time as fixed effects, and participant as a random effect. Values below the lower limit of quantification (0.03780 nmol/L) were set to the quantification limit for summary.</description>

        <title>Insulin Secretion Rate (Measured by Mathematical Analysis of C-peptide Concentrations) During the Glucose Clamp Period</title>
        <description>The insulin secretion rate (ISR) was estimated by the deconvolution of peripheral C-peptide concentrations using a 2-compartment model that utilizes population C-peptide kinetic parameters. ISR was measured at 1 hr, 1 hr 15 min, 1 hr 45 min, 2 hr, 2 hr 45 min, 3 hr, 3 hr 30 min, 3 hr 45 min, 4 hr 15 min, and 4 hr 30 min. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed on insulin secretion rate using a model with treatment, time, and treatment-by-time as fixed effects, and participant as a random effect.</description>

        <description>Epinephrine levels were measured at all stages of glycemia during the glucose clamp period. Epinephrine levels were measured at each clamped glucose concentration: 9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) (0 hour [hr], 1hr, 1 hr 15 minutes [min]), 5 mmol/L (1 hr 45 min, 2 hr), 4 mmol/L (2 hr 45 min, 3 hr), 3.3 mmol/L (3 hr 30 min, 3 hr 45 min), and 2.8 mmol/L (4 hr 15 min, 4 hr 30 min), and clamp released (4 hr 45 min, 5 hr, 5 hr 15 min, 5 hr 30 min). Repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed on log-transformed pharmacodynamic parameters using a model with treatment, time, and treatment-by-time as fixed effects, and participant as a random effect. Values below the lower limit of quantification were set to the quantification limit for summary.</description>

        <title>Norepinephrine Values During the Glucose Clamp Period</title>
        <description>Norepinephrine levels were measured at all stages of glycemia during the glucose clamp period. Epinephrine levels were measured at each clamped glucose concentration: 9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) (0 hour [hr], 1hr, 1 hr 15 minutes [min]), 5 mmol/L (1 hr 45 min, 2 hr), 4 mmol/L (2 hr 45 min, 3 hr), 3.3 mmol/L (3 hr 30 min, 3 hr 45 min), and 2.8 mmol/L (4 hr 15 min, 4 hr 30 min), and clamp released (4 hr 45 min, 5 hr, 5 hr 15 min, 5 hr 30 min). Repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed on log-transformed pharmacodynamic parameters using a model with treatment, time, and treatment-by-time as fixed effects, and participant as a random effect. Values below the lower limit of quantification were set to the quantification limit for summary.</description>

        <title>Growth Hormone Values During the Glucose Clamp Period</title>
        <description>Growth hormone levels were measured at all stages of glycemia during the glucose clamp period. Epinephrine levels were measured at each clamped glucose concentration: 9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) (0 hour [hr], 1hr, 1 hr 15 minutes [min]), 5 mmol/L (1 hr 45 min, 2 hr), 4 mmol/L (2 hr 45 min, 3 hr), 3.3 mmol/L (3 hr 30 min, 3 hr 45 min), and 2.8 mmol/L (4 hr 15 min, 4 hr 30 min), and clamp released (4 hr 45 min, 5 hr, 5 hr 15 min, 5 hr 30 min). Repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed on log-transformed pharmacodynamic parameters using a model with treatment, time, and treatment-by-time as fixed effects, and participant as a random effect. Values below the lower limit of quantification were set to the quantification limit for summary.</description>

        <title>Cortisol Values During the Glucose Clamp Period</title>
        <description>Cortisol levels were measured at all stages of glycemia during the glucose clamp period. Epinephrine levels were measured at each clamped glucose concentration: 9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) (0 hour [hr], 1hr, 1 hr 15 minutes [min]), 5 mmol/L (1 hr 45 min, 2 hr), 4 mmol/L (2 hr 45 min, 3 hr), 3.3 mmol/L (3 hr 30 min, 3 hr 45 min), and 2.8 mmol/L (4 hr 15 min, 4 hr 30 min), and clamp released (4 hr 45 min, 5 hr, 5 hr 15 min, 5 hr 30 min). Repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed on log-transformed pharmacodynamic parameters using a model with treatment, time, and treatment-by-time as fixed effects, and participant as a random effect. Values below the lower limit of quantification were set to the quantification limit for summary.</description>

        <title>C-peptide Values During the Glucose Clamp Period</title>
        <description>C-peptide levels were measured at all stages of glycemia during the glucose clamp period. Epinephrine levels were measured at each clamped glucose concentration: 9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) (0 hour [hr], 1hr, 1 hr 15 minutes [min]), 5 mmol/L (1 hr 45 min, 2 hr), 4 mmol/L (2 hr 45 min, 3 hr), 3.3 mmol/L (3 hr 30 min, 3 hr 45 min), and 2.8 mmol/L (4 hr 15 min, 4 hr 30 min), and clamp released (4 hr 45 min, 5 hr, 5 hr 15 min, 5 hr 30 min). Repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed on log-transformed pharmacodynamic parameters using a model with treatment, time, and treatment-by-time as fixed effects, and participant as a random effect. Values below the lower limit of quantification were set to the quantification limit for summary.</description>

        <title>Average Albiglutide Concentration on the Day of the Clamp Procedure</title>
        <description>Plasma samples were taken from participants at two time points on Day 4 (at 0 hours and 4 hours and 45 minutes post-dose) of Week 1 of the study for albiglutide study drug level analyses. The average concentration for each participant was calculated as the mean of the concentrations at 0 hours and 4 hours 45 minutes. The clamp procedure is a glucose-controlled insulin infusion system. Variable infusions of glucose are administered to achieve various glucose target levels. It is a way of quantifying insulin secretion and resistance.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Any Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Event (SAE) and Treatment-emergent Non-serious Adverse Event (AE) During the Clamp Period</title>
        <description>Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as those with an onset on or after study drug administration. An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>
