  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a surgically implanted functional electrical
      stimulation (FES) system to facilitate stability of the trunk and hips. FES involves applying
      small electric currents to the nerves, which cause the muscles to contract. This study
      evaluates how stabilizing and stiffening the trunk with FES can change the way spinal cord
      injured volunteers sit, breathe, reach, push a wheelchair, or roll in bed.

      In a single surgical procedure electrodes will be inserted into muscles of the trunk and hip
      musculature. The electrode leads are connected to a stimulator/telemeter located in the
      abdomen. After a typical post-operative period of two to five days, neuroprosthesis
      recipients will be discharged to home for two to six weeks of restricted activity to promote
      healing of all surgical incisions. After a period of exercise and training, functional use of
      the neuroprosthesis will begin. Laboratory assessments of strength, balance, and functional
      abilities with and without the system, as well as the technical performance of the implanted
      components will be evaluated.

    <measure>Design a simple position controller</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The position controller will be developed to keep the trunk posture at a neutral seated position while allowing movement to lean forward, backward, or side-to-side. Testing will be carried out with an automated pull system applied to the trunk which pulls the body in various ways (side-to-side, forward, backward)</description>
