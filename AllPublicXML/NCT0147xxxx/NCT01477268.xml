  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depression is a very common health problem affecting older persons. The present
      standard of treatment is with medications called &quot;antidepressants&quot;. Antidepressants have been
      studied extensively in older persons with normal brain function and have been shown to be
      effective. However, certain types of brain dysfunction called &quot;executive impairment&quot;
      (inability to do higher order thinking) may lead to poor treatment outcomes. This study will
      compare how older depressed people with different levels of executive impairment respond
      differently to standard antidepressant treatment. Knowing this information will lead to more
      rational targeting of available treatments, leading to improved treatment outcomes.
