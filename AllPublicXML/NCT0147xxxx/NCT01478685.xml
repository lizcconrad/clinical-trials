      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and to define the Maximal Tolerated Dose
      (MTD) or the Maximal Administered Dose (MAD) of oral azacitidine as a single agent and in
      combination with carboplatin (CBDCA) or paclitaxel protein bound particles (ABI-007,ABX) in
      subjects with relapsed or refractory solid tumors.
