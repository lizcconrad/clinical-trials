    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to apply and adapt device specific body composition formulas to
      various ethnic groups. Bases are prediction equations that are generated in the clinical
      investigation &quot;Generation of prediction equation to analyze body composition of adults based
      on Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA)&quot;. The study bears the code BCA-01.

    <description>A D2O dose of 400 mg per kg body weight mixed with tap water is administered orally in the morning fasting and after a 2 hour fluid abstention. The distribution of the stable isotope in the TBW is completed after 4 hours. During this period, the subject remains fasting. Two venous blood samples of 10 ml whole blood are taken immediately before and four hours after taking D2O. The plasma samples are analyzed using Isoptopic Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS).</description>

    <description>Orally administered NaBr is resorbed quickly and completely and almost exclusively distributes in the extracellular compartment. Blood samples of 10 ml are taken immediately before and 4 hours after oral application of 50 mg NaBr per kg body weight.
