      Introduction: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a condition characterized by airflow
      limitation usually progressive and associated with inflammatory response of lung noxious
      particles. During a physical activity chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients may
      develop dynamic pulmonary hyperinflation, increased dyspnea perception and decreased activity
      performance. The investigators hypothesize that some specific activities of daily living
      induce dynamic pulmonary hyperinflation in COPD patients. Objective: To measure dynamic lung
      hyperinflation and its influence in dyspnea perception in moderate and severe chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease patients after activities of daily living. Methods: The
      investigators measured inspiratory capacity, dyspnea sensation, peripheral oxygen saturation,
      heart rate and respiratory rate in 19 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.
      These measurements were taken at rest and after daily living activities (such as going up and
      down a set of stairs, going up and down a ramp and sweeping and mopping a room).

        The investigators included 19 COPD patients (13 male) with moderate to very severe degree
        of airway obstruction, with a mean post bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in the
        first second (FEV1) of 48.7 ± 7.1% predicted and mean age of 64.1 ± 5.3.
