      Hypothesis 1: Exercise will decrease serum markers in a dose response manner.

      Hypothesis 2: Participants in the 60 minute intervention will have significantly higher
      physical activity levels than those in the 30 minute intervention at three months.

      Primary Aim: To conduct a dose response pilot trial of low (30 min/day) or high (60 min/day)
      dose exercise in men and women at increased risk of colon cancer. The major outcomes are
      changes in serum levels of four risk-related biomarkers: insulin, C-peptide, IL-6 and PGE-2.

      Secondary Aim. To compare changes in the secondary outcome of physical activity over three
      months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  aged 50 to 80

          -  no personal cancer history

          -  found to have an adenomatous polyp upon colonoscopy at BJH/WUSM in the previous six
             months

          -  no contraindications to beginning an exercise program

          -  no previous diagnosis of familial polyposis syndromes

          -  no previous diagnosis of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who are regular NSAID users will be excluded as this may interfere with
             the measurement of inflammatory marker outcomes. Regular use is defined as taking 80mg
             or more per day of aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen or other NSAID 5 or more days of the
             week.
