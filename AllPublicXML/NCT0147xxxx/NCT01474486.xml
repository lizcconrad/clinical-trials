  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to conduct a preliminary test of the feasibility of a
      multi-micronutrient intervention to improve micronutrient status, cardiac function and
      quality of life in Veterans with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF).

    <textblock>
      Veterans with stable CHF resulting from ischemic cardiomyopathy with systolic dysfunction and
      an ejection fraction ≤45% and who fit the criteria of stage B, C and D 2 heart failure will
      be recruited. This is a one group study with Veterans serving as their own control. They will
      receive 50 mg thiamin, vitamin B50 and 220 mg Zn as Zn sulfate daily for 6 months.
      Additionally, they will receive 50,000 IU Vitamin D as ergocalciferol each week for 8 weeks
      then every other week for 16 weeks. Pre (baseline) and post (6 months) cardiac function will
      be tested with echocardiogram and cardiac MR (when applicable), biochemical measures of
      thiamine, pyridoxine, zinc and Vitamin D will be measured at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and
      one year. Quality of life will be measured using the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure
      questionnaire baseline, month 3,6,and one year. Nutritional assessment including a nutrition
      focused physical examination and three days food records will also be measured at baseline,
      month 3, 6 and one year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  stable CHF (three months without an exacerbation or major change in medication regimen
             and cardiology provider determined medication regimen (angiotensin II receptor
             blockers (ARBs), aldosterone, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Beta
             blockers) has been maximized), Stage B, C or D CHF resulting from ischemic
             cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction ≤ 45% with or without a pacemaker or
             defibrillator . Potential participants who require further medication titration to
             attain maximal benefit, will need to wait 30 days after the provider has maximized the
             dose of medication to participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  recent (within the last three months) acute myocardial infarction, or unstable angina,
             pacemaker or defibrillator placed less than six months prior, or anticipated pacemaker
             or defibrillator placement in the next six months, or a bi ventricular pacemaker,
             corticosteroid use (&gt; 20 mg Prednisone use or its equivalent per day &gt; 2 weeks
             duration), isoniazid therapy, use of the study nutrition supplements at the study
             doses for the past month or longer,(if the participant has been taking a multivitamin
             or multivitamin with minerals , or other water soluble vitamins they will need to stop
             taking these for at least one month prior to initiating the study intervention),
             end-stage liver disease, end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis, receiving
             chemotherapy or radiation therapy, active alcohol/ substance abuse, pregnancy
             /lactation, women of childbearing potential who do not have medical documentation of
             surgically induced menopause, pancreatitis, any psychological issues like severe
             depression, claustrophobia, active problematic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
             or memory loss that prevents compliance with the supplement intake, agoraphobia which
             may interfere attendance at research visits or fear of needles which would limit their
             ability to have the blood tests completed, and any active eating disorders. Cardiac
             Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan will not be used to test cardiac function in
             participants with a pacemaker or defibrillator. Nor will it be used for potential
             subjects with ferro magnetic materials (i.e., penile stimulator), inability to lie
             flat for up to one hour, inability to hold their breath for up to 15 seconds or those
             with claustrophobia.
