  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systolic Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) is a large scale randomized trial of ~ 9250
      adults aged 50 years or older with high cardiovascular risk sponsored by NIH. The study is
      designed to recruit 45% of the study population with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). The trial
      will test the effects of low systolic blood pressure (SBP) goal of &lt; 120 mm Hg versus the
      standard goal of &lt; 140 mm Hg on the primary composite of cardiovascular events and death. One
      of the pre-specified secondary outcome is the progression of kidney disease. In this
      ancillary named SPRINT - Factors affecting Atherosclerosis STudy (FAST), the investigators
      plan to take advantage of the unique opportunities afforded by the parent study to examine
      issues that are of significant public health importance.

      This is an observational study in SPRINT participants. This study will examine
      mechanistically, the factors affecting the progression of atherosclerosis in CKD.

        Clinical characteristics of the SPRINT-FAST population will reflect those of the parent
        study. In this ancillary study, one non-CKD participant (control) will be recruited for
        each CKD participant (case). SPRINT CKD stratum will likely comprise of those with eGFR
        between 20-59 ml/min/1.73 m2.
