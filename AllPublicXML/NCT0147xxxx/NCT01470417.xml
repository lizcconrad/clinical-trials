    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the role of Gemcitabine and Abraxane in the treatment of resectable
      and borderline-resectable pancreatic cancer by giving the chemotherapy before surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This current study proposes to conduct a prospective non-randomized open-label phase II trial
      using Gemcitabine and Abraxane in the neoadjuvant treatment of resectable and
      borderline-resectable pancreatic cancer. For patients that are low-risk resectable (based on
      prediction rule) the plan is to administer 2 cycles of Gemcitabine and Abraxane followed by
      additional systemic therapy or chemotherapy with radiation therapy (chemoRT), followed by
      surgical resection. For patients who are either borderline-resectable or high-risk resectable
      (see schema), the plan is to administer 2 cycles of Gemcitabine and Abraxane followed by
      chemoradiotherapy concurrent with gemcitabine followed by surgical resection. For those
      without high-risk features, systemic chemotherapy alone will be administered. The primary
      endpoints will be R0 surgical resection rate, biochemical (CA 19-9), pathologic and
      radiologic response rates. Secondary endpoints will include progression-free survival (PFS),
      overall survival (OS), 30-day post-op mortality, toxicity, quality of life, pain control, and
      correlative molecular exploratory analysis involving pancreatic tumor and stromal SPARC
      expression levels. The investigators will also assess the patient, tumor, and clinical
      characteristics that may predict R0 resectability, thus further refining the predictive rule
      in high-risk patients as defined by Bao and colleagues. The investigators' hypothesis is that
      by using targeted and risk-adapted chemotherapy or chemoRT, improved R0 surgical resections
      can be achieved and effective systemic therapy delivered, which will translate to a
      significant improvement in overall survival in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma,
      compared to published historical controls.

    <description>Evaluate radiographic response of the measurable disease with repeat imaging at 4 - 8 weeks after therapy. Measurable disease was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. Per RECIST v1.1 in target lesions assessed by CT or MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD), &gt;20% growth in the sum of the longest diameter or target lesions or appearance of new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), change in sum of longest diameter of target lesions does not meet criteria for PR or PD. The number of subjects experiencing Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD) and Progressive Disease (PD) is reported.</description>
