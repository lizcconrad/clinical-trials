    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 1/2, open-label, single-arm study is to determine the safety and
      the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of VAL-083 in patients with recurrent malignant glioma.
      Pharmacokinetic (PK) properties will be explored and tumor responses to treatment will be
      evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent glial tumors of the brain continue to be one of the most challenging malignancies
      to treat. Median survival for patients with recurrent disease is approximately 6 months for
      glioblastoma multiforme. Bevacizumab is used for treatment of recurrent disease; however
      patients who fail bevacizumab do not have many treatment options.

      Metastases to the brain are the most common intracranial tumors in adults and occur ten times
      more frequently than primary brain tumors. It is estimated that 8 - 10% of cancer patients
      may develop symptomatic metastatic tumors in the brain. Systemic therapy is rarely used for
      primary treatment of brain metastases because many tumors that metastasize to the brain are
      not chemosensitive or have been already heavily pretreated with potentially effective agents,
      and poor penetration through the blood brain barrier is an additional concern.

      Dianhydrogalactitol (DAG) rapidly penetrates both the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the
      blood-brain barrier and accumulates in brain tissue. Clinical study of DAG in patients with
      GBM or with progressive secondary brain tumors is warranted. Patients with secondary brain
      metastases were allowed to enroll into the current protocol in Cohorts 2 and 3; however,
      enrollment ceased with Amendment 5 and will not be continued beyond Cohort 3.

      This study will utilize a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design, until the MTD or the maximum
      specified dose has been reached. In Phase 2, additional patients with GBM will be treated at
      the MTD (or other selected optimum Phase 2 dose) to measure tumor responses to treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.

          -  Histologically confirmed initial diagnosis of primary WHO Grade IV malignant glioma
             (glioblastoma), now recurrent; or Cohorts 2 and 3 only: progressive secondary brain
             tumor, has failed standard brain radiotherapy, and has brain tumor progression after
             at least one line of systemic therapy. Patients with progressive secondary brain
             tumors will not be enrolled under this protocol following the completion of Cohort 3.

          -  If GBM, previously treated for GBM with surgery and/or radiation, if appropriate, and
             must have failed both bevacizumab (Avastin) and temozolomide (Temodar), unless either
             or both are contraindicated.

          -  If GBM, greater than or equal to 12 weeks from radiotherapy, or 4 weeks if a new
