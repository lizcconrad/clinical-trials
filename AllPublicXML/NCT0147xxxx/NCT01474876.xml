  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 12-month postmarketing observational study (PMOS) was a prospective, single-arm,
      multicenter, multi-country study, with follow-up visits at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the
      initial baseline visit. The study was conducted to determine the long-term effectiveness of
      treatment with adalimumab in routine clinical use in participants with Ankylosing Spondylitis
      (AS) and Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) in Central and Eastern European Countries.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Additional study objectives were to evaluate AS and PsA with regard to extra-articular
      manifestations (EAMs), functional status, the use of concomitant nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory medication, and work productivity impairment. In addition, the Ankylosing
      Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS), a new disease activity index in AS, was measured
      in parallel with the standard Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)
      score to assess the effectiveness of adalimumab in treating axial symptoms.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 0) to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ASDAS tool is a self-administered questionnaire plus an objective laboratory evaluation. The questionnaire covers disease activity, back pain, and peripheral pain/swelling assessed on a visual analogue scale (from 0 (normal) to 10 (extreme pain or disability) cm) and duration of morning stiffness on a numerical rating scale (from 0 to 10, with 0 being none and 10 representing a duration of 2 hours or longer). The laboratory parameter is a measurement of C-reactive protein (mg/L) (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/h) (ESR). Data from five variables (disease activity, back pain, duration of morning stiffness, peripheral pain/swelling, and either CRP or ESR values) are combined to yield a score ranging from 0 to no defined upper limit. Remission is defined as ASDAS score &lt;1.3. Clinically important improvement is defined as a change ≥ 1.1 units, and major improvement is defined as a change ≥ 2.0 units.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 0) to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A mathematical technique called logistic regression was performed to identify factors that could be used to predict maintained treatment response and remission. The following baseline variables were used in the logistic regression analyses: age, gender, disease of interest, result of tuberculosis screening, time since diagnosis and extra-articular manifestations (symptoms and diseases that occur in parts of the body other than joints) at baseline. The BASDAI score at baseline was forced to serve as a predictor in each model.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score (in Case of Peripheral Symptoms) or Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) Score (in Case of Axial Symptoms) in Participants With Ankylosing Spondylitis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 0) to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI consists of 20 questions referring to 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, with a higher score representing a high-dependency disability. The minimal clinically important difference defined for the HAQ-DI is ≥0.22. HAQ-DI remission, indicating normal physical function, is defined as HAQ-DI &lt; 0.5. The BASFI is a set of 10 questions designed to determine the degree of functional limitation in those with AS. A visual analogue scale (with 0 being &quot;easy&quot; and 10 &quot;impossible&quot;) is used. The BASFI score ranges from 0 to 10 and is derived as the mean of the single items. A higher score indicates a higher impairment of functioning.</description>

        <description>The Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Score (ASDAS) tool is a self-administered questionnaire plus an objective laboratory evaluation. The questionnaire covers disease activity, back pain, duration of morning stiffness and peripheral pain/swelling assessed on a visual analogue scale (from 0 to 10 cm) or on a numerical rating scale (from 0 to 10). The laboratory parameter is a measurement of C-reactive protein (mg/L) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/h). Remission was defined as ASDAS &lt;1.3 at 12 months.</description>

          <title>Mean Change in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) Score (in Case of Axial Symptoms) and/or Disease Activity Score/28 Joints (DAS28) (in Case of Peripheral Symptoms) in Participants With Ankylosing Spondylitis</title>
          <description>The BASDAI score was calculated using a questionnaire with 6 questions that the participants completed by marking responses on a 10-centimeter visual analog scale ranging from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe) regarding severity of fatigue, spinal and peripheral joint pain, localized tenderness and morning stiffness. The final BASDAI score ranges from 0 to 10. A positive response was defined as a 50% or more decrease in the BASDAI score at 12 months as compared to baseline.
The DAS28 is a validated index of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Twenty-eight tender joint counts, 28 swollen joint counts, C- reactive protein, and general health are included in the DAS28 score. Scores on the DAS28 range from 0 to 10. A DAS28 score &gt;5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score &lt;3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score &lt;2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS)</title>
        <description>The ASDAS tool is a self-administered questionnaire plus an objective laboratory evaluation. The questionnaire covers disease activity, back pain, and peripheral pain/swelling assessed on a visual analogue scale (from 0 (normal) to 10 (extreme pain or disability) cm) and duration of morning stiffness on a numerical rating scale (from 0 to 10, with 0 being none and 10 representing a duration of 2 hours or longer). The laboratory parameter is a measurement of C-reactive protein (mg/L) (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/h) (ESR). Data from five variables (disease activity, back pain, duration of morning stiffness, peripheral pain/swelling, and either CRP or ESR values) are combined to yield a score ranging from 0 to no defined upper limit. Remission is defined as ASDAS score &lt;1.3. Clinically important improvement is defined as a change ≥ 1.1 units, and major improvement is defined as a change ≥ 2.0 units.</description>

        <title>Predictors of Maintained Treatment Response and Remission in Participants With Ankylosing Spondylitis</title>
        <description>A mathematical technique called logistic regression was performed to identify factors that could be used to predict maintained treatment response and remission. The following baseline variables were used in the logistic regression analyses: age, gender, disease of interest, result of tuberculosis screening, time since diagnosis and extra-articular manifestations (symptoms and diseases that occur in parts of the body other than joints) at baseline. The BASDAI score at baseline was forced to serve as a predictor in each model.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score (in Case of Peripheral Symptoms) or Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) Score (in Case of Axial Symptoms) in Participants With Ankylosing Spondylitis</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI consists of 20 questions referring to 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, with a higher score representing a high-dependency disability. The minimal clinically important difference defined for the HAQ-DI is ≥0.22. HAQ-DI remission, indicating normal physical function, is defined as HAQ-DI &lt; 0.5. The BASFI is a set of 10 questions designed to determine the degree of functional limitation in those with AS. A visual analogue scale (with 0 being &quot;easy&quot; and 10 &quot;impossible&quot;) is used. The BASFI score ranges from 0 to 10 and is derived as the mean of the single items. A higher score indicates a higher impairment of functioning.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) Score (in Case of Axial Symptoms) and/or Disease Activity Score/28 Joints (DAS28) (in Case of Peripheral Symptoms) in Participants With Psoriatic Arthritis</title>
        <description>The BASDAI score was calculated using a questionnaire with 6 questions that the participants completed by marking responses on a 10-centimeter visual analog scale ranging from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe) regarding severity of fatigue, spinal and peripheral joint pain, localized tenderness and morning stiffness. The final BASDAI score ranges from 0 to 10. A positive response was defined as a 50% or more decrease in the BASDAI score at 12 months as compared to baseline.
The DAS28 is a validated index of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Twenty-eight tender joint counts, 28 swollen joint counts, C- reactive protein, and general health are included in the DAS28 score. Scores on the DAS28 range from 0 to 10. A DAS28 score &gt;5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score &lt;3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score &lt;2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

        <title>Correlation Between Change in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) in Participants With Psoriatic Arthritis</title>
        <description>BASDAI score (ranging from 0 to 10) was calculated using a questionnaire. Participants marked responses on a 10 cm visual analog scale ranging from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe) regarding fatigue, spinal and peripheral joint pain, localized tenderness and morning stiffness. A positive response was defined as a 50% or more decrease in the BASDAI score at 12 months as compared to baseline. ASDAS score consists of a self-administered questionnaire plus an objective laboratory evaluation. The questionnaire covers disease activity, back pain, duration of morning stiffness and peripheral pain/swelling assessed on a visual analogue scale (from 0 to 10 cm) or on a numerical rating scale (from 0 to 10). The laboratory parameter is a measurement of C-reactive protein (mg/L) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/h). Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (CC) was calculated for BASDAI vs. ASDAS(subscript)CRP(subscript) and BASDAI vs. ASDAS(subscript)ESR(subscript).</description>

        <description>A mathematical technique called logistic regression was performed to identify factors that could be used to predict maintained treatment response and remission. The following baseline variables were used in the logistic regression analyses: age, gender, disease of interest, result of tuberculosis screening, time since diagnosis and extra-articular manifestations (symptoms and diseases that occur in parts of the body other than joints) at baseline. The BASDAI score at baseline was forced to serve as a predictor in each model.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index ( HAQ-DI) Score (in Case of Peripheral Symptoms) or Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) Score (in Case of Axial Symptoms) in Participants With Psoriatic Arthritis</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI consists of 20 questions referring to 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, with a higher score representing a high-dependency disability. The minimal clinically important difference defined for the HAQ-DI is ≥0.22. HAQ-DI remission, indicating normal physical function, is defined as HAQ-DI &lt; 0.5. The BASFI is a set of 10 questions designed to determine the degree of functional limitation in those with AS. A visual analogue scale (with 0 being &quot;easy&quot; and 10 &quot;impossible&quot;) is used. The BASFI score ranges from 0 to 10 and is derived as the mean of the single items. A higher score indicates a higher impairment of functioning.</description>
