  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) will test the efficacy of a home blood glucose
      telemonitoring system against usual care in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) during pregnancy. We hypothesize that the system can improve
      glycemic control in patients, assessed using the mean blood glucose during gestation as the
      primary outcome measure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Establishing good glycemic control is crucial for the treatment of patients with gestational
      diabetes mellitus (GDM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). High levels of blood glucose in
      pregnancy may lead to complications during delivery and pose threat to the fetus. The
      self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) by patients at home is used to provide clinicians
      with information to make adjustments to treatment plans. Patients record the values and
      present them at their next meeting with the physician. As such, SMBG by the patients is an
      important part of disease management and a method for clinicians to follow a patient's
      day-to-day response to a treatment regime.

      The system is designed to send the blood glucose values from the patients' glucometers
      wirelessly to the server where they can be viewed by the patients' health care providers. The
      system generates automated adherence reminders to patients and alert messages to both
      patients and their care providers. The system will provide clinicians with better access to
      the patient data, so that they may better manage their case loads, make timely clinical
      decisions, and ultimately provide better patient care.

    <description>The system is designed to send the measured blood glucose values directly to a hospital server. Values recorded by the glucometer are sent to the Blackberry速 cell phone. A special removable Bluetooth速 adapter unit is required for data transmission from the glucometer to the Blackberry速. The patient must then select on the Blackberry速 the meal period the last measurement corresponds. The cellular phone serves as the platform for data-transmission to the central server. The threshold number of readings can be set for each patient individually through the web-interface. The system can be accessed by both the patients and the care providers through a secure web-interface.
Apart from collecting values the system generates automated adherence reminders to patients and high/low blood glucose alert messages to both patients and their care providers.</description>
