    <measure>Average Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) Pain Based on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Over the Last 7 Days of Each Treatment Period (Week 6 of Each Treatment Period)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Period (includes both Visits 6 and 11)</time_frame>
    <description>The daily pain diary consisted of an 11-point numeric scale ranging from 0 (&quot;no pain&quot;) to 10 (&quot;worst possible pain&quot;). Participants described their pain during the past 24 hours by having chosen the appropriate number between 0 and 10. Self-assessment was performed daily each evening before bedtime (6.00 pm to midnight) on the telephone via Interactive Voice Recognition System (IVRS). The endpoint mean pain score was defined as the mean of the last 7 daily diary pain ratings while taking study medication in each treatment period - Period 1 and Period 2, respectively. A rating of 1 - 3 was considered as mild pain; 4 - 6 as moderate pain; and 7 - 10 as severe pain.</description>

    <time_frame>End of Period (includes both Visits 6 and 11)</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire developed to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions during a 24 hour period prior to evaluation. The BPI-sf consists of 5 questions: 4 items measure pain (0: no pain; 10: worst pain possible) at its &quot;worst, &quot;least&quot;, &quot;average&quot;, and &quot;now&quot; (current pain) on an 11-point scale. Scores range from 0 - 40 with higher scores indicating greater pain severity. Another item, containing 7 sub-questions, evaluates the level of interference of pain on daily functioning (general activity, walking, work ability, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with other people, and sleep) on 11-point scales (0: does not interfere; 10: completely interferes). Scores range from 0 - 70 with higher scores indicating greater interference.</description>

    <time_frame>End of Period (includes both Visits 6 and 11)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D describes participant`s health status based on 5 attributes producing an 5 digit index score. The 5 dimensions are: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain / discomfort, and anxiety / depression. Dolan 1997 advised how to transfer this index score to a single score for clinical trials, a revised single index was published in 2001. The index uses general population weighted estimates for various health states. In general, the range of the single index tends to vary between 0 = death and 1 = perfect health and there are some states that have been rated by the general population to be worse than death which may result in numbers below 0.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>411 participants were screened, of whom 206 were withdrawn before randomization. 205 were randomized, of whom 2 discontinued before being treated. Participants were randomized at 36 centers in 4 countries: US (25), Sweden (4), South Africa (4), and Czech Republic (3). 11 centers received study drug but did not randomize participants.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants completed daily pain and sleep diary from Visit 1 (V1; Screening) to Visit 12 (V12; Follow-up). Participants with a mean pain score ≥ 4 (moderate to severe pain) and those meeting the pain on walking criteria (post-walk pain score ≥ 4, and &gt; the pre-walk pain score at V1 and Visit 2 [V2; Baseline]) were randomized.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Pregabalin/Placebo</title>
          <description>Participants were randomized to double-blind treatment with pregabalin for 6 weeks (2 week dose titration [starting dose: 150 mg/day] and 4 weeks fixed dose [150 - 300 mg/day]) in period 1 followed by placebo in period 2. There was a 2-week single-blind washout (blinded to participant) between the treatment periods. A 1-week taper was administered at the end of the second treatment period, followed by a final follow-up visit.</description>

        <title>Average Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) Pain Based on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Over the Last 7 Days of Each Treatment Period (Week 6 of Each Treatment Period)</title>
        <description>The daily pain diary consisted of an 11-point numeric scale ranging from 0 (“no pain”) to 10 (“worst possible pain”). Participants described their pain during the past 24 hours by having chosen the appropriate number between 0 and 10. Self-assessment was performed daily each evening before bedtime (6.00 pm to midnight) on the telephone via Interactive Voice Recognition System (IVRS). The endpoint mean pain score was defined as the mean of the last 7 daily diary pain ratings while taking study medication in each treatment period - Period 1 and Period 2, respectively. A rating of 1 - 3 was considered as mild pain; 4 - 6 as moderate pain; and 7 - 10 as severe pain.</description>

        <population>All participants who were randomized, treated (ie, received at least one dose of study medication) and had at least one post-randomization efficacy evaluation were included in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) analysis (N: 203). This was the primary analysis set.</population>

This crossover study consisted of two double blind 6-week treatment periods where participants were randomized to pregabalin or placebo for the first period, and were then switched to the other treatment for the second period (2 weeks dose titration and 4 weeks fixed dose for each treatment period). There was a 2-week single-blind washout (blinded to participant) between the treatment periods.

        <title>Average Weekly DPN Pain Based on a NRS (Baseline, 6 Weeks in Period 1, 2 Weeks Washout and 6 Weeks in Period 2)</title>
        <description>The daily pain diary consisted of an 11-point numeric scale ranging from 0 (“no pain”) to 10 (“worst possible pain”). Participants described their pain during the past 24 hours by having chosen the appropriate number between 0 and 10. Self-assessment was performed daily each evening before bedtime (6.00 pm to midnight) on the telephone via IVRS. The longitudinal mean weekly DPN pain scores were defined as the mean of 7 daily diary pain ratings. A rating of 1 - 3 was considered as mild pain; 4 - 6 as moderate pain; and 7 - 10 as severe pain.</description>

        <description>The post-test DPN pain on walking NRS consisted of an 11-point numeric scale ranging from 0 (“no pain”) to 10 (“worst possible pain”). Participants described their DPN pain in their legs and/or feet while walking during the 50-foot walk test by choosing the appropriate number between 0 and 10. The post-test DPN pain on walking NRS was completed by the participant using paper-pen administration immediately after completing the 50-foot walk test at the end of each treatment period - Period 1 and Period 2, respectively. A rating of 1 - 3 was considered as mild pain; 4 - 6 as moderate pain; and 7 - 10 as severe pain.</description>

Self-assessment was performed daily each evening before bedtime (6.00 pm to midnight) on the telephone via IVRS. The endpoint mean pain score was defined as the mean of the last 7 daily diary pain ratings while taking study medication in each treatment period - Period 1 and Period 2, respectively. A rating of 1 - 3 was considered as mild pain; 4 - 6 as moderate pain; and 7 - 10 as severe pain.</description>

        <description>The BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire developed to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions during a 24 hour period prior to evaluation. The BPI-sf consists of 5 questions: 4 items measure pain (0: no pain; 10: worst pain possible) at its “worst, “least”, “average”, and “now” (current pain) on an 11-point scale. Scores range from 0 - 40 with higher scores indicating greater pain severity. Another item, containing 7 sub-questions, evaluates the level of interference of pain on daily functioning (general activity, walking, work ability, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with other people, and sleep) on 11-point scales (0: does not interfere; 10: completely interferes). Scores range from 0 - 70 with higher scores indicating greater interference.</description>

Scores range from 0 - 70 with higher scores indicating greater interference. The sub-score pain interference with walking ability was evaluated, as it was considered to be the most relevant in the context of this study.</description>

        <title>Daytime Total Activity Counts Per Day Measured by Actigraphy Over the Last 7 Days of Each Treatment Period (Week 6 of Each Treatment Period)</title>
        <description>Actigraphy data which measured steps and daytime activity during waking hours were assessed for the last 7 days at Baseline, Visit 6, and Visit 11. Activity counts are the units of motion. It is equal to the sum of peak accelerations each second during the epoch (60 seconds). Total activity counts per day is the sum of the activity counts for each epoch (60 seconds) during the &quot;day&quot; (non-sleep period). Actigraphy was performed with an accelerometer that was worn on the hip during the waking hours. It was programmed to record movements while the device was being worn.</description>

        <title>Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QOL-DN) Total Quality of Life (TQOL) Score Measured Over the Last 2 Weeks of Each Treatment Period (Week 6 of Each Treatment Period)</title>
        <description>Norfolk QOL-DN is a 35-item participant-rated questionnaire used to assess impact of diabetic neuropathy on the quality of life of participants with diabetic neuropathy. All symptoms (1 - 7) are scored as either 1 or 0, indicating presence or absence of the symptom. With the exception of questions 31 and 32, the other items are scored according to the 5-point Likert Scale (0 - 4, “no problem” to “severe problem”). In question 31, “good”, the middle item, is scored as 0, “very good” as –1, “excellent” as –2, “fair” as 1, and “poor” as 2. In question 32, “about the same”, the middle item, is scored as 0, &quot;somewhat better&quot; as –1, &quot;much better&quot; as -2, &quot;somewhat worse&quot; as 1, and &quot;much worse&quot; as 2.

          <title>Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QOL-DN) Total Quality of Life (TQOL) Score Measured Over the Last 2 Weeks of Each Treatment Period (Week 6 of Each Treatment Period)</title>
          <description>Norfolk QOL-DN is a 35-item participant-rated questionnaire used to assess impact of diabetic neuropathy on the quality of life of participants with diabetic neuropathy. All symptoms (1 - 7) are scored as either 1 or 0, indicating presence or absence of the symptom. With the exception of questions 31 and 32, the other items are scored according to the 5-point Likert Scale (0 - 4, “no problem” to “severe problem”). In question 31, “good”, the middle item, is scored as 0, “very good” as –1, “excellent” as –2, “fair” as 1, and “poor” as 2. In question 32, “about the same”, the middle item, is scored as 0, &quot;somewhat better&quot; as –1, &quot;much better&quot; as -2, &quot;somewhat worse&quot; as 1, and &quot;much worse&quot; as 2. TQOL score should be summed as follow: sum (Σ) (1 - 7, 8 - 35).

          <title>Norfolk QOL-DN Physical Functioning / Large Fiber Domain Score Measured Over the Last 2 Weeks of Each Treatment Period (Week 6 of Each Treatment Period)</title>
          <description>Norfolk QOL-DN is a 35-item participant-rated questionnaire used to assess impact of diabetic neuropathy on the quality of life of participants with diabetic neuropathy. All symptoms (1 - 7) are scored as either 1 or 0, indicating presence or absence of the symptom. With the exception of questions 31 and 32, the other items are scored according to the 5-point Likert Scale (0 - 4, “no problem” to “severe problem”). In question 31, “good”, the middle item, is scored as 0, “very good” as –1, “excellent” as –2, “fair” as 1, and “poor” as 2. In question 32, “about the same”, the middle item, is scored as 0, &quot;somewhat better&quot; as –1, &quot;much better&quot; as -2, &quot;somewhat worse&quot; as 1, and &quot;much worse&quot; as 2. The physical functioning / large fiber domain score should be summed as follow: Σ(8, 11, 13 - 15, 24, 27 - 35). The scales and subscales are calculated without weighting of any kind, and reported as the integer sum of the listed questionnaire items.</description>
          <population>All participants who were randomized, treated (ie, received at least one dose of study medication) and had at least one post-randomization efficacy evaluation were included in the ITT analysis (N: 203). This was the primary analysis set.</population>

        <title>Mean Sleep Interference Rating Score at the End of Each Treatment Period (Week 6 of Each Treatment Period)</title>
        <description>The daily sleep diary consists of an 11-point numeric rating scale with which the participant rates how painful DPN pain has interfered with their sleep during the past 24 hours. Zero indicates “does not interfere with sleep” and 10 indicates “completely interferes (unable to sleep due to pain)”. Self-assessment was performed daily in the evening before bedtime on a telephone via IVRS (time window for completion between 6.00 pm to midnight) after completion of the daily pain diary.</description>

        <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a 14-item self-administered questionnaire that consists of 2 scales, one measuring anxiety (HADS-A), and the other measuring depression (HADS-D). Each subscale consists of 7 statements and the participant responds as to how each item applies to him/her over the past week on 4-point response scale. Separate scores are calculated for anxiety and depression and a score (ranging from 0 to 21) is obtained for each subscale. The higher the score, the more severe the anxiety or depression.</description>

This crossover study consisted of two double blind 6-week treatment periods where participants were randomized to pregabalin or placebo for the first period, and were then switched to the other treatment for the second period (2 weeks dose titration and 4 weeks fixed dose for each treatment period). There was a 2-week single-blind washout (blinded to participant) between the treatment periods.

          <title>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - Depression (HADS-D) Total Score at the End of Each Treatment Period (Week 6 of Each Treatment Period)</title>
          <description>The HADS is a 14-item self-administered questionnaire that consists of 2 scales, one measuring anxiety (HADS-A), and the other measuring depression (HADS-D). Each subscale consists of 7 statements and the participant responds as to how each item applies to him/her over the past week on 4-point response scale. Separate scores are calculated for anxiety and depression and a score (ranging from 0 to 21) is obtained for each subscale. The higher the score, the more severe the anxiety or depression.</description>
          <population>All participants who were randomized, treated (ie, received at least one dose of study medication) and had at least one post-randomization efficacy evaluation were included in the ITT analysis (N: 203). This was the primary analysis set.</population>

        <title>Euro QoL-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) - Health State Profile Utility Scores at the End of Each Treatment Period (Week 6 of Each Treatment Period)</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D describes participant`s health status based on 5 attributes producing an 5 digit index score. The 5 dimensions are: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain / discomfort, and anxiety / depression. Dolan 1997 advised how to transfer this index score to a single score for clinical trials, a revised single index was published in 2001. The index uses general population weighted estimates for various health states. In general, the range of the single index tends to vary between 0 = death and 1 = perfect health and there are some states that have been rated by the general population to be worse than death which may result in numbers below 0.</description>
