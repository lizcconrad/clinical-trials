  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) prior to the onset of anti-tumor
      necrosis factor therapy, as well as a watchful monitoring during the treatment, is strongly
      recommended. Tuberculin skin test (TST), universally used for this purpose, lacks sensitivity
      and specificity. The novel screening tools, including QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT),
      have shown a higher specificity compared to TST, but their feasibility in the setting of
      immunosuppression remains unclear. Aims of this study were to investigate the performance of
      QFT-GIT and its agreement with TST in patients awaiting anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
      therapy, and to evaluate the usefulness of serial QFT-GIT during the treatment with biologics
      to assess whether dynamic changes in interferon (IFN)-gamma levels may be helpful in
      identifying reactivation of LTBI or cases of newly acquired tuberculosis.
