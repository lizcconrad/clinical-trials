  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      200 consecutive patients presenting with STEMI within 12 hours from the onset of symptoms and
      having a high thrombotic burden at coronary angiography, defined as the presence of a
      thrombus size ≥ 2 times the diameter of the vessel, according to a visual estimate. The main
      objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of thrombectomy (either rheolytic or
      manual aspiration) as an adjunct to primary or rescue angioplasty, in patients with
      angiographic evidence high thrombotic burden in the culprit artery. Primary end points: (1)
      rate of complete ST-segment elevation resolution at 60 minutes after the end of the
      procedure; (2) infarct size as assessed by delayed-enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance
      imaging (DE-MRI) at 3 months after the index procedure.

      Secondary endpoints: post-procedural TIMI flow grade; post-procedural MBG; infarct
      transmurality at 3 months; MVO at 3 months; 1-year actuarial freedom from MACEs.
