    <measure>Change From Baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ACQ consists of 7 questions assessing symptoms, rescue medication use and lung function. Except for lung function (FEV1), each question was scored on a 7-point scale where 0 = no impairment and 6 = maximum impairment. Scores ranged between 0 totally controlled to 6 (severely uncontrolled). Participants with a score below 1.0 are considered to have adequately controlled asthma. Participants with a score above 1.0 were considered not to be well controlled. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change in Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 was assessed using central spirometry according to the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) guidelines.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The AQLQ is a 32-item disease specific questionnaire designed to measure functional impairments that are most important to patients with asthma. It consists of 4 domains: symptoms, emotions., exposure to environmental stimuli and activity limitation.
Patients were asked to recall their experiences during the previous 2 weeks and to score each item on a 7-point scale. The scale ranges from 1 to 7. The overall AQLQ score was the mean response to all 32 questions. Higher scores represent better outcomes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Morning and Evening Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Morning and evening PEFs were recorded on an electronic diary (e-diary). PEF was assessed twice daily approximately 12 hours apart and the measurements were recorded in the e-diary.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Maximum Expiratory Flow</measure>

        <description>The ACQ consists of 7 questions assessing symptoms, rescue medication use and lung function. Except for lung function (FEV1), each question was scored on a 7-point scale where 0 = no impairment and 6 = maximum impairment. Scores ranged between 0 totally controlled to 6 (severely uncontrolled). Participants with a score below 1.0 are considered to have adequately controlled asthma. Participants with a score above 1.0 were considered not to be well controlled. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The AQLQ is a 32-item disease specific questionnaire designed to measure functional impairments that are most important to patients with asthma. It consists of 4 domains: symptoms, emotions., exposure to environmental stimuli and activity limitation.
Patients were asked to recall their experiences during the previous 2 weeks and to score each item on a 7-point scale. The scale ranges from 1 to 7. The overall AQLQ score was the mean response to all 32 questions. Higher scores represent better outcomes.</description>
