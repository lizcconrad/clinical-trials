  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use of some protease inhibitors is associated with elevations of a blood pigment called
      bilirubin. This may occasionally lead to yellowing of the eyes (scleral icterus) or jaundice,
      but in the general population bilirubin elevations have been shown to have antioxidant and
      anti-inflammatory properties that could be associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular or
      other disease events.

      Inflammation may also be relevant to neurocognitive impairment in HIV (Human Immunodeficiency
      Virus) infection hence elevations of bilirubin may also be protective against neurocognitive
      impairment.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of hyperbilirubinemia (HBR) on risk of
      heart and renal diseases, and cognitive function.

      Use of some protease inhibitors is associated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia as a
      result of inhibition of the UGT1A1 enzyme.

      Elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin are best characterized among individuals with
      Gilbert syndrome, which is the most common inherited cause of unconjugated
      hyperbilirubinemia, present in 3-10% of the general population. Gilbert syndrome arises
      through variants in the UGT1A1 enzyme, thus these PIs induce a biochemical picture similar to
      Gilbert syndrome. Although elevations of bilirubin may occasionally lead to scleral icterus
      or jaundice, cohort studies of individuals with Gilbert syndrome indicate bilirubin
      elevations may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and are associated with
      reduced risk of cardiovascular events.

      Inflammation may also be relevant to cardiovascular (CV) risk, neurocognitive impairment and
      renal disease in HIV infection. This study seeks to investigate any association between
      antiretroviral associated HBR and CV risk markers, neurocognitive impairment and renal
      dysfunction
