  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A diet rich in leafy green vegetables has been shown to reduce the risk of developing chronic
      metabolic disease. The health benefits from these particular vegetables may be attributed to
      their high nitrate content. Recent work suggests that dietary nitrate triggers endogenous
      nitric oxide release, thereby stimulating vasodilation and improving muscle perfusion in an
      insulin-independent manner. We hypothesize that in an insulin-resistant state, nitrate
      co-ingestion will increase muscle perfusion, thereby improving post-prandial delivery of
      nutrients to skeletal muscle tissue. Specifically, a more efficient delivery of food derived
      amino acids will stimulate post-prandial muscle protein synthesis and, as such, compensate
      for a blunted muscle protein synthetic response to food intake in the elderly. This proposal
      will investigate the efficacy of nitrate co-ingestion as a means to augment muscle protein
      synthesis in elderly, type 2 diabetes patients and may lead to a novel therapy in the
      clinical care of type 2 diabetes patients.

    <description>Blood sampling will occur through a catheter placed in an anticubital vein every 30 minutes throughout the test day. We will be using this plasma to measure plasma amino acids to determine the enrichment of labeled amino acids from both the IV tracer and the intrinsically-labeled casein protein. We wish to track the changes in amino acids from the intrinsically-labeled casein protein.</description>
