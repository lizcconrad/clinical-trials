      1. To establish a BMD reference database of Beijing's urban population, China.

        2. To determine the prevalences and risk factors of osteoporosis and osteopenia in
           Beijing's urban population, China.

        3. To describe the 25OHD level and estimate the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and
           deficiency of Beijing's urban population, China.

        4. Estimation of the prevalence of osteoporotic fracture (vertebral) in over age of 60 of
           Beijing's urban population, China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With one of the biggest populations in the world, China was heavily suffered from
      osteoporosis. The prevalence of osteoporosis in China even is increasing fast in recent
      years, which are especially notable in urban population. This change maybe due to the
      conditions including rapid economic growth, increase in life expectancy, and changes in
      lifestyle. Studies in 1998 including 13 separately small samples (no more than 1000 people)
      from 9 provinces in China showed that the prevalence of osteoporosis and osteopenia were
      5.3-6.2% and 5.8-11.2%, respectively. These estimates were higher by approximately 1% than
      those reported in 1995. In 2002, according to DEXA results in connection with population
      census in 2000, Xiaoguang Cheng et al. took a survey in 600 people who were separately
      studied in previously 10 research projects and find that patients with osteoporosis account
      for approximately 6.97% of the total China population.

      Although these studies have documented a remarkable increase in the prevalence of
      osteoporosis in China, these estimations were all based on small samples. No risk factors
      related with osteoporosis and osteopenia, esp. hypovitaminosis D on osteoporosis and
      osteopenia, have been analyzed yet. So it is impossible to make any forecast of osteoporosis
      or give any instruction for intervention.

      Thus this study designed to provide current and reliable data on the prevalence of
      osteoporosis and osteopenia and associated risk factors correlation coefficients in the
      Beijing's urban adult population.
