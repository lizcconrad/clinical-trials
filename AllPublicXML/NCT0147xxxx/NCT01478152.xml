      In this single center, dose finding, safety study the effect of inhaled Ectoin® inhalation
      solution will be investigated in subjects with mild bronchial asthma. This dose-finding study
      will estimate the minimum effective dose and will assess the safe dosage, in terms of the
      quantity given to patients. The results will be compared to baseline measurements. The
      results regarding Sputum measurements will be compared to measurements after placebo
      administration.

      Based on the anti-inflammatory effects of inhaled Ectoin® shown in previous animal studies,
      this trial aims to investigate the effects in terms of a reduction of the unspecific
      bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to Methacholine challenge test on subjects with mild
      bronchial asthma. In addition, measurements of exhaled nitric oxide level as an indicator of
      bronchial inflammation will be investigated.

      This study will focus primarily on safety and dose finding in 12 to 18 subjects with mild
      bronchial asthma.

      After a screening visit, subjects will be treated with placebo, followed by increasing doses
      of Ectoin® (low, medium and high dose). All doses of Ectoin® inhalation solution and placebo
      will be administered for 5 - 7 days.

    <description>After baseline visit subjects will receive 0.9% saline inhalation solution for placebo. Patients will be instructed to inhale once daily with the AKITA2® APIXNEB® inhalation system for 5 - 7 days.
The treatment phase with low dose of Ectoin® will follow subsequently without any washout phase. This treatment phase will be repeated for medium and a high Ectoin® dose. All doses of Ectoin® inhalation solution will be administered for 5 - 7 days without any washout phase. Sputum inductions will be conducted on the last but one day of placebo treatment phase and on the last but one day of treatment phase with the highest Ectoin® dose.</description>

All doses of Ectoin® inhalation solution will be administered for 5 - 7 days without any washout phase. To minimize circadian variations Methacholine challenge tests will be performed always at the approximately same time. Sputum inductions will be conducted on the last but one day of placebo treatment phase and on the last but one day of treatment phase with the highest Ectoin® dose.</description>
