  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the effects of cancer treatment on the brain.
      Some cancer patients report changes in their memory or thinking after treatment. These
      changes could be a result of changes in brain structure, such as a change in size or
      thickness of different parts of the brain. The investigators will look to see if these
      changes in brain structure happen through the results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
      The investigators will do this by looking at the brain structure of lung cancer patients who
      have surgery and chemotherapy versus those who have surgery only.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients between the ages of 18 and 80 years old

          -  As per self report and/or medical record female patients are either postmenopausal or
             not able to become pregnant

          -  Patients with biopsy proven or suspected non-small cell lung cancer planned to undergo
             induction chemotherapy and surgery, OR with biopsy proven or suspected non-small cell
             lung cancer planned to undergo immediate surgical resection

          -  No clinical/neurological symptoms suggestive of brain metastases by attending's
             judgment as documented in the medical record and/or correspondence with the research
             team

          -  In the judgement of the consenting professional, patient is able to understand
             English, through verbal and written communication

          -  Patient is able to undergo MRI scanning (verified with pre-MRI Safety Screening form
             (Appendix A) used in MSKCC MRI Centers) completed at screening and again prior to
             having the MRI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with history of significant neurological diagnoses including stroke, tumor,
             dementia, epilepsy, or multiple sclerosis as indicated by medical records and/or self
             report

          -  History of head injury with evidence of brain injury or loss of consciousness for &gt; 60
             minutes as per EMR or self-report

          -  No prior treatment with chemotherapy

          -  Participant has dentures, body jewelry or wig that they are unable to remove as per
             self-report

          -  Patient reports that he/she cannot undergo MRI scanning without significant distress
             or discomfort

          -  Significant psychiatric or cognitive disturbance sufficient, in the investigator's
             judgment, to preclude providing informed consent or participating in the study (i.e.,
             schizophrenia).
