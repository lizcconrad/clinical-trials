      The current standard of care for bile duct stone are endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone
      extraction. Placement of plastic stents is an option for incomplete biliary stone clearance.
      This study will use the CSEMS in patients with complex biliary stones who failed stone
      extraction as they have the advantage of large stent diameter. CSEMS may offer a temporizing
      measure that allows more successful subsequent stone clearance. However, their use in benign
      condition has been limited especially for biliary stone removal. The purpose of this study is
      to determine the feasibility, safety, easy removability, stent-stone formation rate, and
      migration rate of CSEMS for complex biliary stones.
