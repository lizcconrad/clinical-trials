  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how well the current drug regimen (including low
      Prograf dose and Myfortic, which is usually recommended to prevent any further deterioration
      in the kidney function) works and how safe it is when compared to a combination of Zortress
      and Myfortic in patients with chronic kidney injury associated with Prograf or Neoral use.

      Specific Aim 1: To investigate allograft and peripheral blood cell gene expression patterns
      of patients with CAI by using Affymetrix microarrays.

      Hypothesis 1: Gene expression patterns of patients with biopsy findings suggesting
      calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) toxicity without significant tubulointerstitial infiltrates or
      transplant glomerulopathy might demonstrate upregulation of genes related to tissue injury,
      fibrosis, and extracellular matrix deposition without upregulation of genes related to
      alloimmune response, such as, T and/or B lymphocyte activation markers, surface receptors,
      co-stimulation molecules, adhesion molecules, cytokines, and chemokines comparing to patients
      with significant tubulointerstitial infiltrates and/or transplant glomerulopathy that might
      show upregulation of genes related to alloimmune response, such as, T and/or B lymphocyte
      activation markers, surface receptors, co-stimulation molecules, adhesion molecules,
      cytokines, and chemokines.

      Specific Aim 2: The effect of everolimus (Zortress)/ mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS, myfortic®)
      treatment on allograft and peripheral gene expression patterns.

      Hypothesis 2: Everolimus (Zortress) and mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS, myfortic®) treatment
      attenuates the progression of CAI due to CNI toxicity by downregulating the expression of
      genes related to fibrosis, such as, transforming growth factor-β, thrombospondin 1, and
      platelet derived growth factor-C.

      Specific Aim 3: To document the clinical outcomes of everolimus (Zortress) and mycophenolate
      sodium (EC-MPS, myfortic®) in patients with CAI due to CNI toxicity Hypothesis 3: Everolimus
      (Zortress) and mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS, myfortic®) can attenuate the progression of CAI
      due to CNI toxicity and may improve the creatinine clearance.

    <description>Patients will be evaluated in terms of acute rejection episodes, graft loss, death, infection episodes, malignancies and graft function at each clinic visit.
Study will be terminated in these circumstances:
Acute rejection rate &gt; 30%
Serious infection rate &gt; 50%
&gt; 50% progression of kidney dysfunction in one third of patients by eGFR</description>
