  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Having an operation places an enormous burden on the body, leading to the development of
      inflammation and so called 'insulin resistance'. Insulin resistance means the body is unable
      to respond to important hormones that control use of energy. Recent studies have shown that
      patients who develop 'higher' insulin resistance and inflammation have more serious
      complications and take longer to recover after surgery. The investigators do not know what
      controls the development of insulin resistance and inflammation after surgery. Similarly, the
      investigators do not know why certain patients develop much more insulin resistance and
      inflammation than others, even though they have the same operation.

      The main purpose of the study is to try to find out which patients are prone to developing
      greater 'amounts' of insulin resistance and inflammation. The investigators also want to find
      out whether the investigators can reduce the 'amount' of insulin resistance and inflammation
      in these patients (for example by giving them carbohydrate [sugar-based] drinks before
      surgery - these have been shown to reduce insulin resistance in some patient groups).

      Information from this study should improve the way the investigators prepare patients before
      surgery and this should help to improve patient outcomes following surgery (by reducing
      complications and speeding recovery after major surgery).

      Interested participants who are undergoing abdominal (tummy) surgery will be recruited from
      surgical clinics. They will be asked to attend the Greenfield Human Physiology Laboratory
      where they will be asked to complete two questionnaires. In addition, a sample of blood, and
      a small sample of muscle and fat from their thigh will be taken. They will undergo a low dose
      X-ray (DXA scan) and an insulin clamp. The insulin clamp involves being connected to an
      insulin and glucose drip for around four hours during which their blood pressure and pulse is
      monitored and regular blood samples are taken.

      Participants will be allocated randomly to one of two groups. One group will receive a
      carbohydrate (sugar) drink before surgery and the other group will receive a dummy (placebo)
      drink.

      On the day of surgery, pre-operative checks and assessment will proceed as normal. After the
      participant is asleep under anaesthetic, a blood sample and tummy muscle and fat samples will
      be taken by the surgeon through the surgical incision. At the end of surgery, another blood
      sample and muscle and fat samples from the tummy and thigh will be taken while the
      participant is still under anaesthetic.

      On the day after surgery, a further blood test and tummy and thigh muscle and fat sample will
      be taken. Participants will also undergo another insulin clamp.

      The research team will follow participants' progress after surgery, but the decision to allow
      them home will be made by the medical team responsible for their care.
