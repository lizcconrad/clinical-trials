    <measure>Change From Baseline In Trough (Morning Predose And Pre-Rescue Bronchodilator) Forced Expiratory Volume In 1 Second (FEV1) Over The 12-Week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, pre-dose), During Study (Days 7, 14, 28, 56 and 84 pre-dose)</time_frame>
    <description>Trough FEV1 was measured electronically by spirometry at morning (AM) investigational site visits, before administration of the AM dose of study drug and before albuterol/salbutamol administration. The highest FEV1 value from 3 acceptable and 2 reproducible maneuvers was used. All FEV1 data were submitted to a central reading center for evaluation.
The p-values for the treatment comparisons to placebo are from an MMRM model excluding FLOVENT DISKUS data: change from baseline = baseline FEV1 + sex + age + treatment + visit + treatment*visit with an unstructured covariance matrix assumed.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline In Weekly Average Of Daily Trough (Predose And Pre-Rescue Bronchodilator) Morning Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Over The 12-Week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Days -7 to 1, am pre-dose), During Study (Days 2-84 am pre-dose)</time_frame>
    <description>Peak expiratory flow was determined in the AM and in the PM, before administration of study or rescue medications using a handheld electronic peak flow meter. The highest value of triplicate measurements obtained was recorded by the subject's diary device.
On mornings for which a treatment visit was scheduled (TV1 through TV9), the PEF was measured and recorded at the investigational site visit.
Baseline trough AM PEF was defined as the average of recorded (non-missing) trough AM PEF assessments over the 7 days directly preceding first study drug intake.
The p-values for the treatment comparisons to placebo are from an MMRM model excluding FLOVENT DISKUS data: change from baseline = baseline PEF + sex + age + treatment + visit + treatment*visit with an unstructured covariance matrix assumed.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Rescue-Free 24-hour Periods During the 12-Week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Days -7 to -1), During Study (Days 1-84)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of inhalations of rescue medication used each day and each night was recorded in the subject's diary device.
Change from baseline in the percentage of rescue-free 24-hour periods was analyzed with a marginal (also called population averaged) logistic model. The model included 2 time points of measurement for each subject: the baseline and the treatment period. The model contained covariates for sex, age, and treatment. The model for the 2 time points was considered as an incomplete randomized block model, with each subject as a block, receiving the baseline level in 1 sub-block and either active treatment or placebo in the other sub-block. The generalized estimating equation (GEE) algorithm was used to fit the model, using a robust estimator for the variance which provided a proper adjustment for possible correlation between the 2 measurements on each subject.
Measure type are estimated mean and measure of dispersion is the standard error of the estimated mean.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The time to withdrawal due to stopping criteria was compared between the treatment groups with the log rank test. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the probability of remaining in the study at week 12 with 95% CI was presented by treatment group. Subjects who completed the study were censored at the date of completion, subjects who withdrew for reasons other than stopping criteria were censored at the time of withdrawal. Stopping criteria were based on day subject first met stopping criteria, using subject's diary data and asthma exacerbations recorded in CRF.</description>

    <measure>Patients With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Experiences (TEAE) During the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 -84</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an AE which prevents normal daily activities. Relationship of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>

    <time_frame>Screening (week -3 to -2), Baseline (Week 0), Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12</time_frame>
    <description>Oropharyngeal examinations for visual evidence of oral candidiasis were conducted at all study visits. If the visual oropharyngeal examination was abnormal at the screening visit, the subject was excluded from entering the study and subjects with an abnormal oropharyngeal exam on Day 1 were not eligible for randomization. Any visual evidence of oral candidiasis during the treatment period of the study was evaluated by obtaining and analyzing a swab of the suspect area. Appropriate therapy was to be initiated immediately at the discretion of the investigator and was not to be delayed for culture confirmation. Subjects with a culture-positive infection could continue participation in the study on appropriate anti-infective therapy, provided this therapy was not prohibited by the protocol. If a subject required a protocol-prohibited medication for therapy, the subject was to be discontinued from the study.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent/assent signed and dated by the subject and/or parent /legal
             guardian before conducting any study related procedure.

          2. Male or female 12 years and older, as of the Screening Visit. Male or female 18 years
             and older, as of the Screening Visit, in countries where local regulations or the
             regulatory status of study medication permit enrollment of adults only.

          3. General good health, and free of any concomitant conditions or treatment that could
             interfere with study conduct, influence the interpretation of study
             observations/results, or put the subject at increased risk during the study.

          4. Asthma Diagnosis: Asthma as defined by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

          5. Severity of Disease: A best forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 40%-85%
             of the predicted normal value during the Screening Visit. NHANES III predicted values
             will be used for subjects aged ≥12 years and adjustments to predicted values will be
             made for African American subjects.

          6. Reversibility of Disease: Demonstrated a ≥15% reversibility of FEV1 within 30 minutes
             following 2 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol (if required,
             spacers are permitted for reversibility testing only) at the Screening Visit. If a
             subject fails to demonstrate an increase in FEV1 ≥15%, then the subject is not
             eligible for the study and will not be allowed to re-screen.

          7. Current Asthma Therapy: Subjects must be on a short-acting β2-agonist alone or a
             non-corticosteroid maintenance medication (with or without a short-acting β2-agonist)
             for ≥ 3 months preceding the Screening Visit. Subjects must not have used an inhaled
             corticosteroid for at least 6 weeks preceding the Screening Visit.

             Exception: Based upon the investigator's judgment that there is no inherent harm in
             changing the subject's current ICS therapy and the subject provides consent, subjects
             on low dose ICS (100mcg Fp BID or equivalent) may be switched to a short-acting β2
             agonist alone at a Pre-screening Visit. The subject will be required to return to the
             clinic to complete the Screening Visit once the 2-week washout period has been
             completed.

          8. Short-Acting β2-Agonists: All subjects must be able to replace their current
             short-acting β2-agonists with albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol at the Screening
             Visit for use as needed for the duration of the study. The use of spacer devices with
             the metered dose inhaler (MDI) will not be allowed during the study with exception of
             its use during reversibility testing at the Screening Visit. Nebulized
             albuterol/salbutamol will not be allowed at any time during the study. Subjects must
             be able to withhold all inhaled short-acting beta sympathomimetic bronchodilators for
             at least 6 hours prior to all study visits.

          9. If female, is currently not pregnant, breast feeding, or attempting to become
             pregnant, has a negative serum pregnancy test, and is of

               1. Non-childbearing potential, defined as:

         10. Capable of understanding the requirements, risks, and benefits of study participation,
             and, as judged by the investigator, capable of giving informed consent/assent and
             being compliant with all study requirements (visits, record-keeping, etc).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of life-threatening asthma that is defined for this protocol as an asthma
             episode that required intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnea, respiratory
             arrest or hypoxic seizures.

          2. Culture-documented or suspected bacterial or viral infection of the upper or lower
             respiratory tract, sinus, or middle ear that is not resolved within 2 weeks prior to
             the Screening Visit. In addition, the subject must be excluded if such infection
             occurs between the Screening Visit and the Randomization Visit.

          3. Any asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 3 months of the
             Screening Visit. A subject must not have had any hospitalization for asthma within 6
             months prior to the Screening Visit.

             Note: An exacerbation of asthma is defined as any worsening of asthma requiring any
             treatment other than rescue albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI and/or the subject's regular
             non-corticosteroid maintenance treatment. This includes requiring the use of systemic
             corticosteroids and/or emergency room visit or hospitalization, a change in the
             subject's regular non-corticosteroid maintenance treatment, or the addition of other
             asthma medications.

          4. Presence of glaucoma, cataracts, ocular herpes simplex, or malignancy other than basal
             cell carcinoma.

          5. Historical or current evidence of a clinically significant disease including, but not
             limited to: cardiovascular (e.g., congestive heart failure, known aortic aneurysm,
             clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia or coronary heart disease), hepatic, renal,
             hematological, neuropsychological, endocrine (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes mellitus,
             uncontrolled thyroid disorder, Addison's disease, Cushing's syndrome),
             gastrointestinal (e.g., poorly-controlled peptic ulcer, GERD), or pulmonary (e.g.,
             chronic bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis with the need for treatment, cystic
             fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
             Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             put the safety of the subject at risk through participation, or which could affect the
             efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study.

          6. Have any of the following conditions that, in the judgment of the investigator, might
             cause participation in this study to be detrimental to the subject, including, but not
             limited to:

               -  Current malignancy excluding basal cell carcinoma; History of malignancy is
                  acceptable only if the subject has been in remission for one year prior to the
                  Screening Visit. (Remission is defined as no current evidence of malignancy and
                  no treatment for the malignancy in the 12 months prior to the Screening Visit)

               -  Current or untreated tuberculosis; History of tuberculosis is acceptable only if
                  a subject has received an approved prophylactic treatment regimen or an approved
                  active treatment regimen and has had no evidence of active disease for a minimum
                  of 2 years • Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP ≥160 or diastolic BP &gt;100)

               -  Stroke within 3 months prior to the Screening Visit

               -  Immunologic compromise

          7. History of a positive test for HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection.

          8. Clinical visual evidence of oral candidiasis at the Screening Visit.

          9. History of any adverse reaction, including immediate or delayed hypersensitivity to
             any β2-agonist, sympathomimetic drug, or any intranasal, inhaled, or systemic
             corticosteroid therapy. Known or suspected sensitivity to the constituents of the dry
             powder inhalers (Spiromax or Diskus) used in the study (i.e., lactose).

         10. History of severe allergy to milk protein.

         11. Use of systemic, oral or depot corticosteroids within 12 weeks prior to the Screening
             Visit

               -  Use of topical corticosteroids (≤1% hydrocortisone cream) for dermatological
                  disease is permitted

               -  Use of intranasal corticosteroids at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to
                  the Screening Visit and throughout the study is permitted

         12. Use of immunosuppressive medications within 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit and
             during the study.

         13. Immunotherapy at a stable dose for at least 90 days prior to the Screening Visit and
             throughout the study for the treatment of allergies is permitted.

         14. Use of potent Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole,
             itraconazole) within 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit.

         15. History of alcohol or drug abuse within two years preceding the Screening Visit.

         16. Current smoker or a smoking history of 10 pack years or more (a pack year is defined
             as smoking 1 pack of cigarettes/day for 1 year). A subject may not have used tobacco
             products within the past one year (e.g., cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, or pipe
             tobacco).

         17. Study participation by clinical investigator site employees and/or their immediate
             relatives.

         18. Study participation by more than one subject from the same household at the same time.
             However, after the study completion or discontinuation by one subject another subject
             from the same household may be screened.

         19. Participation in any investigational drug study within the 30 days (starting at the
             final follow-up visit) preceding the Screening Visit or planned participation in
             another investigational drug study at any time during this study.

         20. Pregnancy, nursing, or plans to become pregnant or donate gametes (ova or sperm) for
             in vitro fertilization during the study period or for 30 days following the subject's
             last study related visit (for eligible subjects only - if applicable). Eligible female
             subjects unwilling to employ appropriate contraceptive measures to ensure that
             pregnancy will not occur during the study will be excluded.

          <description>Patients demonstrated a ≥15% reversibility of FEV1 within 30 minutes following 2-4 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol at the screening visit. If subjects failed to demonstrate an increase in FEV1 ≥15% then subjects were not eligible for the study; however, based on investigator judgment, they were allowed to retest once within 7 days. Reversibility values of 14.50 through 14.99% were rounded to 15%.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline In Trough (Morning Predose And Pre-Rescue Bronchodilator) Forced Expiratory Volume In 1 Second (FEV1) Over The 12-Week Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Trough FEV1 was measured electronically by spirometry at morning (AM) investigational site visits, before administration of the AM dose of study drug and before albuterol/salbutamol administration. The highest FEV1 value from 3 acceptable and 2 reproducible maneuvers was used. All FEV1 data were submitted to a central reading center for evaluation.
The p-values for the treatment comparisons to placebo are from an MMRM model excluding FLOVENT DISKUS data: change from baseline = baseline FEV1 + sex + age + treatment + visit + treatment*visit with an unstructured covariance matrix assumed.</description>

A fixed-sequence testing procedure was employed to control the overall Type I error rate at the 0.05 level. Specifically, the 2-sided linear in log-dose time-averaged trend test was first performed followed by pairwise comparisons of each Fp MDPI dose versus placebo.</groups_desc>

        <title>Change From Baseline In Weekly Average Of Daily Trough (Predose And Pre-Rescue Bronchodilator) Morning Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Over The 12-Week Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Peak expiratory flow was determined in the AM and in the PM, before administration of study or rescue medications using a handheld electronic peak flow meter. The highest value of triplicate measurements obtained was recorded by the subject's diary device.
On mornings for which a treatment visit was scheduled (TV1 through TV9), the PEF was measured and recorded at the investigational site visit.
Baseline trough AM PEF was defined as the average of recorded (non-missing) trough AM PEF assessments over the 7 days directly preceding first study drug intake.
The p-values for the treatment comparisons to placebo are from an MMRM model excluding FLOVENT DISKUS data: change from baseline = baseline PEF + sex + age + treatment + visit + treatment*visit with an unstructured covariance matrix assumed.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline In Weekly Average Of Daily Evening Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Over The 12-Week Treatment Period</title>
          <description>Peak expiratory flow was determined in the AM and in the PM, before administration of study or rescue medications using a handheld electronic peak flow meter. The highest value of triplicate measurements obtained was recorded by the subject's diary device.
PM PEF baseline was defined as the average of recorded (nonmissing) PM PEF assessments over the 7 days directly preceding first study drug intake.
The p-values for the treatment comparisons to placebo are from an MMRM model excluding FLOVENT DISKUS data: change from baseline = baseline PEF + sex + age + treatment + visit + treatment*visit with an unstructured covariance matrix assumed.</description>
          <population>Full analysis set, (participants who contributed &gt;=1 to the analysis). Data from one site omitted due to GCP concerns. Flovent Diskus data was used for confirmatory and exploratory endpoints (see outcome #13).</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Rescue-Free 24-hour Periods During the 12-Week Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The number of inhalations of rescue medication used each day and each night was recorded in the subject’s diary device.
Change from baseline in the percentage of rescue-free 24-hour periods was analyzed with a marginal (also called population averaged) logistic model. The model included 2 time points of measurement for each subject: the baseline and the treatment period. The model contained covariates for sex, age, and treatment. The model for the 2 time points was considered as an incomplete randomized block model, with each subject as a block, receiving the baseline level in 1 sub-block and either active treatment or placebo in the other sub-block. The generalized estimating equation (GEE) algorithm was used to fit the model, using a robust estimator for the variance which provided a proper adjustment for possible correlation between the 2 measurements on each subject.
Measure type are estimated mean and measure of dispersion is the standard error of the estimated mean.</description>

        <description>The time to withdrawal due to stopping criteria was compared between the treatment groups with the log rank test. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the probability of remaining in the study at week 12 with 95% CI was presented by treatment group. Subjects who completed the study were censored at the date of completion, subjects who withdrew for reasons other than stopping criteria were censored at the time of withdrawal. Stopping criteria were based on day subject first met stopping criteria, using subject's diary data and asthma exacerbations recorded in CRF.</description>

        <title>Patients With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Experiences (TEAE) During the Treatment Period</title>
        <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an AE which prevents normal daily activities. Relationship of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>

        <description>Oropharyngeal examinations for visual evidence of oral candidiasis were conducted at all study visits. If the visual oropharyngeal examination was abnormal at the screening visit, the subject was excluded from entering the study and subjects with an abnormal oropharyngeal exam on Day 1 were not eligible for randomization. Any visual evidence of oral candidiasis during the treatment period of the study was evaluated by obtaining and analyzing a swab of the suspect area. Appropriate therapy was to be initiated immediately at the discretion of the investigator and was not to be delayed for culture confirmation. Subjects with a culture-positive infection could continue participation in the study on appropriate anti-infective therapy, provided this therapy was not prohibited by the protocol. If a subject required a protocol-prohibited medication for therapy, the subject was to be discontinued from the study.

        <title>Change From Baseline In Trough (Morning Predose And Pre-Rescue Bronchodilator) Forced Expiratory Volume In 1 Second (FEV1) Over The 12-Week Treatment Period Inclusive of Flovent Diskus Data</title>
        <description>Trough FEV1 was measured electronically by spirometry at morning (AM) investigational site visits, before administration of the AM dose of study drug and before albuterol/salbutamol administration. The highest FEV1 value from 3 acceptable and 2 reproducible maneuvers was used. All FEV1 data were submitted to a central reading center for evaluation.
The p-values for the treatment comparisons to placebo are from an MMRM model including data from all treatments: change from baseline = baseline FEV1 + sex + age + treatment + visit + treatment*visit with an unstructured covariance matrix assumed.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline In Weekly Average Of Daily Trough (Predose And Pre-Rescue Bronchodilator) Morning Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Over The 12-Week Treatment Period Inclusive of Flovent Diskus Data</title>
        <description>Peak expiratory flow was determined in the AM and in the PM, before administration of study or rescue medications using a handheld electronic peak flow meter. The highest value of triplicate measurements obtained was recorded by the subject's diary device.
On mornings for which a treatment visit was scheduled (TV1 through TV9), the PEF was measured and recorded at the investigational site visit.
Baseline trough AM PEF was defined as the average of recorded (non-missing) trough AM PEF assessments over the 7 days directly preceding first study drug intake.
The p-values for the treatment comparisons to placebo are from an MMRM model including all treatments: change from baseline = baseline PEF + sex + age + treatment + visit + treatment*visit with an unstructured covariance matrix assumed.</description>

          <description>Peak expiratory flow was determined in the AM and in the PM, before administration of study or rescue medications using a handheld electronic peak flow meter. The highest value of triplicate measurements obtained was recorded by the subject's diary device.
PM PEF baseline was defined as the average of recorded (nonmissing) PM PEF assessments over the 7 days directly preceding first study drug intake.
The p-values for the treatment comparisons to placebo are from an MMRM model including all treatment groups: change from baseline = baseline PEF + sex + age + treatment + visit + treatment*visit with an unstructured covariance matrix assumed.</description>
