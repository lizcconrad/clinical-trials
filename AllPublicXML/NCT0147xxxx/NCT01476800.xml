    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetic interaction of multiple-dose
      ketoconazole on single-dose YM178 OCAS and the safety and tolerability of YM178 OCAS alone
      and in combination with ketoconazole in healthy adult volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single oral dose of YM178 OCAS will be administered on 2 separate occasions: alone on Day 1
      of Period 1 and during multiple- dosing of ketoconazole on Day 4 of Period 2. In Period 2, an
      oral dose of ketoconazole will be administered once daily on Days 1-9.
