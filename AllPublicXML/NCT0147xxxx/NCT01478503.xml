  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to compare age and gender differences for increasing doses of mirabegron when
      given to healthy young and elderly males and healthy young and elderly females.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject will receive a single dose of mirabegron OCAS-M or placebo on Day 2, followed by
      multiple dosing (qd) for 10 days (Day 5-14).

      Young subjects will be divided into 4 groups and elderly subjects into 2 groups. Dosage will
      be different among groups.
