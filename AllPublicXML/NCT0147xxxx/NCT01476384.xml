  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is accompanied by a progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, leading to
      the loss of functional capacity and an increased risk of developing chronic metabolic
      disease. One of these metabolic diseases interacting with muscle mass is Diabetes Mellitus
      type 2. Diabetes Mellitus type 2 is characterized by high blood glucose in the context of
      insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. It has become clear that amongst its many
      actions, insulin is also a vasoactive hormone. Its effect to cause endothelial-nitric oxide
      dependent vasodilation is physiologic and dose dependent. Recent data suggest that insulin's
      metabolic and vascular actions are closely linked. This also means that an increase in
      microvascular perfusion following food intake is more resistant to postprandial insulin
      release. This physiological process is brought into prominence with increasing age, and even
      more in type 2 diabetics, and contributes to diminishing glycaemic control. In the present
      study the investigators will investigate the impact of postprandial insulin release on
      microvascular recruitment in the oral cavity.

      To fulfil the increasing demand for real-time evaluation of micro vascular flow in muscle
      tissue, new techniques have been evaluated. The conventional systemic hemodynamic and
      oxygenation parameters are neither specific nor sensitive enough to detect regional
      perfusion. A more complete evaluation of tissue oxygenation can be achieved by adding
      noninvasive assessment of perfusion in peripheral tissues to global parameters. Noninvasive
      monitoring of peripheral perfusion could be a complementary approach that allows very early
      application throughout the hospital and interventional research. Orthogonal polarization
      spectral (OPS) is a non invasive technique that uses reflected light to produce real-time
      images of the microcirculation. The technology has been incorporated into a small hand-held
      videomicroscope which can be used in both research and clinical settings. OPS can assess
      tissue perfusion using the functional capillary density (FCD), i.e., the length of perfused
      capillaries per observation area (measured as cm/cm2).

      FCD is a very sensitive parameter for determining the status of nutritive perfusion to the
      tissue. So far, one of the most easily accessible sites in humans for peripheral perfusion
      monitoring is the mouth. OPS produces excellent images of the sublingual microcirculation by
      placing the probe under the tongue. Movement artifacts, semiquantitative measure of
      perfusion, the presence of various secretions such as saliva and blood, observer-related
      bias, and malfunction of the apparatus are some of the limitations of the technique.

      In the present study we will investigate the impact of postprandial insulin release on
      microvascular recruitment in the oral cavity.
