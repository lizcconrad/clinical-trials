  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with mood disorder or psychotic disorder will be given handheld devices with
      personal health records to educate, monitor and deliver customizable healthcare tools based
      on their personal needs. The use of technology has great potential to deliver care more
      effectively and efficiently. No actual information is on the handheld device - it is accessed
      from a secure site behind hospital firewalls.

    <description>At Phase 1 (first 3 months of project), the 200 participants in Group 1 will be provided with a Personal Health Record (PHR) through TELUS Health Space, as well as they will be introduced to smart phone technology to ready them for deployment of the prompts and reminders. Two months later, they will be provided with a smart phone.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Later Intervention</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>A delayed implementation plan will be used (but will have no effect on the standard of care for the remaining 200 participants), so the remaining 200 participants in Group 2 will initially act as a control group, but at Phase 2 (six months later - approximately June 2012) the remaining 200 participants will be introduced to the technology in the same order (PHR -&gt; Smart Phone). Group 2 will have the benefit of any enhancements made during Phase 1 of the project.</description>

    <description>Participants will be given their own TELUS Health Space and Smart Phone in order to have access to their personal health records. Specific procedures using the smart phone will depend on the individual care plan for each participant. Prompts and assessments will vary depending on participant needs.</description>
