      This study employs a Randomised Controlled Trial design to investigate whether a CBT-based
      guided self-help intervention can improve anxiety, depression, psychological well-being,
      quality of life, Diabetic self-care and adherence; as compared to controls. The study aims to
      recruit 42 individuals with Diabetes and mild to moderate anxiety or depression. Anxiety and
      depression are common in patients with Type 2 Diabetes, and has been shown to affect Diabetes
      control. Literature suggests that CBT can benefit individuals with Diabetes and comorbid
      mental ill-health, however little research has been done to date on the effect of guided
      self-help in this population. It is expected that this intervention will improve patient's
      mental health, as well as extend the limited knowledge-base on guided self-help in chronic
      illness.
