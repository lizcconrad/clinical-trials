    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of BTK inhibitor PCI-32765 when
      given together with rituximab and bendamustine hydrochloride in treating patients with
      recurrent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). BTK inhibitor PCI-32765 may stop the growth of cancer
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer to
      grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing
      substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as bendamustine hydrochloride, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving BTK inhibitor PCI-32765 together with rituximab and bendamustine
      hydrochloride may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify the specific toxicities and a recommended phase 2 dose of PCI-32765 (BTK
      inhibitor PCI-32765) orally (PO) in combination with rituximab and bendamustine (bendamustine
      hydrochloride) (i.e., &quot;combination therapy&quot;) in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell
      NHL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the activity of combined rituximab, bendamustine, and PCI-32765 in patients with
      relapsed and refractory B-cell NHL as measured by response rate and duration of response.

      II. Identify potential marker(s) predictive of response to the combination therapy.

      III. Correlate pharmacogenetic (PGx) findings with patient response and toxicity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of BTK inhibitor PCI-32765.

      Patients receive BTK inhibitor PCI-32765 PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Patients also
      receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on day 1 and bendamustine hydrochloride IV over 30
      minutes on days 1-2. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue receiving BTK inhibitor
      PCI-32765 PO in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 4
      months for up to 2 years.
