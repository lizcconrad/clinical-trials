    <textblock>
      This study is a phase IV clinical trial with the objective of evaluating whether pain relief
      associated with pregabalin for at-level non-evoked and evoked neuropathic pain is more
      efficient during the early rather than late subacute phase of spinal cord injury.

          -  Comprehension of clinical trial and signed informed consent before initiation.

          -  Male or female adults, age 18 to 70.

          -  Clinical history of neuropathic pain secondary to SCI

          -  Non-evoked at-level pain with ≥ 2 intensity measured with the numerical rating scale
             (0-10).

          -  Non-evoked/evoked at-level pain corresponding to the area of sensory alteration, and

             screening and subsequent follow up visits) and use a reliable birth control method
             including abstinence of sexual activity throughout the duration of the study and for
             at last 28 days after termination of the clinical trial.
