  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will determine the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in
      Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) and importantly determine the predictors of response to Proton
      Pump Inhibitor (PPI) therapy in EoE. Moreover, the investigators will determine the effect of
      GERD on the location of esophageal eosinophilia.

    <description>Prevalence of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) in Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) Description: The definition of GERD is acid exposure time of &gt;4.2% over 24 hour period, as measured by pH monitoring.</description>

    <measure>Abnormal 24 hour acid exposure</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Abnormal 24 hour acid exposure (as measured by pH monitoring) Description: A thin plastic catheter is passed through one nostril, down the back of the throat, and into the esophagus as the patient swallows. The tip of the catheter contains a sensor that senses acid. The catheter protruding from the nose is connected to a recorder that registers each reflux of acid. The catheter is in place for 24 hours, when is removed and the recorder is attached to a computer so that the data can be downloaded.</description>
