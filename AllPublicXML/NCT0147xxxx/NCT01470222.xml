    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled pilot of a work site weight control intervention. The
      purpose of the pilot is to obtain preliminary data for future NIH submissions. Four work
      sites were identified through a multistage recruiting process. Work sites were randomized to
      either the intervention group, which will receive the intervention immediately following
      randomization or the control group which will receive a shortened intervention over a 1-month
      period, 6 months after the active intervention sites have completed their program. The
      intervention will consist of a variety of activities conducted over a 6 month period, that
      are overseen by a work site-Tufts oversight group, including the following optional elements:
      For overweight and obese individuals, regular support groups for weight loss and prevention
      of weight regain. For all work site employees irrespective of weight, handouts and posted
      informational resources on healthy eating, monthly lunchtime seminars, and food sampling to
      facilitate healthy eating patterns for prevention of weight gain.

      Basic online assessments on health and nutrition will be carried out at baseline (week 0) and
      24 weeks in all work site employees willing to provide information. More detailed online and
      in-person assessments will be performed throughout the 24-week study period in the weight
      loss support group participants (intervention sites) and individuals intending to enroll in
      the support group (control sites).

    <description>Monthly, all-worksite activities will be implemented to raise awareness of healthy nutrition for weight control throughout the worksite. The purpose of the all-worksite activities is: a) to create a supportive worksite-wide atmosphere for the individuals enrolling in the weight loss support group, and b) to provide low-level weight loss support for individuals who wish to prevent weight gain.
Individuals with eligible weight (defined as BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) without medical contradictions to weight loss, who wish to join a support group to lose weight, may enroll in the worksite weight control support group that will meet weekly for the first 10 weeks and then monthly until the end of the 6-month intervention</description>
