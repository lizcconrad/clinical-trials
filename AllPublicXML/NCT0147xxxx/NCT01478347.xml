    <textblock>
      The proposed study will evaluate the safety of the rMenB+OMV NZ in an adult population
      potentially at risk for meningococcal disease (e.g. lab workers).

      In the second part of the study additional blood samples of high responding vaccinated
      subjects will be collected for the purpose of generating a control serum panel for the human
      serum bactericidal assay (hSBA) tests.

Only 11 subjects (one subject was withdrawn after visit 3 due to &quot;lost to follow-up) were included in the safety set and therefore contributed to the baseline characteristics data.</description>
