  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect blood samples and study cancer cells found in these
      blood samples from patients with pancreatic cancer. Prior research has discovered that tumor
      cells can be collected from the blood of patients with pancreatic and other cancers.

      The physicians have developed techniques for isolating and analyzing cancer cells using a
      simple blood test. They will study how these cells relate to how chemotherapy works. They
      hope to use this information to guide choices of treatment for patients in the future.

    <description>This is an observational study to assess the feasibility of 1) isolating and enriching circulating tumorigenic cells from the peripheral blood of eligible pancreatic cancer patients and 2) successful gene expression profiling of these circulating tumorigenic cells.</description>

    <description>Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be enrolled. Venous blood is collected in a standard 10 ml heparin blood collection tube. We may ask for blood samples at different times during the course of the study, specifically, before you start treatment and when your treatment changes. During the one year of the study, the physician anticipates blood samples will be collected a minimum of one and a maximum of four times. The amount of blood collected at any of these times will be 10 mL, about 1 tablespoon.</description>
