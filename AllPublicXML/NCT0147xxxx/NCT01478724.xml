    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is defined as a systemic skeletal disease characterised by low bone mass and
      microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, with a consequent increase in bone fragility
      and susceptibility to fracture. Osteoporosis is a serious public health problem that is
      responsible for approximately 3 million women with osteoporosis in France, with approximately
      150,000 cases per year occurring in vertebral fractures, of which only one third would be
      diagnosed and 50,000 hip fractures (causing death in 20% of cases). The frequency of the
      disease increases with age, particularly among women: 10% among women aged 60 years and 20%
      among women aged 65 and 40% among women aged 75. At menopause, oestrogen deficiency causes
      alterations of the immune system, decreased bone formation, microarchitectural deterioration
      and a decrease in bone mass. Various factors may contribute to this decrease in bone density
      such as diet, lifestyle, or the genetic background.

      According to prospective studies, an overexpression of 135% of hip fractures is expected at
      European level in 50 years. Therefore, it is interesting to develop new prevention approaches
      aimed at maintaining the healthy aging population. Nutritional researches can consider
      setting up a real prevention.

      Studies suggest that specific milk protein fraction contain factors able to promote bone
      formation, inhibit bone resorption in vitro. In animal model, they showed that the specific
      fraction prevents bone loss in aged ovariectomised rats by reducing bone resorption.
      Furthermore, in human volunteers, a supplementation with the specific milk protein fraction
      maintains balanced bone remodelling and increase bone mineral density. For example, in
      healthy postmenopausal women, it has been reported that a mean rate of gain of lumbar BMD in
      the MPF group (1.21%) was significantly higher than in placebo group (-0.66%; p&lt;0.05).

      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of daily consumption of the milk
      proteins fraction on bone mineral density improvement in healthy postmenopausal women.
