      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence of IV Epoetin Hospira
      compared to IV Epogen (Amgen), based on maintenance of Hb levels and study drug dose
      requirements in patients treated for anemia associated with chronic renal failure and on
      hemodialysis.
