      The purpose of this study is to determine feasibility of pleural biopsies with the cryoprobe
      during semirigid thoracoscopy. The secondary aim is to evaluate safety with focus on bleeding

      The primary aim of this study is to determine feasibility of pleural biopsies with the
      cryoprobe during semirigid thoracoscopy. We will assess size, morphological features,
      immunohistochemistry and diagnostic yield as measures of the quality of the samples. The
      secondary aim is to evaluate safety with focus on bleeding intensity.

    <description>Biopsies will be obtained by flexible autoclavable cryoprobe 20416-032 (Erbokryo CA, ERBE, Germany) with 2.4 mm in diameter. The tip of the probe is cooled to -890C with nitrous oxide within seconds after footswitch activation. The biopsy sample will by extracted by gently pulling of the probe.</description>

    <description>The tip of the cryoprobe will be attached to suspicious part of parietal pleura and activated by footswitch for 3 seconds. The frozen tissue is going to be extracted by gently pulling of the probe. The probe with the attached biopsy sample is going to be removed together with the thoracoscope through trocar. The biopsy sample will be released from the probe by thawing in the saline.</description>
