  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether the finger tip images captured by the
      EPIC ClearView device, when analyzed via the ClearView software, produce a Response Scale
      that characterizes trends consistent with known diagnoses identified by medical doctors.
      Specifically, the investigators hypothesize that the organ system involving any of a series
      of known active diagnoses will be identified in the EPIC ClearView Response Scale report with
      the intention of providing potential triage capabilities.

        Men and women ages 18-85 who are inpatients, outpatients, friends/family/staff (controls
        only) of Greater Baltimore Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland. Participants cannot have
        an implantable electrical device (such as a pacemaker) on their body, cannot be pregnant,
        and cannot be undergoing cancer therapy of any kind.

          3. Qualifying medical diagnoses (5 diagnosis groups)

             - For potential subjects presenting with one of the five qualifying diagnoses, the
             patient presents with confirmed active medical diagnoses affecting the following
             systems or organs:

               -  Cardiovascular system: coronary artery disease, left sided congestive heart
                  failure with EF &lt;50%, valvular heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and
                  hypertension
