  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 91-day phase II, open label trial of the true human monoclonal antibody RA-18C3 in
      subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris. Ten (10) subjects will receive RA-18C3 via
      subcutaneous injection. Subjects will receive injections at Days 0, 21, and 42 for a total of
      3 injections. Study drug will be administered under close observation in a facility equipped
      to handle medical emergencies. Subjects will not be discharged from the facility until at
      least 1 hour following the injection or 1 hour after their vital signs have stabilized.
      Safety will be assessed by pre- and post-treatment serial measurements of vital signs,
      clinical laboratory assessments, and the recording of adverse clinical events.

          2. Moderate to moderately severe inflammatory acne vulgaris:

               -  Investigator's Global Assessment grade of ≥ 3 and,

               -  ≥ 15 inflammatory lesions (no more than 6 nodules) and,

               -  ≥ 15 non-inflammatory lesions

          3. Four week washout period for topical and oral antibiotic treatment

          4. Four week washout period for topical retinoids

          5. Negative pregnancy test at screening and at specified time points throughout the
             trial. For subjects with reproductive potential, a willingness to utilize
             contraception during the study and including 3 months after study completion. Sexually
             active men must use an accepted method of contraception during the study and including
             3 months after study completion.

          6. Subjects weighing ≥ 27 kg

          7. Signed and dated Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved informed consent before any
             protocol-specific screening procedures are performed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A diagnosis of Acne conglobata, acne fulminans, secondary acne, severe nodulocystic
