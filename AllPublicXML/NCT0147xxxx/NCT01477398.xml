    <textblock>
      The proposed study will measure the incidence of adverse events and the decrease in time to
      meet discharge criteria from the post anesthesia care unit when hypercapnic and hyperpnoea
      are used during emergence.

    <textblock>
      Hypercapnia has been used in conjunction with hyperpnoea to provide a more rapid return of
      responsiveness after inhaled anesthesia. The benefits of accelerating patient recovery in the
      operating room may extend to the post anesthesia care unit if the patient is more alert and
      easier to care for when they arrive in the unit. Respiratory patterns and gas levels -
      including CO2, O2, and anesthetic vapor - will be measured in order to better understand a
      patient's respiratory status during recovery.

      In Feb 2009 we finished our first study (IRB 26111) and submitted a publication. The journal
      reviewers identified a serious limitation: we could not report whether the treated patients
      recovered from anesthesia faster because the treatment (inspired CO2) caused them to breath
      more vigorously or because the treatment caused the anesthetic vapors to be cleared more
      rapidly from the brain. Our new application uses essentially the same study protocol as the
      former study but adds chest bands to measure the patient's rate of breathing and expired gas
      monitoring to measure the rate at which the vapors are removed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  adult ASA class I-III subjects of both genders scheduled to undergo eye surgery at the
             Moran Hospital.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  a history of renal or hepatic disease, chronic alcohol or drug abuse, disabling
             neuropsychiatric disorder, hypersensitivity, or unusual response to other halogenated
             anesthetics, pulmonary hypertension, increased intracranial pressure, seizure
             disorder, or personal/familial history of malignant hyperthermia, and current smokers.

          -  Subjects will also be excluded if they are currently being treated with known hepatic
             enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenobarbital, dilantin, or isoniazid) or with drugs
             known to alter anesthetic requirements (e.g., opiates, clonidine, alpha2 agonists,
             alcohol, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, barbiturates, benzodiazepines or other
             tranquilizers).

          -  Subjects will also be excluded if they have intolerance to non-steroidal
             anti-inflammatories.

          -  In addition subjects who have received general anesthesia within the previous 7 days,
             received any investigational drug within the previous 28 days, or participated in a
             previous isoflurane or desflurane study will be excluded.

          -  Female subjects can be neither pregnant nor breast feeding.

          -  Subjects with significant restrictive lung disease will also be excluded.

          -  Subjects passing these criteria will be further evaluated with a medical history
             including medications, abbreviated physical examination, clinical laboratory tests
             (urine drug test), and a urine or serum human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test
             for women with childbearing potential.
