  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interaction of fat with the mouth, stomach and intestine will trigger physiological responses
      that will impact on the digestion, gut transit time and absorption of fat. These responses
      will also influence and contribute to regulation of food intake and satiety. No systematic
      research on understanding how the physiological-chemical properties of food affect the
      digestion and absorption of lipids has been carried out previously. Studies have shown that
      the release of free fatty acids triggers the fat-related responses. The investigators
      hypothesize that the release of fatty acids depends on the colloidal state of the fat, which
      changes progressively due to the pH changes and enzyme activities in the mouth, stomach and
      intestine.
