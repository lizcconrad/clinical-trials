  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the progression free survival (PFS), overall
      survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), time to treatment failure (TTF), duration of
      response (DoR), quality of life, safety and tolerability of tivozanib in combination with
      mFOLFOX6 and bevacizumab in combination with mFOLFOX6.

    <textblock>
      Imaging scans (computed tomography [CT]/magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) to assess disease
      progression were to be completed within 28 days prior to first study drug administration,
      approximately every 8 weeks for the first 18 months and then approximately every 12 weeks
      until the patient showed progressive disease (PD) per the investigator, withdrew consent, was
      lost to follow-up or died. Per the original protocol, all patients were to be contacted by
      the study site every 12 weeks for survival following the end-of-treatment visit until death
      or for no more than 3 years after the end-of-treatment visit.

      The interim futility analysis was conducted in December 2013, based on a pre-specified
      analysis cutoff date of 13 September 2013. The study was brought to a close as specified in
      the protocol due to the results of the interim futility analysis and only those participants
      who were deriving benefit (per the treating physician) from their current treatment remained
      on study until one of the discontinuation criteria was met.

      Given the early closure of the study, no updated or additional efficacy analyses were
      performed after the interim analysis. A biomarker analysis was conducted in January 2014,
      based on the data from the cutoff date of 13 September 2013. The safety analysis was updated
      with a new cutoff date of 28 February 2014.

    <time_frame>From randomization until the analysis cut-off date of 13 September 2013; median time on study drug was 167 days in the tivozanib group and 162 days in the bevacizumab group.</time_frame>
    <description>The time from the date of randomization until objective tumor progression or death due to any cause. Objective tumor progression was determined through radiological imaging and based on the requirements of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST Version 1.1):
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions or the appearance of one or more new lesions.
Participants who did not progress or had not died at the time of the analysis were censored at the date of last tumor assessment where non-progression was documented.</description>

    <description>Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the documented date of death. Participants still alive at the time of analysis were censored on the last day the participant was known to be alive.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until the analysis cut-off date of 13 September 2013; median time on study drug was 167 days in the tivozanib group and 162 days in the bevacizumab group.</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) confirmed a minimum of four weeks apart based on RECIST 1.1 criteria.
CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions.
PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters and no progression of non-target lesions and no new lesions, or, disappearance of all target lesions and persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits and no new lesions.</description>

    <description>Duration of response (DoR) is defined as the time from the date of the first documented response of CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) to documented progression or death. If a participant did not progress or had not died at the time of analysis, the duration of response was censored at the date of last tumor assessment. Duration of response is only defined for participants whose best overall response was CR or PR.</description>

    <description>Time to Treatment Failure (TTF) is defined as the time from randomization to last dose date of tivozanib/bevacizumab. If a participant discontinued treatment for any reason, the participant was considered as an event. Participants remaining on treatment at the time of analysis were censored at date of last dose.</description>

    <time_frame>From first dose through 30 days after last dose of either tivozanib or bevacizumab, until the data cut-off date of 28 February 2014. The median duration of treatment was 168.0 days in the tivozanib (tiv) arm and 162.0 days in the bevacizumab (bev) arm.</time_frame>
    <description>An abnormality identified during a medical test is defined as an AE if the abnormality induced clinical signs or symptoms, required active intervention, interruption or discontinuation of study medication or was clinically significant in the investigator's opinion.
An AE was serious if it resulted in death, was life-threatening, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, resulted in congenital anomaly or birth defect, required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization or other medically important event.
AEs, including abnormal clinical laboratory values, were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Grading Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 4.03 per the following: 1=mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe; 4= life threatening; 5=death.
Treatment-related AEs were defined as events where the relationship to study drug was marked as probably or possibly, or was missing.</description>

Duration of response is only defined for participants whose best overall response was CR or PR.</description>

        <title>Safety as Assessed by Physical Examination, Vital Signs, Laboratory Assessments, 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECGs), and Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
        <description>An abnormality identified during a medical test is defined as an AE if the abnormality induced clinical signs or symptoms, required active intervention, interruption or discontinuation of study medication or was clinically significant in the investigator's opinion.
An AE was serious if it resulted in death, was life-threatening, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, resulted in congenital anomaly or birth defect, required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization or other medically important event.
AEs, including abnormal clinical laboratory values, were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Grading Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 4.03 per the following: 1=mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe; 4= life threatening; 5=death.
Treatment-related AEs were defined as events where the relationship to study drug was marked as probably or possibly, or was missing.</description>

        <description>The number of participants with a progression-free survival event (radiological progression assessed by the investigator or death due to any cause) reported by Baseline tumor VEGF-C RNA level.
RNA was purified from biopsy tissue and measured using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Since low cycle threshold (CT) values reflect high RNA expression, the inverse of CT values were used to derive tumor categories. RNA level is expressed relative to the observed median level.</description>

        <title>Progression-Free Survival Events by Tumor Placental Growth Factor (PIGF) RNA Level</title>
        <description>The number of participants with a progression-free survival event (radiological progression assessed by the investigator or death due to any cause) reported by Baseline tumor PIGF RNA level.
RNA was purified from biopsy tissue and measured using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Since low cycle threshold (CT) values reflect high RNA expression, the inverse of CT values were used to derive tumor categories. RNA level is expressed relative to the observed median level.</description>
        <time_frame>From randomization until the analysis cut-off date of 13 September 2013; median time on study drug was 167 days in the tivozanib group and 162 days in the bevacizumab group.</time_frame>
