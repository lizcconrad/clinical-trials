      Goal: The main goal of this study is to develop and validate educational materials that aim
      to improve self-management knowledge and practices about COPD among patients in Mandarin and
      Cantonese-speaking communities in the Greater Vancouver Area (GVA).

      Objectives: &quot;1.&quot; To assess the current landscape of COPD beliefs, perceptions and practices,
      as well as health literacy as it relates to Chinese Mandarin and Cantonese-speaking patients;
      &quot;2.&quot; To develop effective partnerships within primary care physicians serving Chinese
      newcomers in the GVA' &quot;3.&quot; To conduct focus group sessions with collaborative primary care
      physicians to identify common factors that contribute to under service and access barriers
      among patients in the target communities; &quot;4.&quot; To assess the effectiveness of the educational
      materials on patients' beliefs, perceptions, practices, and health literacy related to COPD
      control and self-management; and &quot;5.&quot; To improve the capacity of physicians and allied health
      workers in primary care settings in educating patients and their families about
      self-management of COPD.

      The implementation of the project will include the following phases: &quot;1.&quot; Build and
      strengthen established partnerships with primary care practices serving newcomers in GVA;
      &quot;2.&quot; Conduct an environmental scan and needs assessment (literature review, interviews and
      focus groups with community members and key-informants); &quot;3.&quot; Development of story scripts,
      video clips and other educational materials, and relevant measurement tools; &quot;4.&quot; Application
      of the video clips and other educational materials to test their effectiveness on health
      literacy, beliefs, and knowledge among COPD patients from the target communities; and &quot;5.&quot;
      Evaluation of the usefulness of videos and other educational materials, and the project's
      process and outcomes.

  <detailed_description>

      The main aim of this project is to address our knowledge gap about COPD management, access
      problems, and differences in environmental exposure among newcomers in Canada: by engaging
      key stakeholders, fostering dialogue, gathering baseline data, and generating knowledge on
      how improved access to culturally and linguistically appropriate educational materials can
      enhance awareness and practices about COPD control and self-management through interventional
      study, thereby improving the health status of the target populations. We plan to document:
      &quot;1.&quot; what are the cultural imperatives that are likely to mediate ethnic Chinese patients to
      manage COPD? &quot;2.&quot; to what extent does the Canadian health care system's environment influence
      newcomers response to COPD? Our aim is to examine the belief system and health practices
      among target communities that may influence treatment and management of COPD.

      This research will make theoretical, methodological and applied research contributions. It
      will establish strong community - primary care provider and academic connections for the
      development of the proposed educational materials, measurement tools, and framework.
      Community participation will be included throughout the development of this study, enhancing
      the potential of acquiring new knowledge about cultural and traditional practices of the
      sample population.

      Our approach will enable primary health care providers, knowledge users, and policy makers to
      design appropriate educational intervention initiatives targeted to diverse ethnic minority
      groups in relation to COPD. We foresee findings that provide not only better ways to measure
      health literacy pertaining to COPD in our target populations, but that will also help develop
      materials and measures that can be applied to other populations in BC and the rest of Canada.
      We expect that the participatory approach used in this study will contribute to capacity
      building, improving newcomers' ability to access and use relevant COPD information (in terms
      of prevention, control and management) and to transfer and share the information learned with
      other members of the target communities. The proposed community consultation will also help
      us identify culturally appropriate communication mode(s) to deliver health information
      messages and determine practical adult learning approaches applicable to diverse communities
      in Canada.
