  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This two-phase study was to examine if 16 weeks of treatment with sitagliptin in combination
      with atorvastatin reduces hemoglobin A1C (A1C) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol
      (LDL-C) from baseline more than atorvastatin alone and sitagliptin alone, respectively.
      Following a single-blind placebo run-in period, participants were to be randomized to one of
      three treatment arms (sitagliptin monotherapy, atorvastatin monotherapy, or sitagliptin plus
      atorvastatin) for 16 weeks (Phase A). During Phase B of the study (Weeks 16 through 54),
      participants were to receive either sitagliptin plus atorvastatin or glimepiride plus
      atorvastatin. The primary hypotheses were that after 16 weeks of treatment, sitagliptin in
      combination with atorvastatin reduces A1C from baseline more than atorvastatin alone, and
      that atorvastatin in combination with sitagliptin lowers LDL-C from baseline more than
      sitagliptin alone.
