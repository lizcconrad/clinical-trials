  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inability to provide oxygen to the patient remains the most fearful anesthesia-related
      mishap. Cricothyrotomy (CT) is an infrequently performed but life saving procedure for an
      anesthesiologist, who is encountered with this situation. The current method of
      cricothyrotomy relies on digital palpation (DP). Several patient populations, including
      morbidly obese, short neck, radiation to and previous neck surgeries, have difficult
      landmarks for this procedure. Ultrasound (US) technology has been used in the past to
      visualize landmarks for cricothyrotomy, but there is no study which has examined the role of
      ultrasound in patients who have obscure landmarks. There is no data related to the
      performance of ultrasound guided cricothyrotomy in these patients. In this study, we aimed to
      determine the outcomes of CT performed on human cadavers using US-guidance, compared to
      conventional DP, of anatomical landmarks. In particularly, complication rates, failure to
      cannulate, correct placement of the device and insertion time of CT were assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For each cadaver - epidemiological data (age, sex) and morphometric data (Body Mass Index,
      neck circumference, thyromental distance)

      The primary outcome measure was the complication rate as assessed by the severity of
      injuries; defined as the incidence and severity of posterior laryngeal and tracheal wall
      injuries, as graded by two anesthesiologists using the grading system described by Murphy et
      al,( none (no injury); mild (&lt; 5 mm laceration); moderate (&gt; 5mm laceration or partial
      puncture); severe (&gt; 10 mm laceration or full puncture)). For clinical relevance and analysis
      of data we dichotomized the scale to none-mild and moderate - severe injuries.

      The secondary outcomes include: 1) insertion time, measured in seconds (s) from the time of
      palpation of the skin to insertion of the Portex device in the trachea; 2) failure, with a
      'failure' defined as any attempt in which the trachea was not cannulated, or which required &gt;
      300 s to perform; and 3) correct land-marking, defined as having the Portex device inserted
      via the CM.

          <description>Group-1 will perform cricothyrotomy using conventional digital palpation technique
The identification of the cricothyroid membrane by digital palpation was performed by using the index and third fingers of the non-dominant hand. The thyroid cartilage was first palpated in the midline starting from cephalad and moving caudally until the cricoid cartilage is palpated. The is the space between the inferior border of the thyroid cartilage and the superior border of the cricoid cartilage</description>

          <description>Group-2 Ultrasound guided cricothyrotomy A 15-10 mHz linear probe (MicroMaxx system, Sonosite Canada Inc, Markham, Ontario, Canada) was used to obtain sonographic images of anatomical landmarks on cadaveric necks as described by Kristensen.
The participants held the linear high-frequency transducer in their non-dominant hand and placed themselves on the right side of the cadaver facing towards the head of the cadaver. Then they placed the US probe transversely over the cadaver’s neck just above the suprasternal notch in order to visualize the trachea. The transducer was then moved laterally to the patient’s right side until the right border of the transducer was superficial to the midline of the trachea. During this movement it was ensured that the right end of the transducer was kept in the midline of the trachea while the left end of the transducer was rotated into the sagittal plane resulting in a longitudinal scan of the midline of the trachea.</description>

The identification of the cricothyroid membrane by digital palpation was performed by using the index and third fingers of the non-dominant hand. The thyroid cartilage was first palpated in the midline starting from cephalad and moving caudally until the cricoid cartilage is palpated.

            <description>Group-2 Ultrasound guided cricothyrotomy A 15-10 mHz linear probe (MicroMaxx system, Sonosite Canada Inc, Markham, Ontario, Canada) was used to obtain sonographic images of anatomical landmarks on cadaveric necks as described by Kristensen.
The participants held the linear high-frequency transducer in their non-dominant hand and placed themselves on the right side of the cadaver facing towards the head of the cadaver. Then they placed the US probe transversely over the cadaver’s neck just above the suprasternal notch in order to visualize the trachea. The transducer was then moved laterally to the patient’s right side until the right border of the transducer was superficial to the midline of the trachea. During this movement it was ensured that the right end of the transducer was kept in the midline of the trachea while the left end of the transducer was rotated into the sagittal plane resulting in a longitudinal scan of the midline of the trachea.</description>

            <description>Group-2 Ultrasound guided cricothyrotomy A 15-10 mHz linear probe (MicroMaxx system, Sonosite Canada Inc, Markham, Ontario, Canada) was used to obtain sonographic images of anatomical landmarks on cadaveric necks as described by Kristensen.
The participants held the linear high-frequency transducer in their non-dominant hand and placed themselves on the right side of the cadaver facing towards the head of the cadaver. Then they placed the US probe transversely over the cadaver’s neck just above the suprasternal notch in order to visualize the trachea. The transducer was then moved laterally to the patient’s right side until the right border of the transducer was superficial to the midline of the trachea. During this movement it was ensured that the right end of the transducer was kept in the midline of the trachea while the left end of the transducer was rotated into the sagittal plane resulting in a longitudinal scan of the midline of the trachea.</description>

          <title>Cricothyrotomy Using Digital Palpation</title>
          <description>Group-1 will perform cricothyrotomy using conventional digital palpation technique
The identification of the cricothyroid membrane by digital palpation was performed by using the index and third fingers of the non-dominant hand. The thyroid cartilage was first palpated in the midline starting from cephalad and moving caudally until the cricoid cartilage is palpated. The is the space between the inferior border of the thyroid cartilage and the superior border of the cricoid cartilage</description>
