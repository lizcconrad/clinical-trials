  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the effect of fibrin sealant on reducing blood loss,
      pain and swelling when operated for bilateral total knee arthroplasty. Likewise the effect on
      Range Of Movement (ROM) and strength is examined.

Measurement of postoperative swelling is done on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd day before mobilization. On the 7th and 21st postoperative day the majority of the patients are discharged and therefore testet at the outpatient department. The swelling is measured as the difference of circumference 1 cm proximal of the patella 2-3 weeks before surgery and at the outlined postoperative times.</description>
