  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect on repeat doses of GSK2190915 in
      asthmatic patients with a high percentage of neutrophils in their sputum. GSK2190915 will be
      given as an add on to current therapy, and its effects on the percentage of sputum
      neutrophils in the patients will be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, two-way cross-over study to evaluate
      the effect of treatment with repeat dose GSK2190915, a 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein
      (FLAP) inhibitor, as an add-on to current therapy on the percentage of neutrophils in induced
      sputum in asthmatic patients with elevated sputum neutrophils. Approximately 20 subjects will
      be enrolled onto the study to ensure that approximately 14 evaluable subjects complete the
      study. All subjects will receive oral placebo and GSK2190915 100mg once daily for up to 16
      days. Sputum neutrophilia will be assessed prior to treatment and on treatment. Key
      assessments: sputum cell counts, biomarker samples in sputum, blood and urine, and
      pharmacokinetics. Safety will be assessed by vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical
      laboratory safety tests and collection of adverse events (AEs).

      GSK2190915 is a high affinity 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) inhibitor that
      attenuates the production of leukotrienes, through the blockage of the first committed step
      in the leukotriene pathway, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) activation. Leukotrienes are potent
      inflammatory molecules produced mainly by mast cells, eosinophils, monocytes/macrophage and
      neutrophils in response to allergic or inflammatory stimuli. As GSK2190915 reproducibly
      inhibits the production of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) both in
      vitro and in vivo it has strong potential utility in the treatment of asthma.

             normal (ULN); alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin
             &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Males and females ages 18 years old and above.

          -  An established clinical history of asthma in accordance with the definition by the
             GINA Guidelines.

          -  Subjects who are stable on their current treatment for at least one month prior to
             first dose and for the duration of the study.

          -  Persistent sputum neutrophilia in the absence of infection. Persistent is defined at
             being met at Screening and Visit 1 of Treatment Period 1. At least one sputum sample
             must show neutrophils ≥ 50%. The other sample must be &gt; 45%.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented
                  (medical report verification) hysterectomy or double oophorectomy; or
                  postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea or 6 months of
                  spontaneous amenorrhea with serum Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) levels &gt; 40
                  mIU/mL and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) or 6 weeks postsurgical bilateral
                  oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy. Females on hormone replacement therapy
                  (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the
                  contraception methods specified in the protocol if they wish to continue their
                  Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) during the study. Otherwise, they must
                  discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study
                  enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the
                  cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and
                  dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can

                  risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception
