      Abstract Diabetes mellitus and periodontal diseases are both chronic inflammatory disorders
      that have a major impact on the health and well being of millions of individuals worldwide.
      Periodontal diseases are among the most common diseases in humans, therefore, if the presence
      of periodontal diseases plays any role in overall systemic health, the public health impact
      may be substantial. An important factor that can be involved in the progression of the
      periodontal disease is the production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). The imbalance between
      oxidative stress induced by ROS and the concentrations (or activity) of the antioxidant may
      result in tissue damage. The ROS induce the activity of lipid peroxidation-Tbars,
      myeloperoxidase (MPO), peroxidase and arginase, whose mechanisms reflect the severity of the
      periodontal disease and it may offer the basis for a patient specific diagnostic test for
      periodontitis and could have therapeutic significance. The aim of this study is to
      investigate quantitatively the levels of oxidative stress markers (Myeloperoxidase,
      Peroxidase, Lipid Peroxidation and Arginase) in saliva and in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF)
      of diabetes type 2 subjects with generalized chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy
      individuals, and systematically healthy individuals with generalized chronic periodontitis
      and periodontally healthy individuals, before and after periodontal treatment. Unstimulated
      whole saliva will be collected for 5 min as well as GCF of 25 diabetes type 2 with
      generalized chronic periodontitis, 25 diabetes type 2 periodontally healthy individuals as
      controls, 25 systematically healthy individuals with generalized chronic periodontitis and 25
      periodontally healthy individuals before and after treatment. The following clinical
      parameters will be evaluated: probing pocket depth, probing attachment level, plaque index
      and the gingival index. The activity of stress markers in saliva and GFC will be analyzed by
      spectrophotometry. Adequate statistical analysis will be carried out with a p-value set at p
      &lt; 0.05.
