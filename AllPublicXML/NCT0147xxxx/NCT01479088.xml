      Twelve-month, multicenter, intra-subject controlled (retrospective-prospective), open-label,
      active-treatment study to evaluate the dose-response and pharmacokinetics (PK) of cinacalcet
      HCl for the treatment of Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in paediatric subjects with
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis, followed by 12-month study extension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, intra-subject controlled, open-label, active-treatment study will assess in
      children affected by Secondary Hyperparathyroidism, aged 2-18 years on chronic dialysis not
      responsive to standard of care (SoC) therapy, the response after 6-month cinacalcet compared
      intra-subject to SoC alone at screening visit 6 months prior to cinacalcet start. Secondary
      objectives are to evaluate effects on growth over 18 months and PK profile. At baseline
      children have PTH levels&gt;300 pg/mL, plasma P&lt;6 mg/dL, and Ca 8.4-10.5 mg/dL, or Ca x P
      product&gt;60 not responsive to SoC. Initial dosing of cinacalcet will be 0.5-0.75 mg/Kg per os
      OD to be adjusted up to a max of 180mg OD for target PTH values&lt;180 pg/mL in absence of
      hypocalcemia. Thirty children will be enrolled at 12 centres participating in a national
      paediatric dialysis registry, corresponding to an α=0.05 and a power of 80% using the McNemar
      test, with an expected % of responders to cinacalcet or SoC of 40% or 5% respectively, with a
      drop-out rate of 15. Primary study endpoint (EP) will be the % of children who will have a
      reduction from baseline &gt;25% in mean PTH levels during the 6-mo efficacy-assessment period.
      Among secondary EPs over 18 mos will be the % of patients with mean PTH levels&lt;300 pg/mL; the
      % change in PTH, Ca, P values, and the Ca x P product; PK profile (or population profile by
      age) and its correlation with PTH and testosterone levels; auxological indices and growth
      velocity; % of children with treatment-emergent adverse events and lab abnormalities;
      retention on treatment and reasons of treatment withdrawal. The study will evaluate whether
      cinacalcet represents a safe and effective therapeutic option for SHPT children.

    <description>Subjects who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria at baseline will be given cinacalcet 30mg film-coated tablet, for oral use added to phosphate binders and vitamin D analogue.
For subjects receiving a cinacalcet dose &lt;30mg, commercially available cinacalcet 30mg tab will be ground and diluted with a 5% dextrose solution. Then, an aliquot of this solution corresponding to the individually prescribed dose will be administered as indicated.
Initial dosing of cinacalcet will be 0.5-0.75mg/kg or 30 mg po once daily (OD) each evening with food.
During the cinacalcet dose-titration 6-month period for efficacy assessment, the dose will be increased on monthly basis by 0.5 mg/kg or by 30mg OD to achieve the target iPTH value &lt;180 pg/mL, as tolerated by the subject, up to maximum of 180mg OD in absence of signs of hypocalcemia, according to the current summary of product characteristics.</description>
