    <textblock>
      Despite their benign nature, keloids may constitute a severe aesthetic, and in some cases,
      functional problem which translates to various repercussions on person's quality of life,
      including much stress and insecurities.

      Keloids are mostly observed between the ages of 10 and 30. Although keloid is a common
      condition and the investigators can make assumptions about those living with keloids, the
      investigators do not know the actual impact of the illness on the overall performance of
      patients' and how this disease, day to day, is impacting their lives. The investigators are
      conducting this study, aimed to investigate the psychosocial impact of keloid on daily life.
      Information is collected anonymously. You must be 18 years of age or older to take this
      survey. Parents can respond on behalf of their children who are not 18 years of age yet. The
      online survey will take 20-30 minutes to complete.
