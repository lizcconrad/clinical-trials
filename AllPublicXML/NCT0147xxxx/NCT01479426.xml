      Among the three main lines of therapy for erectile dysfunction (ED), that is, oral therapy,
      self-injection therapy and penile prosthesis implantation, the first line therapy is always
      the first option. Despite the successful advent of sildenafil, the first effective oral agent
      for ED, further development of new drugs and phytochemical studies of widely known herbal
      plants are desirable. Furthermore, there seems to be a large population that prefers to use
      phytotherapies rather than pharmaceutical drugs for their health. Korean red ginseng, a
      phytotherapy plants, used frequently for ED. Ginseng is one of the most popular herbs in both
      Eastern and Western countries. It is known as a traditional Asian medicine for stimulation of
      sexual function and studies have shown the effects of ginseng on relaxation of penile corpus
      cavernous smooth muscle in many studies. In the present study, the investigators will be
      determined the real role of Korean red ginseng in the treatment of ED.
