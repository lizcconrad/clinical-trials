    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the subcutaneous tissue changes in the lymphedema found after
      thigh surgery, by circumferential measure of thr thighs and by magnetic resonance imaging
      verifying the effects of postoperative lymphatic drainage.

      Patients will be invited to participate in the study, divided into two groups, and randomized
      to treatment by wwww.randomization.com, where 10 patients will participate in the study
      group(20 legs) and 10 control group patients(20 legs). Total of 40 legs. Then, the evaluation
      will be performed on preoperative time, consisting of physical examination and
      circumferential measures. Others measurements will be taken im postoperative time and
      confirmed by magnetic resonance.

    <description>Thigh circumference measurements made with anthropometric metal tape and a Permanent Marker, based in bone parameters in supine position. Using as reference the bony protuberance of the trochanter, the first measurement will be taken 5 (five) cm below this point and 5 (five) cm above the patella, and betwin this two points will be made one mark at the midpoint between them. After the measurement, a Magnetic Resonance of the thighs is made.</description>
