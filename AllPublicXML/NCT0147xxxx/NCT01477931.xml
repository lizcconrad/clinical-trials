      The aims of this study are 1) to examine the clinical utility of bupropion hydrochloride
      extended release (Wellbutrin XL®) in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with
      atypical features; 2) to evaluate the tolerability of bupropion hydrochloride extended
      release (Wellbutrin XL®) in patients with MDD with atypical features.

      Whether bupropion hydrochloride extended release (Wellbutrin XL®) improved atypical
      depressive symptoms has not been investigated. The investigators assumed that bupropion
      hydrochloride extended release (Wellbutrin XL®) will be effective and tolerable in the
      treatment of atypical depression in MDD patients.
