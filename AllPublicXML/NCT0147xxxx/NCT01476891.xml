  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For people with cancer, in-person Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) participation can
      decrease stress symptoms, mood disturbance, and fatigue, as well as enhance personal growth
      and spirituality, and improve quality of life and sleep. Online MBSR may improve the
      accessibility of MBSR programs to underserved cancer patients who are unable to attend
      available in-person groups. This study will examine whether patients are willing to
      participate and complete the program, and also whether the online program improves mood and
      stress.
