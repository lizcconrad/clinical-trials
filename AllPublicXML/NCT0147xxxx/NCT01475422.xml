  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose is part of the package of interventions in
      diabetes mellitus and an effective therapeutic strategy for the adequate control of the
      disease; and the continuing education of people with DM is recognized as one of the goals to
      delay the complications arising from chronic disease and alleviate the symptoms of
      hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.

      This study aims to evaluate the effects of educational intervention on self-monitoring of
      capillary blood glucose in metabolic control, knowledge and attitude in two groups of
      patients with diabetes mellitus: a group of diabetic patients who participate in the
      Self-Monitoring of Capillary Blood Glucose at Home Program and receive educational
      interventions (Intervention Group - G1) and a group of diabetic patients who participle in
      the Self-Monitoring of Capillary Blood Glucose at Home Program and receive conventional
      treatment (Control Group - G2). As an educational tool in diabetes will be used Conversation
      Maps which is considered an interactive program of diabetes education.

    <description>The Conversation Maps program is a set of innovative, interactive diabetes education tools developed by the Healthy Interactions, and endorsed by the American Diabetes Association. It consists of four conversation maps covering: 1) how the body and diabetes works, 2) healthy eating and physical activity, 3) treatment with medication and monitoring blood glucose, and 4) reaching the targets with insulin (a fifth map covering gestational diabetes will not be used in this study), and a program manual to help educators successfully implement the program. Participants will be followed for an expected average of 12 weeks.</description>
