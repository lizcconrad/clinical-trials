    <textblock>
      This observational registry is conducted in Europe, Asia, Africa and the United States of
      America (USA).

      The purpose of the registry is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of activated recombinant
      human factor VII (rFVIIa) during bleeding episodes and for the prevention of bleeding during
      invasive procedures/surgery in patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (GT) with past or
      present refractoriness to platelet transfusions. Attention will be directed towards
      complications related to thrombo-embolic events and concomitant medications especially
      antifibrinolytics.

    <description>A prospective, observational multi-national registry collecting data and evaluating the efficacy and safety of rFVIIa in patients with GT with past or present refractoriness to platelet transfusions. The registry will also collect data from a broader range of GT patients treated with systemic haemostatic treatment (with or without antifibrinolytic drugs or other agents) used in the clinics. Data collection will continue for a maximum of six years. Baseline data as well as data obtained during either bleeding episodes or invasive procedures/surgeries will be recorded in the registry.</description>

        Patients with GT. There is no limit to the number of bleeding episodes or preventions of
        bleeding during invasive procedures/surgery that can be entered for each patient within the
        lifetime of the registry. Patients will receive standard care according to local practice,
        thus any systemic haemostatic treatment (with or without antifibrinolytic drugs or other
        agents) considered useful by the centres for treatment of GT, are included in the registry.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with congenital GT defined as patients with lifelong bleeding tendency
             characterised by impaired or absent platelet aggregation, impaired clot retraction and
             prolonged bleeding time or prolonged platelet function analyser closure time. The
             patient has normal platelet counts and platelet morphology. Optional diagnosis
             criteria are quantitative or qualitative evaluation of GP (Glycoprotein) IIb/IIIa
             receptor including flow cytometry and identification of gene defects

          -  Signed informed consent by the patient or next of kin or legally acceptable
             representative to collect data on treatment of a given bleeding episode or surgical
             event as specified in the protocol. If informed consent is provided by the next of kin
             or legally acceptable representative, consent must also be obtained from the patient
             as soon as he/she is able to do so. Informed consent must be obtained before entry of
             data into the registry

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with acquired thrombasthenic states caused by autoimmune disorders (acute or
             chronic) or drugs
