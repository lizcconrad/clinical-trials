  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diet and nutrition play an essential role in the development and the clinical expression of
      the most common health problems. Overeating and obesity induce oxidative stress, which has
      been proposed to be a pathogenic mechanism leading to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes
      (T2D) and associated cardiovascular complications. The main objective of the proposed
      research is to evaluate the beneficial effects of polyphenolic compounds derived from red
      grape marc extracts on the cascade of events leading from overeating to oxidative stress and
      insulin resistance. For that, we will study free radicals production, inflammatory markers,
      adipokines, mitochondrial function, insulin sensitivity and energy substrate utilization in
      healthy volunteers at risk for insulin resistance and T2D (1st degree relatives of T2D
      patients with associated overweight). These volunteers will be randomized between a placebo
      and a polyphenol group for 9 weeks. The demonstration of the beneficial effects of
      polyphenols will be sensitized by high-fructose feeding for the last 6 days of the protocol.
