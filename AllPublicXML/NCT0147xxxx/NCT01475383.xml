  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an investigational
      compound designated PF-03654746 compared to placebo in the treatment of adults with
      Tourette's Syndrome. The study will also explore the pharmacokinetics of PF-03654746 in
      adults with Tourette's Syndrome.

If a subject has intolerable, severe, or serious AEs after taking 2 mg qd for 1 to 5 days of dosing, the dose will be decreased by the investigator to 1 mg qd. If, in the investigator's opinion, the subject is determined to be unlikely to tolerate continued dosing at a dose of 1 mg qd, the subject should be discontinued from the study. Subjects remaining in the study will proceed to the 3-week Stable Dosing Phase; doses will be 2 mg daily x 21 days or 1 mg daily x 21 days.</description>
