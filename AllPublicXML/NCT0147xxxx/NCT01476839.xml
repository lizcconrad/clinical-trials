    <textblock>
      This phase I clinical trial studies the side effects and best dose of radiolabeled monoclonal
      antibody therapy when given together with combination chemotherapy before stem cell
      transplant and to see how well it works in treating patients with primary refractory (did not
      respond to treatment) or relapsed (returned after treatment) Hodgkin lymphoma. Radiolabeled
      monoclonal antibodies can find cancer cells and carry cancer-killing substances to them
      without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carmustine, etoposide,
      cytarabine, and melphalan (BEAM), work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or stopping them from spreading.
      Giving radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy together with combination chemotherapy may
      kill more cancer cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of the autologous hematopoietic cell
      transplantation (AHCT) regimen of yttrium Y-90 basiliximab/DOTA, given in combination with
      standard dose(s) of BEAM in patients with primary progressive or relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma
      (HL).

      II. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and characterize toxicities at each
      dose level - including time course.

      III. To evaluate hematological recovery in terms of neutrophil and platelet engraftment time.

      IV. To estimate overall response rate (ORR: complete remission [CR] + partial remission
      [PR]), response duration, overall survival, progression-free survival, and the cumulative
      incidence of non-relapse mortality and relapse/progression.

      V. To estimate the radiation doses to the whole body and normal organs through serial imaging
      studies.

      VI. To define biodistribution/extended pharmacokinetics of 111indium (In)-basiliximab/DOTA
      and 90Y- basiliximab/DOTA including terminal elimination, serum half-life (t1/2), and area
      under the curve (AUC).

      OUTLINE: DOSIMETRY STUDY: Patients receive basiliximab intravenously (IV) and indium In 111
      basiliximab IV on day -21. Patients undergo indium In 111 imaging scans daily. Patients with
      appropriate biodistribution continue on to treatment.

      TREATMENT: Patients receive basiliximab IV and yttrium Y 90 basiliximab IV on day -14.
      Patients also receive BEAM chemotherapy comprising carmustine IV over 2 hours on days -7 and
      -6, etoposide IV over 4 hours twice daily (BID) and cytarabine IV over 2 hours BID on days -5
      to -2, and melphalan IV on day -1. Patients undergo autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell
      infusion on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 90-100, 180, 1 year, 1.5
      years, and 2-5 years.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>RP2D of Yttrium-90 labeled basiliximab</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>RP2D will generally be the highest maximum tolerated dose (MTD), but it may be less than the MTD based on a review of available data/cumulative toxicities. Additional pulmonary toxicity monitoring will be performed among enrolled/treated patients with prior brentuximab vedotin exposure for both portions of the study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>DLT</measure>
    <time_frame>For 30 days post-transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicities will be recorded using two distinct grading systems: the modified Bearman Scale and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.0 scale. Observed toxicities will be summarized by type, severity, date of onset, duration (for neutropenia only), and attribution.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Best ORR</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Response will be evaluated using the revised Cheson criteria. Objective tumor response for all patients will be summarized for each dose level, and the number and percent responding combined across dose levels.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Biodistribution of basiliximab</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-basiliximab infusion; pre radiolabeled basiliximab infusion; 2 and 4-6 hours post radiolabeled basiliximab infusion; and then 1, 2, 3-4, 5, and 6 days post radiolabeled basiliximab infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Serum basiliximab levels will be evaluated. T1/2 and alpha- and beta- phase will be estimated for each patient using compartmental and non-compartmental methods, with summary statistics tabulated. Exploratory models to predict tumor response, survival, and toxicities from serum data and patient characteristics will be performed to better understand the effect of treatment on patients.</description>

    <time_frame>From stem cell infusion to death from any cause other than disease relapse or progression, assessed up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Cumulative relapse incidence will be estimated treating non-relapse related death events as competing risks and conversely, NRM will be calculated controlling for relapse as a competing risk. Cumulative incidence of NRM and relapse-related mortality will be calculated using the method of Gooley et al. Cumulative incidence differences will be assessed by Gray's test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from transplant to death from any cause, assessed up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS will be estimated using the KM product-limit method; 95% CIs will be calculated using the logit transformation and the Greenwood variance estimate.
