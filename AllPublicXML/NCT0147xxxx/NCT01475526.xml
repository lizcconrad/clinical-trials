      El Valor de Nuestra Salud [The Value of Our Health] is a 5-year study (2010-2014) involving
      grocery stores in San Diego County funded by the National Cancer Institute. The purpose of
      the study is to determine whether an in-store program can promote healthy foods through
      grocery stores. Sixteen stores in San Diego County will participate in El Valor de Nuestra
      Salud. The stores that participate in this study will be randomly assigned to either the
      intervention (program and evaluation) or control (evaluation only) group. We will test
      various strategies to promote healthy food shopping among customers of small-to-medium size
      Latino/Hispanic grocery stores. These strategies include changes to the store environment,
      food marketing efforts, and training of sales associates. Our evaluation protocol will
      determine whether the project is successful at improving aspects of the store and the
      employees, as well as whether customers shop for and eat healthier food products. The primary
      aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of the El Valor de Nuestra Salud intervention on
      consumption of fruits and vegetables among store customers.

      The stores that participated in this study were randomly assigned to either the intervention

      promote healthy food shopping among customers of small-to-medium size Latino/Hispanic grocery

      and training of sales associates. Our evaluation protocol is designed to determine whether
      the project was successful at improving aspects of the store and the employees, as well as
      whether customers shop for and eat healthier food products. Customers were recruited as they
      enter the store to participate in project interviews and objective weight measures at
      baseline, 6-months post-baseline, and 12-months post-baseline. The primary aim of the study
      is to evaluate the impact of the El Valor de Nuestra Salud intervention on consumption of
      fruits and vegetables among store customers.
