    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective genetic analysis of stored tumor tissue samples to evaluate the
      distribution of Recurrence Score® and gene groups of stage II colon cancer in African
      American (AA) and Caucasian individuals. Other covariant factors in the medical chart will be
      analyzed as well. Three institutions will contribute patients to this study with a total
      patient number goal of approximately 200 with approximately 100 being AA and approximately
      100 being Caucasian. As enrollment in this study proceeds a Caucasian subject will be matched
      for every African American enrolled.
