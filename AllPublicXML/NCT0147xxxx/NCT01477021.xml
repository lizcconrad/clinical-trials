      This phase I trial studies the side effects and how well giving autologous T cells with
      cyclophosphamide works in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma that is metastatic or
      cannot be removed by surgery. Biological therapies, such as cellular adoptive immunotherapy,
      may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving autologous
      T cells together with cyclophosphamide may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the feasibility, safety and toxicity of treating patients with NY-ESO-1 specific
      cellular adoptive immunotherapy in myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (MRCL) and synovial sarcoma
      patients receiving autologous cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ NY-ESO-1 specific T cells
      following cyclophosphamide conditioning.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the antitumor effect and persistence of adoptively transferred CD8+
      antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lines following cyclophosphamide conditioning.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -3 and -2. Patients receive
      NY-ESO-1-specific T cells IV on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 8 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histopathological documentation of the diagnosis of synovial sarcoma or myxoid
             liposarcoma with metastatic or unresectable disease who have received an alkylating
             agent containing regimen (such as doxorubicin plus ifosphamide); this includes
             patients who received an alkylating agent as part of adjuvant therapy and then
             relapsed; patients who were treated on the PICCASSO trial who have progressed will be
             allowed on the study; &quot;unresectable disease&quot; shall include patients with locally
             advanced disease where a surgery could be attempted but where this surgery would be
             mutilating, debilitating and would likely fail to result in long-term disease free
             survival; in this setting a patient might reasonably choose to undergo salvage/second
             line systemic therapy but could also pursue aggressive surgical options as standard of
             care

          -  Patients with metastatic disease must have bi-dimensionally measurable disease by
             palpation on clinical exam, or radiographic imaging (computed tomography [CT] scan)

          -  All patients must have an electrocardiogram (ECG); all patients must have a normal
             stress test within 182 days prior to treatment

          -  Patients must have already been leukapheresed on either protocol 1246 or 2365 prior to
             entry into this study; patients who are unable to have a leukapheresis product
             collected, for whatever reason, will be unable to participate in this study

          -  If there is a patient with an NY-ESO-1 expressing sarcoma who would be otherwise
             eligible for the trial, where there has been disagreement between pathologists
             regarding the histopathologic diagnosis, eligibility will be decided on by the
             principal investigator (PI)

          -  Patients must have had NY-ESO-1 specific cells already in production; patients must
             have NY-ESO-1 specific cells that have been generated and sorted; these cells may be

             potential must have a negative pregnancy test within two weeks prior to entry

          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL or glomerular filtration rate &lt; 50

          -  Significant hepatic dysfunction (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT] &gt; 150

             dysfunction (&gt;= grade 3 respiratory disorders as defined by Common Terminology
             Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version [v]4) will not allowed on study until
             their condition improves; however, patients who have recently experienced a decrease
             in their pulmonary function will be required to undergo pulmonary function testing;
             patients with a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) &lt; 1.5L or diffusing
             capacity of carbon monoxide (DLco) (corrected [corr] for hemoglobin [Hgb]) &lt; 50% will
             be excluded; patients with a reversible cause of pulmonary dysfunction may undergo
             repeat testing and enroll if their pulmonary function tests (PFT's) meet criterion

               -  Symptoms of coronary artery disease

               -  Presence of cardiac arrhythmias on EKG requiring drug therapy which has not been
                  stable for at least 6 months

          -  Patients with symptomatic untreated brain metastasis or asymptomatic untreated brain
             metastasis &gt; 1 cm will not be allowed to participate; additionally, patients with five
             or more untreated brain metastasis under 1 cm will not be allowed to participate;
             treatment may include surgery or stereotactic radiation at the discretion of the
             patient's treatment team; patients must be off steroids when starting therapy

          -  Patients with active infections or oral temperature &gt; 38.2 C within 72 hours of study
             entry or systemic infection requiring chronic maintenance or suppressive therapy

          -  Chemotherapeutic agents (standard or experimental or other immunosuppressive
             therapies) less than 3 weeks prior to T cell therapy; (patients with bulky disease may
             undergo cytoreductive chemotherapy but treatment will be discontinued at least 3 weeks
             prior to T cell infusion); patients may receive palliative radiation therapy two weeks
             prior to T cell infusion

          -  Clinically significant autoimmune disorders or conditions of immunosuppression;
             patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or human immunodeficiency

             be recently pathologic complete response (PCR)+ for hepatitis are not eligible for
             this study; virology testing will be done within 6 months of T cell infusion; the
             severely depressed immune system found in these infected patients and the possibility
             of premature death would compromise study objectives

          -  Current treatment with steroids

          -  Patients must not be receiving any other experimental drugs within 3 weeks of the
             initiation of treatment and must have recovered from all side effects of such therapy
