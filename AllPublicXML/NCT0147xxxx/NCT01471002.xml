      The main objective is to evaluate the oncologic efficacy of percutaneous cryoablation of
      renal tumors smaller than 4 cm in patients with renal cancer that cannot be offered a partial
      nephrectomy. The oncologic outcome will be assessed by the presence or absence of residue or
      recurrence during a follow-up by MRI performed the first 12 months (M1, M3, M6, M12).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients should have the following characteristics:

          -  About 75 years, or

          -  Whatever the age:

               -  A context of family-type tumor (VHL, hereditary carcinoma, tubulo-papillary ...);

               -  or solitary kidney, when the tumor is not easily accessible for nephron-sparing
                  surgery: Malignant centro-hilar or intra-parenchymal;

               -  or in a local recurrence (single or multiple) after partial nephrectomy (within a
                  limit of 3 tumors to be treated);

               -  or in a subject with impaired renal function and therefore at risk of severe
                  renal insufficiency (risk defined by a creatinine clearance below 30 ml / min by
                  MDRD formula);

               -  and who do not present any contra-indication for cryoablation treatment.

        The tumor(s) should meet the following criteria:

          -  Presence of one to three solid tumors of the native renal parenchyma with a largest
             diameter less than (or equal to) 40 mm, which corresponds to a maximum volume of about
             32 cc, as measured by MRI.

          -  A preoperative MRI is essential since this technique presents a higher sensitivity.
             This control will also give more consistency to the evaluation of the radiological
             semiology at follow-up.

          -  And its/their location(s) will be accessible to a percutaneous approach.

        The search of metastases, including a thoracic CT scan, should be negative.

        Exclusion Criter ia:

          -  - Partial nephrectomy feasible in good technical and oncologic conditions in patients
             under 75 years and in the absence of family tumors.

          -  Contraindication to any form of sedation.

          -  Irreversible coagulopathy

          -  Tumor&gt; 4cm

          -  Contraindication to MRI or gadolinium (proven allergy). NB: Patients with a glomerular
             filtration rate below 30 ml/min/1, 73 m2 will be injected with a single dose of the
             macrocyclic gadolinium with the highest thermodynamic stability (Dotarem or Prohance),
             given the united recommendations of AFSSAPS and EMA (European Medicines Agency) [45].
             On the contrary, the linear molecules of gadolinium, due to their lower stability,
             will be contra-indicated because of the risk of systemic nephrogenic fibrosis (FNS).

          -  Recurrence on the same location after a procedure performed out of the thermoablation
             protocol.

          -  Biopsy proven benign tumor

          -  Predominantly cystic tumor, defined by a necrotic content constituting over one third
             of tumor volume

          -  Presence of endo-venous extension, of proven secondary extensions, visceral or in the
             lymph nodes (especially lung). In this regard, a thoracic CT scan will be routinely
             required before treatment, according to the recommendations of urological societies.

          -  Psychiatric disorders and adults under guardianship

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding

          -  Minor patients

          -  Legal safeguard

          -  Participation in another clinical trial
