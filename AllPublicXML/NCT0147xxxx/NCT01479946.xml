  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electroporation combined with chemotherapy (ECT) has been shown to be an effective treatment
      for breast cancer that has spread to skin. In routine clinical practise, ECT is offered to
      patients when all other treatment options have been exhausted. This study tests the
      hypothesis that early treatment with ECT may result in improved local control of skin
      metastases, improved quality of life and reduced health care costs. Patients are randomised
      to either ECT given as early as possible in the course of the disease or delaying ECT for at
      least 6 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients &gt; 18 years of age

          -  Histological confirmed breast cancer

          -  Metastatic breast cancer (skin lesions only are considered as metastatic disease)

          -  Prior histological confirmation of at least one skin lesion

          -  Skin lesions must not have a depth greater than 3 cm (measured clinically if possible
             otherwise on the basis of CT/ultrasound examination

          -  Confluent skin metastases where individual lesions are hard to define in their
             entirety may not exceed a maximum area of 10 x 10 cm for each area of confluence. If
             there are several areas of confluence, the patient may be included in the study
             provided that all lesions can be treated within the time constraints of a single ECT
             session (20 minutes).

          -  Not more than ten skin lesions. Each area of confluence is considered as one lesion.

          -  A single skin lesion may not exceed 5 cm

          -  Patients may not have received more than one line of systemic treatment (chemotherapy
             or endocrine therapy) for metastatic disease following the discovery of skin
             metastases. Patients developing skin metastases for the first time during ongoing
             systemic therapy may receive one additional line of systemic treatment prior to
             inclusion.

          -  Patients in the early ECT arm may receive any other cancer treatments at the
             discretion of the treating physician starting no earlier than 2 weeks following ECT.
             This is to ensure that patients with metastatic disease in other locations will
             receive treatment that is considered suitable regardless of their participation in
             this trial. (If 2 weeks from ECT to the start of systemic treatment is judged to be
             too long by the treating physician, this patient should not be entered into the
             trial).

          -  Women of childbearing age must practice a suitable form of contraception.

          -  A life expectancy of at least 6 months.

          -  Patients with a ECOG performance status &lt; 3

          -  Signed Informed Consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have extensive and rapidly progressive visceral metastases where a delay
             in systemic therapy by eventual ECT is judged to not be in the patients` best interest

          -  Patients, who for medical reasons, cannot be given bleomycin

          -  Patients with brain metastases treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy who have
             progressive disease in the brain two months after treatment

          -  Prior cumulative dose of bleomycin exceeding 250,000 IU/m2

          -  Less than 14 days from previous cancer treatment (either local or systemic)

          -  If the patient has skin lesions that are situated in close proximity to a pacemaker
             such that an electrical field from ECT will overlap the pacemaker, the pacemaker must
             be moved to another location in order for the patient to be able to participate in the
             study

          -  Chronic renal failure (serum creatinine &gt; 150 mol/L)

          -  Inadequate liver function defined as:

        ASAT or ALAT &gt; 2.5 x ULN in the absence of liver metastases or &gt; 5 in the presence of liver
        metastases or Bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN (except in the case of Gilberts Syndrome) or Albumin &lt; 25
        g/L

        â€¢ Inadequate bone marrow reserve defined as: White blood cell count &lt; 3 X 109/L or
        Neutrophil count &lt; 1.5 X109/L or Platelet count &lt; 100 X 109/L

          -  Any severe uncontrolled systemic disease.

          -  Unable or unwilling to comply with the study protocol
