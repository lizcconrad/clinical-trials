    <textblock>
      Hypothesis 1: Self-reported health-related quality of life decreases as vision impairment
      worsens in subjects with glaucoma.

      Hypothesis 2: Changes in health-related quality of life are associated with changes in
      clinical measures of vision and performance-based measures of visual function.

      You are being asked to participate in this research study because you have glaucoma, which is
      the second leading cause of blindness in the world and accounts for 15% of blindness
      worldwide. Vision loss caused by glaucoma can significantly worsen your health-related
      quality of life. Despite the fact that glaucoma has such a big impact on a large number of
      people, research examining the long-term effects of glaucoma-related vision loss on one's
      quality of life is scarce.

      The purpose of this study is to look at the long-term effect of this condition on your
      quality of life so that we may gain valuable information about what factors influence the
      quality of life of people with glaucoma. To participate in this study, you will need to allow
      us to perform clinical tests on your eyes, to self-report your well-being and health-related
      quality of life, and to let us know how well you perform your daily life activities.
