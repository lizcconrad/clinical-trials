  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to confirm that the investigational drug Ranibizumab given by
      injection into the eye is safe and effective to use in people with diabetic macular edema
      (DME).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ranibizumab works by blocking Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), a substance which is
      found in eyes with diabetic eye disease and which causes leakage from blood vessels. Several
      studies have suggested that eyes with DME may have very high levels of VEGF; therefore,
      Ranibizumab may be helpful in blocking VEGF and decreasing DME.

      Ranibizumab has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
      treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and Retinal Vein Occlusion at the
      dose amount of 0.5 mg. Ranibizumab has not been approved for use in subjects with DME.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be eligible if the following criteria are met:

               1. Age &gt; 18 years

               2. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2)

               3. Residual edema as determined by mean foveal thickness on Cirrus OCT &gt; 300 microns
                  and leakage seen on FA at baseline

               4. Clinical evidence of retinal thickening due to macular edema involving the center
                  of the macula, associated with diabetic retinopathy.

               5. Previous history of at least 4 or more consecutive anti-VEGF intravitreal
                  injections of Pegaptanib sodium or Bevacizumab (consecutive injections
                  administered no more than 6 weeks apart in the last year) for the treatment of
                  diabetic macular edema.

               6. Previous history of focal laser and/or intravitreal steroid injection for the
                  treatment of diabetic macular edema.

               7. BCVA of 20/32-20/400 (ETDRS)

               8. Media clarity, pupillary dilation and patient cooperation sufficient to allow OCT
                  testing and retinal photography

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or known to be pregnant; also pre-menopausal women
             not using adequate contraception. . The following are considered effective means of
             contraception: surgical sterilization or use of oral contraceptives, barrier
             contraception with either a condom or diaphragm in conjunction with spermicidal gel,
             an IUD, or contraceptive hormone implant or patch.

          2. Participation in another ocular investigation or trial simultaneously.

          3. Systemic use of anti-VEGF within 3 months prior to day 0.

          4. Previous intravitreal ranibizumab within 3 months prior to day 0

          5. Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 (systolic above 180 OR diastolic above 110)

          6. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation
             in the study (e.g. chronic alcoholism, drug abuse).

          7. Evidence of vitreoretinal interface abnormality after ocular exam or OCT that may be
             contributing to the macular edema.

          8. An eye that, in the investigator's opinion, has no chance of improving in visual
             acuity following resolution of macular edema (e.g. presence of subretinal fibrosis,
             ischemic maculopathy or geographic atrophy).

          9. Presence of another ocular condition that may affect the visual acuity or macular
             edema during the course of the study (e.g. AMD, uveitis, Irvine-Gass).

         10. Evidence of active neovascularization of the iris or retina.

         11. Evidence of central atrophy or fibrosis in the study eye.

         12. Presence of substantial cataract, one that might decrease the vision by 3 or more
             lines of vision at sometime during the study.

         13. History of vitreous surgery in the study eye.

         14. History of cataract surgery within 6 months of enrollment.
