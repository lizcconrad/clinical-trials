      The purpose of this study is to assess patient preference of AZARGA® compared to COSOPT®
      after a single drop of each medication is administered to both eyes, in patients with
      open-angled glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

    <description>One drop of medication will be instilled in each eye. At one minute after instillation, subject will be given an Ocular Discomfort Scale and will record ocular discomfort on a questionnaire using a 10-point scale, with 0 being no discomfort and 09 being substantial discomfort.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of ocular hypertension, primary open-angle or pigment dispersion
             glaucoma in both eyes.

          -  On a stable regimen intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering medication within 30 days of
             screening visit.

          -  IOP considered to be safe (in the opinion of the investigator) in both eyes in such a
             way that should assure clinical stability of vision and the optic nerve throughout the
             study period.

          -  Willing to discontinue use of all other ocular drugs (prescribed and over-the-counter)
             prior to receiving the screening dose during Screening Visit and for the course of the
             study.

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known medical history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or poor tolerance to any component
             of the preparations to be used in this study that is deemed clinical significant in
             the opinion of the Principal Investigator.

          -  Corneal dystrophies in either eye.

          -  Risk of visual field or visual acuity worsening as a consequence of participating in
             this study, in the investigator's best judgment.

          -  Bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, or severe chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease that would preclude the safe administration of a topical
             beta-blocker.

          -  History of severe allergic rhinitis.

          -  Participation in any other investigational study within 30 days prior to the
             Screening/Baseline Visit.

          -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
