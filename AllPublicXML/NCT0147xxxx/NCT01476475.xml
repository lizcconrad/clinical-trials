      Primary Objective:

        -  The purpose of this study was to compare insulin glargine/ lixisenatide fixed ratio
           combination (FRC) versus insulin glargine on glycemic control over 24 weeks, as
           evaluated by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction in type 2 diabetic participants
           treated with metformin.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare insulin glargine/lixisenatide FRC versus insulin glargine over 24 weeks on:

             -  Glycemic control in relation to a meal as evaluated by post-prandial plasma glucose
                and glucose excursions during a standardized meal test;

             -  Percentage of participants reaching HbA1c &lt;7% or ≤6.5%;

             -  7-point Self-Monitored Plasma Glucose (SMPG) profile;

             -  Body weight;

             -  Insulin glargine dose

             -  Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG);

             -  Percentage of participants requiring rescue therapy during the 24-week open label
                treatment period;

        -  To assess safety and tolerability of insulin glargine/lixisenatide FRC.

    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia was an event during which typical symptoms of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a measured plasma glucose concentration of ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). Participants without any post-baseline on-treatment value for HbA1c were counted as non-responders if they experienced at least one documented symptomatic hypoglycemia before the introduction of rescue medication and up to 1 day after the last injection of IMP. Otherwise, they were counted as missing data. On-treatment period for this efficacy variable was defined as the time from the first dose of study drug till before the introduction of rescue medication and up to 14 days after the last injection of IMP.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Participants without any post-baseline on-treatment values (for HbA1c and body weight) that were no more than 30 days apart were counted as non-responders if at least one of the components (for HbA1c and body weight) was available and showed non-response. Otherwise, they were counted as missing data.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Documented Symptomatic and Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose of study drug up to 3 days after the last dose administration (maximum of 219 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia was an event during which typical symptoms of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a measured plasma glucose concentration of ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L).Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was an event requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. These episodes were associated with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure, unconsciousness or coma. All episodes in which neurological impairment was severe enough to prevent self-treatment and which were thought to place participants at risk for injury to themselves or others.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 70 centers in 13 countries. A total of 520 participants were screened between November 21, 2011 and June 08, 2012. Out of 520 participants, 197 were screen failure; main reason for screen failure was that glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values were out of the protocol defined range.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 323 participants were randomized in 1:1 ratio to insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio combination (FRC) and insulin glargine arms, stratified by screening HbA1c values (&lt;8% or ≥8%) and screening body mass index (BMI) values (&lt;30 kg/m^2, ≥30 kg/m^2).</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>30-minute and 1-hour plasma glucose excursion = 30-minute and 1-hour PPG minus plasma glucose value obtained 30 minutes prior to the start of the meal and before IMP administration. Change in plasma glucose excursion was calculated by subtracting baseline value from Week 24 value. Missing data was imputed using LOCF. On-treatment period for this efficacy variable was defined as the time from the first dose of study drug till before the introduction of rescue medication and up to the date of last injection of IMP.</description>

        <description>Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia was an event during which typical symptoms of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a measured plasma glucose concentration of ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). Participants without any post-baseline on-treatment value for HbA1c were counted as non-responders if they experienced at least one documented symptomatic hypoglycemia before the introduction of rescue medication and up to 1 day after the last injection of IMP. Otherwise, they were counted as missing data. On-treatment period for this efficacy variable was defined as the time from the first dose of study drug till before the introduction of rescue medication and up to 14 days after the last injection of IMP.</description>
