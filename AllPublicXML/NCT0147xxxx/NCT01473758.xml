  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate if roflumilast can reduce the neutrophilic
      inflammation at acute exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). In
      addition, the potential benefit of roflumilast on severity and recovery periods of acute COPD
      exacerbations will be assessed using patient diaries and questionnaires.

      Participants will be asked whether they agree to participate in the measurements of arterial
      stiffness. Participants who agree will be included in the substudy, with the target of 60
      patients with arterial stiffness measurements to complete the trial.

      Study was terminated due to difficulty in identifying further eligible patients for this
      exploratory study within a reasonable time.

          <description>Sputum samples were collected and processed at the investigational site according to their standard procedures. Total cell count (absolute number of nonsquamous cells per gram of the original sputum sample) were determined using a Neubauer hemocytometer. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. Covariates for Mixed Model Repeated Measurement (MMRM) are baseline value, treatment, visit, and treatment by visit interaction.</description>

        <description>Sputum samples were collected and processed at the investigational site according to their standard procedures. Aliquots of a cell suspension prepared from the sputum sample were used to prepare cytospin slides that were stained with Diff-Quik for differential cell counts. 100 cells were counted and the percentage of macrophages was determined. A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement. Covariates for Mixed Model Repeated Measurement (MMRM) are baseline value, treatment, visit, and treatment by visit interaction.</description>

        <description>Sputum samples were collected and processed at the investigational site according to their standard procedures. Aliquots of a cell suspension prepared from the sputum sample were used to prepare cytospin slides that were stained with Diff-Quik for differential cell counts. 100 cells were counted and the percentage of lymphocytes was determined. A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement. Covariates for Mixed Model Repeated Measurement (MMRM) are baseline value, treatment, visit, and treatment by visit interaction.</description>

        <description>The CAT is a short, validated, patient-completed questionnaire to assess the impact of COPD on health status. It comprises 8 questions that cover a broad range of effects of COPD on patients' health. Each question is scored in a range between 0 and 5, with the higher end indicating a higher impact of COPD on the patient's wellbeing. The CAT Total score ranges from 0 best) to 40 (Worst). A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. Covariates for MMRM are stable state value, treatment, time point, and treatment by time point interaction.</description>

        <description>Any increase in the following respiratory symptoms: dyspnea, sputum purulence, sputum amount, wheeze, sore throat, cough, fever, symptoms of a common cold, ie, nasal congestion and discharge over the previous 24 hours were recorded in a daily diary. Diaries Symptom Score range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating worse health status. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. Covariates for Mixed Model Repeated Measurement (MMRM) are stable state value, treatment, time point, and treatment by time point interaction.</description>
