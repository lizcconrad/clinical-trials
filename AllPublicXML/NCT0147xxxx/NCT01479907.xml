  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this double-blinded prospective randomised trial is to explore the potential
      benefits of early postoperative administration of Synbiotics (combination of prebiotics and
      probiotics) to patients who have undergone colectomy for cancer. The patients are randomised
      to either synbiotics or placebo administration at the day they are able to tolerate po liquid
      diet and for 15 days thereafter.

      Primary end points of the study will be:

      Assessment of gastrointestinal function-related quality of life at 1, 3 and 6 months
      postoperatively by the use of the validated questionnaire GIQLI (Gastrointestinal Quality of
      Life Index)

      Secondary end points will be:

      -Assessment of functional bowel disorders (diarrhea, constipation, etc) at 1, 3 and 6 months
      postoperatively based on the respective domains of the validated instrument EORTC QLQ-C30

      The study patients are randomized before surgery to receive either synbiotics (Synbiotics
      group) or placebo (Control group). Equal randomization is accomplished using a
      computer-generated random allocation schedule. The method of allocation concealment is
      sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes technique. Both synbiotics and placebo
      preparations are in foil-sealed sachets stored in identical numbered containers. Both study
      products are white powders, identical in weight, smell, and taste. Thus, the identity of the
      specific product is blind to participants, support staff and investigators for the entire
      duration of the study period.

    <description>A specific multistrain/multifi ber synbiotic composition of prebiotics and probiotics (Synbiotic Forteâ„¢, &quot;IONIA&quot; Pharmaceuticals, Athens, Greece) was administered at the active comparator arm of the study. It contained 10 [11] of each of four lactic acid bacteria (LAB): Pediococcus pentosaceus 5-33:3, Leuconostoc mesenteroides 32-77:1, Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei 19, and Lactobacillus plantarum 2362, and 2.5 g of each of the four fermentable fibers (prebiotics): b-glucan, inulin, pectin and resistant starch. The synbiotics were delivered in sachets and then mixed with water (12 g in 250 mLof water once daily). Th e treatment started on the day patients tolerated per os liquid intake (2nd-4th POD). The intervention period lasted 15 days.</description>

    <description>The patients belonging to the placebo comparator arm received only the 4 fi bers and no LAB (12 gin 250 mLof water once daily for 15 days). All the subjects were interviewed by a dedicated research fellow (KP) and reactions to the product, and any adverse events occurring in the 15-day period were recorded.</description>
