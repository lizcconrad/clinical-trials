      1. Briefly describe the purpose of this protocol: This study is designed to evaluate the
           effectiveness of an educational training program on the topic of health literacy for
           Family Medicine residents. The hypothesis being tested is that training residents about
           health literacy will result in improvements in residents' knowledge, skills, and
           attitudes with respect to health literacy.

        2. Briefly summarize how participants are recruited: OHSU Family Medicine Interns attending
           mandatory trainings on the topic of health literacy throughout the three years of the
           residency program will be invited to participate in the study.

        3. Briefly describe the procedures subjects will undergo: Completion of a short
           self-administered anonymous survey before and after a variety of learning sessions on
           the topic of health literacy.

        4. If applicable, briefly describe survey/interview instruments used: A 12-item pre-test
           questionnaire and 13-item post-test questionnaire designed to assess individuals'
           knowledge about health literacy, and intended clinical practices with respect to health
           literacy.

        5. If this is a clinical trial using an experimental drug and/or device, or an approved
           drug and/or device used for an unapproved purpose, briefly describe the drug and/or
           device: n/a

        6. Briefly describe how the data will be analyzed to address the purpose of the protocol:
           Demographics and responses to individual items will be reported as frequencies and
           percentages within the sample. We will use a chi-square analysis to stratify responses
           by demographic groups and t-tests to measure possible changes over time
