  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MAN-BIOPSY pursues the concrete research question whether novel biological and
      psycho-physiological clusters or categories can be defined to improve treatment and minimize
      side effects in psychiatry, based on a synopsis of physiological, behavioural, genetic and
      endocrinological parameters. One major aspect of our research approach is its focuses on the
      identification of dysfunctions in fundamental information processing mechanisms and
      neurocomputational mechanisms, and is not restricted to symptom-oriented tasks.

      The main objectives of MAN-BIOPSY are therefore

        -  to identify biological and psycho-physiological parameters for major depressive
           disorders and anxiety disorders, and

        -  to identify predictive markers for treatment response and type/severity of side effects
           for these disorders.
