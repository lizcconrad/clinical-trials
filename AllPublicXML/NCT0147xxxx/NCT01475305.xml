  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the suitability of the challenge model in measuring the
      efficacy of MEDI-557 compared to placebo in healthy adult participants for the reduction in
      the incidence of RSV through 12 days post-RSV challenge with the RSV Memphis-37 strain.

    <textblock>
      This is designed to be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Approximately 30
      participants will be randomized, dosed and followed. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to receive a single intravenous (IV) dose of MEDI-557 or placebo. Participants will be
      inoculated with RSV-A. Participants will be followed for efficacy for 12 days post-RSV
      challenge. Safety follow-up will be approximately 12 months from randomization.

          <description>The AUC (0-infinity) is the area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time, calculated as the sum of AUC(last) and C(last)/lambda(z); wherein AUC(last) is area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to last quantifiable time, C(last) is the last observed quantifiable concentration, and lambda(z) is elimination rate constant.</description>

        <title>Volume of Distribution at Steady-State (Vss) of MEDI-557</title>
        <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired blood concentration of a drug. Steady state volume of distribution (Vss) is the apparent volume of distribution at steady-state which is estimated by (D/AUC[0-infinity])*(AUMC[0-infinity])/AUC[0-infinity]) where D is the dose of study drug, AUMC(0-infinity) is the area under the first moment curve extrapolated to infinity and AUC(0-infinity) is the area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time.</description>
