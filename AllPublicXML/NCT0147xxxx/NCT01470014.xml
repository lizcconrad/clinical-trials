  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnostic criteria for isolated left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (IVNC)
      have been well established for echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance, such
      validation is lacking for computed tomography (CT). Such criteria are of great clinical
      relevance as a growing number of patients undergo a cardiac CT scan in daily clinical
      routine.

      The investigators aim to test the diagnostic accuracy of cardiac CT in distinguishing IVNC
      from lesser degrees of trabecular layering seen in potential differential diagnoses such as
      cardiomyopathies and left ventricular hypertrophy or dilation.

      The investigators hypothesize that echocardiographic diagnosed pathological trabeculation can
      be distinguished by determining the ratio of non-compacted to compacted myocardium on cardiac
      CT.
