    <textblock>
      Although some causal factors in allergy development such as allergen exposure and
      environmental pollution have decreased during recent years, the incidence of the allergic
      diseases has increased in the Western world. Since the genetic predisposition to develop
      allergies cannot change in such a short time it is conceivable that, instead of the emerging
      of some new and unknown risk factors, some protective factors seem to have disappeared in the
      Western world.

      Allergic disease is a tendency to develop allergies to allergens in the surrounding
      environment. The most common symptoms are eczema and food allergy in the early life,
      bronchial asthma (AB) later in childhood and allergic rhino conjunctivitis (ARC) during
      school age and adolescence, the so-called allergic march. Some person may develop only one,
      but others some or all of the symptoms. Inheritance, environment and allergen exposure are
      important factors affecting this march but there are important factors that predict later
      development of diseases. Sensitization to egg (positive skin prick test or specific IgE to
      egg in the serum) combined with skin problems in infancy predispose strongly to the
      development of allergic asthma in later life.

      The purpose of this work is to supply children with early development of IgE associated
      eczema and food allergy with omega-3 LCPUFA before the age of 12 months and assess the effect
      of the supplementation on the future development of skin symptoms, food allergy,
      sensitisation against inhalant allergens and asthma in these children. We will also assess
      immunological markers of Th2-skewed immunity in relation to clinical effect of the
      supplementation.

      Families with children younger than 12 months referred to the paediatric department at
      Linköping University Hospital, Motala, Norrköping and Jönköping Hospitals in the South East
      of Sweden, with the diagnosis IgE associated eczema and sensitised against food allergens
      (egg, milk, wheat and/or soya) will be invited to participate in this study. Clinical
      examination by a paediatrician and assessment of disease severity with SCORAD will be
      performed by a research nurse at inclusion. The children will be assessed every six months by
      a nurse until 2.5 years of age and by a paediatrician at 3 years of age. Later clinical
      assessment will be performed yearly until age 7.
