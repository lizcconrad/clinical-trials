    <textblock>
      This phase 2/3, open-label extension study will evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of
      intravenous (IV) infusions of SBC-102 in children with Lysosomal Acid Lipase (LAL) Deficiency
      who previously received treatment with SBC-102.

    <textblock>
      Early onset LAL Deficiency is a very rare form of LAL Deficiency, with an estimated
      prevalence of less than 2 lives per million (Meikle et al., 1999). This form of the disease,
      named after the physician who first described it (Abramov et al., 1956), is the most
      aggressive presentation of LAL Deficiency and is characterized by gastrointestinal and
      hepatic manifestations including marked growth failure, malabsorption, steatorrhea, and
      hepatomegaly. Early onset LAL Deficiency is rapidly progressive and fatal usually within the
      first year of life (Assmann &amp; Seedorf, 2001).

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of SBC-102 therapy on overall
      survival at 12 months of age in children with growth failure due to LAL Deficiency.

      All subjects will receive repeat IV infusions of SBC-102, beginning at least 1 week after the
      preceding infusion in study LAL-CL03 or under an expanded access treatment regimen.
