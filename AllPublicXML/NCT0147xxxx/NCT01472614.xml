  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open clinical study for 12 weeks of therapy to investigate clinical efficacy and
      safety of an add-on therapy with DLBS3233 in improving blood glucose control, lipid profile,
      and adiponectin in subjects with type-2 diabetes mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will only be one group in this study who will receive study treatment as follows:
      anti-diabetic agents currently used by respective subjects for at least 3 months prior to
      Screening, treatment intensification (lifestyle modification), and DLBS3233 at a dose of 100
      mg once daily for 12 weeks.

      Clinical and laboratory examinations to evaluate the investigational drug's efficacy and
      safety will be performed at baseline and at interval of 6 weeks over the 12-week course of
      therapy.
