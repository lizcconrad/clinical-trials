    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1, dose escalation study of oral ARQ 092 administered to
      subjects with advanced solid tumors and recurrent malignant lymphoma. The study is designed
      to explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ARQ 092 and to
      define a recommended Phase 2 dose of ARQ 092.

    <description>Subjects in this study will receive ARQ 092 orally at dose levels specified for their respective dose cohorts. Dosing will begin at 10 mg every other day (QOD) and will escalate until the MTD or RP2D is determined. Cycles will be repeated in four-week (28 day) intervals until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion is met. In the case of toxicity, dose adjustment will be permitted.</description>
