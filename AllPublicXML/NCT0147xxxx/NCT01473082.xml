  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether patients with trochanteric fractures being
      treated with a Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA) and augmentation can better be
      mobilized than patients without augmentation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To avoid the pain-causing relative movement between implant and bone, surgical techniques and
      devices allowing augmentation of the femoral head have recently been developed. Biomechanical
      studies showed that augmentation leads to a better axial stability and pull-out strength. In
      clinical practice, this might facilitate early mobilization and full weight-bearing with less
      pain. The purpose of this study is therefore to evaluate whether patients with trochanteric
      fractures being treated with a PFNA and augmentation can better be mobilized than patients
      without augmentation. In particular, it will be measured whether patients with a PFNA
      Augmentation can walk faster than the non-augmented patients, measured with the Timed up and
      Go test.

    <description>The TUG measures the time (in seconds) that it takes for an individual to rise from an armchair (chair seat height = 45 cm / 1.5 feet), walk 3 meters (= 10 feet) to a line drawn on the floor, turn around and return to the chair. The time is measured from a seated position (back against the backrest) with a stopwatch started on the command &quot;ready - go&quot; and stopped when the seat position is reached again. Patient-perceived pain and exertion will be assessed after the test.</description>
