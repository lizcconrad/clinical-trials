  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study of the effect of Vitamin D on breast cancer. We hope to learn
      whether Vitamin D can change characteristics of certain genes in a breast cancer tumor that
      affect its growth. We believe some of these characteristics may be influenced by body weight.

      This protocol is a randomized, controlled and blinded clinical trial in obese and non-obese
      subjects diagnosed with breast cancer in whom we will test the effects of vitamin D
      supplementation in the neoadjuvant setting and evaluate changes in biomarker expression in
      blood and tissue comparing core breast biopsy to definitive surgical samples. Our goal is to
      determine whether dietary vitamin D can reverse the negative effects of obesity and insulin
      resistance as reflected by favorable changes in the gene expression patterns in the
      pathologic specimens as well as in serum biomarkers of insulin resistance and adipokine
      secretion. We expect that vitamin D administration will improve the breast cancer gene
      expression pattern from a high-risk configuration to a low-risk profile in the obese patients
      and will also cause improvement in the non-obese.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  3.1.1 Women who have undergone a core needle biopsy demonstrating an operable breast
             cancer whom have not yet had any further therapy.

          -  3.1.2 No prior therapy for breast cancer.

          -  3.1.4 Age 18 years or older.

          -  3.1.5 Any menopausal status

          -  3.1.6 Planned surgical resection of breast cancer or repeat core biopsy tissue
             sampling prior to initiation of neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy.

          -  3.1.7 Availability of tissue blocks from initial core needle biopsy.

          -  3.1.8 Signed informed consent.

          -  3.1.9 Willing to discontinue use of all supplements containing Vitamin D for the
             duration of the study, and take only the Vitamin D provided by the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  3.2.1 Presence of any Metastatic lesion.

          -  3.2.2 History of parathyroid disease, hypercalcemia, or kidney stones.

          -  3.2.3 History of SERM or aromatase inhibitor therapy.

          -  3.2.4 Taking metformin.

          -  3.2.5 History of renal failure requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation.

          -  3.2.6 Women who are known to be pregnant or who are nursing. (As vitamin D does not
             have toxicity to the fetus, a negative pregnancy test is not a requirement to
             participate in the study.)

          -  3.2.7 Patients planned for surgical therapy of their breast cancer or initiation of
             systemic chemotherapy, that would not allow for at least 7 days of vitamin D
             intervention

          -  3.2.9 Any condition potentially interfering with subjects ability to comply with
             taking study medication.

          -  3.2.10 Any medical condition that would potentially interfere with vitamin D
             absorption.

          -  3.2.11 Current participation in another research study that would increase risk to
             subject, in the opinion of the investigators.

          -  3.2.12 Patients currently taking more than 2000 IU of Vitamin D.
