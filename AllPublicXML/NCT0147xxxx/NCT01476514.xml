    <textblock>
      Mutations in genes affecting pain transmission start to be known, the investigators are
      investigating a mutation in a glycine channel, which has an influence on pain modulation.
      Pain modulation is the ability of the central nervous system to enhance or diminish the
      sensation of pain. The investigators therefore will test patients and healthy volunteers with
      quantitative sensory tests, basically determining the point at which a stimulation just
      starts to induce pain. These tests are reliable and permit a direct comparison between
      healthy volunteers and patients with the affected glycine gene.

      Background

      Hyperekplexia, also known as hereditary startle disease or stiff baby syndrome, is a rare
      neurogenetic non-epileptic disorder characterized by exaggerated persistent startle response
      and neonatal hypertonia to unexpected auditory, somatosensory and visual stimuli. Startle
      responses and generalized muscle stiffness both gradually subside during the first months of
      life. Pathological startle responses can remain throughout adulthood resulting in unprotected
      falls and injury.

      Hereditary hyperekplexia has been identified in 70 pedigrees, most of them being
      characterized by the major form. Some occasional occurrence of the minor form was described
      in rare families, but its presence may remain clinically undetected.

      The clinical diagnosis of the major form of hyperekplexia needs three mandatory features:

        1. Generalized stiffness after birth normalizing during the first years of life

        2. Excessive startling to an unexpected stimulus, particularly auditory, present from birth
           and remaining throughout life

        3. Generalized stiffness after a startle reflex that lasts a few seconds Five genes are
           associated with hyperekplexia, the disease being caused by mutations in the genes
           encoding different subunits of the inhibitory postsynaptic glycine receptor GLRA1 and
           GLRB. Additionally defects in the presynaptic glycine transporter gene (SLC6A5) have
           been recently identified in human hyperekplexia. GPHN, encoding the glycinergic
           clustering molecule gephyrin, and ARHGEF9, an X-linked gene encoding collybistin, are
           each associated with one known case of hyperekplexia.

      The glycine receptor is a member of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel family. The
      receptor is a membrane-embedded protein that contains an integral Cl- -selective pore. The
      glycine receptor is the major determinant of inhibitory neurotransmission in the retina,
      spinal cord and brainstem.

      Inhibitory synaptic transmission in the spinal cord dorsal horn use GABA and glycine as their
      principle fast neurotransmitters. Both of them open the Cl- -channels, which induce
      postsynaptic hyperpolarisation and impairs the propagation of excitatory potentials on
      dendrites of neurons. Immunofluorescence studies have revealed abundant glycinergic
      innervations in the dorsal horn, site attributed to the long standing gate control theory of
      pain. According to this model, inhibitory GABAergic and glycinergic interneurons in the
      superficial spinal dorsal horn are key components in the control of pain transmission from
      the periphery to the brain. The model states that a non-painful stimulation is felt as non
      painful as long as the synaptic GABAergic and glycinergic inhibition remains intact.

      Pharmacological blockade of GABAergic and/or glycinergic neurotransmission in the dorsal horn
      mimics many symptoms of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Additionally, a loss of synaptic
      inhibition in the dorsal horn occurs in animal models of experimental pain. This is difficult
      to prove experimentally in humans, although studies on nociceptive long term potentiation
      suggest that loss of inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal horn may have a role in the
      development of chronic pain in patients.

      Objective

      The aim of this study is to evaluate for the first time in humans whether symptomatic
      mutations in the glycinergic system affect central pain processing. Positive results would be
      suggestive for an important role of the glycinergic system in pain modulation and would
      therefore stimulate further developments for the pharmacological modulation of human pain
      syndromes.

      Methods

      Design Assessment of pain thresholds in consecutive hyperekplexia patients and a group of sex
      and age-matched healthy volunteers.

      Subjects We will test consecutive patients with one of the five mutations cited in the
      introduction. Patients will receive a compensation of 150 Swiss Francs for their
      participation, plus reimbursement of travel costs.

      23 hyperekplexia patients will be recruited. Once the testing of these patients is completed,
      45 healthy age and sex-matched controls will be enrolled.

      Treatment with a GABA-agonist (mainly clonazepam) will not be discontinued for safety reasons
      .

    <time_frame>Within 0 to 33 seconds after the beginning of the stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Pain detection thresholds will be measured with an electronic pressure algometer applied at the center of the pulp of the 2nd toe. The probe has a surface area of 1 cm2. The pressure is increased from 0 at a rate of 30kPa/s to a maximum pressure of 1000kPa. Pain detection threshold is defined as the point at which the pressure sensation turns to pain. The subjects are instructed to press a button when these points are reached. The algometer displays the pressure intensity at which the button is pressed.</description>

    <time_frame>Within 50 to 150 ms after the beginning of stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Electromyographic (EMG) reflex responses to electrical stimulation will be recorded from the middle of the biceps femoris and the rectus femoris muscles (Ag/AgCl-electrodes). A 25 ms, train-of-five, 1 ms, square-wave impulse (perceived as a single stimulus), will be delivered. The current intensity will be increased from 1 mA in steps of 1 mA until: 1) a biceps femoris reflex with an amplitude exceeding 20 mV for at least 10 ms in the 50-150 ms post-stimulation interval will be detected (single stimulus reflex threshold); and 2) a pain sensation will be evoked (single stimulus pain threshold).</description>

    <measure>Heat and cold pain detection thresholds, as measured with a thermode in degrees Celsius</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 0 to 14 seconds after the beginning of the stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>A thermode will be applied to the skin. The temperature of the thermode will be continuously increased from 30 ºC to a maximum of 50.5 ºC at a rate of 1.5 ºC/s. Pain detection threshold is defined as for pressure stimulation. The subjects are instructed to press a button when this point is reached. For cold stimulation, the temperature of the thermode will be continuously decreased from 30 ºC to a minimum of 0 ºC at a rate of 1.5 ºC/sec. Pain detection threshold is defined as for pressure stimulation. The subjects are instructed to press a button when this point is reached.</description>

    <measure>Ice water pain threshold of the hand as measured in seconds the hand was left in the water, measured with ice water container</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 0 to 2 minutes after the beginning of the stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>The device consists of a container separated into an outer and an inner part by a mesh screen. The mesh screen prevents direct contact between the ice (placed in the outer part) and the hand of the subject (placed in the inner part). The water is regularly mixed to maintain the temperature in the inner part near to 0°C. The subject places his hand, wide open and to the wrist, into the inner part of the container. He is asked to keep it in the water until he feels an intolerable sensation of pain and is forced to remove his hand from the container, in any case for a maximum time of 2 min.</description>
