      This study aims to evaluate the potential of 2-(5- Fluoro pentyl)-2-methyl malonic acid
      ([18F]ML10), as an apoptosis imaging biomarker and its potential to predict response in
      patients with Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

      Apoptosis or programmed cell death mechanisms are disrupted in cancer cells allowing them to
      live longer and grow faster than normal cells. Apoptosis is a key target for several novel
      anti-cancer agents. A biomarker that could permit imaging levels of ongoing apoptosis could
      be a powerful tool in associated drug development programs by providing relevant data to
      support proof of concept. In addition, use in the clinical setting may permit the tailoring
      of treatment for individual patients balancing efficacy of treatment with known toxicity
      levels. This study aims to evaluate the potential of 2-(5- Fluoro pentyl)-2-methyl malonic
      acid ([18F]ML10), as an apoptosis imaging biomarker and its potential to predict response in
      patients with Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma. All patients will have a baseline [18F]ML10 PET-CT scan
      and a post-treatment scan after the initiation of the first course of intravenous
      chemotherapy. The study aims to enrol unto 16 subjects with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma.
