  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers aimed to investigate the effect of point-of-care platelet function assay on
      the periprocedural cardiac enzyme elevation in patients with diabetes mellitus.

      All patients who are supposed to undergo coronary angiography were loaded with clopidogrel
      (300mg) and aspirin (300mg) at D-1. If patients were determined to implant coronary stent
      after diagnostic coronary angiography, their platelet function is assayed with Verifynow-ADP
      (Accumetrics). If patients have &gt;270 unit in the assay, they are randomized to abciximab or
      control group. After successful stent implantation, cardiac enzymes (CK-MB, Troponin-I) are
      followed at 8hr, 16hr and 24hr. Clinical outcomes including bleeding complications are
      assessed at 1 month.

    <description>The investigators will check cardiac enzymes at 8hrs, 16hrs and 24hrs after percutaneous coronary intervention. We will take the highest value among those measured at three time points as a patient's peak cardiac enzyme level. The primary outcome of this study is to compare the peak cardiac enzyme level between two groups.</description>
