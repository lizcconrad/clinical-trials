    <textblock>
      Colorectal liver metastases (CLM) are currently considered an absolute contraindication for
      liver transplantation (Lt) although Lt for other primary and secondary liver malignancies
      show excellent outcome in selected patients. Before 1995, several Lts for CLM were performed,
      but the outcome was poor (18% 5-year survival) and Lt for CLM was stopped. Since then,
      several advances have been achieved and survival following Lt has improved by almost 30%.
      Thus, a 5-year survival of about 50% following Lt for CLM could be anticipated.

      The investigators have previously included 21 patients in a pilot study. All patients had
      advanced CLM at the time of Lt. Long term overall survival (OS) exceeds by far previously
      reported outcome for this patient group and is comparable or better than survival following
      repeat Lt for non-malignant diagnoses. Development of robust selection criteria may further
      improve the results.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to explore whether liver
      transplantation in selected patients with liver metastases from CRC can obtain significant
      life extension and better health related quality of life compared to patients receiving
      surgical resection.

      The investigators will also explore if patient selection according to nomo-grams for outcome
      of colorectal cancer can define a subgroup of patients with a 5 year survival of at least 50%
      or even cure from the disease.
