    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to understand whether there is any difference in the
      amount of tasimelteon in the blood in smokers versus non-smokers. Additionally, this study
      will provide an assessment of the effect, if any, of age and body size on the safety and
      tolerability profile and the pharmacokinetics of tasimelteon.
