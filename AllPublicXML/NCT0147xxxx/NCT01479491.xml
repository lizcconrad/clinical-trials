    <description>Data source will be the Japan Medical Data Centre Company Limited (JMDC) - JMDC Medical Data Bank (JMDC-MDB) database. Aggregated data (age in months and years and gender) for all subjects recorded in the database and subject-level data for IS cases will be extracted from the database. This database will be reviewed to extract data for the period between January 2005 and April 2011. Cases of IS will be identified using the International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) diagnostic codes, examination codes and procedural codes.</description>
