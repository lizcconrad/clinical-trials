  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent neurocognitive deficits are a major cause of severe disability and impaired
      long-term psychosocial outcome in schizophrenia (SZ). In particular, within the auditory
      system, early deficits such as the behavioral and neurophysiological ability to match tones
      that vary in pitch correlate with impairments in auditory emotion recognition (affective
      prosody) and general functioning, suggesting that interventions aimed at remediating
      sensory-level dysfunction may lead to significant improvement in higher order
      cognitive/emotion processes. Efforts to ameliorate cognitive deficits in schizophrenia
      utilize either pharmacological agents or behavioral treatments such as cognitive remediation,
      which generally focus on higher order processes, and not on the early sensory processing
      which may be key to functioning.

      Numerous pharmacological agents have been proposed, but accumulating evidence suggests that
      dysfunction of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor may be one of the root causes of
      schizophrenia, including sensory and cognitive impairments, suggesting that an NMDA based
      treatment may be efficacious in reversing these deficits. D-Cycloserine, a synthetic partial
      NMDA agonist has been used in anxiety disorders to augment learning in cognitive remediation.
      Because of a tendency to act as an NMDA antagonist at higher doses D-cycloserine is not
      effective in schizophrenia. In contrast, D-serine (DSR), is a full agonist, and is therefore
      more ideal for enhancing NMDA function and cognitive remediation. While previous use of DSR
      was limited by safety concerns in rodents,the investigators have shown that it can safely be
      used at doses of 60 mg/kg and, moreover, demonstrates converging improvement in symptomatic,
      cognitive and sensory-based measures in schizophrenia. Evidence also suggests that NMDA
      receptor dysfunction in schizophrenia may be relative, rather than absolute, suggesting that
      the enhanced practice of a cognitive remediation paradigm might be able to overcome reduced
      plasticity and treat cognitive dysfunction.

      This project will be the first to combine the NMDA based and sensory-based cognitive
      remediation (SBR) approaches, and will utilize not only DSR, but also a tone matching SBR
      paradigm has been shown to enhance learning in healthy controls, as well as a paradigm
      designed to augment visual motion detection. This study will pilot these interventions in a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover design that will use neurophysiology
      together with cognitive tests to explore the effects on brain activity and cognitive function
      in 16 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The investigators hypothesize
      that DSR+SBR will lead to improvement. Subjects will have an initial visit to establish
      baseline performance on cognitive tasks before returning for 3 visits when they will receive
      blinded study medication [60 mg/kg of DSR (2 days) or placebo (1 day)] in a randomized order.
      The procedures on the treatment days will include the SBR paradigm and pre/post
      neurophysiological measurements. Primary outcomes are improvements in neurophysiologic and
      behavioral sensory processing. The main goal is to establish the preliminary efficacy to use
      in a follow-up multi-dose study utilizing a multiple session SBR R01 application.

    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Three 80-tone pair blocks will be used per session (~1 hour with breaks). To minimize practice effects, we will use a different base tone for each treatment day (e.g. 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz), also in a randomized counter-balanced order. To assess the improvement over a treatment day, we will record the ratio of the frequencies in all tone pairs. To correct this non-normal distribution we take the natural log of each of these ratios to determine the tone matching threshold.</description>

    <measure>Mismatch Negativity (MMN)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MMN will be obtained independently to pitch stimuli utilizing the same base frequencies as the SBR, (e.g. 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz). Two sessions will be held each day, both before and after study drug/SBR intervention. MMN will be generated using previously published methods. MMN is maximal at frontocentral electrodes (Fz, Cz). For all measures, peak amplitude at frontocentral electrodes within predefined latency range will be primary outcome measure. We primarily evaluate effect of study drug.</description>

    <measure>Tone Matching</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This task consists of pairs of 100-ms tones in series, with 500-ms intertone interval. Within each pair, tones are either identical or differed in frequency by specified amounts in each block (2.5%, 5%, 10%, 20%, or 50%). In each block, 12 of the tones are identical and 14 are dissimilar. Tones are derived from 3 reference frequencies (500, 1000, and 2000 Hz) to avoid learning effects.</description>

    <description>Subjects will then undergo three treatment visits. Each visit will begin with a pre treatment MMN/visual motion paradigm. Subjects will then receive DSR (60 mg/kg) or placebo and begin a one-hour SBR intervention. SBR will begin approximately 30 minutes after drug administration, to coincide with peak serum DSR level. Finally, to evaluate the effects of SBR and NMDA treatment on neurophysiology, subjects will complete a post treatment ERP paradigm. Treatment days will be separated by 1 week to reduce carryover effect. To increase power, each subject will undergo two DSR treatment days and 1 placebo day, with the placebo day selected randomly from among the three treatment days, in counter balanced order. Treatment assignment (drug and SBR) will be double blinded. Follow-up cognitive and safety measures will also be completed on the final treatment day.</description>
