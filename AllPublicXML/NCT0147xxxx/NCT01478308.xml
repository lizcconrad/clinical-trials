      This study is being conducted to determine the effectiveness of standard 3 weekly treatments
      using docetaxel and prednisone with metformin in patients with castration-resistant
      metastatic prostate cancer.

      It is also being conducted to determine the levels of toxicity of metformin when added to
      every 3 weekly docetaxel treatments in patients with endocrine resistent, metastatic prostate
      cancer.

      This is a single-arm, non-randomized Phase II trial of docetaxel given every 3 weeks with
      metformin twice daily and Prednisone twice daily. The study duration of this trial is open
      ended. The patient would take the metformin only for as long as they are treated with
      docetaxel.

    <intervention_name>Metformin hydrochloride</intervention_name>
    <description>Metformin is administered orally, with food. Metformin tablets contain 500mg, 850mg, or 1000mg of metformin hydrochloride. Tablets contain inactive ingredients including pofidone and magnesium stearate. The coating for 500mg and 850mg tablets contains hypromellose. Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.In this study, Metformin will be given 850 mg orally, with food, once daily for 1 week starting the week before first docetaxel infusion, and thereafter 850 mg twice daily.</description>
