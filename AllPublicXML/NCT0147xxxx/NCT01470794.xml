  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study evaluating the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of
      Toca 511, a retroviral replicating vector, injected into the resection cavity of patients
      with Grade III or Grade IV Gliomas who have elected to undergo surgical removal of their
      tumor. Approximately 6 weeks after injection of Toca 511, patients will begin an oral courses
      of Toca FC, an antifungal agent. These one week courses of Toca FC will be repeated during
      the approximately 30 week study. Two separate cohorts of patients treated with Toca 511 and
      Toca FC will also be evaluated with either of the following standard treatments for glioma:
      lomustine or bevacizumab. After completion of this study, all patients will be eligible for
      enrollment and encouraged to enter a long-term continuation protocol that enables additional
      Toca FC treatment cycles to be given, as well as permits the collection of long-term safety
      and survival data.

    <description>All patients will receive Toca 511, a retroviral replicating vector that expresses the cytosine deaminase (CD) gene. CD converts the antifungal 5-FC to the anti-cancer drug 5-FU in cells that have been infected by the Toca 511 vector. Beginning approximately 6 weeks after administration of Toca 511, patients will begin courses of oral Toca FC at pre-specified intervals, depending on cohort, during the approximately 30 week study.</description>

          -  Is the patient between 18 years old and 80 years old inclusive?

          -  Has the patient had histologically proven HGG with recurrence or progression following
             initial definitive therapy(s) such as surgery with or without adjuvant radiation
             therapy and/or chemotherapy (confirmed by diagnostic biopsy or contrast-enhanced MRI
             and evaluable by Macdonald criteria)? Note if first recurrence of GBM is documented by
             MRI, an interval of at least 12 weeks after the end of prior radiation therapy is
             required unless there is either: i) histopathologic confirmation of recurrent tumor,
             or ii) new enhancement on MRI outside of the radiotherapy treatment field.
