    <textblock>
      Upper respiratory tract infections are a major source of morbidity throughout the world.
      Extracts of Korean red ginseng have been found to have the potential to modulate both natural
      and acquired immune responses. The investigators sought to examine the efficacy of an extract
      of Korean red ginseng in preventing colds. Therefore, the efficacy and safety of Korean red
      ginseng will be investigated in healthy subjects during the influenza season.

      The extract of Korean red ginseng has been found efficacious in the prevention of respiratory
      infections in healthy adults. The investigators will be conducted a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study at the onset of the influenza season. A total of 100 subjects 30-70
      years of age with a history of at least 2 colds in the previous year will be recruited from
      the general population in jeollabuk-do, South Korea. The subjects will be instructed to take
      9 capsules per day of either the Korean red ginseng extract or a placebo for a period of
      12weeks. The primary outcome measure will be the number of Jackson-verified colds. Secondary
      outcome measures will be included symptom severity, total number of days of symptoms and
      duration of all colds. Cold symptoms will be scored by subjects.

Symptom severity of all colds (score 0-27) was measured during study period. The original index consists of 9 Questions(Fever, Rhinorrhea, Nasal congestion, Sore throat, Cough, Sputum, Dyspnea, Headache, Myalgia).
Individual question response is assigned a score of between 0 (none) to 3 (severe) and summed to form a total score(summed) ranging from 0 (best) to 27 (worst).</description>

        <title>Symptom Severity of All Colds</title>
        <description>Subjects received the open-ended questions about symptom severity of all colds onset during study period. The symptom severity of all colds onset was checked weekly via telephone.
Symptom severity of all colds (score 0–27) was measured during study period. The original index consists of 9 Questions(Fever, Rhinorrhea, Nasal congestion, Sore throat, Cough, Sputum, Dyspnea, Headache, Myalgia).
Individual question response is assigned a score of between 0 (none) to 3 (severe) and summed to form a total score(summed) ranging from 0 (best) to 27 (worst).</description>
