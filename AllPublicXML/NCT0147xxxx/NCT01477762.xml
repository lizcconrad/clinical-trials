  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs in some people after exposure to events that
      cause extreme fear or helplessness. The incidence of war zones worldwide and the prevalence
      of violence in large cities in the U.S., increases the likelihood that people will experience
      a traumatizing event in their lifetime. About 1 in 10 people who survive such events will
      develop PTSD, while most people will get better over time. This suggests that some people may
      have biological vulnerabilities that make it harder for them to recover. One of these
      biological risk factors may be related to how stress hormones work in people who get sick.
      Another is how people react to things that make them afraid or nervous, investigators have
      found that PTSD patients have higher than normal fear reactions. The part of the brain that
      reacts to fearful stimulation is linked to stress hormones; the purpose of this study is to
      examine how these systems interact. The study will suppress stress hormones (cortisol)
      production in one group of participants, while another will get a placebo. When their
      cortisol is suppressed, the participants will undergo a startle study to see if their fear
      responses are decreased. Investigators expect that people PTSD will show a normal fear
      response when their cortisol levels are reduced, similar to people without PTSD. This
      research can help discover new medicines for people with PTSD.

      The proposed study will provide innovative tools to tease apart the relationship between
      amygdala-dependent neurophysiology and HPA-axis sensitivity in a human clinical population.
      Investigators have discovered that cortisol suppression reduces fear responses in PTSD
      coupled with the development of new fear conditioning paradigms, providing a unique
      opportunity to interrogate amygdala-HPA interactions to determine aspects of the
      neurobiological underpinnings of PTSD-related pathology.

      Aim 1a will examine baseline and fear-potentiated startle (FPS) response, as well as
      cognitive awareness in PTSD patients and traumatized Non-PTSD controls during a fear
      conditioning experiment 10 hours after dexamethasone administration in a double-blind,
      placebo controlled crossover design.

      Aim 1b will examine the above outcome measures in PTSD patients and controls during a fear
      conditioning experiment 1 hour after dexamethasone administration in order to control for
      direct effects of dexamethasone.

      Aim 2a will examine fear-potentiated startle (FPS) response in PTSD patients and traumatized
      Non-PTSD controls during fear extinction, when the fear is acquired 10 hours after
      dexamethasone administration in a double-blind, placebo controlled crossover design.

      Aim 2b will examine the same outcome measures in PTSD patients and controls, when the fear is
      acquired 1 hour after dexamethasone administration in order to control for direct effects of
      dexamethasone.

    <measure>Mean Baseline Startle Magnitude During Fear Conditioning</measure>
    <time_frame>10 hours after drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>The study measured the acoustic startle response magnitude to a sudden noise using electromyography of the eyeblink muscle. This response magnitude was used as the individual's baseline to compare to the startle magnitude to the danger signal to see if fear conditioning had occurred.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Startle Magnitude to Danger Signal During Fear Conditioning</measure>
    <time_frame>10 hours after drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>The acoustic startle response magnitude was measured using electromyography recordings of the eyeblink muscle when a sudden tone was delivered through headphones in the presence of a stimulus that was paired with an aversive outcome (i.e. the danger signal). If an individual showed successful fear learning, then startle to the danger signal would be greater than baseline startle.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Fear-potentiated Startle to Danger Signal During Early Extinction</measure>
    <time_frame>10 hours after drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Fear-potentiated startle was measured as a difference score between the startle to danger signal and the baseline. This difference score reflects the degree of fear response at the beginning of extinction.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Fear-potentiated Startle to Danger Signal During Late Extinction</measure>
    <time_frame>10 hours after drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>This measures the level of fear-potentiated startle (the difference between startle magnitude to the danger signal and baseline startle magnitude) at the end of extinction. Because the danger signal is no longer paired with the aversive stimulus like it was during the conditioning phase, the fear response should decrease from early to late extinction in individuals who show intact extinction learning.</description>

        <description>This measures the level of fear-potentiated startle (the difference between startle magnitude to the danger signal and baseline startle magnitude) at the end of extinction. Because the danger signal is no longer paired with the aversive stimulus like it was during the conditioning phase, the fear response should decrease from early to late extinction in individuals who show intact extinction learning.</description>

          <title>Mean Fear-potentiated Startle to Danger Signal During Late Extinction</title>
          <description>This measures the level of fear-potentiated startle (the difference between startle magnitude to the danger signal and baseline startle magnitude) at the end of extinction. Because the danger signal is no longer paired with the aversive stimulus like it was during the conditioning phase, the fear response should decrease from early to late extinction in individuals who show intact extinction learning.</description>
