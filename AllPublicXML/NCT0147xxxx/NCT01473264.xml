  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a multi-factorial disease process that is the end result
      of an immature, surfactant deficient lung that has been exposed to hyperoxia, mechanical
      ventilation and infection. These conditions initiate an inflammatory response characterized
      by elevated inflammatory cell infiltrates and proinflammatory cytokines that lead to the
      development of significant acute and chronic lung injury.

      The study drug, rhCC10, is a recombinant version of natural human CC10 protein. Native CC10
      is produced primarily by non-ciliated respiratory epithelial cells, called Clara cells and is
      the most abundant protein in the mucosal fluids in normal healthy lungs.

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and
      anti-inflammatory effects of a single intratracheal (IT) dose of rhCC10 to intubated
      premature infants receiving positive pressure ventilation for treatment of respiratory
      distress syndrome (RDS) to prevent long term respiratory complications referred to as
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and, more recently, as chronic respiratory morbidity (CRM;
      asthma, cough, wheezing, multiple respiratory infections).

      CC10 regulates inflammatory responses and protects the structural integrity of pulmonary
      tissue while preserving pulmonary mechanical function during various insults (eg. viral
      infection, bacterial endotoxin, ozone, allergens, hyperoxia). Together these properties
      suggest that administration of rhCC10 may help to facilitate development of normal airway
      epithelia and prevent the inflammation that leads to CRM in these infants.
