  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A diagnostic peripheral maternal blood test taken and the free foetal DNA is analysed and the
      presence of trisomies using a novel method.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of ~2000 participants have donated blood samples used for the development and
      validation of the IONA non-invasive prenatal screening test for Downs, Edwards and Patau
      syndrome. The IONA Test was CE marked Feb 2013. We are now recruiting a further 800
      participants to provide blood samples to further develop and verify the test for other
      chromosomal abnormalities and to improve test efficiency.
