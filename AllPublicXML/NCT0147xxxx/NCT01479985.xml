  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized clinical trial of a web-based
      contraceptive decision aid compared to routine contraceptive counseling to evaluate the
      effect of the contraceptive decision aid on the contraceptive method selected by the
      participant.

      The investigators primary hypothesis is that women utilizing a computerized Contraceptive
      Decision Aid (CDA) will be more likely to choose highly effective contraception than women
      who undergo standard clinical contraceptive counseling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our primary specific aim is to test the CDA by conducting a randomized clinical trial
      comparing the CDA to routine contraceptive counseling. Our primary outcome of interest will
      be selection of highly effective contraception including the intrauterine device (IUD), the
      implant, and injectable contraception compared to all other reversible contraceptive methods.

      We will also complete the following secondary specific aims:

        1. We will use the validated Decisional Conflict Scale to measure decisional conflict pre-
           and post-intervention and compare the change in decisional conflict score in women
           randomized to the CDA to women undergoing routine counseling.

        2. We will also evaluate satisfaction with contraceptive counseling and contraceptive
           continuation and satisfaction at 3 and 6 months.
