      The investigators will investigate

        1. the relationships between oxidative stress-, apoptosis-related markers, mitochondria DNA
           copy numbers and the clinical psychopathology of schizophrenia, including severity of
           positive and negative symptoms, obesity and metabolic syndrome.

        2. the relationships between aberrant mitochondria genes (single nucleotide polymorphism of
           D-loop region-related genes and haplogroup N9a), DISC1 gene polymorphism, and clinical
           phenotypes in Taiwanese populations.

        3. whether these biological markers could be as clinical markers in schizophrenia for a
           long-term follow-up study.

      In past study, we had shown that there were significant differences in serum Lpo (lipid
      peroxidation) and Thiol levels between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. For
      patients taking risperidone, there were significant decreases in serum Thiol levels. In
      addition, there were also significant differences in age of onset of PPAR gamma coactivator
      1α (PGC-1α) polymorphism for schizophrenia patients. Therefore, we want to know the
      relationships between oxidative stress-, apoptosis-related markers, mitochondria DNA copy
      numbers and the clinical psychopathology of schizophrenia, including severity of positive and
      negative symptoms, obesity and metabolic syndrome.

      In past study, we also found that there were significant differences in 10 SNPs located in
      the D-loop region-related genes between patients and healthy controls. Three SNPs could be
      found in Mitomap data, but another seven SNPs not been found in the Mitomap and they could be
      more confirmed. In addition, Tanaka et al. found that haplogroup N9a was related to diabetes
      and metabolic syndrome in Asia. Therefore, we were interested to clarify the relationships
      between above related mitochondria genes and clinical phenotypes in Taiwanese populations,.

      In addition, we also want to see whether these biological markers could be as clinical
      markers in schizophrenia for a long-term follow-up study.

        This study will be conducted in our clinical setting. By a semi-structured interview for
        DSM-IV criteria, about 300 schizophrenic patients will be recruited in this study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Schizophrenic patients will be recruited in psychiatric inpatients and outpatients
             departments according to DSM-IV criteria by a semi-structured interview. The
             assessment will be done by two senior psychiatrists. The intra- rater and inter-rater
             reliability will be done before this project started.

          2. The patients had the ability to complete the written inform consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Alcohol abuse or dependence

          2. Smoking more than 1 pack per day

          3. Concurrent use of mood stabilizer or beta-blocker
