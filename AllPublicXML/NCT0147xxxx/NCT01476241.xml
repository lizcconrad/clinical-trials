      The investigators main endpoint was focused on the analysis of the type, rate and the impact
      of different clinical parameters on the complications of the PEG tube placements performed at
      the Department of Otorhinolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery since October 2008. In
      addition, the investigators aimed to compare the results with a historic cohort patient group
      (September 2005 - October 2008) sent to the Department of Surgery for PEG tube placement in
      order to evaluate the results of the changed routine.

      We retrospectively reviewed a cohort of patients that had undergone PEG tube placement from
      October 2008 until October 2010 at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology - Head and Neck
      Surgery, Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH), Helsinki, Finland, with a health care
      district currently including approximately 1.5 million inhabitants. Hospital surgical and
      discharge registries were used to identify the patients. Medical records were studied and
      details collected on the patients' age, sex, preoperative condition, preoperative laboratory
      parameters, coexisting medical diagnoses (Charlson Comorbidity Index, CCI (Hall 2004)),
      indication and date for PEG tube placement, complications, the time of PEG use, follow-up
      time, and clinical status at last follow up. The study period was aimed to run from PEG tube
      placement to the last clinical evaluation (minimum 12 months) or the time of death. These
      results were compared with those from a historic cohort group of patients with the PEG tube
      placed in the Department of Surgery, HUCH, Helsinki, Finland from September 2005 until
      October 2008.
