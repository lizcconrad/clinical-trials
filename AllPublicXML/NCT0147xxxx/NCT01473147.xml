      Background: Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) has been demonstrated to be an
      effective clinical tool for intensive insulin therapy in Type 1 diabetic patients. Type 2
      diabetes patients have been proved to have decreased of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)
      levels. Injection of GLP-1 receptor agonists are associated with improved glycemic control.
      Nevertheless, the clinical effects and mechanisms are still unclear when additional
      supplement of GLP-1 analogue in cooperation with intensive CSII treatment for poorly
      controlled Type 2 diabetes patients. This study is designed to understand the complementary
      pharmacological effects of GLP-1 analogue on intensive CSII treatment.

      Methods: Sixty poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes patients will be admitted to the ward for 6
      days CSII intensive treatment. Following the normalization of blood glucose at first 3 days,
      the patients are randomly assigned with combined therapy with exenatide injection or saline
      for another 3 days. The clinical assessments of insulin requirement, insulin secretion,
      insulin resistance glycemic excursions and cytokines will perform immediately during or after
      the study.

      In the poorly controlled type 2 DM, insulin therapy is the treatment of choice to make sugar
      on target. Actually, however, the general control rate is not good and partially due to the
      complex etiology in type 2 DM. GLP-1 deficiency is the mostly emphasized in modern practice.
      In order to study the effect of GLP-1 analogue in insulinized type 2 DM patients,
      investigators have to optimize the insulin therapy in the first priority. Continuous
      subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or insulin pump is a viable choice for patients with
      type 1 or type 2 DM who want close-to-physiologic insulin treatment. By means of the insulin
      pump therapy, standardized sugar control profile in type 2 DM patients could be achieved in a
      short time. Investigators can further evaluate the clinical response under GLP-1 analogue or
      not.
