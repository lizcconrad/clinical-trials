  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to improve safety and efficiency of clinical practice with the
      new generation of oral anticoagulants.

        1. To determine the effect of new oral anticoagulants (dabigatran and rivaroxaban) on
           platelets and coagulation mechanisms under flow conditions.

        2. To evaluate the ability of the concentrates containing coagulation factors (PCCs and
           FVIIa) to reverse the effects induced by the new anticoagulants.

      These studies will be carried out ex vivo in blood samples obtained from healthy volunteers
      undergoing oral anticoagulant therapy at doses of proven efficacy and safety used in previous
      clinical trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a lack of information on antidotes that could reverse the effects of new oral
      anticoagulants in patients that require a rapid restoration of their impaired hemostatic
      mechanisms. The present study seeks to improve the security and efficacy of the clinical
      practice with the new generation of oral anticoagulants.

      OBJECTIVES:

        1. To assess the action of new oral anticoagulants (dabigatran y rivaroxaban) on hemostasis
           with specific interest on possible interference with platelet interactions and
           coagulation mechanisms under flow conditions;

        2. To evaluate comparatively the effects of coagulation factor concentrates of established
           efficacy (prothrombin complexes and rFVIIa) to reverse the alterations of hemostasis
           parameters induced by the new anticoagulants.

      METHODOLOGY:

      Studies will be performed ex vivo using blood samples from healthy individuals subjected to
      treatments with the new anticoagulants at doses of proven efficacy and safety (150mg/12 h for
      dabigatran and 20 mg/day for rivaroxaban). Blood samples from the participants will be spiked
      &quot;in vitro&quot; with know concentrations of the coagulation factors. Modifications in:

        -  morphometric parameters (platelet deposition and fibrin formation) in perfusion studies
           under flow conditions; and

        -  analytical tests evaluating changes in coagulation mechanisms (thrombin generation,
           ecarine and prothrombin times) will be determined.

    <description>We will evaluate: a) the surface covered by platelets and fibrin on the subendothelium of vascular segments. Platelet interaction will be expressed as percentage of covered surface by platelets (%CS) and classified as contact, adhesion and aggregates depending of the size of interactions. Fibrin formation will be also evaluated as percentage of surface covered by fibrin (%F) and as the mean area of fibrin formed; and b) thrombin generation as lag time and maximum thrombin peak generation using a commercially available test (Technothrombin TGA, Technoclone GMBH).</description>
