    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a solid tumor of a type likely or known to either overexpress wild-type
             Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) or to express variant III mutant EGFR (e.g.,
             head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC), and
             colorectal carcinoma).

          -  Subject must have disease that is not amenable to surgical resection or other approved
             therapeutic options with curative intent.

          -  Subject cannot tolerate or must not be eligible for other approved therapeutic options
             with known survival advantage.

          -  Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 2.

          -  Subject must have measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 with at least 1 extrahepatic 2 cm lesion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has received anticancer therapy including chemotherapy, immunotherapy,
             radiotherapy, hormonal, biologic, or any investigational therapy within a period of 14
             days prior to the first dose of ABT-806i.

          -  Subject has received a prior EGFR-directed monoclonal antibody within a period of 4
             weeks prior to the first dose of ABT-806i.

          -  Subject has unresolved clinically significant toxicities from prior anticancer
             therapy, defined as any Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 2
             or higher.

          -  Subject has had major surgery within 21 days prior to the first dose of ABT-806i.

          -  Subject has a clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s) including but not
             limited to the following:

               -  Active uncontrolled infection

               -  Symptomatic congestive heart failure

               -  Unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia

               -  Psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with the study
                  requirements
