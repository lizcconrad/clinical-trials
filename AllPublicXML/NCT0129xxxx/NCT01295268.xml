  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if vulvar (external female genitalia) pain is
      decreased with emu oil over a similar placebo oil (no active ingredient) by using measurement
      devices, examinations, and questionnaires. Topical emu oil has not been scientifically
      studied for this condition yet, but related reports show no significant side effects or
      potential benefits.

      A total of 30 women will participate in the study at William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak.

      -  Women of all ages with vulvar pain may participate in this trial.

        -  Women will be randomized into 2 groups--a treatment group or placebo group for the 1
           month study.

        -  At the end of the study, those in the placebo group may choose to participate in a 1
           month follow-up evaluation using emu oil.
