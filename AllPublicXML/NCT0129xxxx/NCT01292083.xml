      This clinical trial studies azacitidine in treating patients with triple negative stage I-IV
      invasive breast cancer that can be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the ability of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation
      inhibition using 5-azacitidine to induce expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) and
      progesterone receptor (PR) genes in solid human triple negative invasive breast cancer.
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the effect of systemic 5-azacitidine therapy on the
      expression of other methylated genes in triple negative invasive breast cancer using an
      Illumina GoldenGate array. OUTLINE: Patients receive azacitidine intravenously (IV) over
      10-40 minutes 5 days a week for 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients undergo definitive breast surgery within 12 days of the last dose of
      azacitidine.
