  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor adherence to antihypertensive medications is associated with morbidity, and data suggest
      that substance abuse may contribute to poor adherence. Contingency management (CM), an
      intervention highly efficacious for improving outcomes of substance abusers, shows promise in
      improving medication adherence in a handful of small trials. CM involves providing tangible
      reinforcement each time the behavior (medication ingestion) is exhibited. Thus far, studies
      evaluating CM for increasing medication adherence have utilized MEMS caps, but reinforcement
      of adherence via MEMS caps is done relatively infrequently and with delay, hindering its
      efficacy. A widely utilized technology that may be more appropriate for reinforcing
      medication adherence is cell phones, which can record the process of pill ingestion through
      video functions. As regular monitoring and feedback is important in the efficacy of CM,
      patients can be provided with daily messages regarding adherence and CM earnings. In this
      pilot study, we propose to randomize 40 hypertensive substance abusing patients with
      suboptimal adherence to antihypertensive medications to one of two 12-week treatment
      conditions: (1) usual care, or (2) usual care with cell phone monitoring and CM. In the CM
      condition, patients will carry a cell phone and record and send in time- and date-stamped
      self videos of medication ingestion. These patients will receive congratulatory messages or
      reminders about adherence, and they will earn vouchers each time medication ingestion occurs
      at the appropriate time, along with bonuses for sustained adherence. We hypothesize that the
      CM condition will improve self report and pill count measurements of medication adherence and
      that it will result in decreased blood pressure. Results from this study may have widespread
      implications for the use of cell phones as a novel technology to improve medication
      adherence.
