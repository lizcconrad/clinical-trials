  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate sterility of ethyl-chloride topical anesthetic spray
      when used prior to an injection. The hypothesis is that the spray does not change the
      sterility of the injection site after skin is prepped.

      This is an IRB-approved, prospective, blinded, controlled study. In the first set of
      experiments, skin sterility is assessed. Healthy adult subjects are prepared for mock
      injections of shoulders and knees. No injection is performed. Each site has a set of 3 skin
      cultures: 1) prior to the alcohol prep (pre-prep), 2) post-alcohol prep (pre-spray), and 3)
      after ethyl-chloride was sprayed on the site (post-spray). In the second set of experiments,
      sterility of ethyl chloride is tested directly by culturing the liquid from the spray
      bottles.
