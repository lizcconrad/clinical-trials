    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the feasibility of combining four of the most active agents
      available for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Further the investigators will attempt to
      assess the activity of this combination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase I/II studies of the novel proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib, have shown it to have
      significant activity in patients with advanced multiple myeloma, including patients with
      bortezomib refractory disease. This drug, unlike bortezomib, has minimal neurotoxicity and
      appears to have minimal gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Experience with the combination of
      bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone has shown both neuropathy and chronic diarrhea to
      be limiting.

      Vorinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor with modest single agent activity in multiple
      myeloma. Dysesthesia, GI issues and fatigue have been problematic in this patient population.
      More recent studies combining vorinostat with lenalidomide and dexamethasone or with
      bortezomib have demonstrated a much more robust activity, including in patients refractory to
      lenalidomide or bortezomib-based combinations. Again, neuropathy, fatigue and GI issues have
      been problematic.

      The investigators own anecdotal experience with combinations of proteasome inhibitor, histone
      deacetylase inhibitor, immunomodulators and dexamethasone has shown this combination to be
      extremely active and well tolerated. The combination of vorinostat, carfilzomib, lenalidomide
      and dexamethasone should offer the opportunity to maximize activity while limiting
      toxicities, particularly neuropathy and GI.

    <description>Vorinostat, Lenalidomide, Carfilzomib, Dexamethasone - This study will be conducted as an open-label Phase I/II, single-center study in which subjects will receive carfilzomib, lenalidomide, vorinostat and dexamethasone, for relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma. Study treatment will be administered in sequential cohorts, with 3-6 subjects in each cohort. Treatment will be administered in 28-day cycles, with the fourth week as a rest week, for 12 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity develops.</description>
