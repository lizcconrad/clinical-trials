  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was done to look at the level of Depo-Provera, an injectable birth control, in the
      blood to see whether it is affected by the anti-HIV drug Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir
      [LPV/r]). It is not known whether taking Depo-Provera together with Kaletra changes the
      amount of Kaletra in blood. Therefore, this study also looked at the levels of HIV and
      Kaletra before and after receiving a shot of Depo-Provera. This study evaluated the safety of
      Depo-Provera and Kaletra when they are used together. In addition to what is stated above,
      this study also explored any effect of Depo-Provera on the immune system.

  <detailed_description>

      The primary study objective was addressed by calculating the Area Under the
      Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) from week 0 (prior to DMPA injection) to week 12 (twelve weeks
      after DMPA injection) in our study participants.

      DMPA was supplied and administered as part of the protocol, however Kaletra was not. It was
      required that participants already be on a Kaletra based regimen prior to entering the study,
      as described in the eligibility criteria.

      Arm A of AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) A5093, which consisted of 14 participants who were
      administered DMPA without Kaletra, was used as reference data.

        <description>This evaluates the effect of DMPA on LPV PK parameter AUC by comparing PK AUCs of LPV from 0 to 12 hours obtained at study Day 0 (before DMPA was administered) with PK AUCs of LPV from 0 to 12 hours at study Week 4 (4 weeks after DMPA was administered). Blood samples were drawn for LPV concentration levels at time zero (before LPV/r dosing) and at 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10 hours after LPV/r dosing at day 0 and week 4.</description>

        <description>This evaluates toxicity and safety of concomitant medication of DMPA and LPV/r, focusing specifically on the adverse event (AE) menstrual irregularities with abnormal vaginal bleeding. The AEs were graded by the clinicians according to the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) AE Grading Table (see references in the Protocol Section) as follows: Grade 1=Mild, Grade 2=Moderate, Grade 3=Severe, Grade 4=Potentially Life-Threatening, Grade 5=Death. Relationship to study treatment was determined by the study's co-chairs.</description>

The AEs were graded by the clinicians according to the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) AE Grading Table (see references in the Protocol Section) as follows: Grade 1=Mild, Grade 2=Moderate, Grade 3=Severe, Grade 4=Potentially Life-Threatening, Grade 5=Death. Relationship to study treatment was determined by the study's co-chairs.</description>
          <population>This analysis focuses on the 24 participants eligible for the PK analyses.</population>

        <description>This evaluates the short-term impact of MPA on virologic suppression in participants taking LPV/r who have received a dose of DMPA by measuring percentage of participants with HIV-1 RNA levels &lt;400 copies/mL at day 0 (prior to DMPA injection) and at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 (after DMPA injection). An FDA-approved HIV-1 RNA assay with a lower limit of detection of 75 copies/mL or less was required and the same HIV-1 RNA assay was required to be performed for each participant across all study visits. The Roche COBAS AmpliPrep/TaqMan HIV-1 and Abbott RealTime HIV-1 tests were used.</description>

        <description>This evaluates the effect of MPA on Tregs at baseline (Day 0), week 4 and week 12 using flow cytometry in freshly thawed PBMCs. A summary of CD4+ and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8+) anchored T-cell subsets by study week, in percent that express the marker of interest, is presented here together to provide all results pertaining to this objective in a single data table.</description>
