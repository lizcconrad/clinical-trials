      The purpose of this study is to detect acute febrile episodes and dengue infection in five
      Latin American countries to assess dengue seroprevalence.

      Primary objectives:

        -  To identify acute febrile episodes among the cohort in order to detect the presence of
           dengue infection.

        -  To describe the dengue seroprevalence among the cohort at baseline and at the end of the
           study.

      All participants will make two visits to a study site, an enrollment visit and a termination
      visit. Additional visits will be made if febrile episodes occur: an acute visit and a
      convalescent visit. Participants or their parents/guardians will be contacted weekly to
      monitor the occurrence of febrile episodes and ensure appropriate assessment and care.

      No vaccine will be provided or administered in this study
