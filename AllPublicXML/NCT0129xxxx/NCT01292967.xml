      The investigators have conducted a randomized, triple-blind, cross-over study in 15 healthy
      human volunteers to investigate the absorption and metabolism of cocoa flavanols from a
      high-flavanol chocolate made with added sugar and a high-flavanol chocolate containing the
      sugar substitute maltitol; a nutrient-matched low flavanol control product was also fed. All
      products were matched for macro-nutrients, as well as for alkaloids (theobromine and
      caffeine), and were similar in taste and appearance. Both high-flavanol products contained
      ~259 mg cocoa flavanols, whilst the low-flavanol chocolate contained 48 mg of cocoa
      flavanols. On each study day, subjects were cannulated and baseline blood samples were
      collected prior to consumption of any of the test chocolates. Additional blood samples were
      collected at 1, 2 and 4 hours and plasma levels of flavanols were assessed using HPLC with
      fluorescence detection. All test products were well-tolerated by study participants.
