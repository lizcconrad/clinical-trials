        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject completed the RA0056 study (Week 12 Visit)

          -  Subject must have maintained their stable dose (and route) of methotrexate (MTX)
             between 12.5 to 25mg/week in RA0056, and plan to maintain this same dose and route of
             administration for at least 12 weeks

          -  Female subjects must be either postmenopausal for at least 1 year, surgically
             incapable of childbearing, or effectively practicing an acceptable method of
             contraception (either oral/parenteral/implantable hormonal contraceptives,
             intrauterine device, or barrier and spermicide). Abstinence is not considered an
             acceptable method of contraception for this study

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use 2 methods of adequate
             contraception during the study and for 6 months (24 weeks) after their last CDP6038
             dose

          -  Male subjects must agree to ensure that they or their female partner(s) use adequate
             contraception during the study and for 12 weeks after the subject receives their last
             dose of CDP6038

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has an ongoing serious adverse event from the RA0056 study

          -  Female subject of childbearing potential has a positive pregnancy test or plans to
             become pregnant during the study or within 6 months (24 weeks) following their last
             dose of study medication

          -  Subject has evidence of active or latent tuberculosis

          -  Subject is receiving any biologic response modifier or synthetic disease-modifying
             antirheumatic drug other than MTX

          -  Subject has an alcohol consumption of more than 1 unit per weekday. One unit equals 1
             glass of beer or lager (~330mL), a glass of wine (125mL), or a measure of spirits/hard
             liquor (25mL)

          -  Subject with any other condition in RA0056 (eg, clinically significant laboratory
             values, frequent adverse events) which in the Investigator's or Sponsor's judgment
             would make the subject unsuitable for inclusion in the study
