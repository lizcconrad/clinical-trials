    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized two-part study of MK-4827 given with temozolomide in participants
      with advanced cancer. In Part A of the study, the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MK-4827 when combined with temozolomide will be found by
      increasing the MK-4827 dose level in successive cohorts. In Part B of the study, participants
      with advanced glioblastoma multiforme and advanced melanoma will be enrolled to further
      evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of the MK-4827 + temozolomide combination.

        Inclusion criteria

        Part A

          -  Participants with histologically-confirmed advanced solid tumors who have failed to
             respond to standard therapy, or progressed on standard therapy, or for whom standard
             therapy does not exist.

        Part B

          -  Participants must have a histologically-confirmed recurrent glioblastoma multiforme
             (GBM) with radiographic evidence of progression/recurrence of disease, with up to two
