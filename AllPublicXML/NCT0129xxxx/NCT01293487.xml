    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of osteopenia for women (BMD T-scores between -1.0 and - 2.5 SD at the
             lumbar spine, the femoral neck or total hip)

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;45 kg (99 lbs).

          -  Have at least 3 vertebral bodies in the L1-L4 region and one femoral neck site that
             are accessible by DXA.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of any underlying condition, other than primary osteopenia, that
             affect bone metabolism (eg, hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism).

          -  Subjects with pre-existing periodontal/dental disease or those who have undergone
             invasive dental procedures (eg, tooth extraction, oral surgery) within 60 days prior
             to Day -1.

          -  If QTcF exceeds 455 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more times and the average of
             the three QTcF values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.
