  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this pilot study is to develop a cost-effective treatment
      methodology delivered outside of traditional clinical setting, and based on modern technology
      for patients with diabetes type 2 also suffering from obesity. This study will investigate
      the feasibility of web based counselling and situational feedback through mobile supervising.
      The intention is to treat 10-15 patients. All participants will receive standard treatment
      delivered by their general practitioners. In addition the participants will fill in and send
      diaries to the supervisors each evening for 4 weeks reduced to a weekly frequency for the
      next two months period. The diary's schedule will be an evaluation of the day activities
      related to meals and food, medication management as well as the performed physical
      activities. The diary's schedule will also include blood glucose sample, and plans for the
      next day especially regarding physical activity. The participants will be able to view their
      own registrations on a web page. Daily/weekly situational feedback will be given to the
      participants within a cognitive behavioural framework to stimulate self-management. The
      primary outcome will be the HbA1c levels. Secondary outcomes will include evaluation of
      lifestyle outcomes such as physical activity levels and eating behaviour, and skills such as
      self-management of medication. In addition, the interventions effectiveness will examine
      mental health outcomes such as emotional distress and health-related quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes and overweight have become a world health epidemic. The number of people suffering
      of these diseases is increasing due to population growth, aging, urbanization, and increasing
      prevalence of obesity and physical inactivity. The costs of diabetes affect health services,
      national productivity as well as individuals and families. Hospital in-patient costs for the
      treatment of complications are the largest single contributor to direct healthcare costs.
      Many of these complications and, therefore, their costs, are preventable. Intensive therapy,
      directed at the control of blood glucose, blood pressure etc, has been shown to be
      cost-effective in that, although initial costs are increased, it decreases longer term costs
      as a result of delayed or prevented complications . Diabetes self-management education is a
      multi-faceted process involving much more than helping people with diabetes to monitor their
      blood glucose, or take their medication as prescribed. Diabetes education must be an ongoing
      process rather than a one-time event because a person's health status and need for support
      change over time.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood glucose control with changes in Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline and at the end of the intervention (3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>HBA1c is a form of hemoglobin used primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time. It is formed in a non-enzymatic glycation pathway by hemoglobin's exposure to plasma glucose. Normal levels of glucose produce a normal amount of glycated hemoglobin. As the average amount of plasma glucose increases, the fraction of glycated hemoglobin increases in a predictable way. This serves as a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous months prior to the measurement</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Education Impact Questionnaire (heiQ);</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline and after the end of the intervention (3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>heiQ is a user-friendly instrument for the comprehensive evaluation of patient education programs with the following dimensions: positive and active engagement in life, health directed behavior, skill and technique acquisition, constructive attitudes and approaches, self-monitoring and insight, health service navigation, social integration and support, and emotional well-being.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline and after the end of the intervention (3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PAID is a brief self-report measure of diabetes-related distress that has been found to be useful in patients with diabetes (both type1 and 2). PAID scores have been found to show positive associations with HbA1c, and are a major predictor of poor adherence to treatment not involving general emotional distress</description>

    <measure>Food frequency questionnaire FFQ</measure>

    <description>FFQ is a measure designed to measure average long-term diet or usual consumption with specified food items.</description>

    <measure>Audit of Diabetes Dependence Quality of Life (ADDQoL-19)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline and after the end of the intervention (3months)</time_frame>
    <description>ADDQoL19 is a health-related quality of life questionnaire well designed to assess to what extent diabetes may affect different aspects of health related quality of life. The ADDQoL includes 2 introductory questions and 18 specific items, with the purpose of assessing, according to the patient's perspective, how much better his or her life would be if he/she did not have diabetes and how important each of these 19 aspects of life are for the individual.</description>

    <description>All patients will receive standard care (reassurance, education, physiotherapy, and necessary medication). Complementary to this standard care, the participants will be required to closely monitor their blood glucose levels, weight, eating behavior and daily activities, and to relay this information to the nurse specialist trained in treating somatic patients with CBT. The nurse will then suggest appropriate treatment decisions, the patients will receive situational feedback based on the electronic diary during 3 months (daily during 4 weeks intensive treatment and weekly during 2 months as a complement).</description>
