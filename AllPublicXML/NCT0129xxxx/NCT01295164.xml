  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The instrument that will be used in the study is the Murcia monocular Adaptive Optics Visual
      simulator (AOVIS-I). The system provides an objective characterization of the optical quality
      of the patient's eye by application of wave-front sensing technology. The optical condition
      of every eye is represented by its wave aberration. This characterization overcomes the
      current description based only in refractive errors. This provides an accurate description of
      the optics of the eye based on the assessment of the whole set of ocular aberrations. The
      particular wave-front sensor is of a Hartmann-Shack type. One characteristics of this
      wave-front sensor is its high dynamic range allowing measuring highly aberrated eyes, such as
      patients with keratoconus.
