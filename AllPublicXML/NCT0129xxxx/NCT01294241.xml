      The purpose of this study was to compare intra-individually the reepithelialization of skin
      lesion(s) in inherited Epidermolysis bullosa (either 1 wound ≥10 cm2 and ≤200 cm2 in size
      divided in 2 equal halves or 2 comparable wounds of ≥5 cm2 each) treated with Oleogel-S10 and
      non-adhesive wound dressing versus non-adhesive wound dressing only.

      This study was designed as an open-label, prospective, controlled, blindly evaluated,
      monocentric phase II case series documentation in patients with inherited Epidermolysis
      bullosa (EB). The investigator either identified 1 EB wound ≥10 cm2 and ≤200 cm2 in size and
      divided it into 2 halves or selected 2 comparable wounds of ≥5 cm2 each. One (half of the) EB
      wound was treated with Oleogel-S10 and non-adhesive wound dressing. The other wound (half)
      was covered with a non-adhesive wound dressing only (Mepilex®) as control. Wound dressings
      were changed about every 24 to 48 hours until discharge from hospital or until the end of
      treatment at Day 14 in 'recent wounds' or Day 28 in 'chronic wounds'. This was an open-label
      study. The investigator, the participant, and the sponsor knew the identity of the treatment.
      Two independent experts were blind to treatment and assessed efficacy based on chronological
      series of cropped and coded photographs by wound (half) that were taken before start of
      treatment, during wound dressing changes and at the end of treatment on Day 14/Day 28.

    <description>The primary end point was the progress of reepithelialization from baseline to either Day 14 ('recent wounds') or Day 28 ('chronic wounds') of the EB wound (half) treated with Oleogel-S10 and non-adhesive wound dressing (Mepilex®) intra-individually compared to the other wound (half) covered with non-adhesive wound dressing only (intra-individual comparison). Two independent experts were blind to treatment and assessed efficacy based on chronological series of cropped and coded photographs by wound (half) that were taken before start of treatment, during wound dressing changes and at the end of treatment on Day 14/Day 28. They evaluated each series and decided whether 1 wound (half) reepithelialized faster than the other ('winner'), or whether there was no difference in reepithelialization.</description>

          <title>Intra-individual Difference in Reepithelialization of Wound (Halves) at Day 14 in ‘Recent Wounds’ or Day 28 in ‘Chronic Wounds’</title>
          <description>The primary end point was the progress of reepithelialization from baseline to either Day 14 (‘recent wounds’) or Day 28 (‘chronic wounds’) of the EB wound (half) treated with Oleogel-S10 and non-adhesive wound dressing (Mepilex®) intra-individually compared to the other wound (half) covered with non-adhesive wound dressing only (intra-individual comparison). Two independent experts were blind to treatment and assessed efficacy based on chronological series of cropped and coded photographs by wound (half) that were taken before start of treatment, during wound dressing changes and at the end of treatment on Day 14/Day 28. They evaluated each series and decided whether 1 wound (half) reepithelialized faster than the other (‘winner’), or whether there was no difference in reepithelialization.</description>
