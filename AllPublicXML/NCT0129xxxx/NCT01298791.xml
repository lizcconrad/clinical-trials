    <textblock>
      Patient satisfaction is affected by physician communication styles and communication at the
      bedside. The investigators are conducting a randomized controlled trial involving both
      providers and families to determine if providers sitting down while talking with families,
      will improve one aspect of quality care delivered during an inpatient stay as measured by
      patient/family satisfaction. The investigators will additionally study the affects of the
      intervention on the following outcomes: family assessment of provider communication,
      readmission rates, and length of stay.
