  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of multiple doses of hydrochlorothiazide
      and canagliflozin on the concentrations of each drug in the blood and the concentration of
      glucose in the blood and urine in healthy adult volunteers.

      This is a single-center, open-label study with 2 study periods where volunteers and study
      staff will know the names and doses of assigned study treatments. All volunteers will receive
      the same treatment. Canagliflozin (a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2-inhibitor) is currently
      under development to lower blood sugar levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM), and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is a drug indicated for the treatment of patients with
      mild to moderate hypertension. During Period 1, volunteers will take canagliflozin 300 mg
      once daily for 7 days (Days 1 to 7) and during Period 2, volunteers will take HCTZ 25 mg once
      daily for 28 days (Days 1 to 28), and then starting on Day 29, will take canagliflozin 300 mg
      once daily and HCTZ 25 mg once daily for 7 days (Days 29 to 35). Period 1 and Period 2 will
      be separated by a minimum of 14 days.
