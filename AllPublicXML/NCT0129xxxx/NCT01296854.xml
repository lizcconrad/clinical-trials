    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to measure and compare the number of exacerbations
      (moderate or severe) between the two groups of randomized patients with and without thermal
      treatment). An exacerbation is defined by an increase in symptoms which justifies a
      unscheduled medical action: increased daily treatment and / or use of corticosteroids, and /
      or antibiotic therapy. Exacerbations are documented via prescriptions, hospitalisation
      reports or unscheduled visits.

    <description>Exacerbation = increase in symptoms (IS) justifying an unprogrammed therapeutic intervention (TI). An IS = increase in &gt;=2 of the following minor symptoms for &gt;= 2 consecutive days (CD): (i) dyspnea, (ii) volume or (iii) purulence of sputum. Or an increase in any 1 of the following major symptoms associated with any of the minor symptoms for at least 2 CD: (a) sore throat, (b) cold, (c) fever, (d) coughing, (e) wheezing. A TI = systemic corticoids and/or antibiotics. An exacerbation is defined as severe if TI is accompanied by a hospital stay &gt; 24h, and as &quot;moderate&quot; otherwise.</description>
