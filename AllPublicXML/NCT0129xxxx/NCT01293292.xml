  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previously the approach to treatment of osteoporosis has been to use medications which
      prevent excessive resorption of bone. More recently medications that build up new bone, i.e.
      anabolic treatments, have been, and are being, developed. The investigators would like to
      develop a strategy for evaluating the effectiveness of anabolic therapies by studying a
      currently available therapy (teriparatide). This strategy could then be used to assess new
      anabolic treatments as they are developed for use in humans.

      The aims of this study are 1) to fully describe the changes in bone turnover in response to
      teriparatide by biochemical marker type and by time; 2) to fully describe the changes in bone
      mineral density (BMD) in response to teriparatide by site, bone compartment and time.

      If this study is able to identify an early response to treatment, then this will help speed
      up drug development in this area, by allowing the identification of promising new anabolic
      drugs and enabling us to understand their mechanism of action. This will benefit the
      investigators patients as the investigators will have a better understanding of how these
      drugs work.
