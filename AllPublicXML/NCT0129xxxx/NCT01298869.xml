  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccination (Gardasil.
      Merck) 3 doses at day 1, month 2, and month 6 to lower the occurrence of high-grade cervical
      intraepithelial neoplasia than did those in the placebo group. The immunogenicity and
      efficacy of the HPV vaccine has not been proven in late stage chronic kidney disease (CKD)
      population. The cellular and humoral immune responsiveness of CKD population are impaired by
      the retention of uremic toxin due to glomerular filtration rate (GFR) reduction, the
      vaccination efficacy can be altered and the effective dose/schedule of the vaccine may need
      to be adjusted, mostly increase in CKD patients.

      This study aims to investigate the immunogenicity of quadrivalent HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccination
      (Gardasil. Merck) by current recommended dose/schedule in CKD stage IV-V patients and compare
      to non-CKD patients. Although a minimal peak anti-HPV response associated with protective
      efficacy has not been determined, the equivalent immune response in CKD and non-CKD patients
      if can be demonstrated by this study should be extrapolated to the CKD population. If less
      immune response results, the more intense dose/schedule of the vaccine should be further
      studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 70% of sexually active adults will become infected with human papillomavirus (HPV)
      during their lifetime. HPV infection can result in anogenital cancer and genital warts. These
      diseases are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Every year, 471,000 cases
      of cervical cancer are diagnosed worldwide. The 5-year survival for this disease is ~70%. The
      incidence of HPV-related anal cancer has doubled in the last 25 years. Screening programs to
      detect early disease are not available. Genital warts cause significant morbidity. Therefore,
      a prophylactic vaccine that reduces HPV infection will greatly reduce the burden of HPV
      disease. This study aims to demonstrate the immunogenicity of quadrivalent HPV-6/11/16/18
      vaccination (Gardasil. Merck) by current recommended dose/schedule (day 1, and month 7) in
      CKD stage IV-V patients and to compare the immunogenicity of the vaccine in CKD stage IV-V
      patients and non-CKD subjects in historical cohort data.

             m2 by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation: eGFR = 175 x serum
