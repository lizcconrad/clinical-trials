  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Bosentan is an effective and safe treatment
      to adolescent and adult (15 years and older) patients, born with one ventricle of the heart
      instead of two (single ventricle physiology) and who have undergone TCPC as a palliative
      surgical treatment. The aim of the TCPC operation is to use the one functioning ventricle to
      pump the blood flow to the body, while the blood to the lungs is received directly from the
      caval veins, and is thus a passive flow, without the aid of a ventricle to actively pump the
      blood through the pulmonary circulation. The resistance in the pulmonary circulation is
      therefore critical to these patients. These patients have markedly lower work capacity in
      bicycle test than the general public. Furthermore they have a high risk of developing
      complications e.g. loss of protein from the intestines.

      Bosentan is a medication that lowers the resistance in the pulmonary circulation. It is
      routinely used for patients with pulmonary hypertension. Some studies have shown that drugs
      that lower the pulmonary resistance can increase exercise capacity significantly in patients
      with single ventricle physiology.

      In this study 80 patients will receive either placebo or Bosentan for 14 weeks. Before and
      after the treatment, bicycle test along with blood samples, stool samples and quality of life
      interviews will be performed. Every four weeks during the study blood samples, physical exam
      and interviews will be performed to ensure the safety of the treatment.

      The investigators expect to find a significant increase in work capacity after 14 weeks in
      the treatment group compared with the placebo group.

      Moreover the investigators hope to find a decrease in intestinal protein loss and an improved
      quality of life.

      In the statistical analysis the investigators wish to analyse interactions between the
      primary endpoint and predefined subgroups in order to distinguish responders from
      non-responders to the treatment. The predefined subgroups are:

      NT-proBNP &gt; 100 (yes/no) Ventricular anatomy (RV/LV) CT-proEndothelin-1. In the latter, the
      investigators do not wish to predefine a specific value, due to limited experience with this
      analysis. We wish to use the data from the study to find a cut-off value, that is able to
      predict positive response to treatment.
