  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the nation's major health priorities, as outlined in Healthy People 2010, is to
      increase the proportion of children aged 19 to 35 months who have received all universally
      recommended vaccines. This study will compare two interventions for increasing immunization
      rates in this age group, one using well-studied primary care practice-based methods and the
      other using innovative technologies to increase immunization rates at the population-level.
      Results of this study will provide data that will be relevant nationally in guiding future
      investment of resources to increase up-to-date rates in young children prior to school entry.

      Hypothesis: Population-based approaches will be more effective than practice-based
      interventions at increasing immunizations among 19-35 month olds.

    <time_frame>6 months post-intervention (December 2010)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measures will be: 1) change in up-to-date rates from baseline levels 6 months after the intervention (T-1) for 19-35 month olds in population-based compared to practice-based intervention counties and 2) percent of children who were not up-to-date prior to recall (T-0) who received any additional new vaccine in each type of intervention county.</description>

    <description>All practices in these counties will receive training on practice-based R/R using the Colorado Immunization Information System (CIIS or immunization registry). Practices will receive a recommended schedule for conducting recall in 19-35 month children and educational materials to use within their practices to promote compliance with the infant vaccination schedule. Individual practices will make their own decisions about the extent to which they follow the recommendations and implement recall within their practice. Although the study team will not provide them with any additional interventions, we will track any other interventions they independently do (websites, newsletters, telephone informational systems) in order to assess the effect of these additional interventions.</description>

    <description>A centralized recall of children 19-35 months will be conducted through local health departments. CIIS will identify a cohort of 19-35 month olds with an who are in need of an immunization and will coordinate up to 3 mailers to children who are not current for recommended immunizations.</description>
