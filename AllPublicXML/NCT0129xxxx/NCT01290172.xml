    <textblock>
      This study is a 5 day, single-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Somatostatin used as inflow modulator in liver
      transplantation. Patient systemic and hepatic dynamics will be collected and recorded at
      predefined time-points. To evaluate the ischemia-reperfusion injury, it is planned to perform
      liver biopsies at two different time-points to compare the liver structure and proteomic
      variations.

    <description>To evaluate the safety and efficacy, using Somatostatin as portal vein flow and pressure modulator in liver transplantation in humans. Hepatic and systemic hemodynamic measurements will be recorded prior, during and after the bolus infusion of Somatostatin/Placebo during liver transplantation. Infusion of Somatostatin/Placebo will be continued for 5 days.</description>

    <description>6 mg will be diluted in saline in a 60 cc syringe to be infused over 24 h (250 mcg/h). The treatment will be started during the hepatectomy phase, after 1st measurement of native arterial and portal flow and pressure and given a clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) with a hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) &gt;= 10 mmHg.
5 cc will be injected in 2 minutes as a single bolus of 500 mcg. Somatostatin will be given a second time at the beginning of the warm ischemia time as a continuous infusion of 250 mcg/h(infusion rate 2,5 cc/h). This will allow the time needed for reaching a stable plasma concentration at reperfusion and minimizing risks of secondary effects. After portal revascularization of the liver graft, a new measurement of portal flow and pressure will be performed. Provided a portal vein flow (PVF) &gt;= 90 ml/min * 100 g LW, the remaining 55 cc will be infused for the following 22 h. 6 mg per day of continuous infusion will be continued for 5 days.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability and willingness to provide written informed consent

          -  Cirrhotic patients with established clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH)
             defined as an increase in hepatic venous pressure gradient &gt;= 10 mmHg

          -  Recipients who are 18-70 years of age receiving a primary liver transplant from a
             brain dead donor or living donor

          -  Whole liver grafts and partial liver grafts can be included

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are recipients of multiple solid organ transplants, or have previously
             received an organ or tissue transplant that may not be completely resolved by
             thrombectomy

          -  HIV positive patients

          -  Patients with known history of portal thrombosis or diagnosed at the time of

          -  Patients included in the preoperative assessment without a CSPH at the time of the
             first intraoperative measurement of portal pressure

          -  Patients with low portal perfusion (=&lt; 90 ml/min*100 g of LV) measured at the time of
             operation. Portal flows above this limit can be excluded in the eventuality that,
             after infusion, the portal perfusion falls below this limit

          -  Patients with porto-pulmonary hypertension

          -  Patients with known cardiac arrhythmias

          -  Recipients of cardiac-dead donors
