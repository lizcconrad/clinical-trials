  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea is a common disorder linked to serious long-term adverse health
      consequences; such as hypertension, metabolic dysfunction, cardiovascular disease. Retinal
      vascular occlusion is related to many systemic illnesses especially hypertension. Obstructive
      sleep apnea is also related to vascular endothelial dysfunction and vascular endothelial
      growth factor elevation which causes vision threatening complications of retinal vascular
      occlusion. Therefore the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and retinal vascular
      occlusion should be studied.

    <description>Watchpat 100 is a noninvasive portable sleep monitoring device which monitors peripheral arterial tone, pulse, oxygen saturation, snoring, and body position. Patient places one probe at his or her finger and another sensor at front of the chest and Watchpat 100 monitors the patient overnight.</description>
