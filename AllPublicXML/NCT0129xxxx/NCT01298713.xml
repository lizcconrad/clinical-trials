  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tamoxifen is a classical treatment for breast metastatic cancer after 3rd generation
      anti-aromatase hormonotherapy in adjuvant or in metastatic line. The Tamoxifen efficacy is
      lowered by the hormonoresistance mechanisms due to the primary use of the anti-aromatases.
      The Pi3K-AKT-mTor pathway is frequently associated to the hormonoresistance mechanisms. This
      study is aimed to check if the inhibition of this signal transduction pathway by a synthetic
      mTor inhibitor (Everolimus) could improve the efficacy of the Tamoxifen.
