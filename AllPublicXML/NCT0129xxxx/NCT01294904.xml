  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic kidney disease (both men and women), especially those with terminal
      renal failure, manifest infertility. There has been demonstrated several hormonal changes in
      patients on dialysis. Increased levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) has been seen in men (12).
      In women the opposite has been reported. The number of spermatocytes is reduced and a
      disturbance in maturation has been observed.

      This project is aimed to study the influence of uremic milieu on fertility in men and women.
      The hypopituitary/hypothalamus gland axis and hormonal levels will be studied.

      Renal elimination of hormones and peptides. By using a human transplantation model the
      investigators will study changes in hormonal levels before and after a successful
      transplantation up to 12 months. Hormones: testosterone, SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin),
      LH (luteinizing hormone), FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), estradiol and inhibin B.

      Analysis of sperm quality, concentration, motility, morphology and as well DNA-fragmentation
      index (DFI) in men with chronic kidney disease. In women the investigators will study the
      maturation of follicles via vaginal ultrasound. Controls are persons from a study at Dept of
      Reproductive Medicine.
