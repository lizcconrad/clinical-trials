  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this program is to see whether periodically measuring CA-125 (tumor
      marker) levels in the blood and undergoing transvaginal ultrasounds over time will be
      effective in the early detection of ovarian cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The program will offer twice yearly CA-125 blood tests and annual transvaginal ultrasounds to
      monitor women at high risk for ovarian cancer. In addition to the main purpose of providing
      ovarian cancer screening, the researchers would also like to build a repository of blood
      specimens for use in ovarian and breast cancer research and to offer genetics counseling
      sessions to help educate women about risk-reducing options.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must meet one of the following:

               -  The family contains at least two ovarian or breast cancers in the subject or
                  first or second degree relatives of the subject.

               -  The subject is of Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity with one first degree or two
                  second-degree relatives with breast or ovarian cancer, or subject is of Ashkenazi
                  ancestry and has had breast cancer.

               -  The subject has a male relative with breast cancer diagnosed at any age.

               -  Probability of carrying a BRCA1/2 mutation given family pedigree of breast and
                  ovarian cancers exceeds 20% (as determined by BRCAPRO 95% posterior probability
                  interval).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior ovarian cancer or peritoneal carcinomatosis

          -  A first or second degree relative with a BRCA1/2 mutation and has tested negative for
             exactly the same mutation.

          -  The subject has no ovaries.

          -  Less than 30 years of age, unless 25-30 with BRCA I or II mutation confirmed

          -  Currently pregnant

          -  Currently receiving adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy for cancer (excluding
             tamoxifen). Patients who are being treated for local disease may enroll 3 months after
             completion of last treatment (excluding tamoxifen).

          -  Treatment (excluding tamoxifen) for prior metastatic malignancy within the past five
             years.

          -  Intraperitoneal surgery within the last 3 months.
