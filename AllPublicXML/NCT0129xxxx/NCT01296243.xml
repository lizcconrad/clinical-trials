    <textblock>
      Given the activity of docetaxel in patients with progressive, metastatic castration-resistant
      prostate cancer, this study is being undertaken to evaluate the activity of tesetaxel, an
      orally bioavailable taxane, in chemotherapy-naive and chemotherapy-exposed patients.

    <description>Tesetaxel capsules will be administered orally once every 21 days until progression, as defined by Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria. The duration of protocol therapy will not exceed 12 months. Treatment will be initiated at a dose of 27 mg/m2; dose escalation to a maximum of 35 mg/m2 is allowed in Cycle 2 depending on tolerability.</description>
