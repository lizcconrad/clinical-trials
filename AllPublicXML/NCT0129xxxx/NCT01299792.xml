  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Video-urodynamic investigations are regarded as the current standard diagnostics for
      neurogenic bladder dysfunction in patients with spinal cord injury. This examination is
      exact, but time consuming, costly and associated with the risk of urinary tract infection.

      In patients with lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostate hyperplasia, sonographic
      measurement of bladder wall thickness has been demonstrated to be able to replace urodynamic
      testing for the diagnosis of infravesical obstruction.

      Hypothesis: measurement of bladder wall thickness in patients with neurogenic bladder
      dysfunction due to spinal cord injury is closely related to the known risk factors for upper
      urinary tract deterioration (bladder compliance, detrusor leak point pressure) in this group
      of patients and can therefore replace urodynamic examination in selected cases.
