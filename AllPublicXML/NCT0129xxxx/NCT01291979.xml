  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of intravenous lidocaine
      injection on the relief of pain in patients undergoing tonsillectomy.

      A total of 62 patients will be randomized into one of two groups (group C or group I) based
      on Excel number generation.

      Patients in group C will receive received normal saline intravenous injection, and patients
      in group I will receive an intravenous bolus injection of 1.5 mg/kg lidocaine followed by a
      continuous lidocaine infusion of 2 mg/kg/hr.

      Visual analogue scale pain scores, fentanyl consumption and the frequency at which patients
      pushed the button (FPB) of a patient-controlled analgesia system will be recorded at 4, 12,
      24, 48 hours postoperatively.

    <measure>Visual analogue scale 4hour</measure>

    <description>Patients will be assessed for pain using a visual analogue pain scale (VAS). It is usually a horizontal line, 100 mm in length, anchored by word descriptors at each end; left side end which represents 0 is 'No pain', right side end with 100 is 'Very severe pain'. The patient marks on the line the point that they feel represents their perception of their current state. The VAS score is determined by measuring in millimeters from the left hand end of the line to the point that the patient marks.
To check the severity of pain VAS will be measured at post op 4hour.</description>

    <description>The patients will be taught to push the button of the PCA system, which delivered a bolus of drug, each time pain occurred.
