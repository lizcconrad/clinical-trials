      The goal of the study is the evaluation of the air handling of a &quot;new&quot; type of oxygenator
      versus the standard model. The new type has an integrated arterial filter. The standard model
      has a non integrated arterial line filter. If the air handling is as effective/ better than
      in the standard model this can lead to reduction of cardiopulmonary bypass circuits with
      their initiation of systemic inflammatory response and improve cardiopulmonary bypass safety.
