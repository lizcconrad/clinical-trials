    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have a minimum of 2.0 cm of non-ulcerated, non-inflammatory
             columnar-lined esophagus or squamous esophageal lined tissue suitable for ablation. A
             patient may be treated with up to 2 zones of ablation.

          -  Patient is 18 to 80 years of age at the time of consent (inclusive).

          -  Patient has provided written Informed Consent Form (IFC) using a form that has been
             approved by the Institution's reviewing IRB/EC.

          -  Patient is willing and able to comply with all Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP)
             requirements.

          -  Patient's esophagectomy is clinically necessary due to reasons unrelated to this
             study.

          -  Patient is deemed operable per standard institutional criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a known history of unresolved drug or alcohol dependency that would limit
             ability to comprehend or follow instructions related to IFC, post treatment
             instructions or follow-up guidelines.

          -  Patient refuses or is unable to provide written informed consent. - -

          -  Patient has or is currently undergoing endoscopic ablation therapy within 4 cm from
             the proposed treatment area including, but not limited to cryospray therapy, laser
             treatment, photodynamic therapy, multi-polar electro coagulation, endoscopic mucosal
             resection, radiofrequency ablation or argon plasma coagulation.

          -  Patient has esophageal narrowing limiting access to the intended site of ablation.

          -  Patient is undergoing or has recently undergone chemotherapy (within 15 days or WBC
             below normal by institutional criteria or standards).

          -  Patient is undergoing or has recently undergone radiation therapy which involved the
             esophagus (within 15 days or WBC below normal by institutional criteria or standards).
