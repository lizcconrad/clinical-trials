      This study aims to determine whether HIFU treatment is a safe and effective alternative to an
      operation to remove all or part of the affected gland. The objective is to achieve
      biochemical cure (assessed by normal calcium level in the blood at six weeks, six months and
      one year after therapy) without affecting the patient's voice or ability to swallow.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine condition in which one or more of the four
      parathyroid glands in the neck releases too much parathyroid hormone (PTH). this leads to
      excess calcium in the blood and if untreated it can cause osteoporosis, kidney stone
      formation, deterioration of kidney function and disturbance in heart rhythm. Surgery to
      remove all or part of the affected gland(s) is expected to cure 95% of such patients. In
      current practice all such patients undergo localisation techniques using sestamibi scanning
      and neck ultrasonography to demonstrate the position of the enlarged/overactive parathyroid
      gland. These radiological tests are positive in some two thirds of patients, who can be
      operated through a minimally invasive procedure focused on the exact localisation pinpointed
      by the scans.

      This study uses a procedure that does not require a surgical incision. Precise imaging of the
      parathyroid glands allows the exact position of the tumour to be found from outside the body.
      A High Intensity Focused Ultrasound beam produces heat, but only in a small specific area.
      Exact positioning of the ultrasound beam targets the tumour cells and kills them without
      harming the surrounding healthy tissues.
