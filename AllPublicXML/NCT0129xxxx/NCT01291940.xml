      The goal of this study is to better understand what effect emollients (moisturizers) have on
      the skin in young children and adults.

      Subjects will be recruited from PI and Sub-I clinics and Oregon Health &amp; Science University
      (OHSU) research opportunities website.

        1. Adult and Adolescent Study:

           Moisturizer Intervention - There will be 2-3 visits for this study: a screening visit, a
           baseline visit, and a final visit. Adults with a history of eczema will be asked to
           apply one of four possible moisturizers to one arm and nothing to the other arm for four
           weeks. The moisturizers, which will be assigned to the subjects, include either Cetaphil
           Cream, Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream, CeraVe Moisturizing Cream, or Vaseline
           100% Petroleum Jelly. Subjects can use other skin treatments as needed for their skin
           condition, but may not treat the arms during the study. Non-invasive tests of the skin
           will be made at Visit 1 and after four weeks (Visit 2). The skin measurements that will
           be performed are:

             -  Transepidermal loss (TEWL)- measures how much water is lost across the skin barrier

             -  Skin Cohesion and TEWL - TEWL after 5, 10, 15, and 20 tape strips will measure skin
                barrier function after tape-stripping

             -  Skin electrical capacitance - measures the moisture in the top layer of skin

             -  Skin pH - measures the acidity of the skin

             -  Stratum corneum cohesion assay - tape-stripping to measure the protein removed from
                the top layer of skin

             -  Lipidomic analysis - measures the lipids, or oils, in the top layer of skin Control
                - There will be 1-2 visits for this group: a screening visit and baseline visit,
                which can be combined. Non-invasive tests of the skin will be taken and include the
                skin measurements that will be performed are the same as the Moisturizer
                Intervention group.

        2. Pediatric Study: There will be 2-3 visits for this study: a screening visit, a baseline
           visit, and a final visit. Infants and toddlers between 3 months and 3 years of age
           without a history of skin barrier diseases will be assigned to a moisturizer, which
           include either Cetaphil Cream, Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream, CeraVe
           Moisturizing Cream, or Aveeno Skin Relief Moisture Repair Cream. Non-invasive tests of
           the skin will be made at Visit 1 and after four weeks (Visit 2).

             -  TEWL- measures how much water is lost across the skin barrier

             -  Skin electrical capacitance - measures the moisture in the top layer of skin

             -  Skin pH - measures the acidity of the skin
