    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been able to improve the lifespan of individuals
           infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but ART requires continuous
           treatment that has substantial consequences on quality of life. ART suppresses HIV-1
           virus levels below the limits of detection in current tests, but does not completely
           eradicate the virus from the blood. Recent research is attempting to determine whether
           this persistent infection stems from a low-level infection where new cells are
           continually infected with HIV, or from cells that live for a long time after infection.
           ART is very active against the virus in new cells, but has no effect on long-lived cells
           that are already infected with HIV-1 at the start of ART. As a result, new strategies
           may be necessary to reduce or eradicate these 'reservoir' cells.

        -  Interferon is a natural substance made by the body to combat virus infections, but can
           also be made as an injectable drug known as PEGINTRON. PEGINTRON injections have been
           approved to treat hepatitis C infection, including in patients with HIV infection.
           Earlier studies of HIV-infected individuals who were not on any ART showed that
           interferon reduced the level of HIV in the blood. Researchers are interested in
           determining whether PEGINTRON therapy will also reduce the residual low levels of HIV in
           patients who are already taking ART.

      Objectives:

      - To evaluate the effectiveness of PEGINTRON injections on HIV levels in participants
      currently undergoing antiretroviral therapy.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with HIV, are currently
      undergoing antiretroviral therapy, and have maintained HIV virus blood counts that are not
      detectable by current commercial tests for at least 12 months before the start of the study.

      Design:

        -  This study will involve separate screening and treatment processes.

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, including
           blood and urine samples. The screening analysis to determine study eligibility will take
           several weeks. Participants will have apheresis to provide sufficient numbers of blood
           cells for evaluation by the study researchers.

        -  Eligible participants will begin a 4-week course of PEGINTRON injections using the
           standard dose of PEGINTRON that is approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis C.
           Participants will have weekly injections and have frequent blood tests to measure HIV
           virus levels.

        -  Participants who experience problems in maintaining safe numbers of white blood cells
           during the study may receive injections of filgrastim to increase their white blood cell
           count.

        -  After the 4 weeks of treatment, participants will return for additional blood tests on
           study days 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, and 84, and Weeks 16, 24, 36, and 48 (i.e., through the
           end of 1 year after the start of the study).

    <textblock>
      As a result of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), morbidity and mortality from
      acquired immunodeficiency syndrome has declined significantly in the past 15 years, at least
      in developed countries. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected individuals now
      live longer, but must undergo continuous therapy that has substantial consequences on quality
      of life.

      ART suppresses HIV-1 viremia below the limits of detection in current commercial assays (c.
      50 copies/mL plasma)., but HIV viremia persists even after prolonged suppressive therapy. The
      origin of this residual viremia is yet not clear, but data suggest that production from long
      lived HIV infected cells may contribute to viremia.

      Antiretrovirals are extremely active against replicating cells, and can thus successfully
      stop viral replication, but have no effect on long-lived viral reservoirs of cells already
      infected with HIV-1 at the time antiretroviral therapy is initiated. As a result, new
      strategies are necessary to reduce or eradicate long-lived reservoirs.

      Interferon alpha is a natural cytokine with antiviral activity. Prior to the introduction of
      antiretroviral therapy, several studies demonstrated modest effect of interferon alpha in
      HIV-1 viremia in active cycles of infection in infected individuals. Interferon alpha was
      also effective in vitro in decreasing virus production from cells chronically infected with
      HIV-1. With the introduction of potent antiretroviral therapy, interferon was not developed
      as a direct anti-HIV drug. Interferon alpha is relatively effective in therapy of hepatitis C
      virus (HCV) infection, and has been used in HIV-1/HCV coinfected individuals. Kottilil and
      coworkers in the Laboratory of Immunoregulation NIAID have shown a decrease in HIV-1 RNA
      levels in HCV coinfected participants treated with pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin.
      In stored samples from that study, we conducted a retrospective trial on samples from
      participants with HIV-1 RNA levels of &lt;50 copies/mL, showing a further reduction in residual
      viremia using an ultrasensitive Single Copy Assay (SCA) developed in our laboratory. As such
      the effects of interferon on HIV viremia and cell associated HIV RNA are of growing interest.

      In this protocol we will conduct a prospective, non-randomized, single arm, pilot study to
      investigate the effect of pegylated interferon alpha 2b on HIV-1 RNA levels as an additional
      drug in participants undergoing suppressive antiretroviral therapy with viral RNA levels
      suppressed to less than 50 copies/mL plasma. As patients may have levels of HIV RNA that are
      lower than our limit of detection, we will also investigate levels of HIV nucleic acid
      species in cells as well. We will determine whether interferon alpha therapy will reduce
      residual viremia or cell associated HIV RNA in participants on suppressive ART, which will
      expand our understanding of persistent low-level viremia and the pathogenesis of HIV in
      infected individuals.
