  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this study two different therapeutic exercise regimens will be compared in patients with
      anterior knee pain (patellofemoral pain syndrome, PFPS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise therapy is widely used in the conservative treatment of patellofemoral pain syndrome
      (PFPS), but there is still no consensus on recommending any specific rehabilitation program.

      This study evaluates two different therapeutic exercise regimens in patients with PFPS and
      their effect on pain at rest and function.

      Supervised exercise therapy will be applied in both groups three times a week over a 3-month
      period with individually tailored and graded exercise programs, differing between groups in
      terms of number of exercises, number of repetitions and sets, and time spent on performing
      aerobic exercises.

    <measure>Pain measured by a Visual analogue scale (VAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-test, post-test (after completed intervention at 3 months) and one year follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>This scale was illustrated with a 100 mm horizontal line with descriptors &quot;no pain&quot; at the 0 mm mark and &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot; anchoring the 100 mm. Participants were required to place a vertical mark on the horizontal line, representing their average level of pain experienced during the last 24 hours. This was done at rest and provided an illustration of the perceived pain severity, rated in millimetres.</description>
