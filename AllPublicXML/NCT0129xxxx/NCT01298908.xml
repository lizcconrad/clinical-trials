  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial, a method used to implement the random allocation sequence is
      numbered containers.

      The aim of the study is to compare operative treatment, ultrasound guided laser ablation and
      ultrasound guided foam sclerotherapy in occluding/ablating of insufficiency in great
      saphenous trunks. On the grounds of the available data, the study hypothesis is that using
      laser or operative treatment more than 20 percent better outcome can be achieved compared to
      foam sclerotherapy.

      In operative treatment the great saphenous vein will be removed after flush ligation by
      femoral vein and stripping of the trunk. In intravenous laser treatment a thin laser fiber is
      inserted through a tiny distal entry point. The probe is guided into place using ultrasound
      and the procedure is performed under local tumescence anesthesia. Laser energy is delivered
      to seal the faulty vein. Ultrasound guided foam sclerotherapy involves an injection of foam
      (sodium tetradecyl sulfate mixed with air according to the Thessari method) directly into the
      venous trunk under ultrasound control. In each group patients will use supportive treatment
      stockings 2 weeks after treatment. The patients in all groups are followed up one year by
      ultrasound scanning.
