  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study of polatuzumab vedotin
      administered as a single agent by intravenous (IV) infusion to participants with relapsed or
      refractory hematologic malignancies. In Phase Ib, participants will receive polatuzumab
      vedotin in combination with rituximab.
