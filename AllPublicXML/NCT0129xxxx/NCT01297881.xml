    <textblock>
      Pulmonary function tests including spirometry, lung volumes, measurements of resistance and
      diffusing capacity are essential in the diagnosis of several pulmonary diseases. These tests
      are an integral part of the diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases, but until now there is
      no clear evidence for the use of many of the pulmonary function tests because of a lack of
      adequate studies. The obscurity largely pertains to the conditions under which combinations
      of the various tests are indicated. Therefore the Belgian Thoracic Society, assembling all
      pulmonologists and the pneumology LOK/GLEMâ€Ÿs, will investigate this matter.

    <description>To determine the effect of stepwise addition of various pulmonary function tests (spirometry, volumes, resistance and diffusing capacity in that order) on the preferential diagnosis and its reflection of the gold standard (final diagnosis), a statistical score will be calculated based on 1/n differential diagnoses after every pulmonary function test. The score will contain corrections for a high number of differential diagnoses and a wrong preferential diagnosis and compared with Linear mixed model after logistic transformation.</description>
