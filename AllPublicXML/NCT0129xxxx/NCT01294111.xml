  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is recommended in the treatment of heart failure. Elderly people demand
      various forms of physical activity. Tai chi has shown to be an appreciated form of physical
      activity among elderly, although there is a lack of studies focusing people aged 70 years and
      older.

      The overall goal with the project is to find a form of physical activity that is safe and
      free from side effects, suitable for elderly people with chronic heart failure. The
      hypothesis is that for patients participating in tai chi training during three months the
      degree of self rated fatigue will be reduced and health-related quality of life will
      increase, compared with a control group receiving ordinary care. The primary aim is to study
      the effect of tai chi training on fatigue and health-related quality of life. A second aim is
      to study effects on physical function and levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in blood
      plasma. A tertiary aim is to describe the experience of participating in tai chi training.

      A mixed methods study is conducted. Fortyfive patients with a verified diagnosis of heart
      failure in the age of 70 years or older, who experience fatigue according to the Multi
      Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20), was randomized to intervention or control group. Three groups
      with 8-9 participants each completed a tai chi training programme twice-weekly for 16 weeks.
      Data was collected at baseline, directly after the 16 weeks of training, and 6 and 12 months
      thereafter. The programme is worked out by an expert in Chinese traditional medicine to suit
      elderly people with chronic heart failure, and the classes were led by experienced leaders.
      Before the start of the study a small pilot study was conducted to test the feasibility of
      the programme. A group of seven patients completed the programme for eight weeks without any
      problems.

      If tai chi has a good effect on fatigue, health-related quality of life and physical
      function, this form of physical activity can be a valuable complement to other medical
      treatment. Tai chi has a potential to be offered to many patients to a relatively low cost.
      It can be practiced in groups or in private, and also through internet connection.
