  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will develop and evaluate a community-based approach for disseminating comparative
      effective reviews (CERs) about breast cancer prevention to African American women. The
      specific aims of our research, as shown below, will target this population because of
      persistent disparities in breast cancer morbidity and mortality among this population. Our
      primary aims are:

        1. To evaluate uptake of a community-based strategy for disseminating CERs about breast
           cancer prevention to African American women based on sociodemographic characteristics,
           beliefs about medical research, and medical history. We predict that participation in a
           community forum will be higher among women with greater socioeconomic resources, those
           who have a family history of breast cancer, and women who have more positive beliefs
           about research.

        2. To evaluate the impact of evidential versus non-evidential content about breast cancer
           prevention on psychological and behavioral outcomes that include: knowledge of breast
           cancer risk factors and prevention strategies, communication with individuals in their
           social and medical network, and distrust of medical research. We predict that women who
           receive evidential content that is specific for African American women will report
           greater knowledge about breast cancer risk factors and prevention strategies, will be
           more likely to discuss breast cancer prevention strategies with individuals in their
           social and medical network, and will report greater reductions in distrust of medical
           research compared to those who receive non-evidential content.
