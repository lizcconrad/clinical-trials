      The aim of the project is to evaluate the oncological and functional outcome of the more
      extensive perineal dissection - i.e the extra levator resection - in abdominoperineal
      resections in patients with rectal cancer.

      Hypothesis: Extra levator perineal resection reduces local recurrence three year
      postoperatively compared to traditional abdominoperineal resection and improves QoL 2-4 years
      postoperatively.

      Low rectal cancer treated surgically by abdominoperineal resection (APR) has worse outcome
      than other rectal cancers operated with low anterior resection. In order to improve the
      outcome in the APR group a more extensive surgical procedure - the extra levator APR - has
      been suggested. This study aims to investigate both the oncological and the functional
      outcome of this method as compared to the traditional APR.

      Method: All Swedish patients undergoing abdominoperineal resection for rectal cancer
      2007-2009 will be analysed regarding operative technique (traditional or extra levator
      resection). Data on all patients regarding pre op TNM classification, pathological report and
      local recurrence will be collected from the Swedish Rectal Cancer registry. A validated QoL
      form will be sent to each patient to further investigate the functional outcome, health
      economy and Quality of Life 2-4 years postoperatively.

      Data will be analysed regarding 3 year recurrence rate (primary endpoint) as well as
      functional result and QoL (secondary endpoints) in the two different groups - i.e traditional
      and extra levator APR.
