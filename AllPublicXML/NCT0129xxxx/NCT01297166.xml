      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-psoriatic effect of LEO 27989 ointment and
      calcipotriol plus LEO 27989 ointment, using the psoriasis plaque test modified from the
      method developed by KJ Dumas and JR Scholtz.

          -  Systemic treatments with all other therapies than biologicals, with a potential effect
             on psoriasis vulgaris (e.g., corticosteroids, retinoids, immunosuppressants) within
             the 4-week period prior to randomisation and during the study

          -  Subjects using one of the following topical drugs for the treatment of psoriasis

             vulgaris (e.g., beta blockers, anti-malaria drugs, lithium and ACE inhibitors) within

             agent which has not yet been made available for clinical use following registration)
             within the 4 week period prior to randomisation or longer, if the class of the
             substance requires a longer washout as defined above (e.g., biological treatments)

             interfere significantly with the evaluation of study results or the study course (e.g.
             cancer, severe cardiopathy, severe renal insufficiency, severe hepatic insufficiency).
