    <textblock>
      TVI-Brain-1 is an experimental treatment that takes advantage of the fact that your body can
      produce immune cells, called 'killer' white blood cells that have the ability to kill large
      numbers of the cancer cells that are present in your body. TVI-Brain-1 is designed to
      generate large numbers of those 'killer' white blood cells and to deliver those cells into
      your body so that they can kill your cancer cells.

      The TVI-Brain-1 treatment involves several steps. First, the patient's cancer will be
      surgically removed to provide cells for the vaccine. Second, the patient will be vaccinated
      with the vaccine formulation. Third, the patient's blood will be filtered for killer T cell
      precursors which will then be cultured and stimulated to reach a higher (killer) activity
      level. Fourth, the activated cells will be infused into the patient's bloodstream so that
      they will be able to attack the cancer.

    <description>Following surgery, tumor tissue is used to generate a cancer vaccine. Patients are vaccinated with neutralized cells to initiate an immune response. Following vaccinations, the patient's white blood cells are collected, the white blood cells are stimulated and expanded, and are then reinfused into the patient's blood.</description>
