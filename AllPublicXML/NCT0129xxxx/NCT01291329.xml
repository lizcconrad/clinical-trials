      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of intracoronary human
      umbilical Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cell (WJ-MSC) transfer in patients with
      ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that MSCs have the potential to differentiate into cardiomyocytes
      both in vitro and in vivo. Several clinical trials have been performed using autologous bone
      marrow-derived MSCs, but the results of these trials have been unsatisfactory because of a
      low number of MSCs in older patients and in those with coronary heart disease. WJ-MSCs from
      the human umbilical cord matrix which are of epiblastic origin and contain both human
      embryonic stem cell (hESC) and human mesenchymal stem cell markers appear to have a number of
      important advantages: they do not raise ethical issues, are widely multipotent, are not
      tumorigenic, and are not immunogenetic. Because of a short population doubling time they can
      be rapidly scaled up in large numbers. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      multicenter trial, randomly assigning 160 patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial
      infarction to receive an intracoronary infusion of WJ-MSCs or placebo medium into the infarct
      artery 4-7 days after successful reperfusion therapy.

    <description>The primary endpoints were differences between the two treatments and from baseline to 4 months in quantitative myocardial metabolic and perfusion images, as measured by 18F-FDG positron emission tomography and 99 mTctetrofosmine single-photon imaging.

    <time_frame>4 months-1year</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be determined by the assessment of major adverse coronary events (MACE) defined as cardiac death, peri-procedural myocardial infarction, or any repeat coronary intervention at 4 months-1year. Furthermore, safety is also determined by the occurrence of stent thrombosis, arrhythmias events. immune system disorders. The trial will be monitored by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and the trial will be discontinued in case of safety concerns.</description>
