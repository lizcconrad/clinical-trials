      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed combination of
      Brinzolamide/Brimonidine in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) relative to each of its
      individual active components in patients with open-angle glaucoma and/or ocular hypertension.

      This study consisted of 6 visits conducted during 2 sequential phases: the
      Screening/Eligibility phase, which included a screening visit and 2 eligibility visits, and
      the Treatment phase, which included 3 on-therapy visits conducted at Week 2, Week 6, and
      Month 3. A washout period based on previous ocular medication preceded Eligibility Visit 1.
      Patients who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria at both eligibility visits were randomized
      (1:1:1) to receive treatment with 1 of 3 study drugs for 3 months. Study drug instillation
      began the morning after the second eligibility visit.

    <time_frame>Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>At the Month 3 (Exit) visit, the 8 am IOP measurement was taken before instillation of study drug. The study drug was instilled approximately 15 minutes after the 8 am measurement. An additional dose was given at 3 pm. Intraocular pressure was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry. One eye from each patient was chosen as the study eye and only data for the study eye were used for the efficacy analysis. A higher IOP can be a greater risk factor for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage).</description>

             pressure within protocol-specified range at eligibility visit/s.

          -  Other protocol-specified inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females of childbearing potential if pregnant, lactating, or not using highly
             effective birth control measures.

          -  Severe central vision loss in either eye.

          -  Chronic, recurrent, or severe inflammatory eye disease.

          -  Ocular trauma within the preceding 6 months.

          -  Ocular infection or ocular inflammation within the preceding 3 months.

          -  Clinically significant or progressive retinal disease such as retinal degeneration,
             diabetic retinopathy, or retinal detachment.

          -  Best-corrected visual acuity score worse than 55 letters using the Early Treatment
             Diabetic Retinopathy Study chart.

          -  Other ocular pathology (including severe dry eye) that may, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, preclude the administration of study product.

          -  Ocular surgery within the preceding 6 months.

          -  Ocular laser surgery within the preceding 3 months.

          -  Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry.

          -  Any other conditions, including severe illness, which could make the patient, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, unsuitable for the study.

          -  Other protocol-specified exclusion criteria may apply.

        <title>Mean IOP at Month 3 for Each Assessment Timepoint (8 AM, + 2 h, + 7 h, and + 9 h)</title>
        <description>At the Month 3 (Exit) visit, the 8 am IOP measurement was taken before instillation of study drug. The study drug was instilled approximately 15 minutes after the 8 am measurement. An additional dose was given at 3 pm. Intraocular pressure was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry. One eye from each patient was chosen as the study eye and only data for the study eye were used for the efficacy analysis. A higher IOP can be a greater risk factor for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage).</description>
