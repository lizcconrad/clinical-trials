      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the distributions of HCV viral/human
      genotypes (including IL28B and inosine triphosphatase, ITPA), and HCV RNA level among ITPA
      gene among 1000 Han ethnic Chinese patients with HCV who are antiviral treatment naive at the
      time the study is conducted.

    <textblock>
      A sample of 1000 Han ethnic Chinese male or female who are ≥ 18 years old with a recent
      confirmation of anti-HCV-antibody positive and HCV RNA positive but antiviral treatment naive
      from 28 university affiliated hospital in China. The primary objective of this study is to
      estimate the distributions of HCV Viral genotyping(ie, genotype 1 through 6 and their known
      subtypes), and host genotypes, both inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) gene, and IL28B. This study
      also collects other data including patients' demographic and clinical characteristics. There
      is no active antiviral treatments and no follow-up in this study.
