    <textblock>
      Patients with a suspected Deep Tissue Injury (or a purple reddened area over a bony
      prominence of their body, which is expected to break down into a pressure ulcer) will be
      place on the Clinitron® Rite HiteTM bed to see if the air fluidized mattress decreases the
      amount of tissue breakdown from their bruise.

    <textblock>
      Up to 15 centers will participate in this case series in acute care and long term acute care
      facilities. Patients who present with sDTI and consent for study will have the Clinitron®
      Rite HiteTM bed ordered and delivered within a 12 hour window to be able to participate. They
      will have their sDTI photographed, and an assessment of expected breakdown will be noted by
      the clinical team. The patient will be followed during the course of hospitalization and
      additional photographs and documentation will be performed by the clinical team to
      demonstrate the actual breakdown that occurred.

      Information including the pertinent history of current illness, co-morbid conditions, and
      demographic information will be shared with the sponsor in order to demonstrate each case.
