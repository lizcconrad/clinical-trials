  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypomagnesemia is common in renal transplant recipients and is mainly because of enhanced
      renal magnesium wasting, caused by immunosuppressive drugs (calcineurin inhibitors). Glucose
      metabolism disorders, including insulin resistance and decreased insulin secretion, are also
      prevalent post-transplantation and often precede the development of diabetes. As magnesium
      supplementation has been demonstrated to increase insulin sensitivity in both diabetic and
      non-diabetic patients, its potential therapeutic supplementation (post-transplantation)
      deserves further examination. The hypothesis is that magnesium supplementation in renal
      transplant recipients exerts a beneficial effect on insulin resistance and/or secretion.

    <description>The primary outcome of the study is the evaluation of change in insulin resistance and insulin secretion after 6 months of supplementation (versus no supplementation). Insulin resistance is measured by 'Homeostatic Model Assessment' (HOMA) - modeling and the McAuley Index. Insulin secretion is assessed by 'Oral Glucose Tolerance test' (OGTT)- derived indices.</description>

    <description>The patient group of hypomagnesesemic renal transplant recipients randomized to magnesium supplementation (number = 30).

    <description>The patient group of hypomagnesesemic renal transplantation recipients, randomized to no magnesium supplementation (number = 30). During 6 months, no magnesium supplementation is started, provided that the serum magnesium level remains &gt; 1,2 milligram/deciliter. In case of cramps, intermittent supplementation is allowed, but will be recorded. The assessments are a baseline fasting assessment of insulin resistance and an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test with derived indices of insulin secretion,which are repeated after 6 months.</description>

    <description>In the control group of normomagnesemic renal transplantation recipients (number = 10), only a baseline assessment will be performed. The assessments are a baseline fasting assessment of insulin resistance and an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test with derived indices of insulin secretion.</description>
