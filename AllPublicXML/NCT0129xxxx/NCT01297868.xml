      Objective The investigators assessed the acute impact of physical exercise on retinal vessel
      regulation. This might be of clinical importance if retinal vessel regulation is examined
      with the very sensitive method of the dynamic vessel analyzer Design Forty middle aged (age
      range 18 to 31 years, mean age 24 years) healthy subjects (26 female / 14 male) had retinal
      examinations with static and dynamic vessel analysis prior and after (0.5h, 1.5h, 2.5h)
      intense exercise of 20 minutes.
