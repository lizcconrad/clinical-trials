  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic plantar fasciopathy is a painful condition common in the workplace, particularly for
      those workers required to stand for long periods of time, and is typically associated with
      point tenderness at heel and arch of the foot. This clinical trial will investigate the
      effectiveness of an innovative multi-element exercise program versus the standard of care for
      plantar fasciopathy. The observation period will be 12-weeks. Outcomes are determined through
      questionnaire and ultrasound imaging. Workers with long-standing plantar fasciopathy who must
      stand for prolonged periods of time (i.e. &gt; 6 hours) during their workday will be invited to
      participate in this study. After ensuring eligibility, each subject will be randomly assigned
      to either the intervention group who will receive a multi-element exercise program, or the
      control group who will receive a cortisone injection followed by a stretching program for
      their calf-muscles (standard of care). The treatment length for both groups will be 12-weeks.

    <description>The subject stands feet shoulder width apart with one foot ahead of the other and then contracting only calf muscles of the back leg, lifts the heel of the back leg until the metatarsophalangeal joint of that foot is maximally extended. The subject is instructed to concentrate on maintaining balance on the back leg over the first and second metatarsophalangeal joints throughout movement for 5 sets of 15 repetitions.</description>

Next the foot is again placed on top of a phone-book with the knee flexed approximately 15-20 degrees and held for 3 sets of 30 seconds each.</description>
