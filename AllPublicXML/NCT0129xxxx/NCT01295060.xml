        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently enrolled in the Extension Phase of Study IP107-001 and received at least one
             84-mg octreotide hydrogel implant prior to enrollment OR previously enrolled in the
             Extension Phase of Study IP107-001 and currently taking lanreotide or octreotide.

          -  Subjects who have been successfully treated with the 84-mg octreotide hydrogel implant
             in Study IP107 001.

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator; subject has no unstable chronic medical conditions
             and no clinically significant findings that would preclude subject's participation in
             the study.

          -  Subjects must be able to communicate, provide and sign written informed consent, and
             be willing to participate and comply with study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             study IP107 001 within 30 days of enrollment into this study

          -  Received radiotherapy for pituitary tumor or any radiotherapy above the neck at any
             time prior to enrollment into this study

          -  Receiving pegvisomant, dopamine agonist or other therapy in combination with
             somatostatin to control GH or IGF-1 levels prior to enrollment into this study

          -  History or presence of significant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, hematologic,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic, psychiatric
