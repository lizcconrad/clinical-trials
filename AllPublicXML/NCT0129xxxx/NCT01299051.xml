  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposal of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two worksite weight management
      programs at Duke: Steps to Health (STH) ('usual standard of care') and the more extensive
      Steps to Health Plus! (STH+). We have added an additional follow-up, by invitation only, for
      participants in the study who agreed to be contacted for future research.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Steps to Health and Steps to Health Plus! aim to help Duke employees achieve weight loss and
      maintain healthy weights. We will be following participants in these programs over a two year
      period. These two groups will be compared with an observational comparison group of employees
      who meet eligibility criteria but do not take part in the randomized controlled trial. We
      will assess whether the two programs decrease obesity-related injuries in the workplace and
      estimate the net costs of the two programs relative to their effectiveness more broadly.

      In the additional follow-up, we will be assessing factors that may be related to program
      success. This will include a survey as well as some focus group data.
