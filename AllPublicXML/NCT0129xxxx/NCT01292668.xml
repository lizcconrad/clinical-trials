    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses a drug that becomes active when it is exposed to a
      certain kind of light. When the drug is active, cancer cells are killed. Photodynamic therapy
      using methyl-5-aminolevulinate hydrochloride cream may be effective against skin cancer.
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of photodynamic
      therapy with methyl-5-aminolevulinate hydrochloride cream in determining pain threshold
      patients with skin cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the &quot;low&quot; initial irradiance that causes no or minimal
      (pain grade of &lt; 4) during the time period during which 90 +/- 10% photo bleaching of
      protoporphyrin IX (PplX) in the lesion occurs, and which precedes the &quot;high&quot; irradiance
      portion of MAL/PDT. II. To determine the effects of preceding &quot;low&quot; irradiance on the pain
      level of the &quot;high&quot; irradiance portion of MAL-PDT. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the
      effects of irradiance on lesion perfusion. II. To determine PpIX and Total Vit D content in
      blood. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To monitor the clinical outcomes of the treatments for initial
      response and recurrences. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. GROUP I:
      Patients apply methyl-5-aminolevulinate hydrochloride (MAL) cream on the lesions and the
      surrounding normal skin. Beginning 3 hours later, patients undergo laser light treatment for
      3-5 minutes. GROUP II: Patients apply MAL cream on the lesions and the surrounding normal
      skin. Beginning 3 hours later, patients undergo light-emitting diode treatment for 10-20
      minutes. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 5-7 days, at 6-12
      months, and at 24 months.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with 1-2 superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC), 0.5 to 2 cm in diameter

          -  Primary or recurrent lesions may be treated

          -  Diagnosis must be confirmed by biopsy, at least 2 weeks pre treatment

          -  Each patient with &lt; 8 lesions can contribute a maximum of 2 lesions per treatment
             session, 1 lesion per light source, which can be treated the same day as permitted by
             scheduling; the remaining lesions may be treated as soon as scheduling permits with
             non protocol Photodynamic Therapy

          -  Patient or legal representative must understand the investigational nature of this
             study and sign an Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved
             written informed consent form prior to receiving any study related procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients not meeting the above selection criteria

          -  Lesions which are not suitable for diagnostic measurements
