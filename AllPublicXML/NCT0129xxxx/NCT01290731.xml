      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TMC435 in combination
      with peginterferon alfa-2a (PegIFNα-2a) and ribavirin in genotype 1 hepatitis C virus
      (HCV)-infected participants who relapsed after previous interferon (IFN)-based therapy in
      Japan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TMC435 in combination with
      the standard of care (SoC), PegIFNα-2a (P) and ribavirin (R), in adult, genotype 1
      HCV-infected participants who relapsed after previous IFN-based therapy in Japan. The study
      objective is to evaluate the efficacy of TMC435 by the percentage of participants with
      undetectable HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA). Participants will receive 12 weeks of treatment with
      TMC435 (100 mg) once daily plus PR followed by 12 or 36 weeks of treatment with PR. TMC435 is
      a 100-mg capsule and will be taken orally (via the mouth). Treatment with PR will last 24 or
      48 weeks. Pegylated interferon is supplied as a vial containing 1.0 mL solution with 180 µg
      PegIFNα-2a and will be injected by a syringe under the skin once weekly. Ribavirin is given
      as 200-mg tablets (daily dose: 600-1000 mg), taken orally two times a day after meals. The
      participants will receive oral capsules of TMC435 (100 mg) once daily up to Week 12.

        <description>The table below shows the number of participants with abnormal ALT levels at baseline (Day 1) who achieved normalization of ALT levels (defined as an ALT value less than or equal to the Upper Limit of Normality [ie, 40 IU/mL] at EOT). At baseline, 15/49 participants had abnormal ALT levels.</description>
