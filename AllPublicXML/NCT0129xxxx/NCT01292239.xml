    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TMC435 compared with
      placebo in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a (pegIFN alfa-2a) and ribavirin in
      treatment-naive patients with chronic genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Japan.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), 2-arm, double-blind study to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of TMC435 (also referred to as jnj-38733214-aaa) versus placebo in
      combination with the standard of care (SoC) therapy (peginterferon alfa-2a [pegIFN alfa-2a]
      and ribavirin) in adult treatment-naïve patients (who never received treatment for HCV) with
      chronic genotype 1 HCV infection in Japan. The study objective is to evaluate and compare the
      efficacy of TMC435 vs placebo by the proportion of the patients with undetectable HCV
      ribonucleic acid (RNA). In the TMC435 treatment group, patients will receive 12 weeks of
      treatment with TMC435 (100 mg) once daily plus SoC followed by an additional 12 or 36 weeks
      of treatment with SoC. In the placebo treatment group, patients will receive 12 weeks of
      treatment with placebo once daily plus SoC followed by an additional 36 weeks of treatment
      with SoC. TMC435 is a 100-mg capsule and will be taken orally by mouth. The SoC treatment
      will be given for 24 or 48 weeks. Pegylated interferon is supplied as a vial containing 1.0
      mL solution with 180 mcg pegIFN alpha-2a and administered subcutaneously (injected by a
      syringe under the skin) once weekly. Ribavirin is given as 200-mg tablets (daily dose:
      600-1000 mg based on body weight), and taken orally by mouth two times a day after meals.

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted between 17-January-2011 and 22-October-2012 and recruited participants with chronic genotype 1 Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection who were treatment-naïve from 37 study centers in Japan. A total 183 participants were randomized and started treatment; 172 completed the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Treatment-naïve HCV-infected participants were assigned to 1 of 2 groups to receive TMC435 100 mg once daily with PegIFN alpha-2a and ribavirin (PR) until Week 12, followed by PR until Week 24 or 48 OR placebo with PR until Week 12, followed by PR until Week 48.</pre_assignment_details>

Treatment was to be stopped at Week 24 for participants who achieved plasma levels of Hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) &lt; 1.2 log10 IU/mL detectable or undetectable at Week 4 and undetectable HCV RNA at Week 12.
