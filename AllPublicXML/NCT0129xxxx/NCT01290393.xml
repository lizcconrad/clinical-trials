    <textblock>
      This study will assess the risk of spontaneous abortion during weeks 1-19 of gestation, and
      other pregnancy outcomes, in an Exposed vaccinated cohort, i.e. women with last menstrual
      period between 30 days before and 90 days after any dose of CERVARIX, when compared to a
      Non-exposed vaccinated cohort, i.e. women with last menstrual period between 120 days and 18
      months after the last CERVARIX or GARDASIL dose.

      The present study will be conducted by the OTIS (Organization of Teratology Information
      Specialists) network. OTIS is a non-profit organization specialised to assess exposures
      during pregnancy and dedicated to providing accurate evidence-based, clinical information to
      patients and health care professionals about exposures during pregnancy and lactation. OTIS
      is based on voluntary phone calls. Women call when they have questions and concerns about
      risks potentially associated with any kind of exposure during pregnancy or breastfeeding,
      including medications, chemicals, pesticides, diseases, infections, and vaccinations.
