      The primary purpose of the study is to investigate allele frequencies of candidate genes in
      Chinese diabetic patients with or without known diabetic retinopathy. Two hundred Chinese
      diabetic patients, aged between 20 - 75 years old, who have received ophthalmic fundus
      examination (either by an ophthalmoscope or fundus camera) within 6 months before the study
      will be recruited for the study. Each subject will receive anthropometric and blood pressure
      measurements. Then, fasting blood samples will be taken for the measurements of glucose,
      HbA1c, lipid profile, and biochemistry. An additional 10 ml blood sample will be taken for
      DNA extraction from buffy coat. Meanwhile, the participant will receive structural
      questionnaires for demography, personal history, medical history and concomitant medication.
      Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes and in targeted chromosome regions
      will be genotyped by using the ABI TaqMan assays. The differences in the distribution of
      genotypes and alleles between the study groups will be analyzed using appropriate statistical
      methods. Through the study, the investigators hope to build up a platform for future
      large-scale genetic studies of diabetic retinopathy. The investigators also hope to set up
      priority of candidate loci for future studies.

    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most frequent microvascular complications of diabetes
      (DM). Current guidelines recommend that patients with DM should receive ophthalmic fundus
      examination annually. DR poses a serious threat to the health of millions patients who have
      DM. Nowadays, DR has become the leading cause of new cases of visual impairment and blindness
      among adults.

      Genetic factors are likely to account for the susceptibility to DR for the differences in DR
      incidence between individuals with diabetes. Familial aggregation studies showed that
      increased risk of severe DR was noted among family members with diabetes with moderate
      heritability of DR risk. Racial and ethnic differences in the prevalence of DR may also
      explain some parts of influence of genetic or environmental/cultural risk factors. There were
      over 30 candidate genes involved in metabolic mechanisms and functional pathways associated
      with DR. However, consistent associations between candidate genes and DR have yet been
      identified. The current study is designed to build up a working platform for future
      large-scale genetic studies of diabetic retinopathy. The investigators also hope to set up
      priority of candidate loci for future researches.

      In the present study, the investigators plan to recruit 200 Chinese patients with DM who have
      received ophthalmic fundus examination (either by an ophthalmoscope or fundus camera) within
      6 months before the study. Each subject will receive anthropometric and blood pressure
      measurements. Then, fasting blood samples will be taken for the measurements of glucose,
      HbA1c, lipid profile, and biochemistry. An additional 10 ml blood sample will be taken for
      DNA extraction from buffy coat. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes and
      in targeted chromosome regions will be genotyped by using the ABI TaqMan assays. The
      differences in the distribution of genotypes and alleles between the study groups will be
      analyzed using appropriate statistical methods.

      The participants will receive fasting blood sampling for the measurements of glucose, HbA1c,
      lipid profile, and biochemistry. An additional 10 ml blood sample will be taken for DNA
      extraction from buffy coat. Early morning urine samples will also be collected for evaluation
      of overt proteinuria by a dipstick method.
