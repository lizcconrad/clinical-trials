  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma are considered as &quot;one airway, one disease&quot;. Although there
      is increasing evidence for an association between allergy and depression, it remains unknown
      if the relationship between AR and asthma has extra influence on the psychological status of
      the patients. The aim of our study was to investigate the influence pattern of asthma on the
      psychological status in AR patients. The Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) was employed to
      analyze the psychological status of 524 individuals with AR. Independent sample T-tests,
      one-way ANOVA and multivariate ANOVA were used for data analyses.

        524 affected individuals (311 males and 213 females) with AR were prospectively recruited
        from the rhinology clinic of the Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery Department of
        Beijing Tongren Hospital from February 2009 to November 2009.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients suffered from rhinitis symptoms such as nasal itching, sneezing, nasal
             obstruction and running nose, all patients had not undergone any medicine therapy in
             the past one week; nasal endoscopy showed a pale and edematous nasal mucosa, nasal
             discharge and swollen inferior turbinates. Every nasal symptom was scored on Visual
             analog scale (VAS, 0-3 score) respectively. A score of 0 indicated no nasal symptom, 1
             indicated slight nasal symptoms, 2 indicated obvious nasal symptom, but which could
             still be endured, and 3 indicated obvious nasal symptoms that could not be endured;

          -  Age between 16 to 60 years;

          -  A positive skin prick test (SPT)to at least one allergen, the level of response equal
             to or exceeding ++. The following inhalant allergens were tested: Der p; Der f; Animal
             hair; Trees; Grasses; Cereals; Mugwort; Dandelion; Giant ragweed; Chenopodium album;
             Humulus; Locust; Blatella germanica; Pine; Plantain; Curvularia lunata; Candida
             albicans; Penicillium notatum; Alternaria tenuis and Aspergillus fumigatu. The
             reactions were evaluated based on the mean wheal diameter at 15 minutes after
             application of the extracts. The mean diameters of each allergen wheals were
             calculated from the sum of the largest measurement across the wheal and the largest
             wheal measurement perpendicular to this divided by two. In addition, we calculated the
             skin index (SI) as the ratio of allergen weal diameter divided by the histamine weal
             size. The SPT result for each allergen was defined in terms of the SI value as
             follows: +: SI≤0.5; ++: 0.5&lt;SI≤1.0; +++: 1.0&lt;SI≤2.0; ++++: SI&gt;2.0.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  AR combined with hypertension, diabetes or other chronic diseases;

          -  AR combined with tumor in the nasal cavity;

          -  AR combined with eczema;

          -  Acute infection in the past one week;

          -  Failure to complete the questionnaires;

          -  AR patients undergoing negative life events.
