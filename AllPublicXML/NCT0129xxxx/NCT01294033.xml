  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maximal consumption of oxygen (VO2max) during exercise is used in patients with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to stratify perioperative risk. However, the impact of
      supplemental oxygen to prevent hypoxemia during exercise on maximal oxygen consumption and
      other ventilatory parameters during maximal exercise in the resting normoxic Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease population is poorly defined. The investigators performed a
      randomized controlled trial in patients with COPD who underwent cardiopulmonary exercise
      tests on room air and supplemental oxygen. The investigators compared maximal oxygen
      consumption and other ventilatory parameters in each individual subject under the two
      conditions.
