  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to determine the efficacy of topical application of E-101 Solution
      directly into the surgical incisional wound in the prevention of infection of superficial and
      deep surgical incisional wounds. E-101 Solution is an enzyme-based antiseptic that is being
      developed for direct application to a surgical incision.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this standard-of-care, pivotal Phase 3 study is to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of topical E-101 Solution after direct application into the principal surgical
      incision in the prevention of superficial and deep incisional surgical site infections (SSI)
      within 30 days after elective colorectal surgery. The study is intended to support a target
      indication statement of: &quot;E-101 Solution is indicated for the prophylaxis of incisional
      surgical site infections following elective colorectal surgery&quot;. E-101 Solution is comprised
      of the active ingredients of glucose oxidase (GO) and porcine myeloperoxidase (pMPO) that
      produce coupled reactions after the addition of glucose substrate. The hypothesis is that
      E-101 Solution topically applied directly into the principal incision is safe and
      significantly reduces the incidence of incisional SSI compared to placebo topical
      application. (The principal surgical incision is ≥ 5cm and &lt; 35 cm used as a hand port,
      colorectal specimen extraction port, or extracorporeal manipulation port depending on the
      specific colorectal surgical approach.)

          3. Use of microbial sealant (IntegusealTM), any antibiotic-embedded suture, or any
             antimicrobial-embedded suture to close the principal incision or any suture in the

             regulatory authority.

          4. Absolute contraindication to general anesthesia.

          5. Hypersensitivity reactions to steri-strip tapes, medical-surgery tapes, adhesives, or
             sutures. (Note: If there can be assurances that the subject will not be exposed to
             these materials that cause hypersensitivity, alternatives will be allowed.)

          6. History of keloid or hypertrophic scarring within or near an incision from a prior
             surgery.

          7. Body mass index [BMI]: &gt; 50 or &lt; 20 (both due to the extremely high risk of poor wound
             healing).

          8. ASA score &gt; 3.

          9. Undergoing emergency colorectal surgery such that standard bowel preparation and other
             standard preoperative precautions and assessments cannot be performed in time before
             the index-surgery.

         10. The planned index-surgery involves removal or placement of mesh (either synthetic or
             biological) as part of closure in the principal incision or traversing any part of a
             pre-existing mesh (either synthetic or biological) in the principal incision.

         11. There are clinical signs of overt infection necessitating systemic antibiotics via
             oral, intramuscular, or intravenous routes (e.g., infection of the abdominal wall,
             peritonitis, pneumonia, and sepsis/septic shock) prior to the index-surgery.

         12. Preoperative severe neutropenia (total neutrophil count ≤500 X 109/L). (Note: Testing
             should be performed at the local laboratory.)

         13. Receiving any oral or intravenous antibiotics within 24 hours prior to the
             index-surgery. (Note: It is permissible to administer conventional oral prophylactic
             antibiotics as bowel preparation up to the time of the index- surgical procedure, as
             well as intravenous or intramuscular prophylactic antibiotics just prior to the
             index-surgery as per the treating surgeon's standard of care.)

         14. Preoperative evaluation that the intra-abdominal process might preclude full closure
             of the skin incision due to severe or morbid obesity (i.e., any mechanical reason that
             would prevent/preclude primary intent wound healing) at the principal incision.

         15. History of major organ transplantation (e.g., lung, liver, or kidney), including bone
             marrow transplantation, or intent to perform major organ transplant as a concomitant
             surgery.

         16. History of a complicated laparotomy within 30 days prior to planned index-surgery.

         17. Planning to undergo a second colorectal surgical procedure (e.g., colostomy or
             ileostomy takedown) or any other general surgery in less than 30 days of
             index-surgery.

         18. Likely preoperative urinary tract infection, as evident by: i) symptoms of upper
             urinary tract infection (e.g., fever and/or flank pain) or ii) symptoms of lower
             urinary tract infection (e.g., urinary frequency, dysuria, urgency, and/or suprapubic
             pain); accompanied by any one of the following: 1) bacteriuria of ≥104 bacteria/mL
             urine or 2) positive urine leucocyte esterase or positive nitrite urine dipstick
             tests. Also exclude any man under age 60 years who has both positive urine nitrite and
             leucocyte esterase dipstick tests - even if he is asymptomatic (unless he has
             predisposing factors for urinary tract infection - e.g., spinal cord injury). (Note:
             Testing should be performed at the local laboratory.)

         19. Undergoing a significant concomitant surgical procedure (e.g., hysterectomy) or any
             mesh repair (either synthetic or biological mesh) as part of closure. The following
             concomitant procedures are allowed: appendectomy, cholecystectomy, oophorectomy,
             removal of Meckel's diverticulum, primary repair of small ventral hernia (i.e., &lt;30
             cm2), liver biopsy/wedge resection (but not liver resection).

         20. Patients with a condition (e.g., recurrent urinary tract infections, nail infections,
             sinusitis, dental infections, vaginitis/vaginosis, or chronic bronchitis) requiring
             frequent or chronic administration of antimicrobials (received
             antibiotics/antimicrobials at least twice for ≥ 2 weeks during past 6 months).

         21. Preoperative prothrombin time or INR &gt; 2 x upper limit of normal. (Note: Testing
             should be performed at the local laboratory.)

         22. Postsurgical life expectancy ≤ 60 days (in the Investigator's or Sponsor's opinion).

         23. Any patient in which the planned surgery would include: i) placement of a stoma in the
             principal incision; ii) placement of a drain into the supra-peritoneal fascia space
             that emerges through the principal incision; iii) placement of a drain into the
             intraperitoneal space that emerges through the principal incision; and iv)
             supplementation of any of the irrigation fluid with antibiotic or antiseptic drugs.

         24. Patients with severe COPD that are likely to need &gt; 24 hours postoperative ventilator
             support (e.g., patients on chronic or intermittent supplemental oxygen or an estimated
             forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) less than 50% of expected based on bedside
             spirometry).

         25. If, in the opinion of Investigator, the potential subject would likely be unable to
             maintain adequate care of the principal incision post-operatively.

         26. Anticipate that patient will not be available for study visits/ procedures or if in
             the opinion of Investigator there is concern that patient might not comply with study
             visits/procedures (e.g., due to ongoing illicit drug usage or alcohol abuse).

         27. Lack of willingness to have personal study-related data collected, archived, or
             transmitted under a blinded condition to regulatory agencies.

         28. Participation within 30 days before the start of this study in any experimental drug
             or device study; or currently participating in a study in which the administration of
             investigational drug or device within 60 days is anticipated.
