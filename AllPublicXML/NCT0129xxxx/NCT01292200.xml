  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This four-and-a-half-year study will test the efficacy of viewing a theoretically based and
      culturally sensitive video followed by group discussion (vs. single viewing) in increasing
      mammography use. The results of this study will lead cancer control efforts to effectively
      decrease breast cancer screening disparities experienced by Chinese-America women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a 4.5-year community-based RCT to study the impact of intervention approaches
      (small-group video discussion vs. single video mode) on mammography used among Chinese
      immigrant women. The small-group video discussion will be led by trained Chinese community
      health educators and trained bilingual research staff using a standardized structured
      protocol at all sites. In the single video mode, we will mail the intervention materials to
      women to view and/or read at home. We will recruit 974 Chinese women through our strong and
      well-established Chinese community partnerships in the metropolitan areas of Washington, DC
      (Lead PI: Dr. Judy Wang, Georgetown University-GU), New York (Site PI: Dr. Grace Ma at Temple
      University), and southern California (Site PI: Dr. Annette Maxwell, University of California,
      Los Angeles-UCLA). Participants' eligibility are listed under &quot;eligibility criteria&quot;. We will
      not enroll US-born Chinese women as they are least likely to face cultural and language
      barriers to mammography and less likely to engage in our small-group discussion, which will
      be conducted in Chinese languages. Also, we will not enroll short-term visitors as our study
      involves four interviews over a 2-year period.

    <description>Women in the small-group discussion mode will be called by their community educators to determine possible dates, times, and places for group meetings. The small group sessions will be conducted near the participants' homes. Each small-group will consist of 5-10 participants who will first view a 20-minute video together and then discuss the content of the video as well as their barriers to screening for about 30 minutes. A community educator and an RA at the study site will facilitate the discussion in Chinese languages according to a structured guide.</description>
