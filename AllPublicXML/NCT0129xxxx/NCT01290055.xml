  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The yellow fever vaccine is a live, attenuated virus that results in a robust immune
      response, especially in the T cell compartment. We have been studying immune responses to
      live viral infections using the yellow fever vaccine as a model for a live viral infection.
      In this study, we are interested in looking at the processing and lifespan of yellow fever
      specific CD8 T cells.

      We plan to accomplish this by measuring DNA replication and cell proliferation in humans
      using a naturally occurring stable isotope called deuterium (D20). This technique has been
      used to track the turnover of a number of human cell types in vivo. We plan to use D20
      labeling to track YFV specific CD8+ T cells in human vaccinees who are positive for a
      specific HLA type, HLA A202.

      Deuterium labeled water (D2O), also known as heavy water is physically and chemically very
      similar to ordinary drinking water. In water, two hydrogen atoms bond to an oxygen and create
      H20. However in deuterated water, deuterium atoms replace the hydrogen atoms. Deuterium is a
      form of hydrogen that has an extra neutron. This neutron gives the atom extra weight, hence
      the name &quot;heavy water.&quot; This extra weight can be detected in the lab with very sensitive
      instruments. Scientists have been using heavy water as a tracer to gain a better
      understanding of animal and human metabolic rates. Deuterium is in fact already in the water
      we drink daily. It is not radioactive, and it occurs naturally at a concentration of about 1
      part per 5,000. Researchers have used heavy water since 1934 as a safe and effective tool in
      clinical trials.

          1. Able to understand and give informed consent

          2. Age 18-45 years

          3. Participants agree not to take any live vaccines 30 days before or after (14 days for
             inactivated) yellow fever vaccination
