  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clomiphene citrate is commonly used for ovulation induction in women with anovulation,
      correction of luteal phase deficiency or for superovulation as empiric therapy for
      unexplained infertility. Superovulation using clomiphene, usually with intrauterine
      insemination, is usually regarded as first line therapy for unexplained infertility,
      infertility due to mild endometriosis, or infertility with mild or moderate compromise of the
      male factor. The side effect profile reported by some women using clomiphene citrate is
      similar to symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), including tension,
      irritability, depressed mood, affective lability, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating,
      and physical symptoms such as breast tenderness, bloating, headache joint and muscle pain.
      Few studies have been performed to examine the relationship between clomiphene citrate and
      mood symptoms; however, these studies have been limited by their small sample size, potential
      for recall bias and lack of randomization. Moreover, the experience of infertility is
      dysphoric in and of itself. Therefore, a rigorous evaluation of whether, when in the cycle,
      and how often clomiphene is associated with mood changes is needed. Such a study would add to
      the body of literature on this topic in three important ways: 1) use of prospective data
      collection to more accurately identify commonly reported symptoms, 2) characterize the timing
      of symptom occurrence relative to treatment cycle, and 3) provide information relevant to
      planning of future studies involving targeted treatment of clomiphene citrate induced
      symptoms. If clomiphene use is shown to affect mood, the results would point to an important
      avenue for psychopharmacologic insight into relationships between mood and sex steroids.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Specific Aim #1: To identify psychological and physical symptoms experienced by women taking
      clomiphene citrate for superovulation in a prospective, placebo controlled trial setting.

      Specific Aim #2: To determine whether measures of the emotional and physical state prior to
      the administration of clomiphene, predict the occurrence of mood changes during the five days
      of clomiphene administration and in the late follicular and luteal phases of the cycle in
      which clomiphene was administered.

      The aim of this study is to identify psychological and physical symptoms experienced by women
      taking clomiphene citrate for superovulation in a prospective setting.

      Clomiphene citrate is commonly used for ovulation induction in women with anovulation,
      correction of luteal phase deficiency or for superovulation as empiric therapy for
      unexplained infertility1. While clomiphene citrate is generally well tolerated, common side
      effects have been reported including vasomotor flushes, breast tenderness, pelvic discomfort,
      and mood swings. Visual changes, such as palenopsia are rarely reported2. The side effect
      profile reported by some women using clomiphene citrate is similar to symptoms of
      premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Symptoms of PMDD include tension, irritability,
      depressed mood, affective lability, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, and physical
      symptoms such as breast tenderness, bloating, headache joint and muscle pain. Several
      validated scales have been used to record symptom occurrences and to characterize the timing
      of symptom occurrence relative to the menstrual cycle3.

      The psychological and mood side effects of clomiphene citrate in women undergoing infertility
      treatment have been studied to a limited degree. One study reported mood swings in 9 out of
      14 women surveyed4. Another small study found a higher frequency of irritability, mood
      swings, feeling down and bloating in women undergoing fertility treatment who were taking
      clomiphene citrate compared to no medication.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Menstruating women, ages 25-40, with regular menstrual cycles 23-35 days in length who
             elect to treat unexplained infertility using clomiphene citrate for superovulation
             combined with intrauterine insemination will be eligible for participation in this
             study.

          -  Eligible participants will be identified by physicians at the Utah Center for
             Reproductive Medicine at the University of Utah and will be provided written informed
             consent before being randomized to treatment groups.

          -  Male partner's semen analysis must show a sperm density of at least 10 million per ml,
             and motility of 20% or greater and normal morphology using World Health Organization
             (WHO) criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with a history of depression or anxiety disorder requiring hospitalization or
             treatment lasting more than six months and women who currently or have received
             treatment during the previous six months for anxiety, depression or other psychiatric
             disorders listed in the 4th Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
             Disorders (DSM-IV) will be excluded.

          -  Women who have previously received treatment with clomiphene citrate will also be
             excluded from the study.

          -  Women using tobacco or illicit drugs will be excluded from study participation.

          -  Because the measurement tool used to measure symptoms has been validated only in women
             who can read and speak English, women who cannot speak and read English will not be
             eligible to participate in the study.
