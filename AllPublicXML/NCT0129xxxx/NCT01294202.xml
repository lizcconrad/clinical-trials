  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if an investigational drug called AT13387 is
      active against Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) that is resistant to other treatments,
      and to understand more about the safety of AT13387.

      Most subjects in the study will receive AT13387 along with another drug called imatinib
      (Gleevec). Imatinib is a standard (approved) drug for treating patients with GIST. Some
      patients may receive AT13387 on its own. As a result, we shall begin to understand the
      effects of AT13387 given on its own and when combined with imatinib.We shall also find out
      more about the side-effects of AT13387, and more about how the body breaks down (metabolizes)
      AT13387.

      The study consists of 3 parts: Part 1 is a dose escalation phase, Part 2 is a dose expansion
      phase and Part 3 is either a further dose expansion phase or a randomised phase in which half
      the patients receive AT13387 monotherapy and half continue to receive AT13387 in combination
      with imatinib.

      All patients will receive AT13387 given by intravenous infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a
      28-day cycle. Most patients will also receive imatinib 400 mg by mouth every day.

      Patients will have tumour imaging at baseline, and at 2, 4 and 6 months, and then at 2 month
      intervals until cycle 12, and then 3-monthly thereafter.

      Blood samples will be taken to measure plasma drug levels of AT13387 given in combination
      with imatinib

    <description>In part 1 pts will receive AT13387 in combination with imatinib. Up to 5 possible dose levels of AT13387 could be evaluated in combination with imatinib 400 mg daily: 120 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, 180 mg/m2, 220 mg/m2 and 260 mg/m2. AT13387 IV (in the vein) on day 1, 8 and 15 of each 28 day cycle, until progression or unacceptable toxicity develops, in order to establish the recommended phase II combination dose, which will be used in part 2 and/or part 3 of the study.
In part 2 an additional 6-9pts will be treated.
In part 3, provided that sufficient evidence of anti-tumour effect was observed in part 2 (disease stabilisation or reduction in tumour dimensions by RECIST), then an additional 12pts will be treated with AT13387 in combination with imatinib. Alternatively, if combination treatment is found to have excellent efficacy the randomised phase of the study may start so that 12 pts receive AT13387 on its own (monotherapy) and 12 pts receive AT13387 in combination with imatinib.</description>

          -  Willing to provide a tissue block or unstained slides of archived tumour for central
             pathology review and genotyping, or a full pathology report and results of genotyping
             of a previous tumour sample, or willing to undergo a new tumour biopsy for central
             pathology review and genotyping during the screening period of the study (prior to

             patients of childbearing potential must use appropriate birth control (abstinence,
             barrier methods, oral contraceptives and/or intrauterine devices) during the entire
             duration of the study, or the patient must be surgically sterile (with documentation
             in the patient's medical records).

          -  Impaired liver function, as evidenced by prior liver segmentectomy or
             hemi-hepatectomy; or alanine or aspartate aminotransferase (ALAT/ASAT) &gt;2.5x ULN; or

             anticoagulation.

          -  Renal impairment, defined as either serum creatinine higher than the institution
             ULN,or estimated creatinine clearance lower than LLN (i.e. patients should have both
             normal serum creatinine, and normal estimated creatinine clearance)

          -  Impaired marrow function, defined as haemoglobin &lt;9.0 g/dL, neutrophils &lt;1.5 x10^9/L,
             or platelets &lt;100 x10^9/L. Patients may receive a blood transfusion for anaemia to
             allow entry to the study but should not be transfusion-dependent.

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;50% on echocardiography or MUGA scan.

          -  Known metastases of the central nervous system.

             carcinoma of the uterine cervix, unless treated with curative intent more than 2 years
             prior to study entry.

          -  Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic medical conditions which make it
             undesirable for the patient to take part in the study, or which could jeopardize
             protocol compliance. Patients with multiple comorbidities and/or requiring multiple
             concomitant medications (especially conditions/medications which may impair renal
             function or predispose to renal impairment) should be discussed with the Astex Medical
             Monitor at the discretion of the Investigator before enrollment.

          -  Prior history of infection with HIV, or known active hepatitis B or C viral infection
             (active screening for viral infections is not required for study entry).

          -  Significant visual impairment such that in the opinion of the investigator, further
             minor deterioration would have unacceptable consequences (eg. loss of ability to drive
             or live at home.

          -  The Safety Monitoring Committee may add other specific exclusion criteria to enhance
             the safety of the patients based on emerging safety data.
