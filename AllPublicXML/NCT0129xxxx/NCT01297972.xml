    <textblock>
      Mesenchymal stem cells have been tested in many autoimmune disorders with encouraging results
      and may be an alternative to the treatment of immune-mediated severe acquired aplastic
      anemia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acquired aplastic anemia is a bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by and empty bone
      marrow and low blood counts. Most of the cases are immune-mediated. Allogeneic bone marrow
      transplant is the preferable treatment modality for patients younger than 40 years with a
      matched sibling donor. Patients not eligible for transplant are treated with intensive
      immunosuppressive therapy often based on anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporine.

      However, up to one third of patients treated with immunosuppression are refractory and one
      third of those who response eventually relapse. Refractory and relapsed cases may be the
      result of insufficient immunosuppression and these cases may benefit from additional
      immunosuppression. Mesenchymal stem cells infusion may be a potential treatment option,
      considering its properties to modulate the immune system.

      Refractory or relapsed patients with aplastic anemia will be treated with conventional
      immunosuppressive regimen (anti-thymocyte globulin plus cyclosporine) combined with
      intravenous infusion of allogeneic unrelated bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.

    <description>After standard immunosuppressive therapy with rabbit antithymocyte globulin 3,5 mg/Kg/day during 5 days, allogeneic unrelated bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells will be infused intravenously. Oral cyclosporine 5 mg/Kg/day (with dose correction weekly to keep serum cyclosporine level between 150-250 mg/dl) up to 6 months will be added.</description>
