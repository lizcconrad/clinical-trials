      Giving medications to children can be confusingÍ¾ studies have shown that caregivers make
      dosing administration errors up to 50% of the time. There are many reasons that there are so
      many errors, including the fact that dosing for children is based on their weight, liquid
      medications come in many different forms, and caregivers often give medicines using kitchen
      teaspoons and tablespoons. Caregivers who have difficulty reading have even more difficulty
      understanding medication instructions. We are developing and testing a web-based educational
      module to teach caregivers how to give medications. We are focusing on the pediatric
      emergency department because we know that this population has low literacy levels, and that
      many antibiotics are prescribed in this setting. We anticipate that those caregivers that
      view the interactive module will have increased knowledge on how to give medications once
      they get home.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dosing error rates of home administration of medications to children have been reported to be
      as high as 50%. Contributing to this error rate are the complexity of pediatric weight-based
      dosing, confusing formulations of liquid medications, and a reliance on non-standardized
      dosing tools such as kitchen teaspoons and tablespoons to administer medications. Families
      with low health literacy are at particular risk for medication administration errors. Health
      literacy promoting interventions to improve medication administration such as dissemination
      of a pictogram-based medication list have been shown to work for common over-the-counter
      medications such as acetaminophen, but their effect on administration practices for common
      medications prescribed in the pediatric emergency department (PED) has not been evaluated. Of
      the 50,000 patients seen in the PED each year, approximately 85% of patients are discharged
      with a prescription for medication. This makes the PED an ideal setting to implement a health
      literacy intervention to reduce medication administration errors at home. The investigators
      are proposing to conduct a randomized controlled trial of an educational module focused on
      how to administer antibiotics at home and test whether there is an improvement in care
      practices.

    <description>The Research Assistant (RA) will enter the subject's language (English or Spanish), the type of medicine (tablet/capsule, liquid, or ointment) from the antibiotic prescription, and the frequency (once a day, twice a day, three times a day, four times a day) from the antibiotic prescription into the web-based educational module on medication administration so that a tailored module will be setup for the subject. The subject will then view the educational interactive module. After the subject is done with the module, the RA will administer a verbal post-test. The post-test will include questions on medication administration as well as questions on fever assessment and management.</description>
