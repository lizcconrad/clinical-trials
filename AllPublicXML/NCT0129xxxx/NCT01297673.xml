  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the incidence of reflux in patients with spinal
      cord injury in relation to the lesion level, duration of injury and bladder management
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vesico-ureteral reflux was the main cause for renal failure and reduced life expectancy in
      patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction due to spinal cord injury. Neurogenic detrusor
      overactivity leads to high intravesical pressure and may induce reflux. Decreasing
      intravesical pressure and increasing bladder capacity is necessary to prevent reflux and
      secondary renal failure.
