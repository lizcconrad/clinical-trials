      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of E2609 when administered as single doses to healthy adult volunteers and
      healthy elderly subjects. The study will consist of 2 parts:(1) a single dose in healthy
      adult volunteers, at doses up to 800 mg or the maximum dose that can be tolerated, (2) a
      single dose of 50 mg in healthy elderly volunteers.
