  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the role of elastography (along with
      echographic and cytological data) as a diagnostic tool for thyroid cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound is considered the first line examination in the exploration of the thyroid nodule.
      Echotexture analysis often identifies nodules at risk of malignancy, but does not replace or
      exclude an additional cytological exploration. Cytology, although effective, also has
      limitations, particularly when samples are vesicular and it is difficult discern between a
      benign or malignant state. The creation of a noninvasive method in this context could help to
      avoid invasive tests or &quot;useless&quot; surgical procedures.

      Ultrasound elastography, which assesses tissue deformability, may provide valuable
      information concerning benign soft tissue characteristics, whereas malignant lesions are
      harder in consistency. Interest in this method, already proposed for other organs, has
      recently increased due to the emergence of specifically created software that enables
      objective evaluation of the hardness of the nodule during a conventional ultrasound analysis.
      The main hypothesis of this study is that elastography should allow better selection of
      candidates for thyroid surgery.
