  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis to be investigated is if the tolerability of intermittent catheterization with
      Polyolefin Based Elastomer (POBE) 2.0 and Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) is clinically equal - i.e.
      clinically non-inferior when using POBE 2.0 compared to PVC.

      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety and the subject's perception associated with
      the use of the catheters, assessed by the recording of adverse events and the ease of
      handling by means of a subjective assessment scale.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to compare the subject's tolerability, with regards to perceived discomfort, when using two different urinary catheters. Perception of discomfort (yes/ no) will be assessed in patient questionnaire for each subject. The frequency of discomfort will be compared between the treatments.</description>

            <groups_desc>The size of the target population was estimated by calculating 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of a possible difference between the two catheter types. The width of the interval was decided on the proportion of patients who would prefer one or the other catheter. Max width was seen when both proportions were 0.5. A total of 90 evaluable subjects limited the maximum width to 0.41, which was considered narrow enough from a scientific point of view, why this sample size was used in the study.</groups_desc>

            <non_inferiority_desc>Two catheters were tested regarding subjects' perception when using them, in a cross over design. After using each catheter for 1 week the subjects were asked: “Do you experience discomfort when using your catheter”?, and the subjects were supposed to answer “Yes” or “No”. The hypothesis to be investigated was that the tolerability/perception was about the same for each type of catheter, i.e. the POBE 2.0 should be non-inferior compared to PVC. H0: p(disc. POBE - Yes) = p(disc. PVC - Yes)</non_inferiority_desc>
