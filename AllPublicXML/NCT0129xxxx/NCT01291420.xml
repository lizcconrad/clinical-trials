  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and clinical efficacy of intradermal
      vaccination with autologous RNA-modified dendritic cells (DCs) - engineered to express the
      WT1 protein - in patients with limited spread metastatic solid tumors, i.e. breast cancers,
      glioblastoma grade IV, sarcomas, malignant mesothelioma and colorectal tumors. Based on the
      results of our previously performed phase I study with autologous WT1 mRNA-transfected DC,
      the investigators hypothesize that the vaccination with DC will be well-tolerated and will
      result in an increase in WT1-specific CD8+ T cell responses.
