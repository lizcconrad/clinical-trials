    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, single arm, multi-center, study of orally administered
      tivozanib to approximately 100 subjects with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This study
      is designed to evaluate biomarkers in blood and archived tissue samples, and their
      correlation with clinical activity and/or treatment-related toxicity in subjects with
      advanced RCC, and estimate the percentage of tivozanib-treated subjects who are
      progression-free at 6 months, overall response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS),
      safety and tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK). Subjects will be stratified by histology
      (clear cell vs. non-clear cell). Enrollment of non-clear cell subjects will be limited to ≤
      30% of the entire study population.

      Study enrollment is anticipated to complete in approximately 9 months. Treatment duration is
      estimated to last approximately 6 months from the subject's first dose of tivozanib with a
      follow-up period of 30 days. After 6 months, treatment with tivozanib may continue by
      participation in a rollover protocol (AV-951-09-901). Maximum duration of subject
      participation in this Phase 2 study is approximately 8 months.
