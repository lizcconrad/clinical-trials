      Specific Aim 1 - In collaboration with partners in Ross County, renovate and develop
      playgrounds in Chillicothe.

      Specific Aim 2 - In collaboration with partners in Ross County, promote safe play and play
      areas for children on farms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Injury is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity among children in the United States.
      Because children spend much of their time playing, it is important that they have safe play
      environments where they can challenge themselves and develop physically, mentally, and
      socially. The SPARK Project will focus its intervention in Ross County, Ohio, an area with
      more than 930 farms. Prior to this project, relatively little has been done to promote the
      prevention of injuries to children who live and play on farms.

      The specific aims of this project are as follows:

        -  In collaboration with partners in Ross County, renovate and develop playgrounds in
           Chillicothe, Ohio.

        -  In collaboration with partners in Ross County, promote safe play areas for children on
           farms.

      The SPARK Project will employ a multi-faceted approach to injury prevention, centered on
      community partnership and collaboration. Utilizing methodology that was successfully
      developed and implemented as part of the Community Action for Playground Safety (CAPS)
      Program in Columbus, the SPARK Project will combine both active and passive injury prevention
      strategies to reduce playground and play-related farm injuries to children in Ross County.

    <measure>Change in Playground Hazards</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 1 baseline to year 3 follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators hypothesize that the decrease in the number of identified playground hazards (comparing each playground to itself from the year 1 baseline survey to the year 3 follow-up survey utilizing a playground hazards checklist) will be significantly greater for the intervention playgrounds compared with non-intervention playgrounds in Circleville, Pickaway Co. The percentage increase in the number of playgrounds with adequate safety surfacing will be used as a proxy for playground hazardousness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Playground and Farm Safety Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices Composite Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 1 baseline to Year 3 follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators hypothesize that the improvement in the playground safety Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) survey composite scores and farm audits from the baseline in year 1 to the follow-up in year 3 will be significantly greater for parents residing in Ross County than for parents in the non-intervention counties (Morrow and Pickaway).The playground safety KAP survey consisted of 7 items and individuals could receive a summed score of 0-7, with a score of 7 indicating mastery of the material.</description>

        <title>Change in Playground Hazards</title>
        <description>The investigators hypothesize that the decrease in the number of identified playground hazards (comparing each playground to itself from the year 1 baseline survey to the year 3 follow-up survey utilizing a playground hazards checklist) will be significantly greater for the intervention playgrounds compared with non-intervention playgrounds in Circleville, Pickaway Co. The percentage increase in the number of playgrounds with adequate safety surfacing will be used as a proxy for playground hazardousness.</description>
