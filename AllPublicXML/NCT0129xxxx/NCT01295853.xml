      T3 versus T4 as a primary treatment for palmer hyperhydrosis and effect on postoperative

    <textblock>
      Palmar hyperhidrosis (PH) is a benign sympathetic disorder that does not threaten health but
      affects daily activities, and may causes social withdrawal and even depression.1 An incidence
      of up to 1% has been reported by various series in the literature. The incidence in men and
      women is the same; however women are more likely to seek medical attention, which may explain
      the higher incidence of female patients in most surgical series [2,3]. Although various
      treatment options are available, including topical and systemic therapies, iontophoresis,
      regional nerve block, and botulinum toxin injection, each has its limitations 4.
      Video-assisted thoracoscopic sympathetic surgery is currently a worldwide accepted treatment
      of primary palmar hyperhidrosis (PH) 5. However, compensatory hyperhidrosis (CH) is the most
      common and serious side effect that occurs in 30-70% of patients after T2 or T2-3
      sympathectomy 6. For that now T2 sympathetic surgeries are seldom used in PH. Procedures that
      involve T3 or/and T4 sympathetic ganglions are widely accepted in many centers with
      favourable results.5 But some patients still present with certain degrees of CH or over dry
      hands after operation 7, 8.

      The aim of this study is to compare the two methods for the treatment of PH, in which the
      sympathetic chain was transected in merely one segment, on the level of either the third or
      the fourth ribbed, defined as T3 sympathicotomy or T4 sympathicotomy, respectively. Emphasis
      was placed on the evaluation of the efficacy, side effects, and patients' satisfaction rate
      to these two types of surgical therapy.

    <description>CH remains the most common and distressing complication postsympathicotomy and many efforts have been made to ovoid its happening .Chou et al, 2 suggested that the underlying mechanism of CH may be due to a reflex response in sweating centre in hypothalamus but the exact mechanism beyond this phenomenon remain unclear.</description>

    <time_frame>2008-2010</time_frame>
    <description>The recurrence rate in T4 group was occurring in 2 patients (2.8%), whereas one recurrence found in T3 group (1.5%).
Kim et al 4, reported a 4.2 % of patients undergo T3 sympathicotomy complaining of gustatory sweating in a study carried out on 56 patients. However In our study there was no occurrence of postsympathicotomy gustatory hyperhidrosis and this may be due to the small numbers in our series.</description>

    <description>The sympathetic chain was identified at the level of the crossing of the third or fourth costal heads after dissection of the parietal pleura and completely divided about 1 cm wide at the upper margin of the rib. With assistance of anaesthesia team we reinflate the lung totally in sequence with removal of the trocars. The same procedure was performed on the opposite side and ablation of the sympathetic chain overlying the rib was performed bilaterally. At the end of surgery, a postoperative chest x-ray was routinely taken to rule out pneumothorax or hemothorax.</description>
