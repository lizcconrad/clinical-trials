    <textblock>
      The study is a global Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of omalizumab administered
      subcutaneously as an add-on therapy for the treatment of adolescent and adult patients aged
      12-75 who have been diagnosed with refractory CIU and who remain symptomatic despite
      standard-dosed H1 antihistamine treatment.

      The trial incorporated a Type I error control plan, as follows:

      The testing of the primary endpoint was conducted in the following hierarchical order. A
      p-value that is less than 0.05 can only be claimed statistically significant if statistical
      significance has been claimed at the previous stage.

        -  Stage 1: Omalizumab 300-mg group vs. placebo

        -  Stage 2: Omalizumab 150-mg group vs. placebo

        -  Stage 3: Omalizumab 75-mg group vs. placebo

      A hierarchical analysis of the secondary endpoints was performed for each dose found to be
      significant in the primary endpoint. A p-value that is less than 0.05 can only be claimed
      statistically significant if statistical significance has been claimed at the previous stage.

        -  Stage 1: Change from baseline in Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) at Week 12

        -  Stage 2: Change from baseline in the weekly number of hives score at Week 12

        -  Stage 3: Time to weekly itch severity score Minimally Important Difference (MID)
           response at Week 12

        -  Stage 4: Proportion of patients with UAS7 ≤ 6 at Week 12

        -  Stage 5: Proportion of weekly itch severity score MID Responders at Week 12

        -  Stage 6: Change from baseline in weekly size of the largest hive score at Week 12

        -  Stage 7: Change from baseline in overall Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score at
           Week 12

        -  Stage 8: Proportion of angioedema-free days from Week 4 to Week 12

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Weekly Itch Severity Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The weekly itch severity score is the sum of the daily itch severity scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 21. The daily itch severity score is the average of the morning and evening scores on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The Baseline weekly itch severity score is the sum of the daily itch severity scores over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher itch severity score indicates more severe itching. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The urticaria activity score (UAS) is a composite of scores on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (intense/severe) for 1) the number of wheals (hives); and 2) the intensity of the itch, measured twice daily (morning and evening). Daily UAS is the average of morning and evening scores (ranging from 0-6) and the UAS7 is the sum of the daily UAS over 7 days (ranging from 0-42). Baseline UAS7 is calculated using data from the 7 days prior to the first treatment date. A higher UAS indicates more urticaria activity. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Weekly Number of Hives Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The weekly hives score is the sum of the daily hives scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 21. The number of hives is measured twice daily (morning and evening) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (&gt; 12 hives per 12 hours). The daily hives score is the average of the morning and evening scores. The Baseline score is the sum of the daily hives scores over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher score indicates more hives. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Minimally Important Difference (MID) Response in the Weekly Itch Severity Score by Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>by Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The weekly itch severity score is the sum of the daily itch severity scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 21. The daily itch severity score is the average of the morning and evening scores on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The Baseline weekly itch severity score is the sum of the daily itch severity scores over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher itch severity score indicates more severe itching. A negative change score indicates improvement.
The MID response for weekly itch severity score was defined as a reduction from baseline in weekly itch severity score of 5 points or more. The time to weekly itch severity score MID response was defined as the time (in weeks) from Day 1 to the study week when weekly itch severity score MID response was first achieved.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The urticaria activity score (UAS) is a composite of scores on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (intense/severe) for 1) the number of wheals (hives); and 2) the intensity of the itch, measured twice daily (morning and evening). Daily UAS is the average of morning and evening scores (ranging from 0-6) and the UAS7 is the sum of the daily UAS over 7 days (ranging from 0-42). Baseline UAS7 is calculated using data from the 7 days prior to the first treatment date. A higher UAS indicates more urticaria activity. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Weekly Number of Hives Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The weekly hives score is the sum of the daily hives scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 21. The number of hives is measured twice daily (morning and evening) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (&gt; 12 hives per 12 hours). The daily hives score is the average of the morning and evening scores. The Baseline score is the sum of the daily hives scores over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher score indicates more hives. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Weekly Number of Hives Score at Week 12</title>
          <description>The weekly hives score is the sum of the daily hives scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 21. The number of hives is measured twice daily (morning and evening) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (&gt; 12 hives per 12 hours). The daily hives score is the average of the morning and evening scores. The Baseline score is the sum of the daily hives scores over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher score indicates more hives. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Time to Minimally Important Difference (MID) Response in the Weekly Itch Severity Score by Week 12</title>
        <description>The weekly itch severity score is the sum of the daily itch severity scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 21. The daily itch severity score is the average of the morning and evening scores on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The Baseline weekly itch severity score is the sum of the daily itch severity scores over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher itch severity score indicates more severe itching. A negative change score indicates improvement.
The MID response for weekly itch severity score was defined as a reduction from baseline in weekly itch severity score of 5 points or more. The time to weekly itch severity score MID response was defined as the time (in weeks) from Day 1 to the study week when weekly itch severity score MID response was first achieved.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Weekly Itch Severity Score MID Responders at Week 12</title>
        <description>The weekly itch severity score is the sum of the daily itch severity scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 21. The daily itch severity score is the average of the morning and evening scores on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The Baseline weekly itch severity score is the sum of the daily itch severity scores over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher itch severity score indicates more severe itching. A negative change score indicates improvement.
The MID response for weekly itch severity score was defined as a reduction from baseline in weekly itch severity score of 5 points or more. This outcome measure shows the percentage of participants classified as MID Responders at Week 12, meaning their weekly itch severity scores at Week 12 were at least 5 points lower than at Baseline.</description>
