  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the combined impact on bone loss as well as the
      incidence of bone fractures in women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, early breast
      cancer treated with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) either as first line therapy or as
      maintenance therapy after initial treatment with chemotherapy, in real life clinical settings
      in Greece.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with ER-positive early breast cancer will be treated with AIs either as first line
      therapy or as maintenance therapy after initial treatment with chemotherapy. The total study
      duration will be 24 months comprising of a recruitment period of 12 months and a follow-up
      period of 12 months for each participating subject. The primary outcome variable is the mean
      percentage variation in lumbar spine (LS) bone mineral density (BMD) during the 12 month
      follow - up period. Measurements will be taken before and after chemotherapy and at the end
      of the 12 month follow - up period.

    <description>BMD was evaluated at lumbar spine (LS) and hip (HIP) with measurements taken before CT, before AI therapy and at the end of the 12 month followup period while on AI treatment. Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA scan) was used with all measurements performed with the Explorer absorptiometer produced by Hologic, Bedford, MA, USA in the same referral site in Athens, apart from two centres in other cities which used however the same absorptiometer model with identical software.
The primary outcome variable was the mean percentage change in LS BMD between the pre CT treatment measurement and the post 12 months AI measurements in the CT cohort. The HT cohort was included as a control group.</description>

        <description>BMD was evaluated at lumbar spine (LS) and hip (HIP) with measurements taken before CT, before AI therapy and at the end of the 12 month followup period while on AI treatment. Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA scan) was used with all measurements performed with the Explorer absorptiometer produced by Hologic, Bedford, MA, USA in the same referral site in Athens, apart from two centres in other cities which used however the same absorptiometer model with identical software.
The primary outcome variable was the mean percentage change in LS BMD between the pre CT treatment measurement and the post 12 months AI measurements in the CT cohort. The HT cohort was included as a control group.</description>
