        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  are willing and able to understand and sign an informed consent

          -  &lt;= 1.0 Diopters of regular corneal astigmatism in both eyes. NOTE: look for
             consistency between manual keratometry, auto-keratometry and simulated keratometry
             measures to ensure &quot;regular&quot; astigmatism prior to enrollment. Subjects who wear
             contact lenses must discontinue its use for at least 2 weeks (soft contact lens) and
             at least 3 weeks (gas permeable contact lens) and until corneal topography shows
             stability prior to preoperative study measurements.

          -  are willing and able to attend postoperative examinations per protocol schedule

          -  are more than 21 years of age, of either gender and any race:

          -  require bilateral cataract extraction followed by posterior intraocular lens (IOL)
             implantation used as on-label procedure

          -  be willing to have second eye surgery within one month of first eye surgery

          -  are in good ocular health, with the exception of cataracts

          -  are free of disease(s)/condition(s) listed in the &quot;Precautions&quot; section of the AcrySof
             IQ ReSTOR +3 and LENTIS Mplus package inserts

          -  are able to read and understand one of the following languages: Dutch or Spanish

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Planned multiple procedures, including limbal relaxing incision (LRI), during
             cataract/IOL implantation surgery

          -  An ocular disease and/or condition that may compromise visual acuity levels (i.e.
             glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, amblyopia, pupil abnormality
             such as corectopia, etc.)

          -  Previous corneal surgery and/or reshaping

          -  Clinically significant corneal endothelial dystrophy (e.g. Fuchs' dystrophy)

          -  History of corneal disease (eg. herpes simplex, herpes zoster keratitis, etc.)

          -  History of retinal detachment

          -  Subjects that have an acute or chronic disease or illness that would increase the
             operative risk or confound the results of this investigation (eg, immunocompromised,
             connective tissue disease, clinically significant atopic disease, diabetes, and any
             other such disease or illness).

          -  suturing of incision required at time of surgery
