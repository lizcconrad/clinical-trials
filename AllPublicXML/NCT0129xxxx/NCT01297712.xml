  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polyps found during screening colonoscopy have to be removed or at least biopsied. Attempts
      to save costs include endoscopic assessment of polyps with regards to differential diagnoses
      between adenomas (which have to be removed) and hyperplastic polyps (could be left in place
      or removed and not examined histologically). Such a concept would only be feasible if
      endoscopy can make the differential diagnosis with high accuracy. Such high accuracy rates -
      between 80% and 95% - have been reported from reference centers with specific scientific
      interest. The investigators want to test whether these results a) can be reproduced in the
      private practice setting performing large-volume screening colonoscopies and b) whether
      latest generation endoscopes provide benefit in terms of better accuracy.

      Patients undergoing screening colonoscopy will be randomized to the use of two different
      colonoscopes, namely the latest generation (Pentax iScan, Hi Line) versus the previous
      generation (Classic Line). On withdrawal, all polyps found will be diagnosed according to
      their pit pattern (classification scheme mit example images provided) and a differential
      diagnosis made during the live examination. Pit patterns I/II will be classified as
      hyperplastic polyps, patterns III-V as adenomas (in a subgroup IV and V will be classified as
      pre-/malignant). All polyps will be photographed from near distance to allow for later
      blinded review which will be done on patients with only one polyp (to avoid mix-up of polyps)
      by 3 examiners and 2 independent hospital experts.
