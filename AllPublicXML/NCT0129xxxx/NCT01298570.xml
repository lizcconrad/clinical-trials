      This randomized (2:1 ratio), multi-center, placebo-controlled, phase II efficacy study is
      designed to compare progression-free survival (PFS) between regorafenib + FOLFIRI
      (5-fluorouracil + leucovorin + irinotecan [ARM A] versus placebo + FOLFIRI [ARM B]) in
      patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) previously treated with a FOLFOX
      (5-fluorouracil + leucovorin + oxaliplatin) regimen. Secondary objectives include objective
      response (OR) rates, disease control (DC) rates, and overall survival (OS). A pharmacokinetic
      (PK) evaluation of irinotecan will be conducted in a subset of patients at selected sites.
      This trial also incorporates a number of exploratory analyses designed to evaluate potential
      correlations between blood and tissue biomarkers and clinical benefit.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Subject must meet all of the inclusion criteria to participate in this study:

          1. Age ≥18 years of age (no upper age limit)

          2. Histological or cytological documentation of adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum

          3. Archived, paraffin-embedded tissue block (primary or metastatic) available for genomic
             studies required

          4. Metastatic disease not amenable to surgical resection with curative intent

          5. Progression during or within 6 months following administration of a standard
             regimen[2] for treatment of metastatic disease that included oxaliplatin with any of
             the following agents with or without bevacizumab:

               -  5-fluorouracil (F-FU) with or without leucovorin or levoleucovorin

               -  Capecitabine

             Note: In patients receiving FOLFOX, oxaliplatin is sometimes discontinued due to
             toxicity or as part of maintenance therapy strategy. If such patients progress while
             on 5-FU alone, they are eligible for this trial. As an example, a patient who is begun
             on FOLFOX or CapeOx (capecitabine with oxaliplatin, with or without bevacizumab),
             whose oxaliplatin is held for neurotoxicity and who is switched to capecitabine
             monotherapy or capecitabine with bevacizumab, would be considered to have had one
             prior therapy.

             OR

             Patients who develop metastatic disease within 9 months of adjuvant FOLFOX for stage
             II or III colon cancer

                  a repeat urine analysis.If repeat urinalysis shows 1+ protein or more, a 24-hour
                  urine collection will be required and must show total protein excretion &lt;1000
                  mg/24 hours

               -  International normalized ratio (INR)/Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤1.5 x ULN

             Patients who are therapeutically treated with an agent such as warfarin or heparin
             will be allowed to participate provided that no prior evidence of underlying
             abnormality in coagulation parameters exists. Close monitoring of at least weekly
             evaluations will be performed until INR/PTT is stable based on a measurement that is
             pre-dose as defined by the local standard of care.
