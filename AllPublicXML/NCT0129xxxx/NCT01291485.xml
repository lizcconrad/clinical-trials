  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>HIV medication adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported adherence to HIV medications will be assessed using the AACTG Medication Adherence Questionnaire (M. A. Chesney, et al., 2000).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HIV Treatment Adherence Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-month, 3 months, and 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy for adherence to HIV medications will be assessed using the HIV-ASES (Johnson et al., 2007). The HIV-ASES is a 12-item scale of patient confidence in their ability to carry out behaviors related to adhering to medication regimens. Responses range from 1 (&quot;cannot do it at all&quot;) to 10 (&quot;completely certain can do it&quot;). Item scores are averaged with higher scores indicating higher adherence self-efficacy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-month, 3-months, and 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed using the McGill Quality of Life questionnaire (S. Robin Cohen, Hassan, Lapointe, &amp; Mount, 1996). This instrument is a 16-item scale that assesses quality of life in four domains: physical well-being, psychological well-being, existential well-being, and support; each item is assessed on a 0-10 point scale.</description>

Education about HIV and medication adherence, motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral techniques, and problem-solving strategies to improve medication adherence and clinical outcomes in people living with HIV were also included in the intervention.</description>
