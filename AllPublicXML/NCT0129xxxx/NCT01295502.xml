      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of paclitaxel and carboplatin
      after cisplatin and radiation therapy in treating patients with stage IB-IVA cervical cancer.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, paclitaxel, and carboplatin, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to
      kill tumor cells. Giving paclitaxel and carboplatin after cisplatin and radiation therapy may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of
      adjuvant carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy following concurrent weekly cisplatin
      chemotherapy and extended field radiation in women with newly diagnosed stage IB-IVA cervical
      cancer, with positive para-aortic nodes.

      II. To determine the feasibility of the treatment regimen over the four cycles of adjuvant
      chemotherapy once the MTD is estimated.

      III. To assess the toxicities of the treatment regimen the National Cancer Institute (NCI)
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the response rate to this treatment regimen in patients with measurable disease.

      II. To examine progression-free survival for one year on this treatment regimen.

      III. To examine overall survival. IV. To examine the location of recurrence, loco-regional
      versus distant for one year after completion of therapy.

      V. To estimate the frequency of chronic toxicities experienced within one year of study
      entry.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36
      and undergo extended-field radiotherapy daily 5 days a week for 6 weeks followed by
      brachytherapy. Beginning 4-6 weeks after completion of chemoradiation, patients receive
      adjuvant chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30-60
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.
