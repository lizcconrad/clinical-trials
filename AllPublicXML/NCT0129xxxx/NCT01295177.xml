    <textblock>
      Wound healing is impaired in diabetes mellitus, but the mechanisms involved are not well
      established. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a topic insulin cream
      on wound healing in diabetic patients. age eligible for study:18 years old-older gender
      eligible for study:both accepts healthy volunteers:no have a proband with T1DM or T2DM. A
      proband is an individual with more than one year of diagnosis.

      have proband with a wound that is difficult to be healed for at least three months.

      patients with serum creatinine &lt;1.5mg/dl Does not satisfy the above inclusion criteria
      infection diagnosed wound patients with cellulitis, venous stasis, inadequate perfusion,
      osteomyelitis and patient's inability to attend clinics for follow up
