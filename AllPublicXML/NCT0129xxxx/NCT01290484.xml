    <textblock>
      There is an unsatisfied medical need for a first-line treatment of lymphatic malformations
      with a good benefit/risk profile. Based on a patient experience in the institution, the
      investigators plan to verify whether or not the medication sildenafil has a beneficial effect
      on lymphatic malformations. The investigators plan to do this by treating patients with
      lymphatic malformations with the medication sildenafil for a 20 week period. This is an
      investigator initiated study funded by an Innovations in Patient Care grant and a SPARK
      grant.

      Lymphatic malformations can be challenging to treat. Mainstay interventions including surgery
      and sclerotherapy are invasive and can result in local recurrence and complications. We
      sought to assess the effect of 20 weeks of oral sildenafil on reducing lymphatic malformation
      volume and symptoms in children. Seven children (4 boys, 3 girls; ages 13-85 months) with
      lymphatic malformations were given oral sildenafil for 20 weeks in this open-label study. The
      volume of the lymphatic malformation was calculated blindly using magnetic resonance imaging
      performed before and after 20 weeks of sildenafil. Lymphatic malformations were assessed
      clinically on weeks 4, 12, 20, and 32. Both the physician and parents evaluated the lymphatic
      malformation in comparison with baseline. Sildenafil can reduce lymphatic malformation volume
      and symptoms in some children. ( J Am Acad Dermatol 2014;70:1050-7.)

          3. The participant weight is at least 8kg.

          4. A diagnosis of LM or mixed venous lymphatic malformation involving the skin and

      <desc>Participants were given sildenafil for 20 weeks. Participants weighing more than 20 kg were given 20 mg 3 times daily (60 mg/day). Participants weighing between 8 kg and 20 kg were given 10 mg 3 times daily (30 mg/day).</desc>

          <title>Sildenafil</title>
          <description>Adverse events reported while one sildenafil were minimal. All subjects tolerated the prescribed medication dose. One subject developed an upper respiratory tract infection and experienced temporary hearing loss due to fluid accumulation. This was resolved completely and she experienced no further hearing loss while on sildenafil. Four parents requested to have the child continue sildenafil after study completion.</description>
