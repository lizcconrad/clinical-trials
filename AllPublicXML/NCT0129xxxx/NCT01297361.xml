    <textblock>
      Vitamin B12 deficiency is more widespread in the population than has been assumed so far.
      Since a deficiency in this vitamin can lead to irreversible neurological damage, early
      diagnosis is essential. Vitamin B12 is synthesized exclusively in micro-organisms, and in
      humans it is an essential component in methyl group transfer and cell division. The vitamin
      is crucially involved in the proliferation, maturation, and regeneration of neural cells. In
      combination with folic acid, as an enzymatic essential cofactor in the metabolism of
      homocysteine, vitamin B12 maintains low homocysteine levels. The aim of the present study is
      to investigate the relationship between religious origin and age, and Vitamin B12 and Folic
      acid plasma levels in non Jewish population in Western Galilee. The investigators assumption
      is that the results of the study will contribute to early detection and treatment of Vitamin
      B12 and Folic acid deficiencies in order to prevent long term complications.
