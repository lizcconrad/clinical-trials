    <textblock>
      Bronchial asthma is a common disease and frequently encountered disease of respiratory
      apparatus. It has very complex mechanism and multiple inducing factors. This study will focus
      on a new Chinese therapy on Bronchial asthma, analyzing the treatment mechanism of internal
      and external use, based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory and clinical practice.
      The study will also investigate the efficacy of the Chinese drugs and treatments on Bronchial
      asthma, and provide an effective therapy for this disease.
