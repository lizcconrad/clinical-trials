  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to characterize the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion
      (ADME) of ASA404 following a single intravenous administration of 3000 mg (approximately 1800
      mg/m2) ASA404 containing 60 µCi of 14C over a period of 20 minutes in patients with advanced
      solid tumors. Metabolic pathways, route (s) of elimination, distribution characteristics in
      plasma and blood, and exposure characterization in plasma and blood, and exposure
      characterization of the parent drug and metabolites will be obtained from the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven diagnosis of advanced or metastatic solid tumors for whom either
             refractory to standard therapy exists, or for whom treatment with an investigational
             agent alone or in combination with docetaxel, paclitaxel, carboplatin, or paclitaxel
             plus carboplatin is appropriate;

          -  ANC≥ 1.5 x 109/L;

          -  Hgb ≥ 9.0 g/L;

          -  PLT ≥ 100,000/mm3;

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5;

          -  Willing and able to remain in the clinic for at least 4 days

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with CNS and/or leptomeningeal disease metastases allowed on the study unless
             asymptomatic and not requiring corticosteroid therapy. Patients having any clinical
             signs of CNS metastases must have a CT or MRI of the brain performed to rule out CNS
             metastases in order to be eligible for study participation. Patients who have had
             brain metastases surgically removed or irradiated with no residual disease confirmed
             by imaging are allowed;

          -  Patients unable to undergo intravenous infusion;

          -  Patients with a Baseline 12-lead EGC QTc of &gt;450 msec;

          -  Radiotherapy in less than two (2) weeks prior to study entry;

          -  A history of noncompliance to medical regimens or inability or unwillingness to return
             for all scheduled visits

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply
