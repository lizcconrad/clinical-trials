    <description>After meeting all entry criteria, completing a 1-week open-label iloperidone titation period (up to 12 mg/day), followed by a 14-24 week open-label iloperidone flexible dose-stabilization period (up to 24 mg/day), approximately 260 patients will be randomized to one of two arms in a 1:1 ratio of iloperidone (flexible dosing 8-24 mg/day) to placebo. Post-randomization double-blind study medication will be administered orally twice daily for up to 26 weeks to evaluate relapse prevention. Subsequently, during the extension period, after a 1-week mock double-blind titration, open-label iloperidone (8-24 mg/day) is administered for up to 51 weeks to evaluate long-term safety.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must understand and be capable to communicate adequately with the study
             coordinator and to participate in cognitive testing.

          -  Patients must agree to cooperate with all tests and examinations required by the
             protocol, be willing to comply fully with treatment and able to ingest oral
             medication.

          -  Patients must understand the nature of the study and must sign an informed consent
             document.

          -  Patients will have a clear diagnosis of schizophrenia according to DSM-IV criteria for
             at least 1 year.

          -  Patients must need of ongoing psychiatric treatment and must have a documented reason
             why a change in treatment is needed which might lead to a clinical improvement

          -  At screening patients will have a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) of no
             more than 100 and a Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) of no more than 5 (i.e.
             must not be severely ill or worse).

          -  Patients must be outpatients at the time of screening and have not been an inpatient
             to treat schizophrenia for at least 1 week prior to the screening visit.

          -  Patients must have a history of at least 2 prior episodes of relapse or impending
             relapse in the 2 years preceding the screening visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:-

             course of the study.

          -  Patients who have a positive urine drug screen (at the screening visit). If opiates
             are positive at screening and clearly due to the use of pain killing medication, the
             patient may be re screened after the medication has been discontinued and enrolled in
             the study if urine drug screen is negative.

             based on central ECG reading results

          -  Treatment naive, first episode patients,

          -  Patients taking iloperidone at the screening visit or with a known hypersensitivity to
