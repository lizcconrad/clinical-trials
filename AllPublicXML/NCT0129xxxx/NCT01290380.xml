  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential inhibitory effects of ASA404 on
      CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 mediated metabolism on the respective probe drugs
      caffeine, diclofenac, simvastatin, and omeprazole, respectively. This will be accomplished by
      the simultaneous administration of four substrates as part of a cocktail in order to
      characterize the potential for in-vivo drug-drug interactions. This cocktail approach has
      been proposed per FDA guidance as a screening tool for potential in-vivo drug-drug
      interactions Compared to the individual administration of specific probes in multiple
      studies, simultaneous administration of multiple in-vivo probes of drug-metabolizing enzymes
      offer several distinct advantages such as minimizing the confounding influence of
      inter-individual and intra-individual variability over time. Substrates for the CYP enzymes
      were chosen based on the FDA guidance recommendations taking into account that 1. The
      substrates are specific for the individual CYP enzymes, 2. There are no interactions among
      these substrates; and 3. The study will be conducted in a sufficient number of subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Histologically-proven and radiologically-confirmed diagnosis of advanced or metastatic
        solid tumors for whom treatment with an investigational agent alone or in combination with
        docetaxel or placlitaxel +carboplatin is appropriate;

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) must be within the range of 18-30;

          -  A minimum of 4 weeks must have elapsed since the last treatment with other cancer
             therapies, (i.e. endocrine therapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, ect);

          -  Willing and able to remain in the clinic for at least 2 days (the night before dosing
             and the night after dosing 24 hours) for the 3 x's receiving the cocktail (on Day 1,
             Day 8 and Day 15 during the

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients having CNS metastases. (Patients having any clinical signs of CNS metastases
             must have a CT or MRI of the brain performed to rule out CNS metastases in order to be
             eligible for the study participation. Patients who have had brain metastases
             surgically removed or irradiated with no active residual disease confirmed by imaging
             are allowed)

          -  Patients who have not recovered from all acute radiotherapy-related toxicities;

          -  Prior exposure to Vascular Disrupting Agents (VDAs) or other vascular targeting agents

          -  Right bundle branch block (RBBB), complete left bundle branch block (LBBB),
