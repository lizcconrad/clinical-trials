  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colon cancer is one of the most common cancers in France with more than 36,000 new cases per
      year. Despite significant advances in therapeutic care, the prognosis of colon cancers with
      metastases remains bad. The treatment of metastatic disease is based on chemotherapy coupled
      with therapeutic antibodies. The most commonly used are anti-EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor), which allowed a significant increase in patient survival. They are responsible for
      skin toxicity in the form of an acneiform rash which can be debilitating for patients and
      require discontinuation of treatment. However, this toxicity is strongly correlated with
      treatment efficacy. Understanding the mechanisms of cutaneous side effects of anti-EGFR is
      therefore a major challenge to treat and better understand the association with treatment
      efficacy.

      The objective of this study is to investigate a link between cutaneous inflammatory response
      in patients treated with anti-EGFR, serum level of anti-EGFR and treatment efficacy. It will
      be conducted systematic consultations dermatology, skin biopsies and blood samples in
      patients treated with anti-EGFR. From biopsies, it will be searched by an infiltration of
      inflammatory cells and expression of genes involved in skin inflammation.
