    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to identify a 60 minute cognitive battery, for
      subsequent use in clinical trials, that detects cognitive deficits in early HD and late
      pre-manifest HD compared to controls, and that has a potential to show drug induced
      improvements.

    <textblock>
      Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease which typically manifests
      beginning in adulthood in the form of movement symptoms, cognitive decline, and psychiatric
      changes. The proposed research is undertaken in collaboration with CHDI Foundation, Inc., a
      not for profit organization dedicated to finding treatments for HD. CHDI's goal is to develop
      or help to develop both symptomatic and disease modifying treatments for HD. To enable future
      therapeutic trials, CHDI has sponsored several prospective, longitudinal, observational
      biomarker studies of pre-manifest and early HD with the goal of determining which combination
      of measures is the most sensitive for detecting changes over the natural progression of
      pre-manifest and early HD. These and other studies have demonstrated a progressive decline in
      cognitive function in patients with the huntingtin gene mutation beginning in the
      pre-manifest period and progressing throughout the course of the disease. These findings
      support the use of cognitive measures as endpoints in future therapeutic clinical trials.
      CHDI is committed to the development of a cognitive assessment battery for use in HD
      therapeutic trials.

      There will be paper and pencil and computerized cognitive tests given over a six week period
      to non-HD control subjects, pre-manifest HD and early manifest HD subjects.

        Study participants will be pre-HD, early stage HD and control subjects. The cognitive tests
        will be given to all participants. (only varied by order of administration) in order to
        determine what measures will be best at detecting cognitive changes associated with HD.
