      The purpose of this study is to observe the safety of agalsidase alfa in Canadian patients
      with Fabry disease.

      This study will evaluate the safety of agalsidase alfa in patients with Fabry disease.

      Patients diagnosed with Fabry disease who meet current Canadian guidelines for enzyme
      replacement therapy will be eligible to enroll in the study and will receive agalsidase alfa
      at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg body weight administered by an IV infusion over 40 minutes every week
      or every other week, based on previous treatment.

      Shire has implemented a change to the drug substance manufacturing process. Safety data will
      be collected in patients receiving product manufactured with this process. There are no
      changes to the drug product formulation, manufacturing site, manufacturing process, and
      container closure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Cohort 1:

          1. The patient has a documented diagnosis of Fabry disease.

          2. The patient is sufficiently compliant with study activities to participate in this
             treatment plan, as judged by the Investigator.

          3. The patient must meet current Canadian guidelines for enzyme replacement therapy for
             Fabry disease by meeting one of the following criteria:

               1. Age-adjusted glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;80 ml/min or a decline in GFR of
                  &gt;10% which is sustained for 3 months and for which other causes of declining
                  renal function have been excluded by a nephrologist or any 2 of the following:

                    -  Isolated proteinuria ≥500 mg/day/1.73 m2 without other cause

                    -  Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus

                    -  Fanconi syndrome

                    -  Hypertension

               2. Evidence of cardiac involvement related to Fabry disease including any 2 of the
                  following:

                    -  Left ventricular (LV) wall thickness &gt;12 mm

                    -  Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) by electrocardiogram (ECG); Estes ECG
                       score must be &gt;5

                    -  Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) by 2D echocardiogram 20% above normal for
                       age

                    -  Diastolic filling abnormalities by 2D echocardiogram or by other accepted
                       measures of diastolic filling. E/A ration &gt;2.0 and deceleration time &lt;140
                       msec

                    -  Increase of LV mass of at least 5 g/m2/year, with three measurements over a
                       minimum of 12 months

               5. Chronic, intractable neuropathic pain, refractory to analgesics and standard pain
                  management for at least 6 months.

          1. The patient has experienced an anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction or other
             infusion-related reaction which, in the opinion of the Investigator, precludes further
             treatment with agalsidase alfa or may interfere with the interpretation of the study.

          2. The patient is otherwise unsuitable for the study, in the opinion of the Investigator.

          3. The patient is enrolled in another clinical study, other than the Canadian Fabry
             Disease Initiative (CFDI).
