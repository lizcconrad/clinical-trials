  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease is a leading global cause of morbidity and
      mortality, so it's important to find actions that could improve quality of life and decrease
      the mortality. The objective of this study is to verify if a ground walking program applied
      to hospitalized exacerbated COPD patients has effects in quality of life, exercise capacity,
      airways obstruction, body composition, heart rate variability, quadriceps isometric force and
      in the &quot;Body-mass index, Airway Obstruction, Dyspnea, Exercise Capacity index&quot; (BODE index).
      An evaluators-blinded randomized controlled study will be conducted in &quot;Hospital Escola
      Municipal de São Carlos&quot; where forty patients will be recruited to participate. The
      volunteers will be randomized in two groups with twenty patients, the usual care group, that
      will receive only the usual care of the hospital; and the trained group that will receive the
      same care, but will also participate in a ground walking program associated with respiratory
      exercises. It will be evaluated, in the start and at the end of the program, the health
      related and general quality of life and the Barthel index. Daily, the patient will be
      submitted to the Six Minute Walk Test, to a body composition analysis, to a hand grip test
      and to a dyspnea assessment, and will be calculated its BODE index. All patients will be
      invited to a follow up in the 12th and 24th weeks after hospital discharge, when they would
      receive the same evaluation of the last day in the hospital. All the collected data will be
      expressed in means and standard deviations or medians and range when appropriated. It will be
      chosen appropriated tests to compare and correlate them.

    <description>The patients will walk on a corridor, for 40min, once a day. The speed will be controlled through a metronome, that will be programed to a frequency of steps/min determinated as 80% of the mean frequency of steps performed in six minutes walk test of that day. The 40min will be divided in 3min of walk and 2min of rest, totalizing 24min of exercise and 16min of rest. Furthermore, these patients, in sitting position, will receive orientation to do calm and slow inspirations and expirations, associated with pursed lips expiration. They will try to maintain its Respiratory Rate in 6bpm, during four minutes.</description>
