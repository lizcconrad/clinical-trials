  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will be collecting saliva DNA samples from chronic back pain patients. The
      investigators hope to find candidate genes associated with response to opioid medication by
      correlating molecular genetics data with pain measurement and opioid responsiveness data
      including opioid hyperalgesia and opioid analgesic tolerance.

    <textblock>
      The investigators hope to find a genetic association with various physiologic responses to
      opioid medication in patients who suffer from chronic pain (e.g. OIH vs. analgesic tolerance,
      baseline pain sensitivity, etc.). This has never been done before, and if it proves
      successful, it could provide physicians a greater understanding of why some chronic opioid
      users continue needing increased doses of opioids. This data may also help predict which
      patients will do well with chronic opioid therapy and which ones may not. Initial data with
      OPRM1 gene analysis in humans already implicates certain SNPs with opioid responsiveness and
      there have been suggestions for screening patients for OPRM1 prior to initiating opioid
      therapy in order to optimize their treatment response (Reynolds et al., 2008).

      Saliva biospecimen collection will be performed via mail or in person. The PI will send
      participants a letter informing them of the opportunity to participate in a study of genetic
      variation influencing pain and opioid responsiveness phenotypes. If participants agree to
      provide a saliva biospecimen and to participate in the study, an informed consent letter and
      an Oragene™ DNA Self-Collection Kit, in disk format OG-250 (DNA Genotek, Inc., Ottawa,
      Ontario, Canada) will be sent to the participant by the PI. According to the manufacturer
      instructions, participants will provide a 2 ml saliva sample, which will be preserved using
      the reagents provided within the Oragene™ kit. Saliva samples are considered stable at room
      temperature for 5 years by Oragene™.
