  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background.

      Overdiagnosis of malaria is widespread in health facilities throughout Africa, a situation
      that is unsustainable given the relatively high cost of artemisinin combination therapy
      (ACTs) compared to older antimalarials. In addition it often denies patients treatment for
      their actual illness and generates unreliable data for health planners. For these reasons the
      National Malaria Control Programme introduced revised guidelines for malaria diagnosis and
      treatment in 2006 restricting the recommendation for antimalarial treatment in patients over
      the age of 5 years to those with a positive blood slide or malaria rapid diagnostic tests
      (RDTs) result. To support this, RDTs will be introduced into primary care health facilities
      in Tanzania starting in 2009.

      The high accuracy of current rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) provides the potential for a
      cost-effective solution to the problem of malaria overdiagnosis. However, RDTs with revised
      guidelines to restrict malaria diagnoses to RDT-positive patients have been unsuccessful
      unless accompanied by unsustainable levels of supervision and training.

      Primary objective.

      To conduct a trial of interventions directed at prescribers or prescribers and communities
      compared to control groups to improve adherence to national guidelines for prescription of
      antimalarial treatment when supported by RDTs in primary health care facilities in NE
      Tanzania.

      Methods

      All 60 participating health facilities will receive RDTs and basic training in their use and
      a copy of current NMCP/MOH guidelines for each prescribing staff member. A health worker
      intervention arm will, in addition, receive workplace-based interactive training and messages
      from senior staff A health worker-community arm will receive the same training as the health
      worker arm and in addition leaflets will be provided to RDT-tested patients providing
      information on the test and the treatment given. All training materials will be approved by
      NMCP in Tanzania as being consistent with current national guidelines but with the addition
      that prescribers will be asked to follow RDT results in prescribing for patients of any age
      This policy is in line with the most recent revision to WHO guidelines and is supported by
      NMCP in Tanzania.

      Study outcomes will be recorded through a 40% (2 days per week) exit survey of patients.
      Anthropological and economics studies will assess the costs and acceptability of
      interventions.
