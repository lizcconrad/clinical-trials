  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the daily intake of the probiotic Lactobacillus
      reuteri prevents antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and related Clostridium difficile infections
      in children and adolescents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) occurs in up to 25% of all individuals receiving
      antibiotics (Bartlett, 2002). In hospitalized patients, AAD is related to significant
      increases in mortality, length of stay, and cost of medical care (McFarland, 2006).
      Twenty-nine percent of hospitalized patients may develop diarrhoea after antibiotic use;
      therefore, identifying strategies to minimize antibiotic-associated diarrhoea could be of
      significant medical and economic advantage (McFarland, 1998). A promising tool in this area
      is the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri

    <measure>To assess if the probiotic L. reuteri is effective in preventing AAD in children</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of diarrhea during and after treatment with antibiotics in patients ingesting L. reuteri versus placebo during the study period, measured as mean number of episodes per patient. An episode of diarrhea is defined as three or more (≥ 3) soft and unformed or watery bowel movements per day for at least 48 hours.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of mild diarrhea and severity if diarrhea in children with probiotic treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of mild diarrhoea during and after treatment with antibiotics in patients ingesting L. reuteri versus placebo during the study period is measured as mean number of episodes per patient. An episode of mild diarrhoea is defined as any soft and unformed or watery bowel movements not fulfilling the definition of AAD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of diarrhoea in patients ingesting L. reuteri versus placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of diarrhoea in patients ingesting L. reuteri versus placebo is measured as the total number of soft and unformed or watery bowel movements during an episode of diarrhoea and the presence of blood and mucus in faeces.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of stool samples positive for C. difficile toxin A and B</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of stool samples positive for C. difficile toxin A and B at baseline, when presenting with diarrhoea during the study period, and at the follow-up 21 days post-antibiotic treatment is done to detect possible clearance of C. difficile, in patients ingesting L. reuteri versus placebo.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequencies of other gastrointestinal symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Frequencies of other gastrointestinal symptoms during antibiotic use and 7 and 21 days after cessation of antibiotic use, in the L. reuteri group versus placebo is to be assessed by the validated GSRS score (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Score, Svedlund et al., 1988).</description>
