  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The analysis of flow and pressure curves generated by ventilators can be useful in the
      individuation of patient-ventilator asynchrony, notably in COPD patients. To date, however, a
      real clinical benefit of this approach to optimize ventilator setting has not been proven.
      The aim of the present study was to compare: optimized ventilation, driven by the analysis of
      flow and pressure curves, and standard setting (same initial setting, same time at the
      bedside, same physician, while the ventilator screen was obscured with numerical data always
      available). The primary aim was the normalization of pH at two hours, whilst secondary aims
      were change in PaCO2, respiratory rate, patient's tolerance to ventilation (all parameter
      evaluated at baseline, 30, 120, 360 minutes and 24 hours after the beginning of ventilation).
      70 patients (26 females, aged 78±9 years, PaCO2 74±15 mmHg, pH 7.28±0.05, mean±SD) have been
      enrolled, with no basal difference between the two groups.

          -  Consecutive patients aged &gt; 40 years affected by COPD exacerbation (defined as an
             acute change in a patient's baseline dyspnoea, cough and/or sputum beyond day-to-day
             variability sufficient to warrant a change in therapy), and respiratory acidosis (pH &lt;
             7.35) that were treated by NIV in addition to standard medical therapy
