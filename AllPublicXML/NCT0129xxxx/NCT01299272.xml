  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to assess the maintenance of efficacy of LY2216684
      compared with placebo as adjunctive therapy to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
      (SSRIs) as measured by the time-to-symptom reemergence among participants with major
      depressive disorder (MDD) who met randomization criteria with adjunctive LY2216684 during the
      stabilization period.

      This trial consists of two distinct periods: an open-label treatment period, which consists
      of two parts, 8 weeks acute open-label with movement to 12 weeks open-label stabilization if
      participants are in remission at end of 8 weeks (open-label for 20 weeks total) followed by a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled period for 24 weeks.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to enter the Stabilization Open-label Period, participants must have met remission
      criteria, defined as a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score ≤10 at
      Week 8. In order to enter the Double-blind Randomization Withdrawal Period, participants must
      have met randomization criteria, defined as a MADRS total score ≤10 at Weeks 18, 19, and 20.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Meet Criteria for Re-emergence of Depressive Symptoms Estimated by Kaplan-Meier Product Limit Method (Double-blind Randomized Withdrawal Period)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization up to 44 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants meeting any of the following criteria were determined as having major depressive disorder symptom re-emergence: 1) a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score greater ≥14 or a Clinical Global Impressions of Severity (CGI-S) increase of 2 or more points from Week 18 at 2 consecutive visits or 2) discontinuation due to lack of efficacy/worsening of depression/suicidality. Time from randomization to the first visit at which the participant met the reemergence criteria was calculated. The percentage of participants who meet criteria was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. The MADRS is a rating scale for severity of depressive mood symptoms and has a 10-item checklist with items rated on a scale of 0-6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity) to 60 (high severity). CGI-S measures severity of depression at the time of assessment compared with the start of treatment. Scores range from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (extremely ill).</description>

    <time_frame>Randomization, Week 44</time_frame>
    <description>The FAsD is a 13-item participant-rated scale. Items 1-6 ask how often participants experience different aspects of fatigue with responses from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Items 7-13 ask how often fatigue impacts various aspects of the participant's lives with responses from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). The experience subscale score is derived by taking the mean of Items 1-6. The impact subscale score is derived by taking the mean of applicable Items 7-13. The average score is the mean of applicable Items 1-13. Item 12 applies only to participants with a spouse or significant other and Item 13 applies to participants who had a job or who went to school. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis which included terms for the fixed categorical effects of treatment, country, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline score and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>

    <measure>Change From Randomization in the EuroQol Questionnaire-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Index Scores, Visual Analog Scale up to Week 44 (Double-blind Randomized Withdrawal Period)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization, up to Week 44</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D, a health-related, quality-of-life instrument, contains 2 parts: a health status profile and a visual analog scale (VAS). The profile allows participants to rate their health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood using a 3-level scale (no problem, some problems, and major problems). These dimensions are converted into weighted health-state index scores according to United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) population-based algorithms. The US and UK based index scores range from -0.11 to 1.0 (where a score of 1.0 indicates perfect health) and from -0.59 (severe problems in all 5 dimensions) to 1.0 (no problem in any dimension), respectively. The VAS consists of participants rating their current health state from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health). Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with main effects of treatment, country, and baseline score.</description>

Stabilization OL Period: Participants meeting remission criteria continued on the same dose of LY2216684 for an additional 12 weeks. Participants who discontinued early during either OL Period were discontinued abruptly from LY2216684.
Double-blind (DB) Randomized Withdrawal Period: At 20 weeks, participants meeting criteria for randomization were tapered from their LY2216684 dose to placebo following the regimen of 12 mg for 7 days, 6 mg for 7 days, and placebo for the remaining 22 weeks. Participants who completed this period or discontinued early continued to receive placebo for an additional 2 weeks</description>

At 8 weeks, participants meeting remission criteria continued on the same, stable dose of LY2216684 and SSRI, orally, QD, for an additional 12 weeks. At 20 weeks, participants meeting criteria for randomization either 1) continued at their current dose of LY2216684 and SSRI, orally, QD, for an additional 24 weeks or 2) were switched from LY2216684 to Placebo and continued at their current SSRI dose, orally, QD, for an additional 24 weeks.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Meet Criteria for Re-emergence of Depressive Symptoms Estimated by Kaplan-Meier Product Limit Method (Double-blind Randomized Withdrawal Period)</title>
        <description>Participants meeting any of the following criteria were determined as having major depressive disorder symptom re-emergence: 1) a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score greater ≥14 or a Clinical Global Impressions of Severity (CGI-S) increase of 2 or more points from Week 18 at 2 consecutive visits or 2) discontinuation due to lack of efficacy/worsening of depression/suicidality. Time from randomization to the first visit at which the participant met the reemergence criteria was calculated. The percentage of participants who meet criteria was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. The MADRS is a rating scale for severity of depressive mood symptoms and has a 10-item checklist with items rated on a scale of 0-6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity) to 60 (high severity). CGI-S measures severity of depression at the time of assessment compared with the start of treatment. Scores range from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (extremely ill).</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score and Individual Item Scores at Week 44 (Double-blind Randomized Withdrawal Period)</title>
        <description>Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a rating scale for severity of depressive mood symptoms. The MADRS has a 10-item checklist (sadness [apparent], sadness [reported], inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts). Items are rated on a scale of 0-6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms). Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis which includes terms for the fixed categorical effects of treatment, country, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline MADRS total score (individual item score) and baseline MADRS total score (individual item score)-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Depression and Anxiety Subscale Scores at Week 44 (Double-blind Randomized Withdrawal Period)</title>
        <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a 14-item questionnaire with 2 subscales: anxiety and depression. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale (0-3), giving maximum scores of 21 for anxiety and depression. Scores of 11 or more on either subscale are considered to be a 'significant' case of psychological morbidity, while scores of 8-10 represent 'borderline' and 0-7 represent 'normal'. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis which included terms for the fixed categorical effects of treatment, country, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline subscale score and baseline subscale score-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization in the Fatigue Associated With Depression (FAsD) Average Score, Experience Subscale Score, and Impact Subscale Score at Week 44 (Double-blind Randomized Withdrawal Period)</title>
        <description>The FAsD is a 13-item participant-rated scale. Items 1-6 ask how often participants experience different aspects of fatigue with responses from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Items 7-13 ask how often fatigue impacts various aspects of the participant's lives with responses from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). The experience subscale score is derived by taking the mean of Items 1-6. The impact subscale score is derived by taking the mean of applicable Items 7-13. The average score is the mean of applicable Items 1-13. Item 12 applies only to participants with a spouse or significant other and Item 13 applies to participants who had a job or who went to school. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis which included terms for the fixed categorical effects of treatment, country, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline score and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization in the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Items at Week 44 (Double-blind Randomized Withdrawal Period)</title>
        <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) is completed by the participant and used to assess the effect of the participant's symptoms on their work (work/school impairment score), social life (social life/leisure activities impairment score), and family life (family life/home responsibilities impairment score). Each item is measured on a 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) point scale with higher values indicating greater disruption. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis which included terms for the fixed categorical effects of treatment, country, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline score and baseline score-by-visit interaction</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization in the EuroQol Questionnaire-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Index Scores, Visual Analog Scale up to Week 44 (Double-blind Randomized Withdrawal Period)</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D, a health-related, quality-of-life instrument, contains 2 parts: a health status profile and a visual analog scale (VAS). The profile allows participants to rate their health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood using a 3-level scale (no problem, some problems, and major problems). These dimensions are converted into weighted health-state index scores according to United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) population-based algorithms. The US and UK based index scores range from -0.11 to 1.0 (where a score of 1.0 indicates perfect health) and from -0.59 (severe problems in all 5 dimensions) to 1.0 (no problem in any dimension), respectively. The VAS consists of participants rating their current health state from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health). Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with main effects of treatment, country, and baseline score.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Suicidal Ideation and Behaviors Assessed by Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) (Double-blind Randomized Withdrawal Period)</title>
        <description>The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) captures occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. Suicidal ideation is defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any 1 of 5 suicidal ideation questions, which includes a wish to be dead and 4 different categories of active suicidal ideation. Suicidal behavior is defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any of 5 suicidal behavior questions: preparatory acts or behavior, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, actual attempt, and completed suicide. Suicidal ideation and behavior are defined as treatment-emergent (TE) if not present during the period up through randomization. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Event module.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization in the Arizona Sexual Experiences (ASEX) Questionnaire at Week 44 (Double-blind Randomized Withdrawal Period)</title>
        <description>Arizona Sexual Experiences (ASEX) Questionnaire is a 5-item rating scale that quantifies sex drive, arousal, vaginal lubrication/penile erection, ability to reach orgasm, and satisfaction from orgasm. Each item is rated from 1 (extremely) to 6 (no/never). Possible total scores ranged from 5 to 30, with the higher scores indicating more sexual dysfunction. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis which included terms for the fixed categorical effects of treatment, country, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline ASEX total score and baseline ASEX total score-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization in the Massachusetts General Hospital Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ) Total Score at Week 44 (Double-blind Randomized Withdrawal Period)</title>
        <description>Massachusetts General Hospital Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ) is a 7-item participant-rated questionnaire pertaining to a participant's cognitive and physical well-being. It assesses motivation, wakefulness, energy, focus, recall, word-finding difficulty, and mental acuity. Each item is scored on a 6-point scale ranging from 1 (greater than normal) to 6 (totally absent). Total score is reported and ranges from 7 to 42, with higher scores indicating greater impairment. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis which included terms for the fixed categorical effects of treatment, country, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline CPFQ total score and baseline CPFQ total score-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Fatigue Associated With Depression (FAsD) Average Score, Experience Subscale Score, and Impact Subscale Score up to Week 8 (Acute Open-label Period)</title>
        <description>The Fatigue Associated With Depression (FAsD) is a 13-item participant-rated scale. Items 1-6 ask how often participants experience different aspects of fatigue with responses from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Items 7-13 ask how often fatigue impacts various aspects of the participant's lives with responses from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). The experience subscale score is derived by taking the mean of Items 1-6. The impact subscale score is derived by taking the mean of applicable Items 7-13. The average score is the mean of applicable Items 1-13. Item 12 applies only to participants with a spouse or significant other and Item 13 applies to participants who had a job or who went to school.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the EuroQol Questionnaire-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Index Scores, Visual Analog Scale up to Week 20 (Open-label Period)</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D, a health-related, quality-of-life instrument, contains 2 parts: a health status profile and a visual analog scale (VAS). The profile allows participants to rate their health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood using a 3-level scale (no problem, some problems, and major problems). These dimensions are converted into weighted health-state index scores according to United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) population-based algorithms. The US and UK based index scores range from -0.11 to 1.0 (where a score of 1.0 indicates perfect health) and from -0.59 (severe problems in all 5 dimensions) to 1.0 (no problem in any dimension), respectively. The VAS consists of participants rating their current health state from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health).</description>

        <description>The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) captures occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. Suicidal ideation is defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any 1 of 5 suicidal ideation questions, which included a wish to be dead and 4 different categories of active suicidal ideation. Suicidal behavior is defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any of 5 suicidal behavior questions: preparatory acts or behavior, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, actual attempt, and completed suicide. Suicidal ideation and behavior are defined as treatment-emergent (TE) if not present at baseline. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Event module.</description>
