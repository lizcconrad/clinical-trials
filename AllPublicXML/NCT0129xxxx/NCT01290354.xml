  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how much lapatinib can enter both normal brains and
      brains in which tumours secondary to breast cancer have developed.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lapatinib is an anti-cancer drug taken by mouth which inhibits the HER2 protein,
      overexpressed in some breast tumours. It is not known whether lapatinib passes through the
      blood-brain barrier, and, therefore, whether it can target secondary tumours in the brain.
      This study will investigate whether lapatinib does indeed enter the brain.

      Subjects with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer, with and without brain metastases, will
      receive lapatinib tablets daily for 8 days. The subjects will also receive lapatinib with a
      small amount of radioactivity attached on the first and last days of dosing to investigate
      whether it is taken up by the brain, using positron emission tomography (PET) scans.
