      The primary objective of this study is to use LR imaging to evaluate the effects of adjuvant
      radiation therapy on reconstructed breasts.

    <textblock>
      Immediate breast reconstruction following mastectomy has become an increasingly popular and
      accepted treatment option among breast cancer patients. This change in practice has resulted
      in a significant number of patients who undergo radiation therapy after breast
      reconstruction. Following irradiation, the reconstructed breast often experiences fibrotic
      contracture, volume loss, altered pigmentation, or some combination thereof, producing an
      asymmetric and aesthetically compromised result. The effects of radiation on reconstructed
      breasts as well as the implications that such changes have for timing of reconstructive
      surgery, post-operative management and surveillance imaging are topics of growing importance
      in plastic surgery, radiology and surgical oncology.

        The target population will consist of patients with a diagnosis of unilateral breast cancer
        who elect to undero bilateral mastectomy with immediate free flap reconstruction. Patients
        will be treated by members of the Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and will
        receive postoperative radiation therapy to the affected breast.

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of unilateral breast cancer who elect to undergo bilateral
             mastectomy with immediate free flap reconstruction.

          -  Patients must also have a locally advanced tumor that requires adjuvant radiation
             therapy following reconstruction.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who do not undergo immediate, bilateral breast reconstruction using a free flap.

          -  Women who do not require unilateral, adjuvant radiation therapy

          -  Women who are pregnant

          -  Women who have altered renal function, defined as a personal history of diabetic,
             hypertensive or autoimmune nephropathy and/or on routine preoperative testing are
             found to have a serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.3
