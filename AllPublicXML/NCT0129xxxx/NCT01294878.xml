    <textblock>
      By hypothesising that Interstitial Cystitis is an allergic disorder of the urogenital system
      that is linked to mast-cells, current therapy with omalizumab may represent a potential non
      symptomatic strategy for the treatment of IC/BPS

      Interstitial cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome is a chronic inflammatory disease of the bladder,
      that is characterized by pain in the pelvic region and a frequent need to urinate. So far
      there is not a an effective treatment for this uncommon distressing condition.

      The objective of this preliminary study was to evaluate the efficacy of omalizumab in the
      treatment of Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome, evaluated by visual analogue score
      (VAS) for pain and urgency- frequency, O'Leary-Sant IC symptom and problem index
      questionnaire (primary outcome), PUF questionnaire and Patient Global Assessment
      questionnaire, and urination diary (secondary outcomes).

      Three female adult patients (24-34 years) suffering form Interstitial Cystitis and chronic
      bladder pain were included in the study. The omalizumab dose has been calculated on the basis
      of body weight and basal levels of total serum IgE. Treatment was administered subcutaneously
      every 2 or 4 weeks (according to the calculated total dose) for a total of 48 weeks. Each
      vial contained 150 mg of the active compound, therefore the number of injections for each
      administration varied between 1 and 3, depending on the total dose used. Patients were
      allowed to take drugs used for IC (Fibrase, Pelvilen, Normast, Quercetin, Chondroitin,
      Glucosamine per os). During the screening process, the dosage of these drugs was established
      and stably maintained during the 4 week run-in period.

             provided written informed consent

          -  In patients diagnosed with IC/PBS that underwent treatment, basal levels of total
             serum IgE were 30 and 700 IU/ml and patients showed a positive allergic anamnesis
             (asthma, rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, etc.)

          -  Diagnosis of IC/PBS was performed according to the criteria established by the
             National Institute of Health Consensus Conference and patients had symptoms for at
             least 3 months. Cytoscopy was performed according to the clinical indications

        Exclusion Criteria:
