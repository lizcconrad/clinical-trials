    <textblock>
      A whole of school intervention with daily physical activity and healthy food for students
      with intellectual disabilities. The aim is to provide plenty of concrete examples of healthy
      life style choices and using school personnel and peers as role models. This will presumably
      result in healthier weight, better fitness and not least in new familiar healthy habits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Youth with an intellectual disability are reported more sedentary and more often overweight
      than non intellectual disability youth. Cardio metabolic risk factors are observed more
      frequent and at an earlier age among young people with intellectual disability. The school
      reaches all students and they spend the main part of their day in the school milieu hence
      examples of healthy lifestyle can be provided there.

      This intervention increased physical activity with daily scheduled physical activity. At
      least one lesson each week was at the gym. Food provided in the school environment was
      considered from content of sugar and fat and ónly healthy food choices was available at
      school. This included all school activities, both in the school area and on school activities
      out in the community. It included home economic lessons as well as the school cafeterias
      supply and school lunch content.

      To increase vegetable intake a special designed plate was used for lunch according the &quot;plate
      model&quot;. In addition, the plate model was one theme during art class.
