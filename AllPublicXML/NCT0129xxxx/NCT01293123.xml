  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine the effects of the HIV integrase inhibitor,
      raltegravir, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This will be accomplished by collecting CSF before
      and after initiation of either raltegravir or another antiretroviral, efavirenz, each in
      combination with two other antiretrovirals. Assessments will include HIV RNA levels (viral
      load), neuropsychological testing, mood assessments, and quality of life assessments.

    <textblock>
      Cognitive disorders continue to be a common complication of HIV disease even though potent
      antiretroviral drugs can reduce HIV below detectable levels and restore immune function.
      Concentrations of most antiretrovirals in the nervous system are only a fraction of
      concentrations in blood. As a result, HIV can continue to be present in the nervous system
      when it is below detection in blood. A recently approved drug, raltegravir, reaches
      therapeutic concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid and may be effective at controlling HIV
      replication in the primary target cells in the brain, macrophages and microglia. Based on
      this, raltegravir may be a particularly effective drug for treating HIV disease in the
      nervous system. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of raltegravir in the
      nervous system by measuring HIV in the CSF (via lumbar puncture, also known as spinal taps)
      before and after initiation of raltegravir-containing antiretroviral therapy. CSF is an
      accessible fluid that provides a window into brain processes, including HIV replication and
      inflammation. The potency of raltegravir will be estimated by calculating the change in HIV
      viral load in CSF over time. These changes will be compared to those following initiation an
      efavirenz-containing regimen in a separate group of individuals. Two additional drugs
      (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine) will be combined with either raltegravir or
      efavirenz. Neuropsychological performance, mood, sleep and quality of life assessment will
      also be compared. Participants will be randomly assigned to either raltegravir- or
      efavirenz-containing therapy.
