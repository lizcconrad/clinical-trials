      The purpose of this study is to determine whether BEMA Buprenorphine is safe in the treatment
      of chronic pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label study of up to approximately 52 weeks duration to assess the safety and
      effectiveness of BEMA Buprenorphine in the management of moderate to severe chronic pain.

      BEMA Buprenorphine is an oral transmucosal form of the opioid analgesic, buprenorphine
      hydrochloride, intended for application to the buccal mucosa. Buprenorphine is a synthetic
      opioid that is classified as a partial μ-receptor agonist and a Schedule III controlled
      substance in the United States.
