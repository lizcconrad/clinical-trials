    <textblock>
      This is an open, multi-center, non comparative study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      Macrolane VRF30 in the female breast. 71 subjects have received initial treatment with a
      maximum of 120 ml of Macrolane VRF30 per breast. 22 patients have received a re-injection
      (max 120 ml/breast) of Macrolane nine months after initial treatment. Patients are followed
      for 24 months after last treatment.
