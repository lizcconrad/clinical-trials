  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality in patients with end stage renal
      disease (ESRD). They often have myocardial ischemia (a major predictor of mortality) on non
      invasive testing (Stress echocardiography and/or myocardial perfusion scintigraphy) but the
      incidence of significant coronary stenosis (&gt;70%) is low. The goal of this observational
      study is to evaluate the incidence and clinical outcomes of proven myocardial microvascular
      disease in patients with end stage renal disease scheduled or not for kidney transplantation.
      These patients routinely undergo non invasive detection of myocardial ischemia. Patient
      included in the study will be followed up for 2 years for major cardiovascular events.
      Patients with detected myocardial ischemia during non invasive testing are being explored by
      coronary angiography. During coronary angiography additional detection of myocardial
      microvascular disease is being performed by simultaneous measurement of Fractional Flow
      Reserve (FFR) and Coronary Flow Reserve (CFR) followed by calculation of the index of
      microcirculatory resistance (IMR).

      Comparison of cardiovascular outcomes between patients with and without myocardial ischemia
      and patients with and without myocardial microvascular disease will be performed.

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Invasive FFR + CFR measurements are performed during coronary angiography using a pressure guide wire</intervention_name>
    <description>The guide is placed in the distal segment of the coronary artery to measure instantaneously distal pressure and temperature with a tip sensor. Proximal pressure and temperature are being measured from the probe used to catheterize the coronary vessel and from the shaft of the guide. After basal measurement, intracoronary injection of 150µg of adenosine is performed to induce peripheral vasodilatation leading to hyperaemia in the vessel. Additional injection of 3mL 0.9% saline bolus at room temperature at the time of hyperaemia is performed to calculate CFR from transit mean time. FFR and CFR are being recorded at the time of hyperaemia. Subsequently IMR is being calculated from distal pressure and transit mean time. The measurements will be performed in the LAD, circumflex and right coronary arteries.</description>
