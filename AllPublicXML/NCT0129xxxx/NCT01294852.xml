  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the immediate bolus strategy combined with
      early nasal CPAP (nCPAP) treatment could decrease the subsequent need for ventilation
      compared to the administration of surfactant prophylaxis at 15 minutes after birth with early
      nCPAP in premature infants.

    <textblock>
      Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a syndrome in premature infants caused by
      developmental insufficiency of surfactant production and structural immaturity in the lungs.
      Exogenous surfactant therapy has become well established in newborn infants with RDS.
      Surfactant replacement therapy, either as a rescue treatment or a prophylactic, reduces
      mortality and several aspects of morbidity in babies with RDS. It is known that infants who
      are at a significant risk of RDS should receive prophylactic surfactant therapy, but the
      optimal timing and strategy for prophylactic surfactant therapy remains controversial. When
      administered immediately after delivery, surfactant mixes with the fetal lung fluid and
      reaches the alveoli before the onset of lung injury potentially created by the first applied
      positive pressure ventilation. As another approach, surfactant prophylaxis may be
      administered after resuscitation and stabilization.

    <description>Infants with RDS may require mechanical ventilation. Mechinal ventilation causes volu- and barotrauma in the lungs and associated morbidities. The earlier surfactant is given, the better it works. So immediate surfactant prophylaxis given before the first breath may decrease the requirement for mechanical ventilation compared with surfactant prophylaxis given at 15 minutes of age after resuscitation and stabilization.</description>

    <description>Premature infants born before 28 weeks' gestation and infants born at 29 to 30 weeks' gestation who did not receive antenatal steroid were randomized before delivery to receive either immediate bolus or post-resuscitation surfactant prophylaxis at 15 minutes after birth. Those infants who were randomized to immediate bolus surfactant were intubated as rapidly as possible after birth, were administered 100 mg/kg surfactant (Curosurf[Chiesi, Farmaceutici, Parma, Italy]), and received standard resuscitation measures as indicated. Those infants who were randomized to post-resuscitation surfactant received standard resuscitation measures first, were intubated electively at 15 minutes after birth and received 100 mg/kg surfactant (Curosurf[Chiesi, Farmaceutici, Parma, Italy]).</description>
