      Part C: Continuation of long-term follow-up (from Day 365 onwards). Patients who have
      completed Part B and to whom continued treatment with Advagraf® is not currently available,
      will be offered participation in a continuation of long-term follow-up (Part C). Part C will
      continue until Advagraf® becomes available to these patients or these patients'
      discontinuation, whichever is the earliest.

      This applies to patients in the following countries: Czech Republic, Germany, Italy and
      Poland only.
