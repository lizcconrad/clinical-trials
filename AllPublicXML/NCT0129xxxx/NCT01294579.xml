      The purpose of this phase II open label study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      ofatumumab and bendamustine followed by maintenance ofatumumab in subjects with indolent
      B-NHL who have relapsed after Rituximab treatment. A maximum of 53 subjects at least 18 years
      old with Small lymphocytic, lymphoplasmacytic, marginal zone lymphoma, or follicular
      lymphoma; Grades 1, 2 and 3a, will be enrolled (34 in Stage 1 and 19 in Stage 2). Subjects
      should have Rituximab-sensitive disease, defined as a Partial Remission (PR) or Complete
      Remission (CR) to the last rituximab-containing therapy lasting at least 6 months following
      completion of therapy or subjects should have relapse or disease progression following
      response to prior rituximab-based therapy and with a Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
      (ECOG) Performance status of 0 1 or 2. During the induction phase, ofatumumab 1000 mg IV on
      day 1 of each cycle (cycles 1-6) will be followed by Bendamustine 90 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 2 of
      each cycle (cycles 1-6).During the maintenance phase, subjects with a PR or CR after the
      induction phase will receive ofatumumab 1000 mg IV every 2 months for 2 years.
