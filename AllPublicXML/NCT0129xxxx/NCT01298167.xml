  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to look at which nonpermanent superficial closure method,
      cyanoacrylate tissue glue or fast absorbing gut suture, leads to a better cosmetic and
      functional outcome in repairs of facial wounds after Mohs surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cyanoacrylate is a rapidly polymerizing topical adhesive commonly used as an alternative to
      traditional sutures. Both cyanoacrylate and fast absorbing gut suture eliminate the need for
      suture removal which can represent a significant savings in patient and staff time as well as
      related healthcare resources. Both cyanoacrylate and fast absorbing gut suture are currently
      routinely used for epidermal closure at Yale following Mohs micrographic surgery. Physician
      preference currently dictates which epidermal closure method is chosen for a given surgery.

      Cyanoacrylate has been reported to decrease trauma to the epidermal edges, minimize suture
      tract marks in surgical scars, and decrease the risk of inflammatory reaction to suture
      material. Cyanoacrylate, however, does not allow for wound eversion.

      Wound eversion minimizes the risk of a depressed scar from tissue contraction during healing.
      As with all sutures, fast absorbing gut suture allows for wound eversion which is reported to
      maximize the likelihood of a good epidermal approximation. On the other hand, fast absorbing
      gut suture degrades by proteolysis which can result in an inflammatory reaction. Any
      inflammatory reaction on the skin while healing can affect the final cosmetic outcome (ie.
      post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation).

      A recent article (Tierney 2009), reported that tissue adhesive may not be as effective in
      achieving optimal cosmesis as fast absorbing gut for defects on the trunk and extremities.
      However, we would like to study these two methods for the repair of facial wounds, which are
      in low tension areas as compared to trunk and extremities. Therefore, it is unknown exactly
      which of these two method is better than the other in epidermal closure of facial wounds
      follow Mohs micrographic surgery.

    <description>The Visual Analog or Analogue Scale (VAS)* is designed to present to the respondent a rating scale with minimum constraints. Respondents mark the location on the 10-centimeter line corresponding to their feeling. It also gives the maximum opportunity for each respondent to express a personal response style.
The scale is interpreted as the greater the scale score (as the score approaches 10), the greater the cosmetic and functional outcome of the healed wound.

    <description>All wounds will be closed using a linear, bilayered closure method, where the buried intradermal absorbing suture (5-0, Polysorb) will be placed along the length of the incision, consistent with standard surgical procedure. Only patients with wounds with a length of 3cm or greater will be enrolled. Each wound will be measured, and the length divided in half. Half of the surgical wound will be randomly selected (by coin toss) for epidermal reapproximation with cyanoacrylate, whereas the other half will be repaired with 6-0 fast absorbing gut suture in standard running fashion.</description>
