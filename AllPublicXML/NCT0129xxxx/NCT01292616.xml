  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS) is a complication of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) due to pannus
      formation around the odontoid process of C2 of the cervical spine. It occurs frequently in
      15-30% of all RA patients. AAS may occur relatively early in the course of disease within the
      first years. The diagnosis of AAS identifies a patient population with a poor outcome. There
      is evidence that combination treatment with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD)
      may retard the development of AAS. However, it is not known whether treatment with inhibitors
      of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) may lead to regression of cervical pannus and prevention
      or reduction of AAS.

      Clinical studies analysing the effectiveness of TNF-inhibitors combined with conventional
      DMARD therapy, in the treatment of cervical spine involvement leading to AAS, are needed.
      This proposal for a pilot study aims at assessing the feasibility of an MRI-based measurement
      of pannus volume in patients before and after treatment with a TNF-inhibitor.

      Primary objective: To show that measurements of pannus mass with MRI is feasible. Secondary
      objective: To assess whether pannus mass decreases measurably in patients treated with
      TNF-inhibitors.

      This pilot study is prospective, non-randomized. The choice of therapy at any time during the
      study is entirely up to the treating rheumatologist.
