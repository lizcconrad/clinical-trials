      RATIONALE: Studying medical records and collecting questionnaires from patients who were
      enrolled as children in clinical trials for acute lymphoblastic leukemia may help doctors
      learn about long-term effects of treatment and plan the best treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the long-term outcomes of patients with acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia who were enrolled as children on clinical trials EORTC-58741,
      EORTC-58831, EORTC-58832, or EORTC-58881 between 1971 and 1998.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To assess the long-term outcomes (i.e., long-term survival, long-term disease status,
           occurrence of late adverse effects, occurrence of second cancers, and socioeconomic
           status of survivors) of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia previously enrolled
           as children on clinical trials EORTC-58741, EORTC-58831, EORTC-58832, or EORTC-58881
           between the years of 1971 and 1998.

      OUTLINE: Long-term outcome data are collected from the databases about clinical trials
      EORTC-58741, EORTC-58831, EORTC-58832, or EORTC-58881. Other data collected include the
      patient's vital status actualization (e.g., alive, dead or lost to follow up, date last known
      to be alive or date of death), medical records data, and the collection of data from patients
      confirmed to be alive (e.g., data related to marital status, education, work, insurance,
      puberty, fertility, and offspring) by questionnaire.
