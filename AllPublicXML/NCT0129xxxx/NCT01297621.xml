      This prospective controlled trial was designed to determine whether breast reduction may
      influence physical activity and sexuality of breast hypertrophy women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast hypertrophy is a frequent condition among women; reduction mammaplasty is one of the
      most performed procedures in plastic surgery.Previous studies have demonstrated that breast
      hypertrophy is associated to back pain, and patients often complain about physical
      limitations due to this condition, as well as sexual impairment. Thus, this trial was
      designed to test the hypothesis that reduction mammaplasty may improve physical and sexual
      performance of breast hypertrophy patients,and patients'satisfaction with the results of the
      operation. Three validated tools were used: the International Physical Activity Questionnaire
      (IPAQ), the Female Sexual Quotient and the Breast Evaluation Questionnaire.
