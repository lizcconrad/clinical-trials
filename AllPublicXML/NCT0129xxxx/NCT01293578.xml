  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test the relative merits of a decision aid for diabetes
      medications that we have developed - Diabetes Medication Choice Cards- versus usual care in
      translating comparative effectiveness research (CER) into real world clinics. This study will
      involve about 20 primary care practice sites affiliated with Mayo Health System, Park
      Nicollet, or Hennepin County Medical Center. There will be no recruiting done at the Mayo
      Clinic.

      To conduct a cluster-randomized practical trial to evaluate the impact of our decision aid
      (Diabetes Medication Choice Cards) versus usual care as strategies to translate CER into
      practice among patients with poorly controlled diabetes in need of drug intensification
      (Hemoglobin Alc (HbA1c) &gt; 7.3%). Patient outcomes including reaching glycemic control target
      (HbA1c less than or equal to 7.3%), medication choice and adherence, satisfaction and
      knowledge. From the physician perspective, we will be measuring physician adoption and
      satisfaction with the decision aid.

      To identify, describe, and explain factors that promote or inhibit the uptake of complex
      interventions such as decision aids in practices participating in the trial.

      To conduct an exploratory analysis of the ability of patients to adhere to the medications
      chosen while exploring the factors that enable or hinder the patients' ability to incorporate
      these medications into their routine.
