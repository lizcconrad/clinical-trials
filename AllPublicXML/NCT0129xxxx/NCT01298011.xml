      The main purpose of this research study is to evaluate whether Abraxane and gemcitabine are
      effective in treating patients with operable pancreatic cancer.

    <textblock>
      The best outcome for a patient diagnosed with pancreatic cancer is surgery. However many
      patients have recurrence of the cancer after successful surgery. The investigators are
      evaluating chemotherapy before surgery, which is a new approach.

      In this study, Abraxane and gemcitabine will be tested as treatment for people with operable
      pancreatic cancer to see if surgery can be successfully performed and if treatment will
      reduce cancer cells in the tumor at surgery.

      Abraxane is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer after
      failure of combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease or relapse within 6 months of
      adjuvant chemotherapy. Gemcitabine is approved by the FDA for first line treatment for
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer of the pancreas.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has histologically or cytologically confirmed potentially resectable

               3. Clear fat plane between the SMA and celiac axis.

               4. No extension to celiac axis and hepatic artery.

               5. Patent superior mesenteric vein and portal vein.

               6. No evidence of distant or extra-hepatic disease by CT scans.

          4. Patient has known infection with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C.

          5. Patient has undergone major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery (i.e.--surgery done
             to obtain a biopsy for diagnosis without removal of an organ), within 4 weeks prior to
             Day 1 of treatment in this study.

          6. Prior chemotherapy or radiation for pancreatic cancer. Prior exposure to gemcitabine
             and/or Abraxane.

             research drug.

          9. Patient is unwilling or unable to comply with study procedures.

             trial.

         11. Patient has metastatic disease on radiological staging.

         12. Patients aged ≥ 80 are not excluded. As two events of fatal sepsis have been seen in
             this group in other studies, candidates in this age group should be thoroughly
             evaluated before enrollment in the study, to ensure they are fit to receive
             chemotherapy. In addition to meeting all of the baseline patient selection criteria,
             clinical judgment on their susceptibility to infection and expected stability of their
             performance status as to receive repeat weekly chemotherapy cycles, should be paid
             special attention to. Patients should not be enrolled in the study should there be any
             hesitation on any of these considerations. Baseline criteria for all patients enrolled
             on the study must be carefully evaluated and all criteria followed appropriately.
