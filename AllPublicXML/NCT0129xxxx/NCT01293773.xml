      Design: prospective, randomized, multi-center trial comparing the safety and efficacy in the
      prevention of target lesion failure (TLF) of second generation paclitaxel- versus ABT578-
      versus Everolimus- eluting stents Study Population: all consecutive diabetic patients with de
      novo coronary artery lesions undergoing drug-eluting stent implantation in 2010-12.

      Time Course: initial Enrollment: October 2010; end of the Enrollment: December 2012 Primary
      End-Point: target lesion revascularization (TLF) defined as the occurrence of cardiac death,
      myocardial infarction and repeated lesion revascularization within 12 months.

      Secondary End-Points: 1) impact of glucose level during the first three months following the
      procedure (assessed by hemoglobin A1C ) on clinically-driven target lesion revascularization;
      2)TLF and TLR within 12, 24 and 36 months; 3) comparison 12 months versus prolonged (&gt; 12
      months) of dual antiplatelet therapy

      Prospective, randomized, triple arm study. The study population will include all consecutive
      diabetic patients within 24 months undergoing elective second generation DES implantation for
      de novo coronary artery disease. In the randomization process all participating centers will
      be equally stratified to avoid statistical unbalance.
