    <textblock>
      The goals of this open-label Phase Ia study are to evaluate the Pharmacokinetics (PK)
      profiles of new novel single-dose Ondansetron Pulsatile Release (Ond-PR) formulations in
      normal healthy volunteers. After this initial phase, the investigators will follow with the
      Phase Ib study to determine Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD), safety, and tolerability
      interactions following simultaneous administration of these ondansetron formulations with a
      10 mg Methylphenidate Immediate Release (MPh-IR) tablet in normal healthy volunteers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will compare 2 different pulsatile-release formulations of ondansetron, PR1 and PR2.
      Ond-PR1 is a pH-sensitive formulation while Ond-PR2 is osmotic-sensitive.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The release profile of Ondansetron Pulsatile Release (Ond-PR) in the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract matches the one predicted from test tube dissolution experiments.</measure>
    <time_frame>The time to reach peak blood concentration (tmax) for oral Ondansetron Standard (Ond-St) is ~2 hours (h). Therefore, tmax for Ond-PR with in vitro dissolution time of 3 - 4 h is expected to be 5 - 6 h (i.e., 3 - 4 h delay + normal absorption time).</time_frame>
    <description>Serum levels of ondansetron after oral administration of Ond-PR in healthy human volunteers. Standard PK parameters will be calculated based on the serum levels to verify that the drug levels reach the peak blood concentration 5 - 6 hours after oral administration.
Time Frame: Blood samples will be taken immediately before oral Ond-PR administration, followed by sampling at 0.5, 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6 and 10 hours after drug administration.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine drug-drug interactions of Ond-PR with a simultaneously-administered MPh-IR.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 - 6 h</time_frame>
    <description>For our secondary objective we plan to determine drug-drug interactions between Ond-PR and MPh-IR when they are simultaneously administered orally. Specific parameters to be assessed include changes in the PK, properties (see above for the specific parameter list), safety/tolerability profiles of Ond-PR.</description>
