  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A knee dislocation is an unusual and extremely serious injury and is defined as complete
      displacement of the tibia with respect to the femur, usually with disruption of 3 or more of
      the stabilizing ligaments. When the knee dislocates, there is often significant damage to the
      soft-tissues envelope surrounding the joint, including adjacent neurovascular structures. Not
      surprisingly, this injury is a profoundly debilitating, life-altering event, with the
      potential to necessitate career change in athletes and laborers alike. Current evidence
      indicates that operative management for these injuries is more effective at returning
      patients to pre-morbid range of motion (ROM) and activity than conservative management. Post
      operative rehabilitation programs for these patients must balance the need for stability of
      their surgical repair and knee ROM and functionality. Experimental data suggests that
      post-operative immobilization offers greater protection of the surgical reconstruction,
      whereas immediate, aggressive physiotherapy may be more effective at preventing
      arthrofibrosis stiffness. The investigators are proposing a randomized clinical trial
      comparing early physiotherapy (day one post op) versus immobilization for three weeks then
      initiation of physiotherapy. The physiotherapy progams will be identicalbe in all aspects
      except for progam initiation.
