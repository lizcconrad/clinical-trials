    <textblock>
      Providing child nutrition information is a major goal of every pediatric well-child visit.
      Unfortunately, due to a wide array of issues, doing this effectively during clinic visits is
      challenging and insufficient. It is because of this that some have looked for innovative ways
      to enhance the delivery of this information. One such way is the use of touch screen computer
      programs containing nutritional information. Several studies have documented the value of
      patients receiving health information in such a manner.

      Nonetheless, the use of this medium has not been well studied in Spanish-speaking care
      providers of young children. The investigators recently conducted a study that evaluated
      user's perception of the usability of such technology, finding that most users thought that
      the touchscreen was easy to use, despite their low computer confidence levels. The
      investigators also evaluated the impact of using nutrition modules on user's nutrition
      knowledge, finding that immediately after use; participant's nutrition knowledge was
      improved. I now propose to evaluate this technology further through a 4 armed randomized
      controlled trial. The goal here is to evaluate the longer term impact of the educational
      modules on nutrition knowledge and the impact, if any, of additional web access to the
      modules, on longer term knowledge. A secondary goal is to better understand nutritional
      habits in this population and perceptions of weight.
