  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine that the measurements of rectal and bladder
      temperature are correctly consistent with core temperature by using the pulmonary artery
      catheter during therapeutic hypothermia; rapid cooling, maintenance, and slow rewarming
      phase.

      The guidelines of therapeutic hypothermia(TH)are rapid cooling, from normothermia to mild
      hypothermia(32~34 degree), maintenance, and slow rewarming phase. If core temperature
      maintained below 32 degree during TH, som complications will be developed, such as arrythmia,
      hypotension, cold diuresis, coagulopathy, and so on. Therefore correct measurement of core
      temperature during TH is very important process for successful post cardiac arrest care. we
      will know that rectal or bladder temperature are really reflect the core temperature during
      TH for post cardiac arrest care, especially rapid cooling phase, maintenance phase, and slow
      rewarming phase, respectively.
