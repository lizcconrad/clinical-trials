  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This ultrahigh-field MRI study gives us the unique opportunity to measure changes in brain
      function and structure induced by long-term opposite-sex steroid hormone administration in
      transsexual subjects. Our aim is 1. to prove the influence of high-dose, long-term
      opposite-sex steroid hormone treatment on functional brain response in transsexuals. 2. to
      investigate the influence of hormone treatment on resting state functional connectivity and
      brain morphology. 3. to investigate differences between transsexuals and healthy control
      subjects in brain function and functional connectivity, brain morphology and structural
      connectivity. In this longitudinal study, transsexuals and healthy control subjects will
      undergo three 7 Tesla ultrahigh-field MRI scan sessions: 1. baseline (before hormone
      treatment), 2. after 4 weeks of treatment and 3. after 4 months of treatment.

        Transsexuals urging sex reassignment in a clinical setting will be enrolled at the Unit for
        Gender Identity Disorder at the General Hospital in Vienna. 20 female-to-male (FtM) and 20
        male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals will be asked to undergo this fMRI, MRI, DTI and
        resting-state functional connectivity study. Transsexual subjects are aged between 18 and
        50 years old and free from hormone-treatment at baseline.

        40 healthy control subjects, matched for age, sex and sexual orientation to transsexual
        subjects will be recruited.
