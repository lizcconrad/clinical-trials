    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) represents one of the most challenging chronic
      diseases of the 21st century: it is expected to be the fourth leading cause of death by 2030.
      COPD is characterized by pulmonary and extra-pulmonary systemic manifestations caused by
      partly irreversible expiratory airflow obstruction. The cornerstone of COPD management is the
      prescription of single or combined inhalation therapy, such as short- and long-acting
      bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids to possibly prevent disease progression, preserve
      lung function, relieve respiratory symptoms and prevent or treat exacerbations. Given the
      complex and lifelong treatment, one can expect that adherence to the prescribed inhalation
      therapy is not self-evident. Adherence can be defined as the &quot;the extent to which a person's
      behaviour (taking medications, following a recommended diet and/or executing life-style
      changes) corresponds with the agreed recommendations of a health care provider&quot;. Inhaled
      medications have an additional complexity in that patients who intend to be adherent may be
      take the inhaled medication incorrectly, prohibiting proper therapeutic action. Taking less
      than the prescribed amount of medication, missing doses or stopping treatment for brief or
      extended periods will put the patient at risk for suboptimal disease control. Hence, the
      effectiveness will largely depend on the patient's ability to manage their disease adequately
      in daily life.

      Using electronic monitoring, 3 studies in COPD found a prevalence of medication non-adherence
      of 51% which was worse than the average prevalence of 29% (range 3-66%) found across diseases
      such as hypertension, cancer, epilepsia, infections and HIV.

      The existing evidence on risk factors for nonadherence in COPD is mostly anecdotic and not
      guided by behavioral models. According to the integrated model of behavioral prediction
      (IMBP), barriers, skills and ability and intention are the most important drivers of
      adherence (i.e. medication adherence).

      The aims of the study are the following:

        -  To prospectively investigate the impact of medication nonadherence on time to
           exacerbation (primary end-point) and exacerbation rate, FEV1, hospitalization rate and
           duration, and quality of life (secondary end-points) at 1 year follow-up using
           electronic monitoring

        -  To investigate risk factors for medication nonadherence, using the Integrated Model of
           Behavioral Prediction as a theoretical framework

        -  To determine the diagnostic accuracy of different measures of medication nonadherence
           (i.e. pill count, self-report and physician rating) relative to electronic monitoring.

        -  To investigate the prevalence of nonadherence to other aspects of the therapeutic
           regimen, i.e. the use of concomitant medications, smoking cessation, alcohol use,
           physical activity, attendance to rehabilitation sessions and dietary adherence, their
           interrelations, and impact (alone and in combination) on time to first exacerbation.

        -  To investigate the interrelations in adherence to the various components of the
           therapeutic regimen.

        -  To investigate the impact of nonadherence to the other components of the therapeutic
           regimen (alone and in combination) on clinical outcomes (i.e. time to exacerbation,
           exacerbation rate/PPY, FEV1, hospitalization rate and duration, and quality of life at 1
           year follow-up.
