    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate if sedation of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients
      influences the development of delirium during their ICU stay and if incidences of delirium
      have an impact on the development of Post-traumatic Stress-Disorder (PTSD).

      Hypothesis 1:

      Patients who are minimally sedated, remember staying in ICU and experiences fewer episodes of
      delirium than patients that are heavily sedated

      Hypothesis 2:

      Former delirious patients are more likely to develop PTSD

      Hypothesis 3:

      Delirium decreases health-related quality (HRQoL) of life after discharge
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Background:

      It is known that ICU patients that experience delirium have longer hospital stay, higher
      mortality and morbidity. Other studies indicate that PTSD, dementia or depression may emerge
      after discharge from hospital.

      Methods according to hypothesis 1:

      During ICU stay: Measure sedation level &amp; delirium. First follow-up 1-2 weeks after ICU:
      Memories

      Analyses:

      Data will be analyzed descriptive via EPIDATA and Stata Delirium is endpoint, defined as
      CAM-ICU positive. Sedation level is exposure variable.

      Confounders: priory antipsychotic treatment or hypertension,glasses or hearing aids,alcohol
      and tobacco abuse,degree of illness,age and sex.

      Correlation between sedation level and memories will be calculated.

      Methods according to hypothesis 2:

      Screening for: PTSD, Depression, Anxiety

      Analyses:

      PTSD is endpoint, and delirium is the exposure variable. Main confounders: Anxiety and
      Depression Mean of PTSD will be calculated with Confidence Interval to test any difference
      between experienced delirium or not.

      Methods according to hypothesis 3:

      Method:Health-related quality of life is endpoint, Activities of daily living (ADL),
      Memories, and a Script Test (only after 2 month)

      Analyses:

      Mean of HRQoL will be calculated with Confidence Interval to test any difference between
      experienced delirium or not.

      Confounders: Diary and/or Follow up
