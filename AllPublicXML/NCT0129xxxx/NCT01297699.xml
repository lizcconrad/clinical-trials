  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to investigate tocilizumab administration in patients with moderately to
      severely or sight-threatening GO (Graves' ophthalmopathy) without response to treatment with
      corticoid intravenous pulses. Currently, these patients only have surgery as therapeutic
      alternative.

      The principal aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of tocilizumab treatment
      in order to provide a better alternative to surgery for this patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid orbitopathy or Graves´orbitopathy (GO) is manifested for inflammation of the orbital
      and periorbital soft tissues. Ten percent of patients with GO will have long-term serious eye
      problems.

      The cause of the GO is complex. Autoreactive T cells recognize an autoantigen, the TSH
      receptor present in the orbit and thyroid follicular cell, secrete cytokines (IL-6), which
      stimulate the fibroblasts to synthesize glycosaminoglycan, which draws liquid produce
      periorbital edema and muscle, causing exophthalmos.

      This approach suggests that inhibition of IL-6 can be an effective treatment for this problem
      on the basis that tocilizumab specifically binds to the receptors of the IL-6, both soluble
      and membrane-bound. Tocilizumab has been shown to inhibit signaling mediated for IL-6Rm
      IL-6Rs.
