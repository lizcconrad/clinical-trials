  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to compare the accelerated fractionation radiotherapy and concurrent
      chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients in
      terms of loco-regional control, toxicities and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy is a common and conventional method of treating locally
      advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In locally advanced HNSCC it has been
      proved to be superior to radiotherapy alone. On the other side accelerated fractionation
      radiotherapy (AFRT) is a proven practice to improve cure rate in head and neck cancers. Yet
      it has not been compared with Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in locally advanced HNSCC
      and hence this study is aiming to compare CRT versus AFRT.
