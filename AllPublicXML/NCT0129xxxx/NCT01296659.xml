  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ridaforolimus has been tested in almost 2 dozen studies; however, it has not previously been
      tested in combination with the standard of care chemotherapy for sarcoma as this study will.
      We will be looking to see if Ridaforolimus given with SOC chemo (AIM or TG) is well tolerated
      and to determine a Phase 2 dose.
