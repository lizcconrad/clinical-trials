  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, prospective, randomized trial was designed to evaluate the role of
      thalidomide with or without dexamethasone as a maintenance therapy for multiple myeloma
      patients after a single autologous stem cell transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were recruited prior to receiving induction therapy, and randomization in a 1:1
      ratio occurred on day 60 post-autologous stem cell transplantation. The treatment consisted
      of the following four phases:

        1. induction with 3-5 cycles of vincristine plus doxorrubicin and dexamethasone (VAD) every
           21-28 days: vincristine 0.4 mg , doxorubicin 9 mg/m² and oral dexamethasone 40 mg daily
           for 4 days;

        2. cyclophosphamide (4 g/m2 ) plus filgrastim (G-CSF) (5 μg/kg twice a day) for stem cell
           mobilization;

        3. melphalan (200 mg/m2 ) and one autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT);

        4. Sixty days (D +60) after ASCT: RANDOMIZATION in two arms of maintenance: Arm A (oral
           dexamethasone alone 40 mg/d for 4 days every 28 days) and Arm B (dexamethasone plus
           thalidomide 200 mg daily by mouth) for 12 months or until disease progression.

    <description>Primary endpoint: progression free survival (PFS) PFS was defined as the time between randomization and any documentation of relapse, progression, or death by any cause.</description>

    <measure>Overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary endpoints: overall survival (OS) was defined as the interval from randomization to death (or the last follow-up for surviving patients). For patients who were not randomized, OS was calculated from the date of diagnosis until the date of death or last follow-up.</description>

    <measure>safety of thalidomide</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of patients experiencing adverse events grade 3 or 4 were compared between treatment arms. Adverse events were classified as defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2. Safety evaluations were focused especially on neurological symptoms and the development of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Adverse events evaluations were performed at the time of response assessment and whenever a new clinical manifestation suggestive of toxicity appeared.</description>
