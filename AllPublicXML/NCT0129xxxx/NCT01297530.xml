  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study of this drug in human beings. Every patient will receive the drug,
      there is no placebo group. Patients with advanced tumors will be treated. Different groups of
      patients will receive different dosages to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of BAY87-2243. The study will also assess how the drug is metabolized by the body, its
      biologic effects in the body, and changes in tumor size.

      BAY87-2243 will be given as a tablet which dissolves in the gut. Based on findings from this
      study it may be later given as a tablet which dissolves in the stomach.

      BAY87-2243 will be given per mouth, once a day, every day. Treatment will stop if the tumor
      continues to grow, if side effects occur which the patient can not tolerate or if the
      patients decides to exit treatment.

      The study will be conducted in 3 - 4 centers in 3 countries (Norway, United Kingdom and
      Germany). The study will have a part where doses are escalated in different groups of
      patients. Each dose level will be evaluated in a new group of 3 - 6 subjects. This will be
      followed by an extension part where patients are treated at the highest tolerable dose in
      groups of up to 25 patients. The extension part will be described in an amendment to the
      study protocol later. The number of subjects estimated for this study will depend on the
      number of groups enrolled. The starting dose will be 5 mg given orally as a tablet
      formulation.

             refractory to any standard therapy, have no standard therapy available, or subjects
             must have actively refused any treatment which would be regarded standard, and / or if
             in the judgement of the investigator, experimental treatment is clinically and
