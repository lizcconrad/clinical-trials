  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of intradermal delivery of NP2 on pain
      scores and pain medication usage in subjects with intractable pain due to malignant disease.
      A second purpose is to confirm safety and secondary efficacy measurements.

    <textblock>
      Chronic severe pain remains a significant unmet medical need in patients that have
      progressive cancer. Existing treatments have limited efficacy and also suffer significant
      side effects. This is a multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical
      trial designed to evaluate the impact of intradermal injection of NP2 in subjects who have
      intractable pain due to malignant disease. NP2 is a gene transfer vector engineered to
      express human preproenkephalin, a gene naturally involved in pain control. Delivery of NP2
      directly to the site of pain caused by cancer is intended to provide increased Enkephalin
      peptides, which bind to opioid receptors, that may allow better pain control.
