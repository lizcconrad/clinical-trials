  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients constitute a significant proportion of
      the lung cancer population. The prognosis of these patients has improved over the years due
      the introduction of combined modality treatment, including high-dose chemo-radiotherapy. The
      brain, however, remains one of the major sites of failure. Patients with brain metastasis
      suffer from a variety of neurological, cognitive and emotional difficulties that are known to
      adversely affect the health-related quality of life. Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation (PCI)
      can prevent or delay the development of brain metastasis, and as such can improve
      neurological disease-free survival and consequently health-related quality of life. But
      survival is short, and toxicities are real, as PCI in itself can also induce adverse effects.
      The cognitive adverse effects of PCI are not sufficiently illuminated and documented, due to
      the lack of formal and systematic evaluation in patient populations expected to have short
      survival. Also, recent attempts to reduce cognitive side effects of PCI by the application of
      hippocampal-avoidance PCI in order to prevent memory deficits have not been fully evaluated
      yet.

      Before PCI can be offered routinely to stage III NSCLC patients in daily practice, the costs
      and benefits of this therapy should be investigated properly, to allow for well-informed
      treatment choices.

        Patients will be recruited from 5 hospitals participating in the phase III trial:
        Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation (PCI) versus observation in radically treated patients
        with stage III non-small lung cancer: a phase III randomized study ((NVALT 11/DLCRG-02).
