    <textblock>
      Triclosan containing dentifrices are effective in the prevention of inflammatory
      complications following third molar surgery through reducing preoperative oral bacteria load.

    <textblock>
      This study may provide evidence on the effect of triclosan containing dentifrice on oral
      bacteria and oral inflammation prior to third molar surgery, and on the incidence of
      inflammatory complications after the surgery. If proven effective, dentifrice containing
      triclosan may be recommended prior to tooth extractions and replace antibiotics and other
      antimicrobial products as a prophylactic procedure before oral surgery procedures.
