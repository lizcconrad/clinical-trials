    <time_frame>3 months of wear, lenses replaced daily</time_frame>
    <description>Each eye tested individually while reading a chart distant to the participant in normal lighting. Visual acuity was measured using a Snellen chart, with 20/20 Snellen acuity considered normal distance-eyesight. Visual acuity is reported as the number of eyes achieving 20/20 Snellen acuity or better.</description>

          -  Be of legal age of consent and sign Informed Consent document. If under legal age of
             consent, legally authorized representative must sign Informed Consent document and
             subject must sign Assent document.

          -  Willing and able to wear spherical contact lenses for at least 5 days per week.

          -  Willing and able to wear spherical contact lenses within the available range of powers
             of -1.00 diopter(D) to -6.00D in 0.25D steps.

          -  Best spectacle-corrected visual acuity greater than or equal to 20/25.

          -  Manifest cylinder less than or equal to 0.75D.

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any active anterior segment ocular disease that would contraindicate contact lens
             wear.

          -  Any use of systemic medications for which contact lens wear could be contraindicated
             as determined by the investigator.

          -  History of refractive surgery or irregular cornea.

          -  History of pathologically dry eye.

          -  Eye injury within twelve weeks immediately prior to enrollment for this trial.

          -  Currently enrolled in any clinical trial.

          -  Participation in a contact lens or contact lens care product clinical trial within the
             previous 30 days.

          -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
