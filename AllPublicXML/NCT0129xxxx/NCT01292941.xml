      Intermittent catheterization is the preferred method for emptying the bladder in patients
      with spinal cord injury and neurogenic bladder dysfunction.

      Coloplast have developed a new intermittent catheters. In this investigation this new test
      catheter will be compared with SpeediCat by assessing discomfort and pain associated with
      catheterization of healthy men. The reason for choosing healthy men is that many catheter
      users do not have full feeling in their urethra and therefore can not assess the discomfort.

      55 healthy men who are ≥ 18 years and have no signs of urinary tract infection and do not
      have abnormalities, disease or have had operational interventions in the urinary tract will
      be included. They are recruited through advertisements on the website www.forsoegsperson.dk.
