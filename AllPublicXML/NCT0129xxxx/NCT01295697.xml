  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of EZN-2208
      that can be given to pediatric patients with Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumors. The safety
      of the study drug and its effect on the disease will also be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacokinetic (PK) testing of EZN-2208, will be performed for patients who volunteer. PK
      testing measures the amount of a drug in the body at different time points.

    <description>The study will measure incidence, severity and duration of adverse events graded by NCI CTCAE during first cycle of therapy to determine the MTD.
A Phase 2 Dose will be recommended by study investigators after considering the frequency and severity of adverse events and the ability to maintain dose schedule</description>
