    <textblock>
      MEBO-BPII-001 is a single-center, randomized, standard care-controlled pilot study of
      topically applied MEBO in subjects with partial thickness burns expected to heal in 14 days.
      Twice daily application of MEBO versus standard of care will be evaluated in a parallel
      design. Fourteen subjects will be randomized (7 subjects per treatment arm) to one of two
      treatment groups.
