      The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility, safety, and long-term prognosis
      of pancreas-sparing duodenectomy with regional lymphadenectomy in the treatment of
      early-stage (pTis/pT1/pT2) periampullary carcinoma with or without lymph node metastasis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is commonly used for periampullary carcinoma (PC). In recent
      years, morbidity and mortality rates following PD have decreased, but the operative stress
      induced by pancreatectomy is considerable. Less-invasive surgery should thus be elected for
      PC without pancreatic and diffuse lymph node involvement. From the perspective of
      organ-preserving resection, pancreas-sparing duodenectomy (PSD) represents an attractive
      option for selected periampullary tumors, and offers an alternative to PD.

      Previous reports have described PSD for benign, premalignant and some selected malignant
      conditions of duodenum, and have emphasized this procedure as a safe and effective treatment
      associated with good quality of life. However, use of PSD for PC is still
      controversial.Available data about PSD for PC and published data from the follow-up
      evaluation in the literature are still limited.

      Given the fact that 20%-60% pT1/pT2 patients have regional lymph node metastasis, regional
      lymph node dissection should be essential for PC. However, lymphadenectomy has never been
      promoted as a regular procedure of PSD.The aim of the present study was to investigate the
      feasibility, safety, and long-term results of PSD with regional lymphadenectomy for
      early-stage (pTis/pT1/pT2) periampullary cancers.

    <description>Pancreas-sparing duodenectomy for periampullary carcinoma is defined as resection of the descending segment of duodenum; resection of papilla of Vater; reimplantation of bile and pancreatic ducts and reconstruction of duodenum.The Japan Pancreatic Society (JPS) system for numbering of lymph node stations was adopted for accurate description of the surgery and pathological assessment.The standard lymph node groups removed as part of PSD were the anterior pancreatoduodenal groups (JPS LN17), the posterior pancreatoduodenal groups (JPS LN13), the dextroinferior nodes of the hepatoduodenal ligament node groups (JPS LN12), the infrapyloric node (JPS LN6), the nodes around the anterior aspect of the common hepatic artery (JPS LN8) and the nodes on the right side of the SMA (JPS LN14).</description>

    <description>The surgical technique used for standard PD has been described before. Standard PD included clearance of all soft tissues and lymphatics immediately to the left of the superior mesenteric artery, as well as removal of the lymphoareolar tissue along the proximal hepatic artery.</description>
