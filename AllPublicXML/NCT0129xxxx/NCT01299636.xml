      This trial intends to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended dose, to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability, to determine the pharmacokinetics and to evaluate the
      antitumor activity of PM060184 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>MTD (maximum tolerated dose) and RD (recommended dose) of PM060184.</measure>
    <time_frame>From treatment onset to end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose (RD) of PM060184 administered on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle intravenously (i.v.) over 10 minutes to patients with advanced solid tumors.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in patients who have advanced solid tumors.</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples will be collected up to 48 hours after the first infusion. At the RD, 24-h urine collection samples and 15 additional blood samples up to 48 hours after the second infusion of the first cycle.</time_frame>
    <description>The complete plasma concentration-time profiles of PM06184 will be analyzed by standard non-compartmental methods.The percent of PM060184 total dose excreted unchanged into the urine over the collection interval will be calculated from the urine samples.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Antitumor activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Every six weeks while on treatment. Patients who discontinued treatment without disease progression will be followed every three months until disease progression, other antitumor therapy, death or until the end-of-study date, whichever occurs first.</time_frame>
    <description>Antitumor activity will be measured according to the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) version 1.1 or by evaluation of tumor markers</description>
