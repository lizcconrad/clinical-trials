  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to find out if tablets containing extended release (ER) niacin,
      laropiprant, and simvastatin (ERN/LRPT/SIM) are as effective as tablets containing ER niacin
      and laropiprant taken with simvastatin tablets (ERN/LRPT + SIM) for lowering high cholesterol
      and high lipid levels in the blood. The primary hypothesis is that ERN/LRPT/SIM 2 g/40 mg is
      equivalent to ERN/LRPT 2 g co-administered with simvastatin 40 mg in reducing low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Low-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 4 for Period II; Week 12 for Period III) and after 8 weeks of treatment (Week 12 for Period II and Week 20 for Period III)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were taken at baseline (Week 4 for Period II; Week 12 for Period III) and after 8 weeks of treatment (Week 12 for Period II and Week 20 for Period III) to determine the LDL-C levels. The change from baseline after 8 weeks of treatment was recorded.
Results from recent studies indicated that the combination tablet formulations used in the study did not meet the pre-specified pharmacokinetic bounds used to establish the equivalence of the combination tablet (MK-0524B; ERN/LRPT/SIM) to the coadministration of MK-0524A (ERN/LRPT) and SIM. Therefore, efficacy data were not analyzed, as the study was stopped early. Only safety data were evaluated.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced at Least 1 Hepatitis-related Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>up 20 weeks (12 weeks in Periods I/II and 8 weeks in Period III)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which was temporally associated with the use of the product, was also an AE. Hepatitis-related AEs were identified by a collective review using the following pre-specified set of preferred terms: cholestasis, hepatic necrosis, hepatocellular damage, cytolytic hepatitis, hepatitis, hepatomegaly, jaundice, hepatic failure, hepatitis cholestatic, jaundice cholestatic, hepatitis fulminant, hyperbilirubinaemia, jaundice hepatocellular, ocular icterus, yellow skin, hepatic function abnormal, acute hepatic failure, subacute hepatic failure, hepatitis acute, hepatitis toxic, hepatotoxicity, and mixed hepatocellular-cholestatic injury.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were taken at baseline (Week 4 for Period II; Week 12 for Period III) and after 8 weeks of treatment (Week 12 for Period II and Week 20 for Period III) to determine the LDL-C levels. The change from baseline after 8 weeks of treatment was recorded.
Results from recent studies indicated that the combination tablet formulations used in the study did not meet the pre-specified pharmacokinetic bounds used to establish the equivalence of the combination tablet (MK-0524B; ERN/LRPT/SIM) to the coadministration of MK-0524A (ERN/LRPT) and SIM. Therefore, efficacy data were not analyzed, as the study was stopped early. Only safety data were evaluated.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which was temporally associated with the use of the product, was also an AE. Hepatitis-related AEs were identified by a collective review using the following pre-specified set of preferred terms: cholestasis, hepatic necrosis, hepatocellular damage, cytolytic hepatitis, hepatitis, hepatomegaly, jaundice, hepatic failure, hepatitis cholestatic, jaundice cholestatic, hepatitis fulminant, hyperbilirubinaemia, jaundice hepatocellular, ocular icterus, yellow skin, hepatic function abnormal, acute hepatic failure, subacute hepatic failure, hepatitis acute, hepatitis toxic, hepatotoxicity, and mixed hepatocellular-cholestatic injury.</description>
