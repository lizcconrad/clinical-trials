        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects above 35 years inclusive are re-evaluated for the risks of using of a COC

          -  Body Mass Index between 18.5 and 30.0 kg/m2, inclusive

          -  On oral contraceptive with 30ʯg ethinyl estradiol (EE) plus either 125ʯg or 150ʯg
             levonorgestrel (LNG) for at least three months prior to date of randomization and well
             tolerated

          -  During the study the subject is willing to use 1 of the 3 following contraceptive
             methods: diaphragm with spermicide, intrauterine device or partner is using condoms in
             combination with a spermicidal cream

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded from participation if any of the following apply:

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to YM178 or any components of the formulation used

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding within 6 months before screening assessment

          -  Any of the liver function tests (i.e. ALT, AST and Alkaline phosphatase) above the
             upper limit of normal

             pressure &gt;90 mmHg (blood pressure measurements taken in triplicate after subject has
             been resting in supine position for 5 min; pulse will be measured automatically)

             Clinical Unit

          -  Positive test for drugs of abuse or positive alcohol test on the day of admission into
             the clinical unit

          -  History of smoking more than 10 cigarettes (or equivalent amount of tobacco) per day
             within 3 months prior to admission to the Clinical Unit

          -  Participation in any clinical study within 3 months or participation in more than 3
             clinical studies within 12 months, prior to the expected date of enrolment into the
