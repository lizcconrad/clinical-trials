  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apart from brain tumors, Neuroblastoma is the most common solid tumor during childhood. About
      50% of the cases present at diagnosis with factors of bad prognosis. During the last two
      decades, despite increased therapeutic intensity during induction and consolidation of
      high-risk neuroblastomas, the 5 year overall survival of high risk neuroblastoma remains in
      between 30 to 40% depending on studies.

      Besides strategies of high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous transplantation of
      hematopoietic stem cells, and differentiating molecules (retinoids), immunotherapy will
      become one of the leading anti-neuroblastoma targeted therapy. No therapeutic strategies or
      molecules obtained such gains of survival ever before.

      Studying the immune system of children with neuroblastoma at diagnosis and during their
      treatment will help us to determine when we should test active or passive immunotherapy
      strategies. Moreover, this study would allow us to specify the cause of tumor immune
      tolerance in neuroblastoma, on which we have few data in comparison to adult tumors.

      This will be a multicentric, pilot, prospective, open, study that will not require unusual
      diagnostic interventions. This study will be transversal (all neuroblastoma stages included)
      in order to determine comparative criteria between low and high risk neuroblastoma. It will
      also be longitudinal (from diagnosis to post-treatment follow-up) in order to specify
      evolutionary aspects of immunity under radio-chemotherapy and retinoic acid therapy.

      Immunological analyses will be done on blood, bone marrow and tumor samples, at diagnosis,
      and during the treatment of children diagnosed for neuroblastoma (up to 3 time points). These
      types of samples are routinely done during conventional neuroblastoma treatment.

      The main objective of the study is the description of immune effectors in the blood, marrow
      and tumor diagnosis.

      During 3 years, this trial will include 30 children from pediatric oncology units of Lyon,
      Saint-Etienne, Grenoble and Clermont-Ferrand.

      The study duration is 5 years. Children follow-up scheduled for at least 2 years in order to
      determine predictive factors of therapeutic efficiency and survival.

      Multi-parametric marker sets (6-8 markers per sample) have already developed and validated
      for analyzing the absolute amount and proportion of immune subpopulations (B, TCD4+, TCD8+,
      Treg, NK, DC) and activation status (PD1, ICOS, CD39, CD73, CD62L, CCR7, CD45RO, CD45RA,
      CD86, Ox40, CD137, CTLA4) on a small volume. At least, these analyses will be performed on
      each blood and marrow sample. If the amount of blood and mononuclear cells harvested allows
      it, functional analyses will be undertaken (intracytoplasmic cytokines in response to
      activation for T, DC, NK; protocols been set up).

      Immunostainings will be performed on tumor samples at diagnosis and after resection of the
      primary tumor, in order to determine the expression and evolution of several immunomodulatory
      molecules on neuroblastoma cells (HLA class I &amp; II, HLA-G, IDO, IL10,…)., and also determine
      the immune infiltrate within the tumor microenvironment (lymphocytes Treg, cellules
      dendritiques, MDSC,…). The techniques used will mostly be those of classical immunology (IHC,
      IF, FACS), and have already been set-up in our INSERM team for adult tumors.

      Children's plasma will be screened for specific anti-tumor immunoglobulins at diagnosis and
      at key treatment time points. In the meanwhile, levels of circulating cytokines
      concentrations will be evaluated by Luminex, especially those known to have inhibitory
      effects on immune effectors: IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, TGF-beta, HLA-Gs, TNF-alpha, IFN-gama,
      IL-2, IL-12, IL-27, IL-17 and CD40L (already in place).
