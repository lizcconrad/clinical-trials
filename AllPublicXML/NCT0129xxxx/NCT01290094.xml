  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm, open label study will assess the efficacy and safety of and compliance to
      treatment with Bonviva/Boniva (ibandronate) in biphosphonate-naïve patients with
      post-menopausal osteoporosis. Patients will receive Bonviva/Boniva at a dose of 3 mg
      intravenously every three months. Anticipated time on study treatment is 12 months with a
      follow-up of 12 months.

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Lumbar Spine T-score at Month 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12, Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change was calculated as [(measure at time &quot;t&quot; - measure at baseline)/measure at baseline]*100, where t=12 and 24 months. The baseline value is used as a reference to calculate the relative change from baseline. T-score is the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for a healthy 30 year old adult of the same sex and ethnicity as the participant. A T-score with above -1 is normal bone density level. A T-score between -1 and -2.5 means that the bone density is below normal and it might be a sign of an osteopenia and may also lead into osteoporosis. A T-score below -2.5 indicates osteoporosis. A T-score below -2.5 in combination with a prevalent fracture indicates serious osteoporosis.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Lumbar Spine T-score at Month 12 and 24</title>
        <description>Percent change was calculated as [(measure at time &quot;t&quot; - measure at baseline)/measure at baseline]*100, where t=12 and 24 months. The baseline value is used as a reference to calculate the relative change from baseline. T-score is the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for a healthy 30 year old adult of the same sex and ethnicity as the participant. A T-score with above -1 is normal bone density level. A T-score between -1 and -2.5 means that the bone density is below normal and it might be a sign of an osteopenia and may also lead into osteoporosis. A T-score below -2.5 indicates osteoporosis. A T-score below -2.5 in combination with a prevalent fracture indicates serious osteoporosis.</description>
