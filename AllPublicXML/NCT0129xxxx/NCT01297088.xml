  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted as an open label, single-center, single dose and biodistribution
      study in patients with cancer or inflammation. 56 patients will be selected among the
      patients undergoing the screening examination conducted within 3 weeks before drug
      administration. Single dose of the study drug will be administrated in a dose of 300 MBq to
      these patients. The follow-up period contains the end-of-study telephone interview 5-8 days
      following the treatment. Key measurements are the PET/CT image acquisitions within a time
      frame of about 2 hours after the single injection of BAY86-9596.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cancer Patients

               -  Patient had an Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography
                  (PET)/Computer tomography(CT) performed 14 days prior to treatment with
                  BAY86-9596 for detection, or staging, or restaging, or therapy response
                  assessment that still showed tumor mass with high certainty, for cancers such as

                    -  Colorectal cancer,

                    -  Breast cancer (female patients),

                    -  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the cancers under colorectal cancer to
                       hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are histologically confirmed (Exception,
                       based on diagnostic criteria for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma:
                       Histological diagnosis of hepatocelluar carcinoma is not necessary if the
                       nodule is larger than 2 cm, has been visualized in two dynamic imaging
                       studies and shows arterial hyperenhancement and washes out in the venous
                       phase.)

               -  Patient has prostate cancer (primary or recurrent), still shows tumor mass
                  (primary tumor and/or lymph node metastasis and/or distant metastasis) and the
                  primary cancer disease is histologically confirmed

               -  Patient has brain metastasis (strong evidence from imaging modalities), and the
                  primary cancer disease is histologically confirmed.

               -  Patient has a primary malignant brain tumor which is either confirmed by
                  histology, or a positive cytology of cerebrospinal fluid, or imaging modalities
                  (such as MRI, CT) strongly support the diagnosis of brain tumor.

               -  Patient has some other cancer (such as ovarian cancer, melanoma), preferably with
                  an FDG PET/CT available, and the primary cancer is histologically confirmed.

          -  Inflammation Patients

               -  Patient with inflammatory disease having inflammatory focus/foci. An FDG PET/CT
                  of the inflammation is available.

               -  Patient underwent FDG PET/CT during the inflammation. The maximum interval
                  between FDG PET/CT and examination with BAY86-9596 is 5 days, performance of both
                  examinations on two subsequent days is recommended.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled and/or unstable medical disease other than
             cancer or inflammation (e.g. poorly controlled diabetes, congestive heart failure,
             myocardial infarction within 12 months prior to planned injection of BAY86-9596,
             unstable and uncontrolled hypertension, severe pulmonary disease, chronic renal or
             hepatic disease which could compromise participation in the study. When considering
             hepatic function in hepatocellular cancer patients, the Child-Pugh score is applied, a
             score &gt; 7 will be considered an exclusion criterion.

          -  Known sensitivity to the study drug or components of the preparation

          -  Drug abuse/dependence or history of recovered alcohol dependence.

          -  Patient has completed participation in another clinical study involving administration
             of an investigational drug in the preceding 4 weeks or is participating in any other
             clinical trial during this study

          -  Previous participation in treatment phase in this study

          -  Unwillingness or inability to comply with the protocol

          -  Patient fulfils criteria which in the opinion of the investigator preclude
             participation for scientific reasons, for reasons of compliance, or for reasons of the
             patient's safety.

          -  Patients with inflammatory disease with known tumor where images of tumor lesions may
             overlap with inflammatory lesions, or tumor patients with known inflammatory diseases
             (e.g. autoimmune diseases), where images of inflammatory lesions may overlap with
             tumor lesions.
