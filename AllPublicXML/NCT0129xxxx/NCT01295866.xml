    <textblock>
      Nitric oxide (NO) was considered as a mediator of nasal inflammation and the measurement of
      nasal nitric oxide (nNO) may assist in the diagnosis of nasal inflammation. Few data exists
      comparing nNO with established, larger accepted reference standard for chronic rhinosinusitis
      (CRS) diagnosis. Moreover, the role of atopic status on nNO in nasal inflammatory diseases
      has not been reported. The aim of our study was to determine the value of nNO in patients
      with chronic nasal inflammation, and to assess the relationship between nNO and atopic status
      in these patients. A total of 131 randomized patients suffering form chronic nonallergic
      nasal inflammation and 20 healthy volunteers were finally recruited. nNO was measured by NIOX
      devices. Sinus computed tomography (CT) scan, nasal endoscope and nasal symptoms evaluation
      were used in the different diagnosis of chronic rhinitis (CR), CRS without nasal polyps
      (CRSsNP) and CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Atopic status was confirmed by skin prick test
      and serum IgE levels. Blood eosinophils were evaluated simultaneously. Relationships among
      nNO, various atopic characteristics and chronic nasal inflammation were evaluated.

        Patients were prospectively recruited from the Rhinology Clinics of the Otolaryngology,
        Head and Neck Surgery Department of Beijing TongRen Hospital from January 2010 to November
        2010. After application of the exclusion criteria, the study was discussed with 410
        consecutive patients with a primary diagnosis of chronic nonallergic nasal inflammation. Of
        these, 214 agreed to take part in, of which 83 were excluded (57 diagnosed as other nasal
        diseases such as fungal sinusitis, inverted papilloma and so on, 20 with obviously medicine
        history in the latest two weeks, and 6 refused to continue). Thus, 131 patients were
        randomized for inclusion and 20 normal adults were recruited as well in our study.
