      The Cancer Survivor Registry: The Breast Cancer M.A.P. (Mind Affects the Physical) Project
      was the first registry of its kind to look at the emotional and social needs of individuals
      diagnosed with breast cancer and track how their needs changed throughout their cancer
      journey. Data will raise awareness and help develop programs to address the needs of breast
      cancer survivors. Findings from the Registry are disseminated online at
      www.CancerSupportCommunity.org/RegistryIndexReport2017
