      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Levetiracetam dry syrup at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day or
      3000 mg/day used as adjunctive therapy in Japanese pediatric patients aged ≥4 to &lt;16 years
      with uncontrolled Generalized Tonic-Clonic (GTC) seizures despite treatment with 1 or 2

    <measure>The Percent Change From the Combined Baseline (4-week Retrospective Baseline and 4-week Prospective Baseline) in the Generalized Tonic-clonic Seizure Frequency Per Week Over the 24-week Treatment Period (Up-Titration and Evaluation Periods)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week -8) to Treatment Period (Week 0 to Week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>The percent change from Combined Baseline over Treatment Period was calculated from the Generalized Tonic-Clonic (GTC) seizure frequency per week during the Treatment Period (T) and during the Baseline Period (B, Combined Baseline, ie, Retrospective and Prospective Baseline Periods) using the equation below.
The percent change from Baseline = (B - T)/B x 100
The seizure frequency per week was calculated using the following formula:
Frequency per week of GTC seizures = total number of GTC seizures in the corresponding period / number of days for observation in the corresponding period x 7</description>

    <description>The percent change from Combined Baseline over Evaluation Period was calculated from the Generalized Tonic-Clonic (GTC) seizure frequency per week during the Evaluation Period (E) and during the Baseline Period (B, Combined Baseline, ie, Retrospective and Prospective Baseline Periods) using the equation below.
The percent change from Baseline = (B - E)/B x 100

        <title>The Percent Change From the Combined Baseline (4-week Retrospective Baseline and 4-week Prospective Baseline) in the Generalized Tonic-clonic Seizure Frequency Per Week Over the 24-week Treatment Period (Up-Titration and Evaluation Periods)</title>
        <description>The percent change from Combined Baseline over Treatment Period was calculated from the Generalized Tonic-Clonic (GTC) seizure frequency per week during the Treatment Period (T) and during the Baseline Period (B, Combined Baseline, ie, Retrospective and Prospective Baseline Periods) using the equation below.
The percent change from Baseline = (B - T)/B x 100
The seizure frequency per week was calculated using the following formula:
Frequency per week of GTC seizures = total number of GTC seizures in the corresponding period / number of days for observation in the corresponding period x 7</description>
