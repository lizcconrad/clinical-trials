  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary evidence attests to the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions in
      reducing symptoms associated with a variety of medical and psychological conditions. However,
      research progress has been hampered by discrepancies in how mindfulness has been
      operationalized, assessed, and practiced. Existing contemporary assessments of mindfulness
      were developed exclusively by Western scientists and have exhibited questionable validity,
      particularly among diverse cultural groups. Operational definitions of mindfulness are
      essential for the development of valid measures, which in turn are necessary for
      investigating the mechanisms of change in mindfulness-based interventions. Therefore, the
      overall goal of this study is to create a mindfulness measure that is informed by the
      experience of mindfulness experts - Theravāda, Tibetan, and Zen Buddhist clergy and lay
      practitioners. To do so, this study will employ the preliminary phases of the sequential
      exploratory mixed methods for instrument design model. The first phase will involve
      conducting open-ended interviews with Theravāda, Tibetan, and Zen Buddhist clergy and lay
      practitioners to ascertain expert information on mindfulness and closely related Buddhist
      concepts. This qualitative process allows the experts to define the phenomena of interest
      (i.e., addresses issues of validity). In the second phase, the investigators will use the
      themes and specific phrases evoked during the qualitative interviews to develop items for a
      draft closed-ended self-report measure of mindfulness. Following completion of the research
      outlined in this proposal, the investigators will submit a subsequent proposal to thoroughly
      evaluate the psychometric properties of our draft mindfulness questionnaire in a variety of
      different cultures and contexts. This measure can be beneficial in clinical research by
      helping to elucidate the mechanisms of change in mindfulness-based psychotherapies in the
      United States and equally so in other cultures such as Thailand, where mindfulness and other
      Buddhist practices have already been integrated into mainstream mental health treatment.
      Therefore, our aim is to create a measure that can help improve the assessment and clinical
      use of mindfulness.
