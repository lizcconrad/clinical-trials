      RATIONALE: Hepatitis B antigen peptide (HBsAg) vaccine may help the body build an immune
      response and help prevent hepatitis B. PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies edible HBsAg
      vaccine therapy in healthy participants who have undergone previous vaccination.

      OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of orally delivered
      HBsAg that is formulated as an expressed protein in transgenic potato tubers (HBV-EPV) at
      different doses and schedules. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. ARM
      I: Participants consume placebo HBV-EPV on days 0, 14, 28, and 56. ARM II: Participants
      consume HBV-EPV expressing HBsAg on days 0 and 28 and placebo HBV-EPV on days 14 and 56. ARM
      III: Participants consume HBV-EPV expressing HBsAg on days 0, 28, and 56 and placebo HBV-EPV
      on day 14. ARM IV: Participants consume HBV-EPV expressing HBsAg on days 0, 14, 28, and 56.
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 70, 84, 98, and 114.
