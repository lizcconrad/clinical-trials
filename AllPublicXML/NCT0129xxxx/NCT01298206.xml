  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pandemic A/H1N1 virus was named &quot;swine flu&quot; when the current outbreak started. Although
      it is not yet confirmed that the index case acquired the virus from pigs, the nomenclature
      &quot;swine flu&quot; was due to the fact that the virus is triple-reassortant with genes from swine,
      avian, and human influenza origins. A total of 57,809 cases were reported in the WHO EMRO
      region, 693 of whom have died (1.2% case fatality). Lebanon had 1,838 confirmed cases with 5
      deaths, it is estimated that 4% of these cases required hospitalization. Most cases of
      pandemic influenza presented with fever, cough, and sore throat. Other common symptoms
      included myalgia, headache, and rhinorrhea. The pandemic A/H1N1 virus appears to be very
      successful at human-to-human transmission. It is also causing infections beyond the
      traditional seasonal variation of previous human influenza viruses. Unlike seasonal influenza
      viruses that usually cause severe infections requiring hospitalization among the elderly and
      children under 5 years old, the pandemic A/H1N1 viruses are causing more severe illness among
      young adults. Several reports have associated certain underlying conditions with severe
      illness. Such conditions were pregnancy, asthma, diabetes, obesity, and heart disease.

      This study will measure risk and protective factors associated with pandemic A/H1N1
      infection. This study will also be able to estimate risk factors for severe illness requiring
      hospitalization or leading to death. These factors are: travel history, exposure to other
      confirmed or suspected cases, obesity, pregnancy, influenza vaccination history, residency in
      nursing homes, attendance of daycares, tobacco use, and other comorbidities (pulmonary
      diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, renal insufficiency). Unlike other descriptive
      studies, this analytical case-control study will enable to accurately measure the strength of
      association between potential risk factors and outcome. By isolating viruses from specimens
      collected from cases, this study will be able to characterize these viruses and document any
      genetic mutations or antiviral resistance.

      The main objectives of this study are:

        1. To investigate the risk factors of infection with the pandemic A/H1N1 viruses.

        2. To characterize influenza viruses causing infection.

        3. If enough severe cases were enrolled to make it statistically feasible, this study will
           investigate the risk factors of severe illness or death associated with infection with
           the pandemic A/H1N1 viruses.

    <description>For every enrolled H1N1 case, the study will enroll 2 sex matched controls. On the date of enrollment of a case, 2 sex-matched controls will be located from the same clinic from which the case was enrolled. Enrolled controls will then be verified to be free from influenza infection at the time of enrollment by RT-PCR.</description>

    <description>A swab will be collected from cases to verify presence of pandemic influenza. Testing positive for influenza A/H1N1 by RT PCR to be enrolled will be confirmed as a case. The participant will be presented with a questionnaire that will capture exposure data through a group of variables assessing underlying health conditions, symptoms, use of influenza vaccine, travel, occupational setting, and other demographic variables. Cases will be contacted once during the study.</description>

        Cases will be selected from the outpatient clinics and inpatient units at American
        Univeristy of Beirut thus the study team expect that selection bias would be minimal.
        Confirmed cases attending other healthcare facilities for whom contact information is
        available, will be contacted and invited to participate in this study. Controls will be
        selected from the outpatient clinics and inpatient units of the Internal Medicine, Family
        Medicine, and Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine Departments at AUBMC. Cases and controls
        attending the hospital will be from the same catchment area, thus coming from the same
        geographical areas, have similar socioeconomic status, and have similar chances of exposure
        to influenza viruses. Other influenza case control studies have matched on sex and enrolled
        hospital-based controls.
