        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          2. Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          3. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
                  spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;147
                  pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose
                  menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception
                  methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.
                  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal
                  status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 week will
                  elapse between the cessation of HRT and the blood draw; this interval depends on
                  the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal
                  status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a
                  contraceptive method.

               -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed
                  in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product
                  label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the
                  risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception
                  until after the follow-up visit and completion of all follow-up assessments or at
                  least 7 days after study drug administration, whichever is longer.

          4. Body weight greater than or equal to 50 kg and BMI less than or equal to 31 kg/m2.

          5. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          6. QTcB or QTcF &lt; 450 msec; or QTcB or QTcF &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch
             Block.

          7. AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin greater than or equal to 1.5xULN
             (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct
             bilirubin &lt;35%).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has a positive pre-study drug screen. A minimum list of drugs that will be
             screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids and
             benzodiazepines.

          2. A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening.

          3. A positive test for HIV antibody.

          4. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          5. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as:

               -  an average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males or &gt;14 units for females. One
                  unit is equivalent to 8 g of alcohol: a half-pint (~240 ml) of beer, 1 glass (125
                  ml) of wine or 1 (25 ml) measure of spirits.

          6. Smoking or regular use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products within 2 weeks
             prior to screening.

          7. Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

          8. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          9. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (if the clinic
             uses heparin to maintain intravenous cannula patency).

         10. Pregnant females as determined by positive serum or urine hCG test at screening or
             prior to dosing.

         11. Lactating females.

         12. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

         13. Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

         14. Consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice and/or
             pummelos, exotic citrus fruits, grapefruit hybrids or fruit juices from 7 days prior
             to the first dose of study medication.

         15. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

         16. Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

         17. Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.
