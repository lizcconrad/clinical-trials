  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to study the effect of early NEuroMuscular EXercise (NEMEX) versus
      conventional treatment (late exercise) in patients with acute non-operative achilles tendon
      rupture (ATR).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no consensus on treatment for achilles tendon rupture with regard to
      surgical or non-surgical treatment. In addition, the optimal time to start exercise treatment
      after the injury, with or without surgery, is not well understood. Animal studies show
      positive effects of early mobilization in tendon healing. Neuromuscular exercise has shown
      better effects than strength exercise in people with knee injury or knee disease. There are
      few studies in humans focusing on exercise as treatment, without surgical intervention, after
      ATR.

    <description>30 patients are randomized to early neuromuscular exercise (n=15) or treatment as usual, i.e., late exercise (n=15). Both groups are given an orthosis and are instructed to wear this for eight weeks. The experimental group starts with a structured exercise program one week after the diagnosis. The patients attend one training session/week during eight weeks, guided by a physical therapist. The level of training is progressed during this time. The patients in the control group (treatment as usual) are given exercise instructions and information at one occasion; 2 weeks after diagnosis. Both groups are followed up, by a blinded assessor, with valid and reliable self-reported and physical function outcomes at 1, 4, 8 and 16 weeks after injury.</description>
