      The objective of the study is to assess mechanical strength and function in subjects
      undergoing Musculotendinous Tissue Unit Repair and Reinforcement (MTURR) with the use of
      biologic scaffolds for the restoration of both mechanical strength and function in these
      subjects. This study formally evaluated healing and return of function after an extracellular
      matrix device implantation in 17 male and female subjects participating at the University of
      Pittsburgh under the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery who suffer from injury
      with loss of skeletal muscle tissue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Loss of musculotendinous tissue as a result of trauma inevitably leads to severe morbidity
      for the subject and surgical challenges for the caregiver. The reconstruction of tissue
      following such injuries is often not possible and surgical options are extremely limited.
      Amputation of the affected limb is not an uncommon outcome. Free muscle grafts, pedicle
      grafts, and the use of prosthetic materials have all been attempted when primary repair is
      not possible due to loss of tissue domain. The results of such efforts are typically
      disheartening. If autologous grafts are used, donor site morbidity compounds the post
      surgical problems with resultant diminished quality of life. Stated differently, the existing
      treatment options for treatment of the loss of large amounts of skeletal muscle tissue with
      scarring are extremely limited because the existing tendon structures are damaged and lack
      strength. A Repair and Reinforcement approach with a biocompatible device would represent a
      paradigm shift in the treatment of traumatic tissue injury. This approach involves releasing
      scar tissue that constricts movement of the existing tendon, repairing damaged tendon and
      musculotendinous units with suture repair, and reinforcing the repair with a biologic
      scaffold material. The biologic scaffold is composed of animal derived collagen and the
      approved by the FDA as devices for reinforcement of soft tissues repaired by sutures or
      suture anchors, during tendon repair surgery.&quot; Additionally, as listed in the FDA 510k
      approval, these devices&quot; provide a remodelable scaffold that is replaced by the subject's own
      soft tissues.&quot; These biologic materials fall into a category of implantable devices known as
      extracellular matrix (ECM) because they are composed of proteins that surround the cellular
      elements in mammals. No living cells are found in these ECM implantable devices. ECM devices
      are made by many commercial manufacturers and have been used for a variety of reconstructive
      surgical procedures for years. Because the ECM implant becomes populated with subject cells
      and blood vessels, the repair may be stronger and the new tissue growing within the device
      could possibly contribute to improved function by augmenting the tendon structure and
      allowing ingrowth of adjacent muscle fibers. The objective of the study is to assess
      mechanical strength and function in subjects undergoing Musculotendinous Tissue Unit Repair
      and Reinforcement (MTURR) with the use of biologic scaffolds for the restoration of both
      mechanical strength and function in these subjects. This study evaluated healing and return
      of function after an extracellular matrix device implantation in 17 male and female subjects
      participating at the University of Pittsburgh under the Department of Plastic Surgery who
      suffer from injury with loss of skeletal muscle tissue.

    <description>The secondary objective is to examine the cellular properties of the biopsy tissue material in each subject for future correlation with clinical outcomes. Seven biopsy samples were collected and stained with Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and Masson's trichrome stain. Tissue was stained with antibodies against the progenitor cell markers CD146 and NG2 to show evidence of progenitor cell migration into the remodeling injury site.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with the following characteristics will be eligible to participate in the
             study:

               -  Age: 18 to 70 years of age and able to provide informed consent

               -  Civilian, and current or former military personnel are eligible to participate

               -  Have suffered injury resulting in a structural deficit of a minimum of 20% of the
                  muscle group mass and a functional deficit of a minimum of 25% when compared to
                  the contralateral limb; or if bilateral injury is present to extremities, the
                  potential surgical extremity is to be compared against normal expected values of
                  a sample population of similar age and gender, and evidence of remaining tendon
                  and musculotendinous units that could be surgically repaired with sutures.

               -  Injuries may encompass a single muscle belly or compartment. Whether an area is
                  expected to be repaired by sutures will be determined from imaging studies and
                  physical examination.

               -  Have suffered traumatic injury within the last 18 months to the upper and/or
                  lower extremity; Target of 18 months or less but subject's may be enrolled with
                  injury outside this range if the principal investigator determines that there is
                  viable muscle in the injured compartment determined by clinical exam and imaging
                  studies.

               -  Eligible for study procedures 3 months post injury with stability determined by
                  the Principal Investigator and/ or MD Co-Investigator

               -  Willing and able to comply with follow up examinations, radiographic studies,
                  physical therapy, muscle biopsy and laboratory tests.

               -  Chronic disease such as congestive heart failure, liver disease, renal disease,
                  or diabetes

               -  Active and unstable disease state or infection anywhere in the body per MD's
                  evaluation and determination (demonstrated by stated or medical record history
                  and abnormal lab range for CBC with Differential and Platelet, and chemistry
                  panel values)

               -  Known coagulopathy (demonstrated by stated or medical record history of
                  diagnosis)

               -  Pregnancy (demonstrated by a positive result of a urine pregnancy test)

               -  Diagnosis of cancer within last 12 months and /or actively receiving chemotherapy
                  or radiation treatment

                  found to be stable on medication and receive psychiatric clearance could be
                  eligible for study participation per the Physician's discretion

               -  Subjects with complete muscle/tendon gaps greater than 5 cm that are obvious on
                  imaging studies and are unlikely to be reasonably repaired with sutures and
                  reinforcement, and will be excluded.

        <description>The secondary objective is to examine the cellular properties of the biopsy tissue material in each subject for future correlation with clinical outcomes. Seven biopsy samples were collected and stained with Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and Masson’s trichrome stain. Tissue was stained with antibodies against the progenitor cell markers CD146 and NG2 to show evidence of progenitor cell migration into the remodeling injury site.</description>
