    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the effect of Epoetin Alfa (Procrit) on the
      change in hemoglobin (red blood cell count) in anemic kidney transplant recipients. The
      investigators hypothesize that epoetin alfa will raise hemoglobin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anemia has become an increasingly recognized problem in kidney transplant recipients, and
      erythropoietin is often prescribed as treatment despite limited data regarding outcomes.
      Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated correction of anemia with erythropoietin in
      patients with chronic kidney disease (pre-transplant) and patients on dialysis. No large
      clinical trials of erythropoietin treatment have been done in anemic kidney transplant
      recipients, however. The investigators hypothesize that when used for the treatment of
      post-transplant anemia, Epoetin Alfa increases hemoglobin (Hb). The investigators further
      hypothesize that Epoetin Alfa suppresses pathogenic alloimmunity directed at the kidney
      transplant and as a consequence, prevents immune-mediated injury and thereby preserves renal
      function. Finally, the investigators hypothesize that treatment of post-transplant anemia
      with Epoetin Alfa also results in improved patient-reported outcomes (quality of life) and
      decreased left ventricular mass. In order to test these hypotheses, the investigators propose
      a randomized controlled trial of Epoetin Alfa in anemic kidney transplant recipients (9.0 &lt;
      Hb &lt; 11.0). 100 study subjects will be randomized to either treatment with Epoetin Alfa at a
      starting dose of 150 units/kg/week or no treatment (50 subjects/arm). The primary outcome of
      change in Hb will be measured by CBC at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year of
      enrollment. Secondary outcomes to be measured include change in renal function (eGFR), change
      in T cell phenotype, change in patient-reported outcomes (SF-36 form), and change in left
      ventricular mass (by cardiac MRI).
