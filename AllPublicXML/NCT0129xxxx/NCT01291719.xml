    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the use of a counterbalancing system of glucose and
      insulin infusion with frequent blood glucose monitoring and combined adaptive algorithm can
      produce tight glycemic control without hypoglycemia; study to develop a closed loop for use
      in intensive care units and surgery

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is using an experimental design outpatient with individuals having treatment using
      an automated closed loop glucose control unit; glucoses are measured every 5 minutes using a
      intravenous glucose sensor and infusion of glucose and insulin are altered without manual
      intervention as directed by algorithm
