  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with an experimental drug called
      YF476 in patients with Barrett's esophagus reduces the expression of tissue markers that are
      associated with an increased risk of developing esophageal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The association between gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) and cancer of the esophagus
      is well-established. Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a condition in which the lining of the part
      of the esophagus changes to look like small intestine, and this change occurs in the setting
      of GERD. Patients with BE are at increased risk for developing esophageal cancer. It is
      recommended that all patients with BE take medicines called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs),
      which greatly reduce the acid produced by the stomach, in the hopes of reducing the risk of
      esophageal cancer. However, by reducing the acid level in the stomach, levels of a hormone
      called gastrin are increased. There is laboratory data to suggest that gastrin may have
      effects that actually promote the development of cancer, including esophageal cancer. The
      investigators previously showed that BE patients with very high gastrin levels are more
      likely to have either advanced precancerous changes (also called high grade dysplasia) or
      cancer of the esophagus. As such, the obvious question is raised: does gastrin promote the
      development of cancer in BE? YF476 is a new drug that blocks the effects of gastrin. Trials
      in healthy subjects have demonstrated that the drug is safe and well-tolerated. The
      investigators therefore propose to conduct a randomized placebo-controlled trial of YF476 in
      patients with Barrett's esophagus. The primary hypothesis is that treatment with YF476 will
      reduce the expression of tissue markers that are associated with an increased risk of
      developing esophageal cancer.
