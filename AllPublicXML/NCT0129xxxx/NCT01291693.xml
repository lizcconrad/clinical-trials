  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether motivation-tailored alcohol interventions are
      more effective when delivered by person or by computer-generated feedback letters. A sample
      of 920 general hospital inpatients with risky drinking will be recruited through a
      computerized screening procedure. Patients with more severe alcohol problems will be excluded
      from the study. Participants will be allocated by time frame randomization to one of three
      study arms: (1) personal counseling based on Motivational Interviewing, (2) computer-expert
      system intervention that generates individualized feedback-letters, and (3) control group
      (treatment-as-usual). The interventions differ in their channel of delivery, but not
      regarding their content. Both intervention groups receive interventions at three time points:
      directly after the baseline-assessment at the general hospital, and 1 and 3 months later by
      mail and phone, respectively. Outcome will be assessed six, 12, 18 and 24 months after
      baseline.

    <description>At three time-points, participants receive counseling by health professionals trained in Motivational Interviewing based counseling. To assure that both interventions do not differ in their content, individual manuals generated by a software program are used. Counseling will be face-to-face during the hospital stay, and by phone one and three months later.</description>
