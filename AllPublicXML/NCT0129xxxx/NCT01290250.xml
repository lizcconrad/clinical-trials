    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a new orange juice-based beverage
      enriched in fiber and selected phenolic compounds (mainly flavanones) on features of
      metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease risk factors related to inflammation and
      antioxidant defense system in overweight and obese adult humans. This study hypothesizes that
      consumption of an orange juice-based beverage enriched in fiber and selected phenolic
      compounds (mainly flavanones)would improve lipid levels and lipid metabolism,blood pressure
      and the Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA) index.

    <description>Biomarkers of the non-enzymatic (NE-ADS) and enzymatic antioxidant defense system (E-ADS). For the NE-ADS, in addition to total plasma antioxidant capacity, malondialdhyde, and total carbonyl protein derivatives, plasma α-tocopherol, β-carotene, retinol, coenzyme Q and total blood glutathione will be determined. Furthermore, the amount of plasma oxidized LDL and urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and F2-isoprostanes will be measured. For E-ADS the activities of glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase in red blood cells will be assessed.</description>

Likewise, adiponectin, leptin, resistin, visfatin, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), nerve growth factor (NGF), retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) and L-fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) will be determined</description>

    <description>Whole genome gene expression analysis: This analysis will be carried out in a subset of 20 control and 20 experimental samples at four times: 160 arrays. The GeneChip® Human Exon 1.0 ST will be used for the gene expression analysis.
Validation by Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR): In order to confirm the arrays results, a total of 93 differentially expressed genes in the experimental samples will be analyzed by RTPCR using low density arrays</description>
