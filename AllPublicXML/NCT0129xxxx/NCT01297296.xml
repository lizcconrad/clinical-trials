      The primary objective is to assess the longterm safety of the CardioKinetix Parachute Implant
      and Delivery System in the partitioning of the left ventricle in patients with heart failure
      due to ischemic heart disease.

    <textblock>
      While current therapies for heart failure (including but not limited to: medical management,
      cardiac resynchronization and ICDs) may represent the best treatment available today for the
      majority of HF patients, the medical community recognizes that pharmacologic therapy has been
      optimized to nearly the extent that is possible, and that any incremental improvements in the
      management of HF patients will now come from device based therapies. With this background,
      CardioKinetix has developed a catheter-based intravascular approach to ventricular
      partitioning using an implantable device. The purpose of this study is to assess the longterm
      safety of using the CardioKinetix Parachute device to isolate the malfunctioning portion of
      the left ventricle in patients with symptoms of HF due to ischemic heart disease.
