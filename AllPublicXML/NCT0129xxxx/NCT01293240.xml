    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Protein and lipid deposits on the contact lens surface were assessed for each eye by the investigator using a biomicroscope, which magnifies the appearance of the contact lens on the wearer's eye.

    <measure>Corrected Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Each eye was tested individually while the participant read distant charts in normal lighting. Corrected visual acuity was measured using a Snellen chart, which was converted into logMAR units (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution). A 20/20 Snellen acuity equates to a logMAR acuity of 0.0 and is considered normal distance eyesight. Positive logMAR values indicate poorer vision, and negative values denote better visual acuity.</description>

        <title>Corrected Visual Acuity</title>
        <description>Each eye was tested individually while the participant read distant charts in normal lighting. Corrected visual acuity was measured using a Snellen chart, which was converted into logMAR units (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution). A 20/20 Snellen acuity equates to a logMAR acuity of 0.0 and is considered normal distance eyesight. Positive logMAR values indicate poorer vision, and negative values denote better visual acuity.</description>

          <title>Corrected Visual Acuity</title>
          <description>Each eye was tested individually while the participant read distant charts in normal lighting. Corrected visual acuity was measured using a Snellen chart, which was converted into logMAR units (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution). A 20/20 Snellen acuity equates to a logMAR acuity of 0.0 and is considered normal distance eyesight. Positive logMAR values indicate poorer vision, and negative values denote better visual acuity.</description>
