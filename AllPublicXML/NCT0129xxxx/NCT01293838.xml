      The primary objective is to examine whether Cipralex® is effective and safe in the treatment
      of anxiety disorders in youth. The secondary objective is to identify changes in arousal and
      stress response from pre- to post-treatment with Cipralex® in youth with anxiety disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses of adolescence, with an overall
      prevalence ranging from 5.0% to 10.8% (Costello et al, 1996; Ford et al, 2003; Fergusson et
      al, 1993; Shaffer et al, 1996; Verhulst et al., 1997). Six- to 12-month prevalence has been
      estimated to be 0.5-2.4% for separation anxiety disorder (SAD), 2.1-4.6% for overanxious
      disorder (OAD), the DSM-III antecedent of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), 1.7-6.9% for
      social phobia (SP), and 0.3-1.2% for panic disorder (PD) (Bowen et al, 1990; Fergusson et al,
      1993; Ford et al, 2003; Lewinsohn et al, 1993; Romano et al, 2001; Verhulst et al, 1997). In
      the US National Comorbidity Survey, the median age of onset for anxiety disorders was 11
      years (range 6-21 years), which was much younger than for substance use disorders (20 years)
      and mood disorders (30 years) (Kessler, 2005). However, anxious youth often go undiagnosed
      and untreated, possibly because they tend to be compliant and nondisruptive (Esser et al,
      1990). This is of concern since research suggests that youth with untreated anxiety disorders
      are more likely to develop significant problems later in life, such as continued anxiety,
      depression, substance abuse, suicide attempts, educational underachievement, and impaired
      psychosocial functioning (Pine et al, 1998; Woodward &amp; Fergusson, 2001).

      The existing literature on pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders in adolescents is
      limited, but suggests that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the
      treatment of choice for pervasive and impairing anxiety disorders in youth (Reinblatt &amp;
      Walkup, 2005). A few randomized controlled trials (RCT) provide support for the use of SSRIs
      such as fluvoxamine and fluoxetine for the treatment of SAD, GAD and SP. Cipralex® is a newer
      SSRI whose use for treatment of anxiety disorders in adolescents has been documented in only
      one previous open trial (Isolan et al., 2007). Results from this study and a few RCTs
      conducted in adults with anxiety disorders suggest that Cipralex® should be effective and
      safe for relieving symptoms of anxiety in adolescents.

      Primary objectives: (1) to assess the clinical and psychosocial changes associated with
      16-week open-label treatment with Cipralex® (10 to 20 mg/day) in adolescents with SAD, SP, PD
      and/or GAD; (2) to assess the tolerance and safety of Cipralex® (10 to 20 mg/day for 16
      weeks) in adolescents with SAD, SP, PD and/or GAD.

      Secondary objective: (1) to investigate changes in physiological measures of arousal and
      stress response (i.e., heart rate variability, salivary concentrations of cortisol and
      alpha-amylase, acoustic startle response,) using standardized laboratory stressors, before
      and after treatment with Cipralex® (10 to 20 mg/day for 16 weeks) in youth with anxiety
      disorders.
