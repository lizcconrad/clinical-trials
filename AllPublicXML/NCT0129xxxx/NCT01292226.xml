  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the correlation between the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      parameters of CellCept in patients undergoing primary kidney transplantation, in order to
      assess the impact on clinical outcome and the risks of acute rejection. All patients will
      receive oral CellCept, 1g twice daily, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters
      will be measured at weeks 2, 4, 12 and 24. The anticipated time on study treatment is 24
      weeks.

All suspected acute rejections were confirmed by biopsy. The start date of acute rejection was identified as the date of biopsy.</description>

    <description>BPAR was defined according to 1997 Banff Criteria as a biopsy Banff grade of IA, IB, IIA, IIB, or III. Grade IA was defined as significant interstitial infiltration with greater than (&gt;)25% of parenchyma affected, and foci of moderate tubulitis with &gt;4 mononuclear cells per tubular cross section or group of 10 tubular cells. Grade IB was defined as significant interstitial infiltration with &gt;25% parenchyma affected, and foci of severe tubulitis with &gt;10% mononuclear cells per tubular cross section or group of 10 tubular cells. Grade IIA was defined as mild to moderate intimal arteritis. Grade IIB was defined as severe intimal arteritis comprising &gt;25% of the luminal area. Grade III was defined as transmural arteritis and/or arterial fibrinoid changes and necrosis of medial smooth muscle cells.</description>

        <description>BPAR was defined according to 1997 Banff Criteria as a biopsy Banff grade of IA, IB, IIA, IIB, or III. Grade IA was defined as significant interstitial infiltration with greater than (&gt;)25% of parenchyma affected, and foci of moderate tubulitis with &gt;4 mononuclear cells per tubular cross section or group of 10 tubular cells. Grade IB was defined as significant interstitial infiltration with &gt;25% parenchyma affected, and foci of severe tubulitis with &gt;10% mononuclear cells per tubular cross section or group of 10 tubular cells. Grade IIA was defined as mild to moderate intimal arteritis. Grade IIB was defined as severe intimal arteritis comprising &gt;25% of the luminal area. Grade III was defined as transmural arteritis and/or arterial fibrinoid changes and necrosis of medial smooth muscle cells.</description>
