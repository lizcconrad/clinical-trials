  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be done in 6 parts. In Part A the dose of intravenous (IV) pembrolizumab
      (MK-3475) will be escalated to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2
      dose (RP2D) for participants with a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of
      any type of carcinoma or melanoma (MEL). Part B of the study will explore the safety,
      tolerability, and efficacy of the drug in participants with advanced or metastatic MEL and
      compare every 2 week to every 3 week dosing. Part C of the study will explore the safety,
      tolerability, and efficacy of the drug in participants with non-small cell lung carcinoma
      (NSCLC) that is locally advanced or metastatic. Part D of the study will explore the low and
      high doses of study drug identified in Parts A and B in participants with advanced or
      metastatic MEL. Part E (closed with Amendment 7) will explore low, medium, and high doses of
      study drug in combination with standard chemotherapy in participants with locally advanced or
      metastatic NSCLC. Part F will explore low and high doses of study drug in treatment-naive and
      previously-treated participants with NSCLC with programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) gene
      expression. In Parts D and F and some of Part B participants will be randomized to one dose
      level. The primary hypotheses are the following: that pembrolizumab has acceptable safety and
      tolerability; and that pembrolizumab shows a clinically meaningful response rate (RR) or
      disease-control rate (DCR) in participants with melanoma (ipilimumab-refractory or not), and
      a clinically meaningful RR in participants with NSCLC, especially a clinically meaningful RR
      in those participants with either cancer, whose tumors express PD-L1.

          -  In Part A: Histological or cytological diagnosis of MEL or any type of carcinoma,
             progressive metastatic disease, or progressive locally advanced disease not amenable
             to local therapy. In Parts B and D of the study, histological or cytological diagnoses
             of metastatic MEL with progressive locally advanced or metastatic disease. In Parts C
