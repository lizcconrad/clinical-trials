  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many adults find it difficult to perform physical exercise during leisure. The workplace may
      provide an optimal setting to encourage a healthier lifestyle. This study investigates the
      effect of daily stair walking at the workplace on cardiovascular health.

      The main hypothesis is that daily stair walking for 10 weeks compared with a control group
      results in increased aerobic fitness.
