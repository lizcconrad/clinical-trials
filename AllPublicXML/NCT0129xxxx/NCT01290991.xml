      Is Augment Bone Graft plus Allograft safe to use for the treatment of osteochondral defects
      of the knee?

    <textblock>
      Subjects will be 18 to 40 years with an osteochondral defects of the knee.They will be
      candidates for allograft and Augment Bone Graft will be added to the procedure. The safety of
      Augment Bone Graft plus allograft for osteochondral defects of the knee will be evaluated by
      type, frequency, severity and relatedness of adverse events to the device for a minimum of 24
      weeks.Magnetic Resonance Imaging will be performed at 1,12 and 42 weeks to evaluate device
      integrity and surgical treatment of osteochondral defects. Computed tomography will be done
      at week 1 and week 24 to determine the healing status of the osteochondral defect.
