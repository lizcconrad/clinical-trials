      <recruitment_details>This study started in February 2011. It was subsequently terminated due to low enrollment.
Baseline characteristics refer to the Safety Set (SS). The Safety Set (SS) consisted of all patients included in this study receiving treatment with Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) at least once.
There was a total of 3 subjects enrolled in this study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Since only 3 subjects were enrolled in this study, the efficacy data is not interpretable and will not be presented. Only Adverse Event (AE) data will be summarized in a table, with frequency counts and percentages.</pre_assignment_details>
