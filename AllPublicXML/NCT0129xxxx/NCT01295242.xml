    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine rates of oral and genital human papillomavirus
      (HPV) infections, and look at risk factors for HPV infection in healthy mid-adult women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a longitudinal study of 500 women in order to determine rates and
      risk factors for HPV infections in 30-50 year old women. Participants will be followed for 6
      months and will be asked to complete online questionnaires on their health, sexual behavior,
      HPV vaccinations, and cervical cancer screening. The investigators will ask participants to
      self-collect monthly vaginal swab samples and self-collect 2 oral swab samples. Women will
      also be asked to provide 2 blood samples. All swab samples will be tested for type-specific
      HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay, blood
      samples will be tested for HPV antibodies.
