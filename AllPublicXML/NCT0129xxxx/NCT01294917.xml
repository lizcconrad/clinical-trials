    <textblock>
      This is a three-arm crossover clinical evaluation of 40 subjects who will use each of three
      contact lens care regimens for one month with Acuvue Oasys lenses. The subjects will be
      randomized on the order of solutions used: Investigational MPS, ClearCare, and Opti-Free
      RepleniSH MPS.

    <measure>Corneal Staining</measure>

    <description>Corneal staining will be assessed with sodium fluorescein dye on the ocular surface. The cornea is split into 5 sections, each section is evaluated by staining type, depth, and extent is graded on a 0 to 100 scale with higher scores indicating more staining. The possible total range for the total score per eye is 0 to 50,000 (100x100x100=10,000 per section) with values higher than 1200 being clinically relevant.</description>

    <measure>Dryness</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
