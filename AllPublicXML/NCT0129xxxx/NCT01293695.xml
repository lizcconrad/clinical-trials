      This study is designed to determine the effect of a Hypnosis Intervention on reducing hot
      flash frequency (perceived impact vs. physiologically measured impact), severity and daily
      interference in post-menopausal women. It is felt that the Hypnosis Intervention will result
      in significantly lower hot flash frequency, severity and daily interference scores (perceived
      impact vs. physiologically measured impact) versus Structured-Attention Control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aging population of the United States and findings from the Women's Health Initiative
      that indicate a shift in the risk/benefits balance of hormone therapy have created a growing
      interest in alternative treatments for hot flashes. Hot flashes are among the most severe and
      frequent symptoms experienced by women during menopause. Over 66% of post-menopausal women
      experience hot flashes. As a result, there is a pressing need for safe and effective
      treatments for hot flashes. Hypnosis is one mind-body therapy that seems particularly
      promising for treating hot flashes.

      However, the treatment effectiveness of hypnosis in reducing physiologically measured (i.e.
      physiologically measured impact) hot flashes with post-menopausal women has yet to be
      established relative to a Structured-Attention Control. This is a critical step to further
      investigate the intervention and to determine if hypnosis reduces the symptoms (i.e. the
      number of physiological hot flashes) or only the women's perception of symptoms.

      Also, the physiologic mechanism by which hypnosis may operate in reducing hot flashes is not
      known. The present study will compare hypnosis to a Structured-Attention Control in reducing
      hot flashes (perceived and physiologically monitored) in post-menopausal women in a
      randomized clinical trial.

      Innovations of this study are that it will be the first full scale test of hypnosis for hot
      flashes; one of the first studies to examine both perceived impact and physiologically
      measured impact of a mind-body intervention for hot flashes using state-of-the-art 24 hour
      ambulatory physiological monitoring; the first study to examine the effect of hypnosis for
      hot flashes on cortisol; and the first investigation of the role of cognitive expectancies in
      treatment of hot flashes in comparison to a Structured-Attention Control.

    <measure>Hot Flash Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hot Flash Symptoms Diary was used to measure hot flash frequency. Participants recorded their hot flashes over seven days by daily frequency and severity. This instrument provides a measure of hot flash frequency and hot flash score (product of frequency x severity).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hot Flash Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hot Flash Score is a product of frequency of hot flashes × severity of hot flashes, which could range from 0 (best possible outcome) to infinity (worst possible outcome).
Hot flash frequency and hot flash severity were obtained using the Hot Flash Symptoms Diary. Participants recorded their daily hot flashes marking each hot flash (frequency) and rating the severity of each as mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), and very severe (4).
The values presented represent the average of daily hot flash scores.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire is used to measure the effects of hot flashes on women as they go about their daily activities. Answers on the scale can range 0 (Do Not Interfere) to 10 (Completely Interfere). The total score was computed by averaging the subjective ratings over the 10 items. A lower score indicates better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sternal Skin Conductance Monitor Used to Physiologically Measure Skin Moisture</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>As a secondary outcome, hot flashes were measured using a Biolog ambulatory recorder. Skin conductance was expressed in micro Siemens (0 to infinity) and the final value was obtained by averaging the recorded skin conductance for a period of 24 hours. Lower skin conductance measure indicates less sweating.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-report inventory designed to measure sleep quality. The participants self rate their sleep quality over seven areas of sleep.The questions about sleep quality are answered on a 0-3 scale with higher scores indicating greater sleep pathology. The global score is determined by summing the raw scores of the seven sleep components. The global score can range from 0 - 21 and total scores above 5 are normally considered indicative of poor sleep quality.</description>

          <description>Hot Flash Score is a product of frequency of hot flashes × severity of hot flashes, which could range from 0 (best possible outcome) to infinity (worst possible outcome).
Hot flash frequency and hot flash severity were obtained using the Hot Flash Symptoms Diary. Participants recorded their daily hot flashes marking each hot flash (frequency) and rating the severity of each as mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), and very severe (4).
The values presented represent the average of daily hot flash scores.</description>

Skin conductance was expressed in micro Siemens (0 to infinity) and the final value was obtained by averaging the recorded skin conductance for a period of 24 hours. Lower skin conductance measure indicates less sweating.</description>

          <description>The Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-report inventory designed to measure sleep quality. The participants self rated their sleep quality over seven areas of sleep.The questions about sleep quality are answered on a 0-3 scale with higher scores indicating greater sleep pathology. The global score was determined by summing the raw scores of the seven sleep components. The global score can range from 0 - 21 and total scores above 5 are normally considered indicative of poor sleep quality.</description>

          <description>The Hot Flash Symptoms Diary was used to measure hot flash frequency. Participants recorded their hot flashes over seven days by daily frequency and severity. This instrument provides a measure of hot flash frequency and hot flash score (product of frequency x severity).</description>

        <title>Hot Flash Score</title>
        <description>Hot Flash Score is a product of frequency of hot flashes × severity of hot flashes, which could range from 0 (best possible outcome) to infinity (worst possible outcome).
Hot flash frequency and hot flash severity were obtained using the Hot Flash Symptoms Diary. Participants recorded their daily hot flashes marking each hot flash (frequency) and rating the severity of each as mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), and very severe (4).
The values presented represent the average of daily hot flash scores.</description>

        <description>The Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-report inventory designed to measure sleep quality. The participants self rate their sleep quality over seven areas of sleep.The questions about sleep quality are answered on a 0-3 scale with higher scores indicating greater sleep pathology. The global score is determined by summing the raw scores of the seven sleep components. The global score can range from 0 - 21 and total scores above 5 are normally considered indicative of poor sleep quality.</description>
