      An open-label Phase 1 Study Assessing the Safety, Immunogenicity and Dose Response of IC84, A
      new vaccine against Clostridium Difficile (C. difficile), In healthy subjects
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, partially randomized, dose escalation Phase 1 study which will consist
      of a part A in healthy adults aged between ≥18 and &lt;65 years and a part B in healthy elderly
      ≥65 years, the latter age group being the most vulnerable population to suffer from C.
      difficile infections.

      Part A consists of 3 vaccinations on Day0, Day7 and Day21 with the following groups:

      Group A: IC84 20 mcg (microgram)with Alum Group B: IC84 75 mcg (microgram)with Alum Group C:
      IC84 75 mcg (microgram)without Alum Group D: IC84 200 mcg(microgram)with Alum Group E: IC84
      200 mcg(microgram)without Alum

      Part A was already finished and part B is now ongoing. All information which could be find
      under the other sections are referring to the information on Part B.

             menopausal, or a negative serum pregnancy test during screening and the willingness

             of contraception.

             therapy, and a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

          4. Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, a negative test result within 30
             days before screening is acceptable), Hepatitis B virus (HBV, Hepatitis B surface
             antigen [HBsAg]) or Hepatitis C virus (HCV).

             contraception in female subjects with child-bearing potential ( and unreliable
             contraception in male subjects.
