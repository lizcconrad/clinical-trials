  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall hypothesis is that the long-term cognitive and behavioral sequelae of traumatic
      brain injury (TBI) are due to selective disruption of the long association white matter
      tracts of the cerebral hemispheres, with resulting functional impairment of the network of
      cortical regions that are interconnected by these long-range association pathways. We propose
      that traumatic white matter injury can be measured with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and
      that the impaired cortical activation can be detected with magnetoencephalography (MEG), and
      that the results of these imaging examinations will correlate with neurocognitive status and
      functional recovery after TBI.

    <description>We believe that brain injury results in selective disruption of the associative white matter tracts of the cerebral hemispheres, with resulting functional impairment of the network of cortical regions that are interconnected by these long-range association pathways. We propose that traumatic white matter injury can be measured with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We evaluate DTI using 3T and 7T MRI. Participants receive scans at only one time-point.</description>

    <description>We hope to better understand the long-term cognitive and behavioral sequelae of traumatic brain injury (TBI) by correlating neurocognitive testing data with imaging data. We will also compare neurocognitive testing data between patients and controls to help illustrate the impact of brain trauma on these neurocognitive symptoms. Our participants receive testing at only one time-point.</description>
