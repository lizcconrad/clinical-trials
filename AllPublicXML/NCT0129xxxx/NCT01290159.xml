  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, the level of tolerance to heat is based on physiological strain indices, with no
      correlates to any relevant biomarker. We hypothesize that oxidative stress (OS) and the
      formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS), which are part of the underling
      pathophysiology related to hyperthermia, can be used to identify tolerance/intolerance to
      heat. The aim of the present project is to develop a simple assay, based on specific designed
      sensitive biomarkers of OS that can be detected in a small blood sample, and to possibly
      correlate each individual's state of tolerance to heat to the level of OS. These biomarkers
      specially designed and synthesized to form a novel probe (not present as such in biological
      organs). The method will be based on the incubation of the suggested biomarkers with the
      patient's blood sample and the measurement of the level and type of oxidative alteration of
      the markers. For this goal, post heat stroke patients, with different levels of tolerance to
      heat and subjects during a process of acclimation to heat will be studied. Such a method will
      add to our ability to better determine the level of tolerance to heat and not rely only on
      the measurements of temperature and heart rate during an exercise-heat stress.
