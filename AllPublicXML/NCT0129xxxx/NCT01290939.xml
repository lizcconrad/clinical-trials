      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      lomustine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known which regimen of bevacizumab
      given together with lomustine is most effective in treating patients with glioblastoma
      multiforme in first recurrence.

      PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether the addition of
      bevacizumab to lomustine improves overall survival (OS) in patients with recurrent
      glioblastoma compared to treatment with lomustine alone.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the therapeutic role of bevacizumab as well as the most favorable approach
           to treatment optimization for sequencing the combination of bevacizumab and lomustine in
           patients with glioblastoma multiforme in first recurrence.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to institution, WHO
      performance status (0 vs &gt; 0), steroid administration (yes vs no), and largest diameter of
      tumor (≤ 40 mm vs &gt; 40 mm). Patients are randomized at 2:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm 1: Lomustine 90 mg/m² every 6 weeks (cap. 160 mg) + bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2
           weeks (at further progression treatment will be according to investigators discretion).
           In the absence of hematological toxicity &gt; grade 1 during the first cycle the dose of
           lomustine can be escalated to 110 mg/m² (cap 200 mg) in their second cycle.

        -  Arm 2 (control arm): Lomustine single agent 110 mg/m² every 6 weeks (cap. 200 mg) (at
           further progression treatment will be according to investigators discretion).

      One cycle will be defined arbitrarily (due to the lomustine sequencing) as 6 weeks for all
      arms. Day 1 of a cycle will be the first day when medication is taken.

      Previously collected blood and tumor tissue samples are analyzed for MGMT methylation status,
      isocitrate dehydrogenase 1, and biomarkers of the VEGF pathway.

      Patients and their caregivers/relatives complete quality-of-life questionnaires (EORTC
      QLQ-C30 and EORTC-BN20) at baseline, at 12 weeks, and then every 12 weeks after completion of
      study therapy. Patients also undergo neurocognitive assessment at baseline, at 12 weeks, and
      then every 12 weeks after completion of study therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 12 weeks.

          -  Absence of pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an
             adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and 6 months
             beyond stop of treatment in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized. In
             general, the decision for appropriate methods to prevent pregnancy should be
             determined by discussions between the investigator and the study subject. WOCBP
             include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful
             surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral
             oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal. Females should not be breast feeding.

          -  Post menopause is defined as: amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive months without another cause
             or for women with irregular menstrual periods and on hormone replacement therapy
             (HRT), a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt; 35 mIU/mL

          -  Women who are using oral contraceptives, other hormonal contraceptives (vaginal
             products, skin patches, or implanted or injectable products), or mechanical products
             such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicide) to
             prevent pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or where their partner is sterile
             (e.g., vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing potential.

          -  Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours prior to the
             start of investigational product.

          -  Female patients within one year of entering the menopause must agree to use an
             effective non-hormonal method of contraception during the treatment period and for at
             least 6 months after the last study treatment.

          -  Males must agree to use an effective method of contraception during the treatment
             period and for at least 6 months after the last study treatment.

          -  Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical factors
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; such
             conditions should be assessed with the patient before randomization in the trial.

          -  Before patient randomization and study related procedures (that would not have been
             performed as part as standard care), written informed consent must be given according
             to ICH/GCP, and national/local regulations. Informed consent should also be given for
             biological material to be stored and used for future research on brain tumors.

          -  Patients with a buffer range from the normal values of +/- 5 % for hematology and +/-
             10% for biochemistry are acceptable. A maximum of +/- 2 days for timelines may be
             acceptable (one day for post operative MRI).
