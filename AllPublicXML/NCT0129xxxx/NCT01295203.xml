  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether access to a website with personalized
      feedback on physical activity level and suggestions to increase physical activity results in
      improvements in self-reported physical activity, anthropometrics and physiological
      measurements

      In a website-based intervention study, the investigators wish to examine if it is possible to
      increase physical activity among inactive persons. Main objective is to determine if access
      to a website with personalized feedback on PA level and suggestions to increase PA results in
      improvements in self reported PA, anthropometrics and applied physiological measurements.

      Physical inactive adults (n=12,287) participating in a nationwide health survey and
      examination (DANHES) were asked to randomly assigned to either intervention (n=6,055) or
      control group (n=6,232). The intervention group had access to a PA website with personalized
      advice and suggestions to increase PA. After 3 and 6 months, a follow-up questionnaire was
      administered by e-mail. The 7-day International Physical Activity Questionnaire was included
      in the questionnaires to assess four domains of PA in daily-life (work, transportation,
      domestic, and leisure-time) and sedentary time. Furthermore, at the 3 month follow-up a
      subgroup of participants (n=1,190) were invited complete anthropometrics and physiological
      measurements.

    <description>Hip and waist circumference was measured with a body tape (Chasmors WM02 Body Tape, Chasmors Ltd.,London, United Kingdom) to the nearest 1.0 cm. Waist circumference was measured midway between the iliac crest and the costal margin following a quiet expiration, and lastly hip circumference was measured at the maximal circumference over the buttocks and below the iliac crest.</description>

    <measure>Aerobic fitness</measure>

    <description>Estimated during a max (watt-max) or a sub-maximal test on a ergometer bike depending on the physical condition of the participant (Ergomedic 828E, Monark Exercise AB, Vansbro, Sweden). One of the following conditions contraindicated participation in the watt-max test: Any heart-related disease, chest pain, hypertension (&gt;160/100 mmHg), heart or lung (pulmonary) medication, pregnancy and muscle, joint or skeletal problems. The sub-max test was contradicted by hypertension (&gt;180/110 mmHg), severe heart-related disease, certain types of heart medication, muscle, joint or skeletal problems.</description>
