    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess safety and tolerability and determine the
      pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous single and multiple (up to 12) dose administration of
      CBX129801 (long-acting synthetic C-peptide) in type 1 diabetes patients.

      This study will be conducted in two parts (Part 1 and Part 2). Part 1 will be conducted in
      three sequential dose cohorts with dose level escalated for each successive cohort. In Part 2
      of the study, a dose regimen determined from the pharmacokinetic data from Part 1 will be
      administered in up to 40 additional subjects to achieve a target plasma concentration range
      that represents the most commonly observed physiological C-peptide levels in healthy,
      non-diabetic individuals.
