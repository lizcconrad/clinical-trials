  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine, in a pilot setting, if this study is feasible in
      terms of recruitment, willingness to be randomized, provision of contraceptive methods, and
      follow-up. The investigators hypothesize that this pilot study will be feasible in terms of
      recruitment, provision of care, and follow-up.

      The study will be a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing outcomes of immediate
      post-placental insertion of the Copper T 380A (Group 1) to outcomes of interval insertion of
      the Copper T 380A performed 6 weeks after delivery (Group 2) for patients undergoing
      scheduled cesarean delivery at Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. This study will not be
      powered to detect a difference, but rather the investigators will enroll all eligible and
      interested women during the three-month enrollment period. Potential participants who do not
      choose an IUD or who choose not to participate will be offered an anonymous opt-out survey.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>6 month IUD usage rates</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants enrolled who are using the Copper T 380A at 6 months post-delivery. This will include participants who are excluded at time of delivery or interval insertion and participants who do not follow up for interval Copper T 380A insertion</description>

    <measure>IUD Expulsion</measure>
    <time_frame>within 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The time until expulsion of the Copper T 380A will be defined as the time from insertion until expulsion occurred, if known. If the date of expulsion is not known, this will be documented as the day after the IUD was last known to be in place. If a pregnancy is detected and the Copper T 380A is absent (and the participant was unaware of expulsion), the expulsion will be assumed to have occurred at the time of conception, as determined by gestational age on ultrasound. Expulsions will be measured as total expulsions and separately noted whether complete or partial</description>

    <measure>IUD Removal</measure>
    <time_frame>within six months</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of participants who have the Copper T 380A inserted and who deliberately have it removed. We will also analyze the time to removal for these participants</description>

    <measure>Pregnancy</measure>
    <time_frame>within 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time to pregnancy will be calculated from the date of delivery until the estimated date of conception of a subsequent pregnancy, as based on sonographic dating. If sonographic dating is not available, the date of the last missed menses or three weeks before the first positive urine pregnancy test (if amenorrheic or oligomenorrheic) will be used</description>

    <time_frame>within 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The diagnosis of a perforation may be made by a transvaginal sonogram that shows no Copper T 380A within the uterus and an abdominal radiograph that shows a Copper T 380A within the abdominal cavity</description>
