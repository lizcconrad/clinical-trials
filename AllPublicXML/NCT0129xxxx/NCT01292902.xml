    <textblock>
      Inspiratory muscle dysfunction is a reduction in the ability to generate pressure and force
      by the inspiratory muscles. This decrease in the strength of these muscles can be attributed
      to biochemical and histological changes. Some patients with CHF showed a reduction of maximal
      inspiratory pressure (MIP) and inspiratory muscle endurance, and such factors known to
      exercise limitation and deterioration in quality of life and worsens the prognosis of these
      patients. This study aims to evaluate the Regional pulmonary distribution volume and the
      influence of enclosures system thoracoabdominal in CHF patients with cardiomegaly associated
      with diaphragmatic weakness during quiet breathing and during exercise for inspiratory muscle
      and its correlation with functional data. The investigators evaluated a total of 31
      individuals divided into two groups: CHF and control. In the control group, twelve volunteers
      participated with similar age, gender and body mass index in relation to the group of
      patients with CHF. The control group participants had an ejection fraction of left ventricle
      (EF)&gt; 50% without cardiac abnormalities of the cameras and MIP over 80% of predicted. To
      conduct the exercise to the inspiratory muscles (EMI) was used for IMT Threshold ® device
      (Threshold Inspiratory Muscle Trainer, HealthScan Products Inc., Cedar Grove, New Jersey) is
      one of the most used for training of inspiratory muscles in patients with several pathologies
      such as CHF. The exercise time was 3 minutes. During this period, participants were
      encouraged to only breathe through the mouth and maintain a respiratory rate between 12 and
      16ipm. Opto-electronic plethysmography measures the volume changes of thoracoabdominal system
      by placing 89 markers formed by hemiesferas covered with retro-reflective paper, taking the
      place of each of these hemiesferas determined by anatomical landmarks on the anterior and
      posterior regions of the chest and abdomen. According to our study, a lower ventilation on
      diaphragmatic region would lead to an increased perception of dyspnea during submaximal
      exercise in this population. Moreover, the observed changes in the pattern of regional
      distribution of ventilation in CHF patients compared to healthy individuals can serve as a
      basis for prospective cohort studies using IMT.

    <description>To assess the functional capacity test was used for 6-minute walk (6MWT) according to the protocol established by the American Thoracic Society (ATS). Before the test parameters were assessed resting blood pressure (BP), Heart Rate (HR), Oxygen Saturation (SpO2 - pulse oximetry portable Onix 9500), Respiratory Frequency (RF) and dyspnea scale (scale Borg).</description>

The exercise time was 3 minutes. During this period, participants were encouraged to only breathe through the mouth and maintain a respiratory rate between 12 and 16ipm. The exercise would be stopped if HR increased more than 20% and / or SpO2 &lt; 88%.</description>
