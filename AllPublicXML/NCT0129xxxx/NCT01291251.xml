      The guidelines of The Norwegian authorities concerning the use of antibiotics in general
      practice state that for several common diseases such as pneumonia and tonsillitis,
      antibiotics should be given four times daily instead of three times daily. The study´s aim is
      to see whether the patient compliance is significantly reduced in antibiotic regimes of 3 or
      4 daily doses as compared to 1 or 2 daily doses.

      All patients given antibiotic tablets, independent of diagnosis and medicament, are included.
      All patients give a written consent. Within a week after the end of the treatment all
      patients are contacted by one of the authors and asked a few standardized questions
      concerning their compliance with the treatment.
