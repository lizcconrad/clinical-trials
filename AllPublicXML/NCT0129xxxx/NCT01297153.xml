      The purpose of this study is to document the safety and efficacy of primary IOL implantation
      in children below 2 years of age undergoing congenital cataract surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of IOLs in pediatric patients has become increasingly popular in recent years and may
      represent a standard of care for older children. The refinements in surgical techniques
      attained in adult cataract surgery have been translated to pediatric cataract surgery to
      produce a technically safe eye. Nevertheless, the use of IOLs in children younger than 2
      years remains controversial. Exaggerated inflammation, capsular opacification and changing
      refractive status of the developing eye should be considered before the use of IOLs in the
      first two years of life. Further more, there is concern about the unknown risks of an IOL
      over the long life span.

      Currently, there are 3 methods of optical rehabilitation following congenital cataract
      surgery :

        1. Primary IOL implantation.

        2. Aphakic glasses.

        3. Contact lenses.

      At present, there is no randomized clinical trial reported to document the safety and
      efficacy of IOL implantation in children less than 2 years.

      Aim : To compare the technical outcome (safety) and functional outcome (benefits) following
      primary IOL implantation and aphakia in children less than 2 years.

    <description>An Objective visual assessment to be performed using Lea Grating Paddles(Grating Acuity Test developed by Lea Hyvarinen16), Cardiff Acuity Cards(Preferential Looking Test17), or ETDRS (Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study) chart. Vision is subjectively assessed as the ability to follow or to fixate on a point source of light or on an object shown to the child.. Ocular alignment was measured using alternative cover testing. If this kind of testing was not feasible, Hirschberg testing was performed..</description>

    <description>The patient is randomly assigned for aphakia / pseudophakia. This is done only after vitrectomy. If it is aphakia,IOL will not be implanted.Aphakia will be corrected with aphakic glasses / contact lenses. Bilateral aphakes are given both contact lenses and glasses. So when they do not wear contact lenses they can put on aphakic glasses. Unilateral aphakes are given only contact lenses. Contact lenses should be fitted in the eye in OT immediately after the operation.
Aphakic glasses :
Prescribed within 2 weeks of surgery for both eyes.</description>
