    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare open abdominal incisional hernia repair using
      XenMATRIX biologic mesh versus repair with their own tissue. This study will provide
      information in determining if a biological mesh is necessary to provide a sturdy repair for a
      ventral hernia.

      This study will involve comparison of open abdominal incisional hernia repair with XenMATRIX
      biologic graft versus repair with native tissue.

      The current study seeks to evaluate XenMATRIXTM, an FDA approved biologic graft for repairing
      contaminated abdominal wall defects.

      This study will provide significant insight for the reconstructive surgeon and patient to
      determine whether a biologic graft is necessary for the reconstruction of a contaminated
      ventral hernia repair to provide a durable single staged repair.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Is an adult ≥ 18 years old of either gender

          2. Will undergo a planned open abdominal incisional hernia repair

          3. Has a defect that can be repaired primarily without tension with myofascial
             advancement flaps and requires no more than 1 piece of surgical mesh (largest mesh
             size (19 x 35 cm)

          4. Contamination is known preoperatively, e.g. repair in the presence of a chronic wound,
             the presence of a stoma or in conjunction with a bowel resection, or such
             contaminations occurs intraoperatively, e.g. inadvertent enterotomy or opening of
             other hollow intra-abdominal viscus

          5. Infection is known due to local frank signs of incisional drainage, fistula formation
             or abdominal abscess following prior surgical abdominal surgery or presence of
             infected mesh

          6. Has an estimated hernia size of ≥ 3cm to 20cm in maximal width by physical exam

          7. Is considered a clean-contaminated or contaminated case per Surgical Site Infection
             Risk Guidelines

          8. Is willing and able to return for all scheduled and required study visits

          9. Is willing and able to provide written informed consent for study participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has a defect that the surgeon cannot achieve primary fascial apposition and requires a
             bridge of mesh

          2. Is a clean or dirty case per Surgical Site Infection Risk Guidelines

          3. Has conditions that would adversely affect subject safety as per product labeling

          4. Will undergo a laparoscopic hernia repair

          5. Has a nidus of chronic colonization, such as chronic indwelling bladder catheter or
             significant amounts of non-removable infected mesh

          6. Has conditions which preclude abdominal imaging at a standard imaging facility

          7. Has an anticipated survival of &lt; 24 months

          8. Care plan is to perform a staged repair over 45 days

          9. Is bedridden or otherwise non-ambulatory (i.e. is unable to independently transfer
             into and out of a wheelchair)

         10. Is ASA class 4 or 5

         11. BMI over 45

         12. Is pregnant
