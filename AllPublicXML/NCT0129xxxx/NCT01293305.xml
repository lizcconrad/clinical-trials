  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine sulfate has been recognized since the 70
      decade in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated the
      therapeutic properties of this association in control of osteoarthritis, especially in
      reducing pain and improving movement. The combination of chondroitin sulfate with glucosamine
      sulfate offers a significantly higher tolerance than most drug treatments and, moreover, has
      long lasting effects even after stopping treatment.

    <description>Assessment of noninferiority clinical association Chondroitin + glucosamine in dosage forms and oral powder hard gelatin capsule, produced by Geolab Pharmaceutical Ltd., with the comparator drugs in the same dosage forms produced by the Laboratory Zodiac (Condroflex ®) through the promotion of pain relief in patients with osteoarthritis between grades 1 and 3, according to the classification of Kellgreen &amp; Lawrence (1957), measured by visual analogue scale (VAS). There will be five visits: V0, V1, V2, V3 and V4.</description>

    <description>Are the secondary objectives:
Functional capacity before and after treatment, using the Lequesne questionnaire, comparing the groups (T and Co).
Overall evaluation of clinical improvement made by the principal investigator.
Incidence of use of painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs orally for the treatment through the patient's report, comparing the groups (T and Co).
