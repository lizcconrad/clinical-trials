  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the impact of traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) on embryonic implantation in
      the patients who have underwent in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer, the investigators
      compare the pregnancy rate in traditional Chinese medicine group and control group. The
      hypothesis is that pregnancy rate in traditional Chinese medicine group is higher than the
      control group.

    <textblock>
      To demonstrate the impact of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) on embryo implantation, the
      investigators perform a prospective randomized study on patients who have underwent in vitro
      fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) in the Reproductive Medical Center of the Remin
      Hospital Wuhan University in the next six months. These patients were randomly divided into
      two groups, one group was given traditional Chinese medicine, that is, ten days oral
      administration of Zhuyun recipe from the day after HCG injection. The second group without
      any treatment, and then the pregnancy rate were observed. Frozen embryo transfer for patients
      do the same treatment, measured indices were also the same in both groups. Our hypothesis is
      that Zhuyun recipe is beneficial for embryo implantation in IVF-ET patients, it can be found
      that pregnancy rate in traditional Chinese medicine group is higher than the control group.
