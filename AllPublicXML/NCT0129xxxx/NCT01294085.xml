      To assess the difference of prognosis between unresectable and recurrent biliary tract cancer
      and evaluate prognostic factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most patients of biliary tract cancer have advanced disease at diagnosis and often relapse
      despite surgery. Combination therapy of gemcitabine and cisplatin could be a standard therapy
      for this kind of cancer with the evidence of phase III study compared with gemcitabine alone.
      However the prognosis and the tolerability of chemotherapy in the patients with recurrent
      biliary tract cancer after radical resection might differ from those of unresectable biliary
      tract cancer, because the dose intensity of chemotherapy can be influenced by adjuvant
      chemotherapy and/or hepatic resection.
