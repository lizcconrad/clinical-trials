    <textblock>
      This study is being done to look at the absolute bioavailability of fluticasone furoate and
      GW642444 inhalation powder when administered in healthy subjects. Bioavailability is
      determined by measuring the amount of the dose of inhaled medication that reaches the
      circulation; the amount of inhaled fluticasone furoate and GW642444 powder will be compared
      to the medication administered intravenously (where bioavailability is 100%).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluticasone furoate (FF), a novel glucocorticoid, and GW642444, a potent, inhaled longacting,
      beta2-receptor agonist (LABA), are currently under development in combination for use as a
      once-daily, inhaled treatment for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). FF
      is also being developed as a stand-alone product for asthma and GW642444 is also being
      developed as a stand-alone product and in combination with a novel, long-acting muscarinic
      antagonist for the treatment of COPD. This study is being performed to determine the absolute
      bioavailability of both FF and GW642444 when delivered in combination from the novel dry
      powder inhaler.
