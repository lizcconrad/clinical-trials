      This study is being done to study the healthful benefits of eating garlic. Previous studies
      suggest that garlic may help prevent cancer. The investigators are recruiting healthy
      volunteers to participate in a study to determine the ways in which eating garlic may reduce
      cancer risk.

      A crossover design will be utilized with each participant completing each treatment phase;
      participants will be randomly assigned to a sequence of dietary treatments. There will be a
      17-day washout period in between diet periods. Participants will consume a garlic-free diet
      for the first 10 days of each diet period. The dietary treatments will be administered on day
      11 of each diet period. Dietary treatments will be incorporated into food as follows: 1) 5 g
      (0.175 oz.) of garlic mixed with 15 g margarine on top of 270 kcal white bread, served as
      breakfast, or 2) 15 g margarine on top of 270 kcal white bread, served as breakfast.
