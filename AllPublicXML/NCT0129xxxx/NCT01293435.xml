    <textblock>
      This study will collect real-life data from patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP)
      OR complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) to assess the burden of the
      disease, review the treatment pathways, evaluate how health resources are used and identify
      any areas of unmet medical needs. The aim of the study is to compare how patients who are
      admitted to hospital with CAP or cSSSI are managed across Europe. This will be done by
      collecting data to understand the patient and disease characteristics, current practice of
      treatment, and outcomes for the patient. Overall 4000 patients will be recruited from 10
      European countries.
