  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The main objective is to evaluate the efficacy of different dosage regimens of intraarticular Hyaluronic Acid 5 ml (Adant®)compared to a standard treatment (2.5ml X 5 i.a) in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Primary endpoint: Pain, Function and patient's assessment according to OARSI 2004 responder criteria.
Every patient who has received 100% of injections by the end of the study and has fulfilled the follow-up visits will be considered evaluable.
The percentage of patients in each group who do not complete the study due to lack of efficacy will be evaluated.</description>
