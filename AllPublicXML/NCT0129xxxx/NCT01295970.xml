  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Usually the treatment of a single brain metastasis is surgery or Stereotactic Radiosurgery
      (SRS). Surgery involves resection of the brain tumor by means of an operation, whereas SRS is
      treatment consisting of highly focused radiation doses to the tumor. These two treatment
      modalities are both widely used, well established, and proven to improve survival, but so
      far, no study has been done to directly compare the efficacy of one over the other. Neither
      treatment in itself is considered to be experimental and both have been shown to provide
      benefits to patients with metastatic brain tumors. The aim of this study is to determine
      which two modalities are better for local control and improving quality of life.

      Patients who consent to this study will be randomized to either receive surgery or
      Radiosurgery in the treatment of single brain metastases. The study seeks to recruit 12
      patient to each group. Patients will be in this study for up to five years from the time of
      the treatment finished. This will include follow-up visits at 4 weeks after the procedure and
      then every 3 months after the procedure up to 5 years.

    <description>Prior to surgery, patients will have placement of scalp fiducials and undergo a contrast enhanced MRI scan. Once the patient is anesthetized or sedated, the head will be secured with a head frame and scalp fiducials will be registered to the stereotactic neuronavigation system. The tumor will then be resected and the patient will be taken to the recovery unit.</description>
