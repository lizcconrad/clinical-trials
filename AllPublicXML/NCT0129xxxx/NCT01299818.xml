    <textblock>
      -  Pain is one of the most common concerns for which patients seek medical attention.

        -  Pain is usually understood as symptom that reflects peripheral organic damage. Many
           patients experience pain, often chronically, independently of any underlying cause such
           as chronic regional pain syndromes (irritable bowel syndrome, temporo-mandibular pain
           syndrome, chronic headache or chronic low back pain)or diffuse like in fibromyalgia. In
           all those &quot;functional&quot; syndromes, accumulated evidence supports involvement of central
           pain processing systems, hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axes and autonomic nervous
           system, and are now referred as central pain conditions.

        -  Other patients suffers from chronic pain caused by damage or inflammation in peripheral
           tissues, but also experienced more diffuse pain, not directly explained by peripheral
           damage, that further aggravates pain and function. This is illustrated by the high
           prevalence of fibromyalgia observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis,
           osteoarthritis or ankylosing spondylitis for example.

      These pain conditions are now understood as combinations of peripheral, neuropathic and
      central pain.

      The investigators aimed to focus in this study in patients that are candidates to spinal
      surgery and suffer from low back pain and/or radiculopathy. Pain in these patients may arise
      from damage to nerves - neuropathic pain- , to musculoskeletal structures - peripheral pain-,
      and may also reflects alteration in central pain processes.

      In these patients, spine surgery is usually performed to improve quality of life, decrease
      pain and avoid neurological deficits. Evaluation of surgical outcome includes objective
      measures such as neurological findings and radiographic evaluation, and subjective measures
      including patient self-assessments for pain and quality of life and psychological changes.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate patients who undergo spinal surgery for presence of
      central pain and central sensitization symptoms and evaluate their influence on these
      surgical outcomes
