  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the benefit of the withdrawal of
      Tacrolimus (Prograf®) on renal function in patients one year after the end of the weaning
      period. The secondary objectives will focus on assessing the risks and consequences of
      withdrawal of Tacrolimus (Prograf®).

    <description>The primary endpoint will be the improvement of renal function one year after complete withdrawal of Tacrolimus (Prograf®) assessed by measuring the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) calculated by the dosage of cystatin C according to the equation Bricon. The DFG will be compared between times J-30 and J480 (1 year after the withdrawal).</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the &quot;withdrawal&quot;group will begin the protocol with their usual dose of Tacrolimus (Prograf®) (initial dose). The initial dose of tacrolimus (Prograf®) will be reduced by one third at visit 3 (day 0) and again a third visit 5 (J60). The complete withdrawal Tacrolimus (Prograf®) begins to visit 7 (J120). The withdrawal of Tacrolimus (Prograf®) will be obtained in four months. Monitoring of all patients lasted 17 months in total from the screening visit, which corresponds to 12 months after complete withdrawal of Tacrolimus (Prograf®) for patients in the &quot;withdrawal&quot; group.</description>
