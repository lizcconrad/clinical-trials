      Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (ASC) is defined by an Intra Abdominal Hypertension (IAH)
      associated with a new organ failure. The occurrence of this syndrome is not well known in
      infants. Preterm birth is frequently associated with gastrointestinal complications,
      particularly Necrotizing Enterocolitis. In this pathology it is likely that the intra
      abdominal pressure (IAP) increases and can participate in the occurrence of organ failures.
      Newborn, in particular with digestive malformation as diaphragmatic hernias, gastroschisis,
      could themselves be suffering from this syndrome. It would be interesting to make early
      diagnosis in order to optimize the management of these children. This requires reliable
      measurements methods and standards. Intravesical Pressure (IVP) is the most reliable
      validated indirect method to measure intra-abdominal pressure. In order to measure the IVP,
      the bladder must contain a minimum of liquid. However, using inappropriate volumes could give
      erroneous IAP readings. The optimal amount of saline to inject in older children, determined
      from pressure-volume curves study is 1 ml/kg. In preterm and term infants, this volume appear
      extremely low (e.g. 0 8cc if taking a child to 800 g). The question that arises is whether
      this quantity is sufficient to obtain reliable and reproducible measurements of IVP in
      preterm and term.
