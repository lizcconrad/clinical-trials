  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concept of breath testing for various diseases has been around since ancient greece. It
      has been hypothesized that cancer is generating a unique pattern of compounds in patients'
      breath. This study is trying to characterize a novel system, based on nanoparticles
      technology, for cancer diagnosis through breath samples.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is accompanied by increased oxidative stress and induction of polymorphic cytochrome
      P- 450 mixed oxidase enzymes (CYP). Both processes affect the abundance of volatile organic
      compounds (VOCs) in the breath because oxidative stress causes lipid peroxidation of
      polyunsaturated fatty acids in membranes, producing alkanes and methylalkanes which are
      catabolized by CYP.

      In the Technion labs, a new system for breath samples diagnosis, is being developed. The
      system is based on Nanoparticles technology.

      The current study will try to identify colon and breast cancer patients through their breath
      samples and discriminate them from healthy individuals.

      Men and women coming for colonoscopy or breast biopsy will be recruited for the study. Breath
      samples will be taken from all volunteers before the medical test. Subjects with positive
      cancer results by biopsy will be the test groups for both diseases, all others will be the
      control.

      The research goal is to test the NaNose system ability to discriminate between healthy and
      sick.
