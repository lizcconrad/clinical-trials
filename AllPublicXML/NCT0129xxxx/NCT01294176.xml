  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if oral lipoic acid can safely help relieve
      permanent optic nerve injury in patients diagnosed with acute optic neuritis. It will also
      explore how the body absorbs and breaks down the study drug, and what effects it has on the
      immune system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral lipoic acid is an antioxidant that helps proteins work in the body. It is available in
      oral and intravenous formulations and has been used in the past to treat nerve damage like
      that seen in diabetes and some other metabolic disorders. It is available as a dietary
      supplement in the United States.

      Patients with a diagnosis of acute optic neuritis who are enrolled in the study will undergo
      medical and nervous system examinations, and blood draws. The study doctor will take a
      medical history and perform physical examinations. Research assistants at the MS Center, who
      are trained in blood draws, will perform the blood draws. Patients will also undergo Optical
      coherence tomography (OCT) examination at Casey Eye Institute, and receive two MRIs at Oregon
      Health and Science University (OHSU). Because it is a placebo-controlled trial, subjects will
      have a 50:50 chance of receiving either placebo (inactive) or study drug. If enrolled in the
      study, patients will take two gel capsules of the study drug or placebo at the same time
      every day for six weeks.

    <measure>The primary outcome measure will be the difference from baseline in retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness of the affected optic nerve, as determined by OCT, at 12 and 24weeks post LA treatment.</measure>

    <description>Individual data will be assessed at the last study visit (six months post baseline). Group data cannot be assessed until all participants have exited the study.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary outcome measures to assess optic nerve injury will be changes from baseline in the RNFL thickness at week 24, and changes from baseline in low- and high-contrast visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and visual field changes at weeks 12 and 24.</measure>
