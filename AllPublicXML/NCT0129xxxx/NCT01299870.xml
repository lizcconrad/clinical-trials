  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a disorder in the brain. The brain is full of &quot;nerve&quot; cells. Nerve cells have
      normal electrical activity to control the many functions of the body. Sometimes nerve cells
      do not function normally due to many different reasons such as disease, an injury or because
      the brain didn't develop normally at birth. When nerve cells do not function normally the
      electrical activity that controls things like muscles and body movement can get mixed up and
      cause seizures. When a seizure occurs, sometimes a person loses control of body movement,
      and/or bodily functions. When a seizure occurs, a person may become unconscious, and/or
      senses may be affected. Seizures can occur at any time, without warning, and can lead to many
      health problems.

      &quot;Catamenial epilepsy&quot; is specific form of epilepsy in women. It is closely related to the
      menstrual cycle. In this form of epilepsy seizures increase around the menstrual period.

      By doing this study, researchers hope to learn whether Keishibukuryogan add-on therapy with
      antiepileptic drugs is safe for women with epilepsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is known that the female hormone levels in epilepsy patients are different from healthy
      women. These hormonal differences may be part of the cause of catamenial epilepsy. It is
      estimated that at least 1 in every 3 women with epilepsy have catamenial epilepsy. Although
      many antiepileptic drugs are available, it is very difficult to control these seizures. In
      the past, studies using antiepileptic drugs and hormonal agents were done to treat catamenial
      epilepsy. However, those medications did not work well and caused side effects.

      Keishibukuryogan is a traditional Japanese herbal medication. It is made of 5 natural herbs
      (cinnamon bark, hoelen, moutan bark, peony root, and peach kernel). It is used to treat
      disorders in women like menopause and menstrual cycle problems. This is the first study to
      examine the safety of Keishibukuryogan in women with epilepsy. As such, Keishibukuryogan and
      your current antiepileptic drug(s) will be given to you during the study.

      Keishibukuryogan is a dietary supplement in the United States. It can be bought without a
      prescription. The safety and efficacy of Keishibukuryogan has not been studied in epilepsy.
      However, it has been used safely in Japan and other Asian countries for years.
