  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnosis of diabetic cardiomyopathy is then retained, supposing a change in the coronary
      microcirculation linked to an endothelial dysfunction. Abnormalities of the myocardial
      metabolism is frequently associated. It is regrettably about a hypothesis difficult to verify
      with current medical techniques.This deficiency being not only harmful to the diagnosis, but
      also to the assessment of the efficiency of the medical treatment on the myocardial
      metabolism and the endothelial function. Techniques of nuclear magnetic resonance offer
      interesting perspectives.

      These techniques allow in this context:

        1. to quantify the myocardial blood flow at rest and after &quot;cold pressor test&quot; in a
           population of healthy volunteers. The myocardial blood flow will be obtained by
           estimating myocardial blood flow at the venous coronary sinus site. This allows us to
           quantify a possible endothelial dysfunction in a reproducible way. No MRI study in
           diabetic patients has ever been led until now with this technique.

        2. to estimate the metabolic and structural abnormalities in this population, with
           particularly:

             -  Quantification of the myocardial metabolism in vivo by spectrometry of phosphorus
                31.

             -  Structural abnormalities: become integrated into the description of diabetic
                cardiomyopathy.

    <description>Quantification of the myocardial metabolism in vivo by spectrometry of phosphorus 31 which allows to estimate the energy state of the heart by analyzing the phosphorous metabolites with high energy involved in the myocardial energetic metabolism.
Structural abnormalities: evaluation of the fibrosis and the collagenic deposits by T1 mapping and measurement of relaxation T2 as well as the study of the late enhancement of gadolinium. These structural abnormalities become integrated into the description of diabetic cardiomyopathy.</description>
