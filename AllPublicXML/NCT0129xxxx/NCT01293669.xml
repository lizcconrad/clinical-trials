  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TC-6987 is a selective nicotinic α-7 receptor ligand (open channel stabilizer) that has
      demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory/antioxidant properties in animal models. Following the
      oral administration of a 1mg/kg dose of TC-6987 to diabetic mice (db/db mouse) for 7 weeks,
      numerous metabolic improvements were observed. Specifically, plasma glucose and triglyceride
      concentrations declined by approximately 30%; Hb1Ac was reduced by nearly 50%; and TNF-α
      declined more than 60% relative to control db/db mice Therefore, it appears that TC-6987
      could prove beneficial in reducing elevated glucose concentrations in diabetic patients as
      well as in ameliorating organ damage associated with inflammation, oxidative stress and
      hyperglycemia.

      This is a Phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled
      study to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic parameters of TC-6987
      in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The study is organized into three phases:
      (a) Screening phase consisting of a 1-week Screening (Week -5)and a 4-week Washout (Week -4
      to Day 1); (b) 4-week, Double-Blind Treatment (Day 1 to Week 4) during which subjects are
      randomized to either TC-6987 (20 mg on Day 1 and 10 mg from Day 2 to Week 4) or placebo; and
      (c) 2-week Follow-Up (Week 6). Unscheduled visits will be allowed between visits from Washout
      through Follow-up to evaluate a subject's glycemic status or other safety issues, as
      required. Subjects will fast overnight for a minimum of 10 hrs and refrain from drinking
      alcohol 24 hrs prior to each visit.

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint will be FPG values obtained at Week 4 compared to Day 1 (baseline). This change from baseline will be analyzed using MMRM techniques with an alpha of 0.10 (one-sided), to examine differences between the TC-6987 and placebo treatment cohorts. This change from baseline will be analyzed using the primary efficacy endpoints for the mITT analysis set. The efficacy analyses based on the Per Protocol (PP) analysis set will be considered secondary.</description>
