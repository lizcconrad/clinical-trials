    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop a risk assessment tool to identify bereaved in risk of complicated
      grief reactions and to implement a bereavement management programme in primary health care
      based on the Dual Process Model of coping with bereavement. Furthermore to enhance
      bereavement care in general practice and to enhance patients' self-management in bereavement
      care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Denmark alone there are approximately 55.000 deaths annually which leave approximately
      200.000 bereaved close relatives. International studies show that 10-15% of bereaved persons
      develop complications following the death of a close relative. If those studies hold true,
      approximately 20 - 30.000 individuals annually will develop complications as a result of
      suffering a loss, and there is hardly any knowledge of how bereavement is treated or even
      legitimized in primary care and referred on to specialized (psychological or psychiatric)
      care. The field of bereavement is in need of studies that validate the theoretical
      underpinnings of the research area, enhanced assessment of predictive risk factors and
      updated intervention methods: in short a scientifically valid management programme.

Intervention
Professional level:
GPs receive updated information on bereavement related symptoms, how to identify complicated grief, and the DPM of coping.
GPs receive suggestions on how to provide psycho-educational support for the patient.
GPs are informed about the results of the initial assessment of their patient prognostic screening for complicated grief.
Patient level:
Patients receive updated information on bereavement related symptoms, the DPM of coping and suggestions on when to seek professional help.
Patients are informed of the results of their initial assessment of their prognostic grief screening.
Patients are encouraged to contact their GP if they worry about handling their bereavement reaction.</description>
