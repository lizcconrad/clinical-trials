      RATIONALE: Studying samples of bone marrow from patients with cancer in the laboratory may
      help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in bone marrow samples from patients with
      T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To confirm an association between induction failure (IF) status predicted by a
           previously identified 116-member genomic classifier and actual induction therapy outcome
           observed on COG study AALL0434.

        -  To explore whether there is an association between early relapse (as defined by bone
           marrow or extramedullary relapse within 18 months of diagnosis) predicted by previously
           identified 5-member (primary) and 57-member (secondary) genomic classifiers, and actual
           relapse status at 18 months on COG study AALL0434. (Exploratory)

      OUTLINE: RNA from cryopreserved bone marrow samples are analyzed for gene expression by
      microarray methods. Samples are then compared with the 116-member genomic classifier.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Newly diagnosed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia

          -  Cryopreserved bone marrow from the Children Oncology Group (COG) Cell Bank of patients
             enrolled on COG-AALL03B1 and COG-AALL0434, including the following:

               -  30 samples from patients who had &gt; 25% bone marrow blasts at day 29 (induction
                  failure [IF] cases)

               -  Samples of cases of bone marrow and/or CNS relapse occurring within the first 18
                  months of treatment

               -  Random samples of 105 non-IF cases who achieved remission at the end of induction
                  therapy (at least 18 months)
