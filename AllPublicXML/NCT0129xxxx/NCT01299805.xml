  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacodynamics (the drug's effect on the
      body), the pharmacokinetics (the body's handling of the drug), and the safety and
      tolerability of vortioxetine, once daily (QD) in healthy men.

    <textblock>
      This study will look at an investigational medicine called vortioxetine to see how the drug
      affects the body and how the body handles the drug.

      The study enrolled 17 patients. Participants were randomly assigned at a 2:1 ratio to one of
      the following two treatment groups—which remained undisclosed to both the participant and
      study doctor during the study (unless there was an urgent medical need):

        -  Vortioxetine 20 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this was a capsule that looked like the study drug but
           had no active ingredient.

      All participants were asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This single-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate
      in this study was approximately 7 weeks. Participants made 2 visits to the clinic, including
      18 days confinement to the clinic, and were contacted by telephone 1 day and 27 days after
      leaving confinement for a follow-up assessment.
