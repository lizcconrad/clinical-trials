    <textblock>
      Major orthopaedic surgery is painful and requires safe and effective postoperative analgesic
      therapy. The successful use of continuous peripheral nerve blocks provides sustained
      analgesia while minimizing the need for opioid analgesics throughout the postoperative period
      and avoiding the side effects associated with central neuraxial techniques. Excellent
      analgesia can be maintained and opioid-related side effects avoided allowing improved
      rehabilitation. However using existing methods a failure rate of &gt;20% significantly limits
      the analgesic benefits in a substantial proportion leading to uncontrolled pain and side
      effects of opioid analgesics.

      A major concern with the use of continuous peripheral nerve blocks is difficulty in placement
      of the catheters close enough to the nerve to allow for effective local anaesthetic spread
      and therefore analgesia. The benefit of ultrasound to precisely place needles adjacent to
      nerves and increase efficacy of block success is undisputed. However ultrasound is of less
      help in accurately placing catheters. Indeed the final position of the catheter tip is not
      predictable and can be inadequate in 10%-50% of cases. The explanation for that is the
      material in currently used catheters is stiff and designed to avoid kinking. Unfortunately
      this same stiffness often leads to inadequate placement of the catheter tip. We have
      developed a catheter which coils up as soon as it is advanced beyond the needle tip, thus
      allowing the catheter tip to remain close to the initial needle tip position and therefore
      the nerve. The aim of this prospective randomized double blind controlled study is to
      determine the effectiveness of this new catheter in comparison with standard of care methods
      for continuous femoral nerve block commonly used after total knee arthroplasty. The primary
      outcome measure will be the incidence of catheter related block failure 24 hours after
      surgery. Our hypothesis is that the coiled catheter will significantly improve the efficacy
      of continuous femoral nerve block as compared to existing techniques.

      Aims of the study The aim is to determine the effectiveness of a the coiled catheter for
      continuous peripheral nerve block after total knee arthroplasty based on secondary block
      failures compared to the secondary block failures of the conventional, currently used
      stimulating catheters.

      Study design The trial is a prospective single-centre randomized double-blinded controlled
      trial. Patients will be randomized to (1) use of conventional stimulating catheters or (2) to
      use of a coiled catheter.

      Patient population Adult patients of at least 18 years of age undergoing unilateral knee
      arthroplasty, under spinal anaesthesia will be recruited in this randomized double blind
      controlled trial.

      Inclusion criteria: Ability to provide informed consent, understanding of the possible local
      anaesthetic-related complications, and understanding of the study protocol.

      Exclusion criteria: Any contraindication to peripheral nerve block, allergy to local
      anaesthetics, infection near the insertion site, ASA classification IV or V, pregnancy,
      chronic opioid analgesic therapy (&gt;30mg morphine equivalent per day), coagulopathy, known
      hepatic or renal insufficiency, peripheral neuropathy and patient refusal.

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be the presence or absence of analgesia (loss of temperature sensation in the femoral nerve distribution) on postoperative day 1 at 24 hours after placement of the catheter.
Secondary block failure rates are defined as presence of temperature sensation in the sensory distribution of the femoral nerve i.e.: anterior aspect of the thigh and anteromedial lower leg.</description>

    <description>Placement of the coiled catheter for continuous infusion of local anesthetics close to the femoral nerve: To place coiled catheters ab 18-gauge Tuohy needle (Sonoline Curl Catheter Set, PajunkÂ® Medizintechnologie GmbH, Geisingen, Germany) of 8 cm length is placed adjacent to the nerve by ultrasound guidance and nerve stimulator control. At this position and after injection of 5 ml dextrose 5% in water to dilate the space the coiled catheter is blindly advanced 2 cm through the needle and the final position verified with ultrasound.</description>

    <description>For the control group a conventional stimulating catheter is placed adjacent to the femoral nerve as follows: To place the simulating catheter an 18-gauge Tuhoy needle s placed adjacenit to the nerve by ultrasound guidance. At this position a stimulation catheter is introduced through the needle and stimulated with a decreasing current from 1 mA to 0.4 mA, with a pulse width 0.1ms to verify the appropriate motor response of the quadriceps muscle. The catheter is slowly advanced 3 cm beyond the needle tip under continuous electric stimulation using a current that is subsequently adapted according to the motor response achieved. If muscles twitches disappear during catheter placement at a current above 1 mA, either the catheter or the needle are manipulated until muscle twitches reappear.</description>
