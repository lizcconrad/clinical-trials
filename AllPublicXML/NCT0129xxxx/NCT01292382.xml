  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Memory is constituted by a set of mental abilities of information processing that will be
      available at a later time. Flawless performance depends on several brain systems and other
      cognitive domains. Normal aging is characterized by cognitive deficits that may worsen the
      production capacity and quality of life. Such deficits represent variations of normal , and
      may stabilize,or even better progress. Include multiple cognitive domains, such as working
      and episodic memory, and attention. Despite the heterogeneity of the nature and severity of
      these deficits, common characteristics were observed in neuropsychological assessment of that
      population, for example, reduction in processing speed. There is an important gap in the
      therapeutic approach of these individuals.

      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive and promising intervention, with
      potential to improve memory and cognition activating networks that operate on memory or other
      networks that interfere with cognitive performance. The technique relies on generating a
      variable magnetic field originated from an alternating electric current applied to the human
      skull reaching focal cortical regions.

      This study is a sham-controlled clinical trial, randomized, double-blind study. It will be
      evaluated the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on global
      cognition (memory, attention, language, executive functions, planning, logical reasoning,
      calculation and visual-spatial perception), especially memory, of elderly individuals with
      mild cognitive impairment, included in the domain of cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND).

      III. Outcome measures:

      Will be considered as an outcome measure a variation greater than or equal to 10% compared to
      baseline scores of neuropsychological tests, which will be applied on three occasions:
      immediately before (T0), after treatment (T2) and 4 weeks after the end of it (T3).
