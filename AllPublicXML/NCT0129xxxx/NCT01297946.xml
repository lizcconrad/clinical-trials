  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent developments of continuous glucose sensors and insulin infusion pumps have motivated
      the research toward closed-loop strategies to regulate glucose levels in patients with type 1
      diabetes. In a closed-loop strategy, the pump(s) infusion rate is altered based on a
      computer-generated recommendation that relies on continuous glucose sensor readings. In this
      study, we aim to compare the effectiveness of dual-hormone (insulin+glucagon) closed-loop
      strategy to open-loop conventional continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump (CSII)
      therapy in regulating glucose levels during an evening exercise and on a night following an
      exercise in adults with type 1 diabetes.
