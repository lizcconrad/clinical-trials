    <textblock>
      Chemerin is a novel adipokine that might provide a link between chronic inflammation and
      obesity. Pulse wave velocity(PWV) is a useful method for examining arterial stiffness,
      meaning early-stage atherosclerosis. Therefore, in the present study, the investigators
      examined the relationship between circulating chemerin and arterial stiffness measured using
      PWV in obese persons.
