  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that consumption of a low calorie cranberry beverage imparts a
      favorable impact on HDL cholesterol, LDL oxidation, and cell adhesion molecules in men.
      However, these studies were not well controlled. Thus, it is important to confirm these
      effects in a blinded, placebo-controlled feeding study. The investigators goal is to verify
      the cardioprotective effects of cranberries by conducting a dietary intervention trial with
      healthy subjects in a controlled environment.
