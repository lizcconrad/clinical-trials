      The primary objective is to assess the effect of a single dose of two experimental
      levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone (L/C/E) treatment regimens versus standard L/C/E treatment
      regimen in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with end-of-dose motor fluctuations in terms of
      duration of motor response after the first morning dose of levodopa. The secondary objective
      is to evaluate the safety of the L/C/E treatment regimens in patients with PD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, 3-period crossover study comparing the effects of a
      single dose of two L/C/E treatment regimens (A and B) and standard L/C/E treatment regimen
      (Stalevo) on the duration of motor response in PD patients with wearing-off symptoms after
      the first morning dose of levodopa.

      The study consists of a screening visit, 3 treatment visits and an end-of-study visit. Within
      14 days of the screening visit, the patients will receive a single morning dose of study drug
      (either of the two L/C/E treatment regimens) or Stalevo. The order of the 3 treatment periods
      will be randomised according to a crossover design and the duration of each period is 2 days,
      followed by a wash-out period (1-9 days) during which the patients will be on their
      individual standard PD treatment.

      Before each study day, patients will arrive at the study centre in the previous evening. The
      patients' own standard PD treatments will be discontinued at the latest by 22:00 to be
      continued after completion of the motor part (part III) of the Unified Parkinson's Disease
      Rating Scale (UPDRS III) next day. After completion of the UPDRS III, patients will return to
      their own standard PD treatments. Duration of the study will be 2 to 7 weeks per patient,
      depending on the length of the screening and wash-out periods.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent (IC) obtained.

          -  Male or female patients with idiopathic PD according to the United Kingdom brain bank
             criteria with end-of-dose motor fluctuations

          -  Hoehn and Yahr stage 2-4 performed during the &quot;ON&quot; state.

          -  Duration of response between 1.5 and 4 hours (based on medical history) to the
             patient's first morning dose of levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (DDCI) with or
             without entacapone.

          -  Treatment with 3-8 daily doses of levodopa/DDCI with or without entacapone with a
             total daily levodopa dose in the range of 300-1200 mg. One evening dose of
             controlled-release formulation of levodopa/DDCI is allowed provided that it is
             included in the total of 3-8 daily doses of levodopa/DDCI mentioned above.

          -  Unchanged levodopa/DDCI with or without entacapone and other antiparkinsonian
             medication(dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase [MAO] B inhibitor, amantadine and/or
             anticholinergics with approved doses), if any, for at least 6 weeks prior to the
