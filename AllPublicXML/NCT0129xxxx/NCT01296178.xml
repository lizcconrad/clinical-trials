    <textblock>
      Advances in the biological characterization of AML can now make a proper estimate of the risk
      of recurrence and likelihood of survival of different groups of patients according to the
      expression of different disease parameters. Karyotype, the molecular alterations affecting
      genes FLT3, NPM1 and CEBPA, minimal residual disease by flow cytometry and response to first
      induction cycle are variables that must be taken into consideration when planning the
      treatment of first line from a patient with AML.

      This breakthrough in the field of biology has not resulted yet in the development of new
      drugs really effective in the treatment of AML. Therefore, the core of the treatment continue
      to rely on the use of traditional chemotherapy combined or not with allogeneic hematopoietic
      stem cell. Both treatments differ in their antileukemic efficacy, higher in aloTPH, as well
      as their toxicity and procedure-related mortality, increased also in the aloTPH. These
      aspects should be added that most candidates aloTPH patients lack an HLA identical sibling
      donor forcing the search for alternative sources and hematopoietic stem cell donors. These
      transplants alternative, but are not committed to their antileukemic efficacy, it does have
      implied a greater toxicity. Therefore, the ultimate effectiveness of these procedures depends
      largely on the proper selection of candidates for the same.

      While there is broad agreement in terms of induction chemotherapy using a combination of
      cytarabine with anthracycline, the choice of chemotherapy regimen is controversial
      postremisión today. In the poor prognosis of itself involve the LMA, patients classified as
      &quot;favorable group&quot; are acceptable disease-free survival with consolidation schemes involving
      high-dose cytarabine. For other patients appear to be inappropriate to combine cytarabine
      with an anthracycline, at least one cycle of consolidation, and raise the option of
      allogeneic different depending on prognostic markers

      Primary objectives

        1. Optimizing current treatment of AML based on the classification of patients into
           different risk groups according to parameters cytogenetic and molecular response to
           treatment and to analyze its effectiveness in terms of survival.

        2. Apply a uniform treatment to individual patients according to previously defined
           prognostic groups.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Correlate the different clinical and biological characteristics with response rates and
           patient outcomes.

        2. Studying the role of minimal residual disease by molecular techniques in anticipation of
           relapse of AML
