    <textblock>
      This single arm. open-label study will assess the efficacy and safety of Herceptin
      (trastuzumab) in combination with Xeloda (capecitabine) in patients with metastatic or
      recurrent HER2-positive breast cancer, refractory to or relapsing after chemotherapy with
      Herceptin and taxanes. Patients will receive Xeloda 900mg/m2 twice daily orally on days 1-14
      of each 3-week cycle and Herceptin 8mg/kg intravenously (iv) on day 1 of the first cycle
      followed by 6mg/kg iv every 3 weeks. The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
