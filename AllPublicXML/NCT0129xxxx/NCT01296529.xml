    <textblock>
      Liver-related death is the leading cause of mortality in HIV-infected individuals with CD4+
      cell counts over 200, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the greatest risk for
      liver-related mortality in HIV-positive patients. Compared to HCV monoinfected individuals,
      patients with HIV and HCV coinfection experience accelerated progression of liver fibrosis,
      which can lead to higher incidence of cirrhosis, end stage liver disease (ESLD), and death.
      Changes in CD8+ T-cell activation, inflammatory cytokines, and serum markers of tissue injury
      may offer an immunologic platform to determine factors associated with progressive liver
      fibrosis in coinfected patients. In this cross-sectional study we will evaluate whether HIV
      and HCV coinfection patients with well-controlled HIV infection who have an undetectable
      viral load exhibit abnormal levels of inflammation and immune activation, potentially
      contributing to advanced liver fibrosis. Comparative groups include coinfected patients
      successfully treated for hepatitis C, or who have absence of hepatitis C viremia through
      spontaneous clearance, hepatitis C monoinfected patients, and HIV-positive patients with
      well-controlled HIV infection without hepatitis C. Liver fibrosis will be measured by
      non-invasive methods.

      The primary objectives of this study are:

        1. To determine if there are differences in markers of inflammation and immune activation
           in subsets of patients with HIV, hepatitis C, and HIV and hepatitis C coinfection.

        2. To assess the stage of liver fibrosis using non-invasive methods in subsets of patients
           with hepatitis C and HIV and hepatitis C coinfection and compare the degree of liver
           fibrosis with levels of inflammation and immune activation.

        a) HIV monoinfected; b) hepatitis C monoinfected; c) HIV/HCV coinfected untreated for
        hepatitis C; and d) HIV/HCV coinfected with clearance of HCV virus. Subjects will be all
        matched by age and estimated duration of hepatitis C infection where applicable. In
        addition, subjects in strata a and c will be matched by length of ARV therapy and CD4 count
        first established in strata d observed immediately before the initiation of successful
        hepatitis C therapy or documentation of negative HCV RNA in subjects with spontaneous
        clearance. Subjects in strata b will be matched in the same manner to strata d, except
        length of ARV therapy and CD4 count variables will not be considered. All subjects with HIV
        infection will be on HAART with undetectable viral loads.
