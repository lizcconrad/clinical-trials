  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In relapsed or refractory AML allogeneic HCT is considered to be the only treatment by which
      long-term disease-free survival can be achieved. Despite this favorable prospect, even in
      younger patients with relapsed AML only about 40% of the patients reach allogeneic HCT. A
      number of factors contribute to this low rate of transplantation, among them moderate
      activity of the salvage regimens and accumulating toxicities which prevent from
      transplantation; Prospective clinical trials in this indication usually focus either on the
      rate of CR achieved after a defined number of cycles of salvage therapy or on transplantation
      modalities. The consequent integration of salvage therapy into a transplant strategy
      accounting for the time-dependent process of donor search has not been studied so far.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of clofarabine salvage
      therapy prior to allogeneic HCT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients are scheduled for at least one cycle of induction therapy with CLARA. CLARA
      contains clofarabine 40 mg/m2 (1 hr infusion) days 1-5 followed 3 hours after the end of
      infusion by intermediate dose cytarabine 1 g/m2 (2 hrs infusion) days 1-5. Patients with
      moderate early response (reduced marrow blast count but ≥10% at day 15) or patients with
      progressive disease during delayed hematologic recovery (beyond day 42) may receive
      re-induction therapy similar to the first cycle induction therapy.

      Study treatment comprises up to two cycles of induction therapy and one to two cycles of
      consolidation chemotherapy for patients without a donor. Consolidation therapy is reduced by
      25% and consists of clofarabine 40 mg/m2 (1 hr infusion) days 1-4 followed 3 hours after the
      end of infusion by intermediate dose cytarabine 1 g/m2 (2 hrs infusion) days 1-4.

      Patients for whom a donor can be identified may proceed to allogeneic HCT after CLARA I
      adopting the concept of allogeneic HCT in aplasia. Patients for whom donor search is more
      time consuming should proceed to allogeneic HCT once a donor has been identified.

      Patients who have achieved a response after the last cycle of CLARA will receive clofarabine
      as part of the conditioning regimen. Clofarabine and melphalan may only be given as
      conditioning therapy to patients with HLA-compatible donors with a maximum of one mismatch
      refering to the HLA-loci A, -B, -C and -DRB1. Conditioning therapy then contains clofarabine
      30 mg/m2 (1 hr IV infusion) days -6 to -3 and melphalan 140 mg/m2 (1 hour IV infusion) on day
      -2.
