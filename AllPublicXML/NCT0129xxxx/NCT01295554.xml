  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) of the peripheral arteries has become essential in the
      diagnosis and follow-up of peripheral arterial disease.

      In clinical routine, the acquisition uses intravenous injection of a Gadolinium based
      contrast agent (gadolinium chelates).

      Initially, contrast enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA) was recommended for diabetic patients,
      elderly patients and\or patients with chronic renal insufficiency presenting a
      contraindication to CT angiography using iodized contrast agent injection.

      However, the increase in nephrogenic systematic fibrosis clinical cases, which would be
      secondary to gadolinium chelates injection, in patients with chronic renal insufficiency has
      restricted the use of CE-MRA. More than 500 cases were described to date in the world.

      Its occurrence is currently estimated around 4 % for patients in terminal chronic renal
      insufficiency and its mortality around 30 %.

      According to the recommendations of AFSSAPS from August, 2007, two gadolinium contrast agents
      (Gadodiamide-OMNISCAN *, General Electric HealthCare and Gadopentetate Dimeglumine-MAGNEVIST
      *, Bayer HealthCare) are contraindicated if the glomerular filtration rate is lower than 30
      ml/mn.

      Non-contrast enhanced MR angiography (NCE MRA) techniques have been proposed to provide
      complete and non-invasive investigation of the peripheral vasculature, from the abdominal
      aorta to the calf, thus offering patients with chronic renal insufficiency a surrogate with
      no side effects.

      Moreover, the use of high field (3T) MR imaging and phased array coils offers high quality
      images and good signal to noise ratio for peripheral vasculature analysis.

      Besides, the acquisition can be repeated if required as it does not require any contrast
      injection.

      The main objective is to evaluate the quality of the NCE images obtained for every
      investigated station from the abdominal aorta to the calf.

      The secondary objective is to compare the diagnostic performances of NCE images with those of
      CE MRA.

      The third objective is to estimate the contribution of automated and dedicated
      post-processing tools in optimizing the diagnostic quality of the images.

      20 patients will be recruited either by the vascular surgery or by the cardiology departments
      The appointment for MRA of the peripheral arteries on the Siemens 3T MR Scanner will be given
      as usual.

NCE MRA
CE MRA usually performed in the clinical routine
After each MRA examination, the CE images will be interpreted by a radiologist and the report transmitted to the prescriber within the usual delay. The radiologists in charge of this interpretation will not be involved in the evaluation of NCE images nor in the comparison between CE and NCE images.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any adult patient known or clinically suspected to present a peripheral arterial
             disease, the assessment of which requires an MRA of the peripheral arteries.

          -  MRA will be prescribed by the vascular surgery or cardiology departments. The patient
             should be conscious and cooperative. Clear and intelligible oral and written
             information will be given to the patient. The patients giving written informed consent
             will be included in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A contraindication to MRI, in particular pacemakers or implantable defibrillators,
             cochlear implants, neurosurgical clips, intra-orbital or brain metallic foreign
             bodies, endo prothesis since less than 4 weeks or osteosynthesis material since less
             than 6 weeks

             allergic reaction to contrast agent injection.

          -  Hemodynamically unstability, acute respiratory failure, a precarious condition or a
             need for continuous monitoring incompatible with the constraints of MR imaging.

          -  Age under 18 or under legal protection measure or without social coverage.
