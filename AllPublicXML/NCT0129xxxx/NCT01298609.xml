  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a prospective, randomized, double-blind, single center study with a
      6 month duration post permanent system implantation. Forty patients will be implanted.

      During trial stimulation, patients will be randomized into one of two study arms for two
      weeks. Crossover will occur at the 2 week study visit to the opposite group. After completion
      of these two arms, every patient will subsequently complete participation in the third study
      arm.

      After completion of the third arm, patients will be evaluated to determine if they are a
      positive responder responder. If so, the patient will have the option of obtaining the
      permanent implant.

    <description>The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) is a self administered scale that was developed to measure fibromyalgia patient status, progress and outcomes. It measures the components of health that are most affected by fibromyalgia. The maximum score is 100 and a higher score indicates a greater impact of the syndrome on the person.
The change in the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) will be analyzed and reported.</description>
