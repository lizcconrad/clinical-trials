    <measure>Change From Baseline in Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) Assessment of the SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) Score at Week 8.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Diary data from the 7 days prior to respective visit were used to evaluate the endpoint, where the score was only calculated if at least 5 of the 7 days data were available. Score was calculated from NSAID usage completed on diary cards considering NSAID type, total daily dose and number of days consumed. The Daily diclofenac-equivalent dose score was derived by converting each daily dose of NSAID to a percentage dose equivalent of 150 mg diclofenac; e.g. 1000 mg naproxen is equivalent to 150 mg diclofenac. For each NSAID, the percentage diclofenac-equivalent score is then multiplied by daily dose frequency and proportion of the period where dose was taken.
Ie Score=M x F x n/N (M: Percentage dose equivalent to diclofenac; F=Daily Dose Frequency; n=number of days with NSAID; N=number of days in period). The NSAID ASAS score is the sum of all such scores for all NSAIDs taken during the period. The minimum value is 0 and a higher NSAID-ASAS value indicates greater NSAIDs consumption.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) at Week 4.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>A numeric rating scale was used, for questions 1-5 (Fatigue, Spinal Pain, Joint pain or Swelling, Discomfort and Morning stiffness severity respectively) on a scale from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe). Question 6 (morning stiffness duration) was recorded on a scale of 0 (0 or more hours) to 10 (2 hours). To give the five major Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) symptoms equal weighting, the average of the two scores relating to morning stiffness was taken. This averaged morning stiffness score was then summed with the remaining 4 questions, resulting in a composite score on a scale of 0-50, which was then divided by 5 to give the final BASDAI score on a scale of 0-10.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Minimum Clinically Important Improvement (MCII) at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>MCII was completed at visit weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16 or Early Discontinuation and once weekly between visits. MCII was converted to binary scores as follows: 1 = 'improved'/'very important' and 'improved'/'moderately important' 2 = 'improved'/'slightly important', 'improved'/'not at all important', 'no change' and 'worse-no pain'. MCII was determined based on participant's response on the following three items for the question of how have they been during the last 48 hours compared to when they started the study: improved or less pain, no change and worse-more pain. MCII was typically defined according to the patients perception of what was very important improvement, moderate important improvement, slightly important improvement or not at all improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) Assessment of the SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) Score at Week 8.</title>
        <description>Diary data from the 7 days prior to respective visit were used to evaluate the endpoint, where the score was only calculated if at least 5 of the 7 days data were available. Score was calculated from NSAID usage completed on diary cards considering NSAID type, total daily dose and number of days consumed. The Daily diclofenac-equivalent dose score was derived by converting each daily dose of NSAID to a percentage dose equivalent of 150 mg diclofenac; e.g. 1000 mg naproxen is equivalent to 150 mg diclofenac. For each NSAID, the percentage diclofenac-equivalent score is then multiplied by daily dose frequency and proportion of the period where dose was taken.
Ie Score=M x F x n/N (M: Percentage dose equivalent to diclofenac; F=Daily Dose Frequency; n=number of days with NSAID; N=number of days in period). The NSAID ASAS score is the sum of all such scores for all NSAIDs taken during the period. The minimum value is 0 and a higher NSAID-ASAS value indicates greater NSAIDs consumption.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) at Week 4.</title>
        <description>A numeric rating scale was used, for questions 1-5 (Fatigue, Spinal Pain, Joint pain or Swelling, Discomfort and Morning stiffness severity respectively) on a scale from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe). Question 6 (morning stiffness duration) was recorded on a scale of 0 (0 or more hours) to 10 (2 hours). To give the five major Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) symptoms equal weighting, the average of the two scores relating to morning stiffness was taken. This averaged morning stiffness score was then summed with the remaining 4 questions, resulting in a composite score on a scale of 0-50, which was then divided by 5 to give the final BASDAI score on a scale of 0-10.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in ASDAS CRP Score at Week 8.</title>
        <description>The ASDAS-CRP was derived from back pain, duration of morning stiffness, patient global score and peripheral pain/swelling. The scores were categorized as follows : inactive disease(&lt; 1.3), moderate (1.3 – &lt; 2.1), high (2.1 – 3.5) and very high disease activity ( &gt; 3.5). ASDAS CRP is calculated as follows:
ASDAS CRP=0.12*Total Back Pain+0.06*Duration of Morning Stiffness+0.11*Patient Global+0.07*Peripheral Pain/Swelling+0.58*ln(CRP+1).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in ASDAS ESR Score at Weeks 12 and 16.</title>
        <description>The ASDAS-ESR was derived from back pain, duration of morning stiffness, patient global score and peripheral pain/swelling. The scores were categorized as follows : inactive disease (&lt; 1.3), moderate (1.3 – &lt; 2.1), high (2.1 – 3.5) and very high disease activity ( &gt; 3.5). ASDAS ESR is calculated as follows:
ASDAS ESR=0.08*Total Back Pain+0.07*Duration of Morning Stiffness+0.11*Patient Global+0.09*Peripheral Pain/Swelling+0.29*√(ESR).</description>
        <time_frame>Weeks 12 and 16</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT population comprised all participants who received at least one dose of the randomized treatment. Participants were analyzed according to treatment randomized and any data recorded after entry into the escape arm were included in the analysis. This analysis was performed with the observed cases.</population>

        <title>Change in NSAID ASAS Score From Baseline to Week 16 (ETN Arm Only)</title>
        <description>Diary data from the 7 days prior to respective visit were used to evaluate the endpoint, where the score was only calculated if at least 5 of the 7 days data were available. Score was calculated from NSAID usage completed on diary cards considering NSAID type, total daily dose and number of days consumed. The Daily diclofenac-equivalent dose score was derived by converting each daily dose of NSAID to a percentage dose equivalent of 150 mg diclofenac; e.g. 1000 mg naproxen is equivalent to 150 mg diclofenac. For each NSAID, the percentage diclofenac-equivalent score is then multiplied by daily dose frequency and proportion of the period where dose was taken.
Ie Score=M x F x n/N (M: Percentage dose equivalent to diclofenac; F=Daily Dose Frequency; n=number of days with NSAID; N=number of days in period). The NSAID ASAS score is the sum of all such scores for all NSAIDs taken during the period. The minimum value is 0 and a higher NSAID-ASAS value indicates greater NSAIDs consumption.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in BAS-G Score at Weeks 12 and 16.</title>
        <description>BAS-G was used to indicate the effect of disease has had on participant's well-being over the last 48 hours in a 0 (none) to 10 (very severe) point scale. Participants completed the BAS-G on a diary card following their Screening visit if they had a flare which required them to restart their NSAID. Participants were requested to complete the BAS-G upon symptom return (after stoppage of NSAIDs during screening phase) and weekly thereafter.</description>

        <description>Participants were requested to complete the BASDAI upon symptom return then every day for the first 15 days after first administration of test article and weekly thereafter. A numeric rating scale was used, for questions 1-5 (Fatigue, Spinal Pain, Joint pain or swelling, discomfort and morning stiffness severity respectively) it was on the scale from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe). For question 6 (morning stiffness duration) it was on the scale of 0 (0 or more hours) to 10 (2 hours). The analysis presented below is the change in morning stiffness severity.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT population comprised all participants who received at least one dose of the randomized treatment. Participants were analyzed according to treatment randomized and any data recorded after entry into the escape arm were included in the analysis. Missing data were imputed through LOCF approach.</population>

        <description>MCII was completed at visit weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16 or Early Discontinuation and once weekly between visits. MCII was converted to binary scores as follows: 1 = ‘improved’/’very important’ and ‘improved’/’moderately important’ 2 = ‘improved’/’slightly important’, ‘improved’/’not at all important’, ‘no change’ and ‘worse-no pain'. MCII was determined based on participant's response on the following three items for the question of how have they been during the last 48 hours compared to when they started the study: improved or less pain, no change and worse-more pain. MCII was typically defined according to the patients perception of what was very important improvement, moderate important improvement, slightly important improvement or not at all improvement.</description>

        <description>MCII was completed at Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16 or Early Discontinuation and once weekly between visits. MCII was converted to binary scores as follows: 1 = ‘improved’/’very important’ and ‘improved’/’moderately important’ 2 = ‘improved’/’slightly important’, ‘improved’/’not at all important’, ‘no change’ and ‘worse-no pain. MCII was determined based on participant's response on the following three items for the question of how have they been during the last 48 hours compared to when they started the study: improved or less pain, no change and worse-more pain. MCII was typically defined according to the patients perception of what was very important improvement, moderate important improvement, slightly important improvement or not at all improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI) at Week 4</title>
        <description>BASMI is an objective measure of spinal mobility. The BASMI score is composed of 5 measures: cervical rotation, intermalleolar distance, modified Schober's test, lateral flexion and tragus to wall distance.

          <title>Change From Baseline in BASMI Components at Week 8</title>
          <description>BASMI is an objective measure of spinal mobility. The BASMI score was composed of 5 measures: cervical rotation, intermalleolar distance, modified Schober's test, lateral flexion and tragus to wall distance. Each measure was scored 0-2 (0=normal mobility, 2=severe reduction) to give a final score ranging 0 to 10. For each BASMI component, the best of the two tries was taken which corresponded to the highest value for cervical rotation, intermalleolar distance, modified Schober’s test and lateral flexion and the smallest value for tragus to wall distance. For cervical rotation, lateral flexion and tragus to wall distance, a mean of the left and right measurements was taken.</description>
          <population>The ITT population comprised all participants who received at least one dose of the randomized treatment. Participants were analyzed according to treatment randomized and any data recorded after entry into the escape arm were included in the analysis. This analysis was performed with the observed cases.</population>
