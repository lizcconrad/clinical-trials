  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of the
      study product, AOBO-001, when taken by adults with symptoms of overactive bladder. AOBO-001,
      is experimental, which means that the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet
      approved it for use. AOBO-001 has been approved in China as a prescription drug product to
      treat bedwetting in children. AOBO-001 is also approved in Hong Kong as a dietary supplement
      to improve quality of life for people with urinary incontinence. AOBO-001 is a botanical
      (from a plant) product. It is prepared from the seeds of Xanthoceras sorbifolia bunge plant,
      which is a flowering tree grown in Northern China. Approximately 60 subjects who are 18 years
      of age and older are expected to participate in this study at up to 8 investigational sites.
      Each subject will complete 6 visits to the study site over a 14-week period. Subjects will
      consume 8 capsules of the assigned test product twice daily (that is, 16 capsules daily).
      Capsules will be taken with at least 6 ounces of water approximately 30 minutes before
      breakfast and 30 minutes before dinner. If a subject qualifies, he/she will be randomly (by
      chance) assigned to one of three study treatment groups. Subjects in one group will consume
      capsules containing a daily dose of 3.2 grams of AOBO-001; a second group will consume
      capsules containing a daily dose of 6.4 grams of AOBO-001; and a third group will consume
      capsules containing a placebo (no active ingredients). Subjects will have a 2 in 3 chance of
      being assigned to an active study treatment group. Neither the subject nor the study doctor
      will know to which study treatment group the subject has been assigned, but this information
      is available in case of a medical emergency. There will be a time during the study dosing
      schedule when all subjects will consume capsules containing a placebo (no active
      ingredients). Subjects will not be told when they are receiving the placebo.

      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial will evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of AOBO-001 in adults with overactive bladder. The primary objective of
      this study is to evaluate the efficacy of AOBO 001 compared with placebo on the basis of the
      change from baseline in average number of micturition episodes per 24 hours from the 3-day
      diaries and average number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours from the 3 day
      diaries during the double-blind treatment period in adult patients with OAB. Secondary
      efficacy objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of AOBO-001 compared with placebo on the
      basis of the number and severity of urgency episodes by using the Patient's Perception of
      Intensity of Urgency Scale (PPIUS), nocturia episodes, volume voided per micturition, and
      Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) global assessment measure. An additional
      secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AOBO-001 compared with
      placebo.

      Eligible patients will be randomized in equal proportions to double-blind treatment with AOBO
      001 1.6 g twice daily (3.2 g daily), AOBO-001 3.2 g twice daily (6.4 g daily) or placebo
      capsules twice daily.

      Efficacy assessments include urinary diary assessments, including the number of micturitions
      (daytime, nighttime), number of urge incontinence episodes, number/grading of urgency
      episodes (Patient's Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale or PPIUS), and volume of voided
      urine; and Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) questionnaire. Safety assessments
      include post-void residual urine volume measured by bladder scan; vital signs, 12-lead ECGs,
      complete or brief physical examinations, clinical laboratory safety tests, and
      treatment-emergent adverse events.
