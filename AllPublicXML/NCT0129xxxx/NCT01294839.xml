  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double blinded, multi-center, controlled study to evaluate
      the clinical impact at 18 months after DDD implantation of alternative pacing site (RVOTs and
      RVA) and the different conduction path (RVOTs and AV node) on cardiac dysfunction prevention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ventricular pacing is unavoidable in many patients because of unreliable or absent AV
      conduction, or permanent AF. In recognition of this need, interest has focused on alternative
      site(s) ventricular pacing to maximize pumping function. These sites include the RV septum,
      His bundle, various LV sites, and combination of LV and RV (biventricular [BiV]). The RV
      outflow tract septum (RVOTs) seems to be the most promising site within the RV.

      However, small enrollment and inconsistent experimental methods hinder the interpretation of
      these studies. Locations of alternative pacing sites were not clearly specified, were largely
      topographic, and lacked consistent anatomic designation. And what is more, there was no
      prospective, double-blind randomized, multi-center clinical trial which is design to test
      whether RVOTs pacing is superior to right ventricular apical pacing in preserving left
      ventricular systolic function and avoiding adverse left ventricular remodeling in patients
      with a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, ventricular synchrony and standard
      indications for pacing (sinus node dysfunction) in China. There was also no prospective,
      double-blind randomized, multi-center clinical trial which is design to test whether RVOTs
      pacing is not inferior to AAIR pacing in preserving left ventricular systolic function and
      avoiding adverse left ventricular remodeling in patients with a normal left ventricular
      ejection fraction, ventricular synchrony and sinus node dysfunction in the world.

      So SJM China will sponsor a prospective, randomized, double blinded, multi-center, controlled
      study to evaluate the clinical impact at 18 months after DDD implantation of alternative
      pacing site (RVOTs and RVA) and the different conduction path (RVOTs and AV node) on cardiac
      dysfunction prevention.
