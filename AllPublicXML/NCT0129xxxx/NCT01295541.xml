      The current study is proposed to assess the frequency and type of progressive mobility
      procedures currently performed in the CVICU The study will evaluate the type and frequency of
      progressive mobility orders, whether or not progressive mobility steps are being taken by the
      nursing teams, define what steps patients are receiving, and record time to first weight
      bearing. Other outcome measures will be the days of required mechanical ventilation, and
      current ICU length of stay and cost to treat.

      This will be a descriptive 4 month study of standard care practice. Patients who meet the
      inclusion / exclusion criteria for study will be enrolled (Waiver of informed consent is
      requested) and followed for a maximum of 28 days. The type and frequency of progressive
      mobility orders, whether or not progressive mobility steps are being taken by the nursing
      teams, define what steps patients are receiving, and record time to first weight bearing will
      be recorded. Weight bearing will be defined as standing for at least 1 minute. ICU LOS,
      Ventilator Days will be assessed at ICU discharge for study patients. Barriers to PM
      procedures will also be assessed.
