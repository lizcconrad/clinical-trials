      This study is designed to determine whether TC-6987 improves respiratory function in subjects
      with asthma by reducing airway hyper-responsiveness and inflammation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common, chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways that affects an estimated 20
      to 22 million people in the United States. It is characterized by variable and recurring
      symptoms, notably airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and an underlying
      inflammation. The bronchospasm is caused by inflammation of the muscles surrounding the air
      passageways, making them smaller, thus more difficult for air to freely move in and out of
      the lungs. Cardinal symptoms of asthma include coughing, chest tightness, shortness of breath
      and wheezing. These symptoms are often more severe in the morning and late night, and usually
      reversible with medications. Clinically, asthma is typically classified according to the
      frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow
      rate.

      The rationale for this Phase II proof of concept study is to demonstrate that TC-6987
      improves respiratory function in subjects with asthma, compared to placebo, as measured by
      the Baseline FEV1 on Day 1 compared to the End-of-Treatment FEV1 on Day 28 or Early
      Withdrawal (EW); and also to assess the safety and tolerability profile of TC-6987 in
      subjects with asthma.

             of daily treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).

          2. A FEV1 value at Screening that is 60-90% of predicted FEV1.

          3. Age 18 to 65, males or females.
