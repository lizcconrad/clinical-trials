  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, multi-national, randomized, open-label comparative trial. After
      screening, the subjects will start down-regulation treatment on Day 21-22 of the cycle.
      Down-regulation treatment will start within 2 months following the screening visit. The
      routine long luteal phase protocol for gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist
      treatment will be followed. Once down-regulation has been confirmed, a pregnancy test will be
      performed just before randomization and start of recombinant human follicle-stimulating
      hormone (r-hFSH) treatment to rule out any pre-existing pregnancy. If the result is negative,
      the subject will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms of the trial:

        -  GONAL-f®: (Liquid Pen; 300 international unit [IU] of per day) stimulation Day 1-5
           followed by Pergoveris® (vial/powder, 300 IU per day) from stimulation Day 6 and until
           required recombinant human chorionic hormone (r-hCG) criterion is met. The dose can be
           adjusted from stimulation Day 6 (increased or decreased) based upon the subject's
           ovarian response and according to the center's standard practice.

        -  Pergoveris®: (vial/powder, 300 IU per day) from stimulation Day 1 and until required
           r-hCG criterion is met. The dose can be adjusted from stimulation Day 6 (increased or
           decreased) based upon the subject's ovarian response and according to the center's
           standard practice.

      Randomization across the two treatment arms will be kept balanced in a 1:1 ratio. Follicular
      development will be monitored according to the center's standard practice by ultrasound (US)
      and/or estradiol (E2) levels, until the protocol r-hCG requirement is met (i.e., at least one
      follicle greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 18 millimeter [mm] and two follicles &gt;=16 mm). After
      this, a single injection of r-hCG will be administered in order to induce final oocyte
      maturation.

      At a time of 34-38 hours after r-hCG administration, oocytes will be recovered vaginally
      under US monitoring. Oocytes will then be fertilized in vitro and embryos replaced 2-5 days
      after oocyte recovery. Ovum pick up (OPU), in vitro fertilization (IVF), embryo transfer (ET)
      and luteal support will be performed as per center's standard practice.

      A post-treatment safety visit will be performed for all subjects who received r-hCG (pregnant
      and non- pregnant) on Day 15-20 post-hCG. For subjects who have withdrawn from treatment
      (i.e. after starting Pergoveris® or Gonal-f® but before hCG is given) this visit will take
      place 20-30 days after their first Pergoveris® or Gonal-f® treatment injection (excluding
      pregnancy testing).

        <description>The total number of oocytes retrieved per reporting group on the day of ovum pick-up (OPU) (34-38 hours post r-hCG day) was calculated.

          <description>Ovarian Hyper Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS) is a syndrome which can manifest with enlarged ovaries, advanced ascites with increased vascular permeability, pleural fluid accumulation, hemoconcentration, and increased blood clotting. Early OHSS was defined as the onset of OHSS occurring within 9 days after oocyte retrieval and late OHSS was defined as the onset of OHSS occurring on or after day 10 from oocyte retrieval.</description>
