    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study being conducted to determine the metabolism and physiological
      disposition of radiolabeled LY2603618 after a single dose in patients with advanced and/or
      metastatic solid tumors.

      After a minimum 7-day washout period following the [14C]LY2603618 dose, patients will be
      allowed to continue to receive continued access to LY2603618 in combination with pemetrexed
      or gemcitabine as outpatients.

    <description>Single 250 mg intravenous dose of LY2603618 containing [14C] LY2603618.
After the completion of a minimum 7 day wash out period, patients may receive additional doses of LY2603618 in combination as follows:
Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 with 230 mg LY2603618 being administered on days 2, 9 and 16 of a 28-day cycle OR
Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 on day 1 and 275 mg LY2603618 on day 2 of a 21-day cycle
Patients will be allowed to continue to receive the combination therapy until fulfilling one of the criteria for discontinuation, such as unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a histological or cytological diagnosis of cancer (solid tumor), with clinical or
             radiologic evidence of locally advanced and/or metastatic disease, for which no
             life-prolonging therapy exists (that is, refractory to standard therapy and/or
             therapies known to provide clinical benefit, or for which no standard therapy exists)
             Note: Patients who have had progressive disease after receiving pemetrexed for
             metastatic disease are excluded from receiving the combination with pemetrexed during
             the safety extension study. Patients who have had progressive disease after receiving
             gemcitabine for metastatic disease are excluded from receiving the combination with
             gemcitabine during the safety extension study.

          -  Have a body surface area greater than or equal to 1.37 m^2

          -  Have given written informed consent prior to any study-specific procedures

          -  Adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function

          -  Have a performance status of less than or equal to 2 on the Eastern Cooperative
             Oncology Group (ECOG) scale

          -  Have discontinued all previous treatments for cancer, including chemotherapy,
             radiotherapy, anticancer hormone therapy, or other investigational therapy for at
             least 30 days prior to study entry and recovered from the acute effects of therapy (at
             least 42 days for mitomycin-C or nitrosoureas, or 60 days for monoclonal antibodies)

          -  Are reliable and willing to make themselves available for the duration of the study
             and are willing to follow study procedure

          -  Males and females with reproductive potential: Must agree to use medically approved
             contraceptive precautions during the study and following the last dose of study drug
             until, in the judgment of the investigator, it is safe for the patient to become
             pregnant or father a child

          -  Females with childbearing potential: Have had a negative serum pregnancy test less
             than or equal to 7 days before the first dose of study drug and must also not be
             breastfeeding

          -  Have an estimated life expectancy that, in the judgment of the investigator, will
             permit the patient to complete 1 full cycle of treatment (beyond the initial
             [14C]LY2603618 dose)

          -  Prior radiation therapy for treatment of cancer other than pancreatic is allowed to
             &lt;25% of the bone marrow and patients must have recovered from the acute toxic effects
             of their treatment prior to study enrollment. Prior radiation to the whole pelvis is
             not allowed. Prior radiotherapy must be completed at least 4 weeks before study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received treatment within 28 days of the initial dose of study drug with an
             experimental agent for noncancer indications that has not received regulatory approval
             for any indication

          -  Have previously completed or withdrawn from this study or any other study
             investigating LY2603618 or any other checkpoint kinase one (Chk1) inhibitor

          -  Have a known allergy to gemcitabine, pemetrexed, LY2603618, or any ingredient of
             gemcitabine, pemetrexed, or LY2603618 (like Captisol)

          -  Have serious preexisting medical conditions (left to the discretion of the
             investigator) other than advanced cancer

          -  Have symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or metastasis (screening not
             required). Patients with treated CNS metastases are eligible for this study if they
             are not currently receiving corticosteroids and/or anticonvulsants, and their disease
             is asymptomatic and radiographically stable for at least 90 days

          -  Have current hematologic malignancies or either acute or chronic leukemia

          -  Have an active fungal, bacterial, and/or known viral infection including HIV or viral
             (A, B, or C) hepatitis (screening is not required)

          -  Have a QTc interval of &gt;500 msec on the screening electrocardiogram (ECG)

          -  Have electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities on the screening ECG such as significant
             conduction abnormalities, ischemic changes (such as prior Q-wave myocardial infarction
             and/or marked ischemic ST- and T-wave), arrhythmias (such as persistent or paroxysmal
             ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation), or other
             ECG abnormalities that would put the patient at unnecessary risk in the opinion of the
             investigator

          -  Have participated in a 14C study within the last 6 months prior to screening for this
             study. The total exposure from this study and the previous study must be less than 5
             mSv.
