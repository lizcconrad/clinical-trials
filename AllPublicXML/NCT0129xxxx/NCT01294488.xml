      The overarching aim of the proposed study is to test the implementation effectiveness of two
      implementation approachesâ€”Remote Real-Time (RRT) using the internet telemedicine technology
      and traditional Phone Consultation (PC) for training practitioners in PCIT. The study will
      add to emerging knowledge about how technology can facilitate the transport of evidence-based
      intervention models into field settings.

      Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is an empirically supported behavioral parent
      training program for reducing aggressive behavior in young children and for reducing future
      rates of child physical abuse. Prior research has found that an adapted version of PCIT
      developed specifically for violent parents in the child welfare system reduced future child
      physical abuse recurrence rates from 49% to 19%. OUHSC/CCAN researchers, in prior and ongoing
      studies, have found the benefits of PCIT to be durable over time and to generalize across
      settings and across children in the same family. Culturally-specific adaptations of PCIT and
      adaptations for older abused children and their abusive parents have been developed. A number
      of blue-ribbon panels have recommended PCIT for widespread dissemination in child abuse
      prevention and intervention service systems, but uptake of PCIT has been limited. One reason
      for this is that the traditional PCIT practitioner training models are not easily replicable
      in field settings. PCIT has historically been taught in University-based training programs
      (graduate programs, internships, etc.) and includes several months of co-therapy mentoring
      where trainers work directly with trainees during live sessions. In contrast, given the
      difficulties of conducting co-therapy mentoring in field settings, training for widespread
      implementation has generally involved initial training in the model followed by phone
      consultation.

      OUHSC/CCAN researchers have pilot- and feasibility tested a system using internet-based
      telemedicine technology to deliver live, mentored PCIT training. OUHSC/CCAN researchers have
      piloted Remote Real-Time (RRT) training at sites in Utah, Seattle, Alaska, Oregon, and
      Oklahoma. Feasibility appears excellent, and the approach has been well received. Moreover,
      RRT implementation revealed misapplications of the model that had gone unaddressed in phone
      consultation. This research project will make use of planned, funded PCIT start-up
      implementations at 20-24 agency sites in Washington and Oklahoma. Study participants will
      include agency practitioners engaged in implementing the PCIT model and families receiving
      PCIT services at these community agencies. Using a multilevel interrupted time series
      randomized design; the study will compare the RRT implementation approach with standard phone
      consultation (PC). Outcomes will include practitioner fidelity and competency in implementing
      PCIT, practitioner acceptance and satisfaction with PCIT, and family outcomes of parental
      skill acquisition, parent satisfaction, child aggressive and oppositional behaviors, and
      rates of future child welfare abuse reports. A mediational model is proposed in which
      differences in client outcomes are mediated by improved practitioner fidelity and competency.
      Cost effectiveness and practitioner response to the implementation approach will be examined.
      The study thus will inform strategies for facilitating widespread dissemination and
      implementation with fidelity of the evidence-based PCIT model, thereby making the model
      available to a broader range of agencies and practitioners working with at-risk families.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A major inclusion criterion for agencies is existing plans and financial support for PCIT
        implementation because this study's resources cannot fund the phase one didactic training
        or clinical implementation. The proposed agencies all have existing funding, including
        demonstration grants, Children's Justice grant funding, state contracts, federal
        implementation funding, Indian Health Services funding, or SAMHSA funding specifically to
        support their PCIT implementation. However without the current project, none of the agency
        sites proposed for this study would be using RRT or assessing therapist fidelity; this
        study thus provides quality assurance mechanisms that would be unavailable otherwise. The
        agencies have reviewed and agreed to a set of agency inclusion criteria for study
        participation:

          -  The agency should be committed to developing a PCIT program, not simply training
             staff. There should be a commitment by leadership to the program's long-term
             sustainability, including sustaining the program through staff turn-over.

          -  The agency should identify a minimum of three staff for PCIT training (with two staff
             members acceptable from very small agencies that do not have three child service
             providers), at least one of which is a supervisor. Licensed mental health practitioner
             staff with a Master's degree or higher are strongly preferred, although exceptions may
             be made in cases where agencies do not have Master's level staff. (For example, some
             agencies conducting culturally relevant programs for minority or rural populations are
             not always able to employ licensed mental health provider staff. Because RRT may be
             especially salient for some of these agencies, these agencies will not be excluded
             from the study.)

          -  The agency should be committed to providing the resources and staff availability to
             complete the basic PCIT training package, standard PC consultation, and staff
             participation in approximately six months of RRT training.

          -  The agency should have or be in the process of developing the physical infrastructure
             to deliver PCIT. Physical infrastructure includes PCIT rooms with sound equipment,
             bug-in-the-ear equipment, and video recording equipment.

          -  The agency will need to have a dedicated broadband internet line for the RRT
             equipment.

          -  The agency should be able to demonstrate that it has or will develop a referral
             network sufficient to provide enough PCIT cases so that therapists can develop
             mastery. This can include referral commitments and support from local child welfare
             offices, courts, schools, and so forth. If the agency plans to serve child welfare
             parents whose children are in foster care, it is imperative that there are firm
             commitments for a transportation plan. Preliminary work may be necessary to gain the
             cooperation of child welfare and courts to insure that service plans and court orders
             are consistent with PCIT (i.e. allowing joint parent-child sessions).

          -  The agency agrees that basic PCIT training will meet OUHSC training guidelines (to be
             described later).

          -  If clients consent to participate, the agency agrees to archive video recordings of
             all PCIT sessions and basic PCIT clinical measures from clients.

          -  The agency is in a state that agrees to provide OUHSC with child welfare outcome data.

          -  In the event the agency's PCIT start-up plan requires that they begin PCIT services
             prior to the start of the study, they will commence archiving session and client data
             so that early session fidelity and competency and client outcomes can be tracked.
             Standard PC consultation will be provided until the study begins. Session- and
             client-level data are routinely collected as part of PCIT implementation, to guide
             clinical intervention and assure quality of services. However, no data will be used
             for research purposes unless therapists and clients provide informed consent for its
             use.

          -  The study will retain the right to involuntarily remove an agency and its therapists
             from the study if PCIT implementation and data collection at the agency proves
             infeasible.
