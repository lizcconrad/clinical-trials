  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>

      compared to vitamin complex, in the treatment of lack of appetite and prevention of
      deficiency of B and C vitamins.

    <textblock>
      Apevinat BC presents in its formula the cyproheptadine hydrochloride, which is an
      antihistamine and anti-serotonin with stimulant of appetite property associated with the
      vitamin B complex and C, in balanced amounts.

      This combination is specially formulated to adequately serve patients with anorexia
      represented by lack of appetite or appetite diverted to diets without the necessary vitamins.
      For the anorexic patients that are common B and C hypovitaminosis, the use of Apevinat BC
      will have a synergistic and joint action to increase appetite and facilitate correction of a
      diet while also supplement with B and C vitamins, this association does not decreases its
      tolerability and safety but hits adequately the purpose of therapeutic orexigenic.

      The current study will compare the efficacy and tolerability of Apevinat BC to vitamin
      complex administered three times a day, in the prevention and treatment of lack of appetite
      and B and C hypovitaminosis.
