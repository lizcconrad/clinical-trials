      This prospective observational study is designed to find out what treatment options new
      patients with chronic kidney disease learn about from their renal unit.

      Aims: To determine the proportion of new CKD patients who receive information about treatment
      options prior to commencing dialysis, pre−emptive transplantation or conservative management.
      To determine the timing (i.e. patient's stage of disease) when information is given. To find
      out whether patients have a friend or family member with them when information is given.

      Research Design and methods: This study is an assessment of CKD education practices.
      Nephrologists and pre−dialysis coordinators from each renal unit will complete questionnaires
      about information that was given to each new dialysis, pre−emptive transplant or
      conservatively managed patient that started treatment during a 3 month period.

      Study hypothesis: Approximately one third of CKD patients will receive information after
      starting treatment. There will be a positive association between in−centre haemodialysis and
      later referral, non−English speaking background, and advancing age. Significance: The results
      from this national audit will provide Australian nephrologists and renal nurses with evidence
      about CKD education practices and compliance with clinical practice guidelines. The results
      may highlight opportunities for improvement in practice.

      Additional research objectives and key research questions:

      1. To determine the proportion of patients who receive information about: pre−emptive
      transplantation; peritoneal dialysis; home haemodialysis; centre based haemodialysis;
      supported non−dialytic care or conservative management.

      3. To determine the proportion of incident patients that have a non−English speaking
      background (NESB) requiring an interpreter or translated materials.

      4. To examine associations between age, gender, health insurance status, NESB, CKD stage and
      information provided on initial treatment commenced.

      5. To determine the proportion of patients who choose not to dialyse.
