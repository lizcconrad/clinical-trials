      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of lacosamide on mood and quality of
      life in people with epilepsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lacosamide (LCM) was found in phase 3 studies to have good efficacy and tolerability as
      adjunctive treatment in adult patients with uncontrolled partial onset seizures, with or
      without secondary generalization. Dose-related adverse drug reactions (ADRs) included
      dizziness, headache and nausea, but the incidence of reported mood symptoms was similar to
      placebo. The very low incidence of such events, combined with LCM's unique mechanism of
      action, suggest that LCM has the potential to be among the few anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs)
      without clinically significant mood ADRs.

      The effects of LCM on mood states (i.e., worsening or improvement) have not been examined
      with standardized measures. In addition, its effects on quality of life (QOL) have not been
      explored, although QOL is known to be affected by other AEDs.

      The investigators propose to examine the effects of LCM on mood and QOL in a real-world
      population of adult patients with partial-onset seizures. To the knowledge of the
      investigators, the proposed study will be the first to examine these domains in a
      scientifically rigorous fashion in patients treated with LCM. Thus, study results will fill a
      current knowledge gap, and will provide important information to clinicians and patients when
      considering LCM treatment.
