  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 study is being conducted to evaluate 3 increasing subcutaneous (SC) doses (50,
      mg, 100 mg or 200mg) of mipomersen in Japanese healthy volunteers. Eligible subjects will
      receive a single study injection of either mipomersen or placebo. Subjects will be enrolled
      into 1 of 3 treatment cohorts (Cohorts A, B, and C) in a dose-escalation design.
      Dose-escalation will proceed only if there is an acceptable safety profile from the previous
      dosing level.
