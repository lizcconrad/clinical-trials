      A Phase 1, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Observer-Blinded, Escalating Dose-Ranging Study to
      Assess the Safety, and immunogenicity of 6 different recombinant RSV-F formulations in
      healthy adults (18 to 49 years of age).

      Study Objectives:

      Primary:

        -  To assess and compare the safety, reactogenicity, and tolerability of 6 RSV-F protein
           particle vaccine formulations.

      Secondary:

        -  To assess and compare the immunogenicity (neutralizing antibody and total anti-F
           antibody) of the 6 RSV-F protein particle vaccine formulations

        -  To confirm the &quot;dose sparing&quot; and &quot;value added&quot; effects of the aluminum phosphate
           adjuvant

      A total of 150 subjects will be allocated to 7 cohorts. Subjects will be randomly assigned to
      vaccine treatment or saline placebo in a 4:1 ratio, such that each cohort will include 20
      subjects who receive active vaccine (Groups A, B, C, D, F and G) and 5 subjects who receive
      placebo (Group E).

      Subjects will be followed for all AEs, including SAEs and non-serious AEs, from the time of
      each vaccination through 30 days following the second vaccination (Day 60Â±5). After Day 60,
      subjects will be contacted via telephone on a monthly basis (approximately Days 90, 120, 150,
      180, and 210) and asked about the occurrence of SAEs and SNMCs.
