  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is a common major complication of
      cardiopulmonary bypass. &quot;Emergency Hematopoiesis&quot; is the pathological process induced by the
      inflammation. The investigators previously confirmed that emergency hematopoiesis induced by
      cardiopulmonary bypass led to dynamic changes of quantities of monocyte subsets, there is a
      significant increase in the number of two monocyte subsets: 1) CD14highCD16+ monocyte with
      strong immunomodulatory activity; 2) CD14lowCD16- monocyte with potential ability of
      proliferation and differentiation. Therefore, a new hypothesis risen: &quot;the change of the
      function and the number of monocyte subsets induced by emergency hematopoiesis play an
      important role for SIRS occurrence after cardiopulmonary bypass, correcting emergency
      hematopoiesis is a new breakthrough in the prevention and treatment of SIRS.&quot; To identify the
      mechanism of function changed in different monocyte subsets during the pathogenesis of SIRS,
      the research intended to target perioperative-period patients with heart valve replacement,
      monitor dynamically the number and phenotype of peripheral blood monocyte subsets by flow
      cytometry; sort out of different monocyte subsets for cell culture in vitro, observe the
      ability of proliferation and differentiation and effects between monocyte subsets and T
      lymphocyte; investigate the mechanism of immune function changes with antibody-blocking and
      compartment culture in patients; observe the impact of glucocorticoid treatment on the
      emergency hematopoiesis, offer new objects for evaluation of immune status in patients and
      provide new evidence for anti-inflammatory therapy .

      Patients should be follow the protocol of cardiopulmonary bypass according to normal hospital
      routine practice.

      A total of 30 patients will be enrolled in this clinical trial.
