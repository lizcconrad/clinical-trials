  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given that the uncinate process is the gatekeeper of the sinuses, we hypothesize that
      inflammation of the uncinate process is associated with decreased ventilation and drainage of
      the paranasal sinuses and consequently with the inflammatory process occuring in the sinuses.

      The purpose of the present study is to gain insight into the histopathological changes of the
      uncinate process in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis through comparison of its mucosal
      and bony elements with those of the normal uncinate process without chronic inflammation
      (unpublished data: Gilead Berger, Ephraim Eviatar, Tatiana Kogan, Roee Landsberg).

    <description>Adult patients with chronic rhinosinusitis who failed treatment with antibiotics and topical corticosteroids and underwent endoscopic sinus surgery. Preoperative evaluation included paranasal sinus CT scans. The diagnosis was confirmed by endoscopic examination showing purulent and/or mucopurulent discharge in the middle and/or superior meatus.</description>

          -  Failed conservative medical treatment.
