    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the potential beneficial cardiometabolic effect of moderate (5%)
      weight loss and progressive (5%, 10%, and 15%) weight loss in obese adults without diabetes.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of 2 groups. Group 1: supervised weight loss
      group (low-calorie diet). Group 2: supervised weight maintenance group (normal diet). Of
      those assigned to group 1, half of the participants will lose 5% of their body weight and the
      other half will lose 5%, 10%, and 15% of their weight over time under the guidance of a
      dietitian. Research testing will be repeated at each time point (5%, 10%, and 15% weight
      loss). In group 2, research testing will be repeated after six months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Insulin Sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline through weight loss (approximately one year)</time_frame>
    <description>In the weight-loss arm we will measure insulin sensitivity at baseline, after 5% weight loss, after 10% weight loss and again after 15% weight loss. Each weight loss phase will last an average of four months for a total of approximately one year. In the weight maintenance arm we will measure insulin sensitivity at baseline and after six months.</description>

    <measure>intra-hepatic triglyceride</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline through weight loss (approximately one year)</time_frame>
    <description>In the weight-loss arm we will measure intra-hepatic triglyceride at baseline, after 5% weight loss, after 10% weight loss and again after 15% weight loss. Each weight loss phase will last an average of four months for a total of approximately one year. In the weight maintenance arm we will measure intra-hepatic triglyceride at baseline and after six months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>total cholesterol</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline through weight loss (approximately one year)</time_frame>
    <description>In the weight-loss arm we will measure total cholesterol at baseline, after 5% weight loss, after 10% weight loss and again after 15% weight loss. Each weight loss phase will last an average of four months for a total of approximately one year. In the weight maintenance arm we will measure total cholesterol at baseline and after six months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>systolic blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline through weight loss (approximately one year)</time_frame>
    <description>In the weight-loss arm we will measure systolic blood pressure at baseline, after 5% weight loss, after 10% weight loss and again after 15% weight loss. Each weight loss phase will last an average of four months for a total of approximately one year. In the weight maintenance arm we will measure systolic blood pressure at baseline and after six months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cell proliferation (growth) rates in the colon - optional procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline through weight loss (approximately four months to one year)</time_frame>
    <description>Colon cell proliferation rates will be determined using stable isotope labelled tracer methods in conjunction with sigmoid colon biopsy samples. In the weight-loss arm we will measure colonocyte proliferation rate at baseline, and once again after weight loss (either 5% weight loss, or 10% weight loss, or 15% weight loss; i.e. only one time after weight loss). Each weight loss phase will last an average of four months for a total of approximately one year. In the weight maintenance arm we will measure colonocyte proliferation rate at baseline and after six months.</description>
