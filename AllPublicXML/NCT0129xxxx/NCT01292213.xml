  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of Haemophilus influenzae and other
      bacteria in causing chronic cough, through a direct comparison of chronic cough cases and
      healthy controls recruited from paediatric respiratory clinics in the United Kingdom.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    • Long delay due to challenges with sample analysis at local labs; • Low recruitment of case
    and control subjects; • Constant staff turn-over in the sites.

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Children aged six to 72 months, residing in the United Kingdom. These children will be
        classified as cases and controls.

        Cases will be children who have had persistent cough for greater than eight weeks and are
        undergoing general anaesthesia for clinically indicated bronchoscopy/ bronchoalveolar
        lavage as part of the diagnostic process for chronic cough.

        Controls will be children who are undergoing general anaesthesia with endotracheal
        intubation for elective surgery or endoscopy for non-respiratory-related conditions and had
        no acute or chronic respiratory symptoms during the four weeks prior to the visit.

          -  No documented evidence or suspicion of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

          -  No evidence of an upper viral respiratory infection four weeks prior to the visit.

        In addition, all subjects regarded as 'cases' must satisfy all the following criteria at
        study entry:

          -  Persistent cough greater than eight weeks.

          -  No response to five-day prednisolone treatment.

          -  Chest X-ray showing no evidence of a lobar pneumonia or gross structural abnormality.

        In addition, all subjects regarded as 'controls' must satisfy the following criteria at
        study entry:

          -  No respiratory symptoms four weeks prior to the visit.

          -  No documented evidence or suspicion of lung disease upon physical examination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrently participating in another study, at any time during the study period, in
             which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a
             non-investigational product.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product within 30 days prior to study
             procedures, or planned use during the study period.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination.

          -  Child in care.
