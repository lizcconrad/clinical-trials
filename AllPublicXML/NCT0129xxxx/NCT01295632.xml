  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two part study of the drug MK-8669 (ridaforolimus) given with MK-2206 or MK-0752.
      In Part A of the study, the preliminary maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the drug combinations
      will be found by giving sequentially higher doses of the study drugs. An expansion cohort of
      participants may be enrolled to confirm the MTD. New cohorts at other dose levels may be
      enrolled, depending on the rate of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the planned cohorts. In
      Part B, an assessment of the efficacy of the drug combinations against selected advanced
      cancers will be made so that a recommended dose to be used in Phase 2 studies (RPTD) can be
      found. As of 19 July 2012 the MK-0752 arms of the study were fully enrolled and closed to
      further recruitment. As of 30 November 2012, no additional participants with prostate cancer
      will be enrolled.
