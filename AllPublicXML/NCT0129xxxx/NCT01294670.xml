  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how safe and effective treatment with a new
      combination of drugs, vorinostat and etoposide, is in treating cancer. The medication
      etoposide is a standard medication used in the treatment of cancer in children. Vorinostat is
      an experimental drug which targets a protein(s) that control the way cancer cells grow and
      divide. Vorinostat is approved by the FDA in adults with certain cancers but not approved yet
      in children.

      There are two parts to this study. In the first part of this study, the phase I portion, a
      safe dose of the combination, vorinostat and etoposide. The goal of second part of this
      study, the phase II portion, is to see how effective the combination of vorinostat and
      etoposide is in treating cancer.

    <description>Patients will be assessed in 3-week cycles. Escalating doses of vorinostat will be administered orally on a daily x 4 schedule in combination with a fixed dose of etoposide. Etoposide will be administered intravenously daily x 3 days. Cohorts of 3-6 patients will be treated with vorinostat and etoposide. In the phase II component, patients will be treated at the RP2D established in the Phase I component of the study, which was found to be 270 mg/m2/dose of Vorinostat and 100 mg/m2/dose of Etoposide.</description>

             CNS disease (e.g. cranial nerve abnormalities) without cytologic abnormality in the
             CSF should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and
             known propensity for the development of progressive neurologic dysfunction that would
             confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. Patients with
             metastatic CNS tumors will not be excluded from enrollment on this study in the phase
             I component only.

             fungal infection, acute or chronic graft versus host disease, symptomatic congestive
             heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive within the
             projected duration of the study. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             vorinostat, lactating patients will be excluded from this study.

          -  Patients known to be Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-positive.

             stable following treatment for these conditions is eligible.

          -  Patients who are at the time of signing informed consent, a regular user of any
             illicit drugs, substance abuser or who have a recent history of drug or alcohol abuse.

          -  Patients who have a history of gastrointestinal surgery or other procedures that might
