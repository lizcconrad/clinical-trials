      Rationale:

      Due to western lifestyle human coronary arteries are prone to develop atherosclerotic
      plaques. Hence the heart is an important target organ for atherothrombotic complications:
      myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction and heart failure. To alleviate
      symptoms and decrease mortality in these patients, myocardial revascularisation is
      recommended. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is indicated in patients with severe
      atherosclerotic disease of all three coronary arteries or the left main stem coronary artery.
      Cardiac ischemia and reperfusion injury during CABG is inevitable and jointly accountable for
      complications that occur after CABG (e.g. death, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, stroke,
      or renal complications). Dipyridamole has been shown to reduce ischemia reperfusion injury in
      healthy volunteers using an intermediate endpoint and may prevent cardiovascular death or
      event in secondary prevention after cerebrovascular disease. The investigators hypothesise
      that oral pre-treatment with dipyridamole can increase cardiac tissue tolerance against
      ischemia and reperfusion injury due to CABG. The investigators expect lower troponin-I
      release in patients who were pretreated with dipyridamole.

      Objective: To study the effect of oral pretreatment with dipyridamole on high sensitivity
      (HS)-troponin-I release after CABG. Secondary objectives are whether oral pretreatment with
      dipyridamole reduces postoperative CABG arrhythmias, prolonged inotropic support, and
      duration of Intensive Care-stay. Further secondary endpoints are the effects of dipyridamole
      pretreatment on renal injury and post-ischemic recovery of contractile function (measured
      ex-vivo).

      Hypothesis:

      The investigators hypothesize that oral pre-treatment with dipyridamole can increase cardiac
      tissue tolerance against ischemia and reperfusion injury. The investigators expect lower
      HS-troponin-I release in patients who were pretreated with dipyridamole. Additionally the
      investigators expect the incidence of arrhythmias, need for prolonged inotropic support
      (longer than 24 hours postoperative) to be decreased in pretreated patients.
