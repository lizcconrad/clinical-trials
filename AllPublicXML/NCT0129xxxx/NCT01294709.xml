  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety of telcagepant in coronary artery disease (CAD)
      participants with stable angina during exercise treadmill testing and evaluate whether
      calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonism by telcagepant reduces exercise
      tolerance in these participants. Primary hypothesis is that telcagepant does not
      significantly decrease exercise duration compared to placebo, as measured by a treadmill
      exercise test; that is, the true treatment difference in exercise duration (MK-0974 -
      Placebo) &gt;= -60 seconds.

      Amendment 3 of the protocol reduced the dose of telcagepant to be administered from a single
      dose of 900 mg to a single dose of 600 mg. Pooled data from both the 600-mg and the 900-mg
      group wiil be utilized in the analyses. Also due to supply issues regarding the 300 mg
      telcagepant capsules, 280 mg telcagepant tablets with demonstrated bioequivalence to the 300
      mg telcagepant capsules, could be administered to participants enrolled after the
      implementation of Amendment 3.

    <description>Bruce (and Modified Bruce) Protocol was used to assess the exercise duration on a treadmill. This protocol consists of a standardized gradual incremental increase in external workload every 3 minutes while the participant's electrocardiogram (ECG), symptoms, and arm blood pressure were continuously monitored. Regardless of whether the participant believed he or she could continue, the test was discontinued upon evidence of chest discomfort, severe shortness of breath, dizziness, fatigue, ST-segment depression of greater than 2 mm, a fall in systolic blood pressure exceeding 10 mmHg, or the development of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia</description>

    <time_frame>2.5 to approximately 2.75 hours post dose of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Bruce (and Modified Bruce) Protocol was used to assess the exercise duration on a treadmill. This protocol consists of a standardized gradual incremental increase in external workload every 3 minutes while the participant's ECG, symptoms, and arm blood pressure were continuously monitored. The time of peak exercise was considered the time at which the participant reached at least one of the criteria for stopping the treadmill test (evidence of chest discomfort, severe shortness of breath, dizziness, fatigue, ST-segment depression of greater than 2 mm, a fall in systolic blood pressure exceeding 10 mmHg, or the development of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia). The ECG for that timepoint (time of peak exercise) was evaluated and the amount of ST segment depression was determined.</description>

             at prestudy), breast-feeding, or is a female expecting to conceive within the
             projected duration of the study. Postmenopausal women who are currently using hormone
             replacement therapy are excluded from participation in the study.

          -  Participant has electrocardiogram (ECG) findings that interfere with ECG
             interpretation or may cause false positive stress test (e.g., &gt; 1 mm horizontal or

             test results; there may be other findings that have not been included which may affect
             test results. These ECG findings are exclusions only if these findings may jeopardize
             interpretation of stress test results.

             medication, that in the opinion of the investigator is likely to result in
             hypoglycemia within 8 hours of dosing.

          -  Participant has had myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization within the
             prior 2 months.

          -  Participant has acute myocarditis or pericarditis.

          -  Participant is obese, with adipose tissue which may interfere with ECG interpretation,
             or in the opinion of the investigator, whose obesity puts the participant at medical
             risk.

          -  Participant has clinically significant hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia.

          -  Participant has a history of any illness that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             might confound the results of the study or poses an additional risk to the participant
             by their participation in the study.

          -  Participant must not have taken any of the following medications in the time frame
             specified: Participant is unable to refrain from or anticipates the use of any herbal
             remedies beginning approximately 2 weeks (or 5 half-lives) prior to administration of
             the initial dose of study drug, throughout the study (including washout intervals
             between treatments), until the post-study visit; participant is unable to refrain from
             taking a drug metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) until at least 48 hours post
             dose (the exact length of time a specific drug metabolized by CYP3A4 is withheld is
             dependent on the therapeutic index of the drug and the extent to which it is
             metabolized by CYP3A4); participant consumes excessive amounts of alcohol which, in

        <description>Bruce (and Modified Bruce) Protocol was used to assess the exercise duration on a treadmill. This protocol consists of a standardized gradual incremental increase in external workload every 3 minutes while the participant’s ECG, symptoms, and arm blood pressure were continuously monitored.

The ECG for that timepoint (time of peak exercise) was evaluated and the amount of ST segment depression was determined.</description>

        <description>Bruce (and Modified Bruce) Protocol was used to assess the exercise duration on a treadmill. This protocol consists of a standardized gradual incremental increase in external workload every 3 minutes while the participant’s ECG, symptoms, and arm blood pressure were continuously monitored. The ECG was reviewed and the time to the first ST segment depression of 1 mm was recorded.</description>
