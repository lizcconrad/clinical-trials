    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the plasma levels of Soluble Urokinase Plasminogen
      Activator Receptor (suPAR) at the diagnosis and after treatment of sepsis, and to determine
      whether it has a diagnostic and prognostic value in late-onset neonatal sepsis.

    <textblock>
      Infection is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. The clinical
      presentation of neonatal infection is subtle and nonspecific. Microbiologic cultures of
      clinical specimens, the gold standard for diagnosis, have low sensitivity and are not
      available in time to influence initial therapy. Therefore, reliable and rapid in vitro tests
      are needed for early diagnosis and management of infection in neonates. suPAR, secreted from
      the cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells) has recently been
      reported to be a potential biomarker for several infection diseases. The levels of suPAR have
      not been studied in newborn infants yet.

    <description>Levels of suPAR will be dosed with suspicion of late-onset sepsis diagnosis at day 0 and at the end of the treatment. The evolution and the best cut-off values will be calculated for the diagnosis. Indices of sensibility, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value will be calculated.</description>
