  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase I/II study to assess the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032. The Phase I portion will be divided into two stages. During
      Stage 1, GDC-0032 will be administered every day orally and at escalating doses in
      participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. During Stage 2, GDC-0032 will
      be administered alone or as combination therapy within indication-specific cohorts. In Phase
      II of the study, the efficacy and safety of the combination GDC-0032 and fulvestrant will be
      evaluated in post-menopausal female participants with locally advanced or metastatic human
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.
