  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open label, non-comparative trial in Spain.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the complete response, defined as no
      vomiting and no use of rescue treatment, in women with early-stage breast cancer treated with
      one cycle of Docetaxel-Cyclophosphamide and active therapy for the prevention of
      CINV(Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting) day 1, 5-HT3 antagonist plus 3 days of
      dexamethasone. A second step (efficacy phase) is designed to examine the efficacy and
      tolerability of aprepitant in the second cycle among patients who failed to the previous CINV
      prevention treatment.

      The study will focus on early-stage chemonaïve breast cancer patients receiving
      docetaxel-cyclophosphamide and a 5-HT3 antagonist plus dexamethasone for the CINV prevention.
      The CINV incidence in those patients will be evaluated on the first cycle. All refractory
      patients, will be asked to participate in the second phase, where aprepitant on days 1, 2 and
      3 will be added to their antiemetic regimen.

      Assuming a drop out of 5%, 212 patients will be included in the study. It is anticipated that
      around 48 patients will enter the efficacy phase.

      The duration of the study, from first patient visit to last patient visit will be
      approximately 21 months.
