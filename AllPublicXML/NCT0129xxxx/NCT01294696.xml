  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a study to estimate the proportion of participants with osteoarthritis of the
      knee(s) who were treated with oral or topical analgesics for their symptoms, who did and did
      not report adequate pain relief at Baseline and to characterize their pain level over a
      12-month follow-up period.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Reported Adequate vs. Inadequate Pain Relief at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Participant pain at baseline was recorded using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). The BPI is an inventory of subject-reported questions, where for each pain severity item the response scale is 0 = No Pain and 10 = Worst Pain You Can Imagine. The questions refer to pain due to osteoarthritis in the affected knee in the last week: at its worst, at its least, on the average, and right now. Adequate pain control was defined as a score of &lt;=4 on question 5 of the BPI. Inadequate pain control was defined as a score &gt;4 on question 5 of the BPI. Question 5 of the BPI asked participants to rate their pain by circling the number that best describes their pain on the average scale from 0 to 10 (with 0=no pain and 10=worst pain imaginable).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Reported Adequate Relief From Joint Stiffness or Limitation in Physical Function at Baseline (Day 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Joint stiffness or limitation in physical function was evaluated using the Western Ontario and McMasters Universities (WOMAC) visual analog (VA)3.0 Index. The WOMAC VA 3.0 is a self-administered, tri-dimensional, disease-specific health status measure. It probes clinically important, subject-relevant symptoms in the areas of pain, joint stiffness and physical function in subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee. The index consists of 24 questions (5 pain, 2 stiffness and 17 physical function) and uses a VA scale of 0-500 mm for pain, 0-200 mm for stiffness, and 0-1700 for physical limitation with higher scores indicating poorer outcomes. Adequate pain was defined as participants reporting less than 4 on the BPI average pain scale.</description>

        <description>Participant pain at baseline was recorded using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). The BPI is an inventory of subject-reported questions, where for each pain severity item the response scale is 0 = No Pain and 10 = Worst Pain You Can Imagine. The questions refer to pain due to osteoarthritis in the affected knee in the last week: at its worst, at its least, on the average, and right now. Adequate pain control was defined as a score of &lt;=4 on question 5 of the BPI. Inadequate pain control was defined as a score &gt;4 on question 5 of the BPI. Question 5 of the BPI asked participants to rate their pain by circling the number that best describes their pain on the average scale from 0 to 10 (with 0=no pain and 10=worst pain imaginable).</description>

Question 5 of the BPI asked participants to rate their pain by circling the number that best describes their pain on the average scale from 0 to 10 (with 0=no pain and 10=worst pain imaginable).</description>

        <description>Joint stiffness or limitation in physical function was evaluated using the Western Ontario and McMasters Universities (WOMAC) visual analog (VA)3.0 Index. The WOMAC VA 3.0 is a self-administered, tri-dimensional, disease-specific health status measure. It probes clinically important, subject-relevant symptoms in the areas of pain, joint stiffness and physical function in subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee. The index consists of 24 questions (5 pain, 2 stiffness and 17 physical function) and uses a VA scale of 0-500 mm for pain, 0-200 mm for stiffness, and 0-1700 for physical limitation with higher scores indicating poorer outcomes. Adequate pain was defined as participants reporting less than 4 on the BPI average pain scale.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Reported Adequate Relief From Joint Stiffness or Limitation in Physical Function at Month 12</title>
        <description>Joint stiffness or limitation in physical function was evaluated using the Western Ontario and McMasters Universities (WOMAC) visual analog (VA)3.0 Index. The WOMAC VA 3.0 is a self-administered, tri-dimensional, disease-specific health status measure. It probes clinically important, subject-relevant symptoms in the areas of pain, joint stiffness and physical function in subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee. The index consists of 24 questions (5 pain, 2 stiffness and 17 physical function) and uses a VA scale of 0-500 mm for pain, 0-200 mm for stiffness, and 0-1700 for physical limitation with higher scores indicating poorer outcomes. Adequate pain was defined as participants reporting less than 4 on the BPI average pain scale.</description>
