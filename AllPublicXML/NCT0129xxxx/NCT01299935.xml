  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled clinical trial tests the hypothesis that a selected stress
      reduction approach, the Transcendental Meditation program will reduce all-cause mortality,
      myocardial infarction and stroke in African American patients with coronary heart disease.
      Secondary hypotheses include effects on other cardiovascular clinical events, blood pressure
      and psychosocial stress.

      The overall objective of this randomized controlled trial is to conduct a long-term
      evaluation of the effects of the Transcendental Meditation (TM) program compared to health
      education (HE) on secondary prevention of clinical events in African American men and women
      with coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients (N=201; mean age 59 yrs) were enrolled with
      documented CAD (i.e., coronary angiogram showing at least one artery with &gt; 50% stenosis).
      Patients were pretested at baseline and every 6-12 months for the duration of the study for
      incidence of clinical events, BP, BMI, medication usage, lifestyle behaviors, psychosocial
      stress factors and intervention compliance. Subjects were followed for a maximum of 9.2 years
      (mean 5.4 years). The investigators hypothesize that a selected stress reduction
      intervention, the TM program compared with a health education control may significantly
      reduce risk for death, MI and stroke in African American men and women with CHD. If
      successful, the Transcendental Meditation program may be clinically useful in the secondary
      prevention of cardiovascular disease in a high-risk population.

    <description>The Transcendental Meditation program is the principal mind-body approach of Maharishi Ayurveda, originating from the ancient Vedic tradition and introduced 50 years ago by Vedic scholar and teacher Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The Transcendental Meditation technique is described as a simple and natural procedure that is practiced 20 minutes twice a day while sitting comfortably with the eyes closed. Practice of the Transcendental Meditation technique does not require any changes in personal beliefs, philosophy or lifestyle. During the practice a unique state of restful alertness is gained. Acute and chronic physiological effects have been documented. The course is taught by instructors certified by Maharishi Foundation - USA.</description>
