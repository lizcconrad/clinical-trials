    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this pilot project is to test in 50 women with a history of
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), the effectiveness and feasibility of an 8 month
      intensive lifestyle intervention to reduce the rate of metabolic abnormalities within 1 year
      after delivery.

      The objective is in comparison to a group of women not enrolled in the lifestyle
      intervention, 8 months of intensive lifestyle intervention aimed at promoting 7% weight loss
      through increased physical activity and dietary modification in women with a history of GDM
      will:

        1. decrease body weight and

        2. reduce the rate of metabolic abnormalities, 12 months after delivery
