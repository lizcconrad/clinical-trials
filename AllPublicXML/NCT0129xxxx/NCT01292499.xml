  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RIMAT‐De study (Rete Italiana per il Miglioramento dell'Adesione al Trattamento nella
      Depressione) is a multicentric Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial aiming at identifying the
      best strategies available to reduce the poor compliance of patients with antidepressant
      drugs. Patients' compliance will be measured within six months of pharmacological treatment,
      comparing the specific contributions of brief psychotherapy and psychoeducational
      interventions: the psychoeducational intervention will encompass the monitoring of drugs'
      side effects and patients' satisfaction. In the rest of the document, for the sake of brevity
      the two treatments previously described will be indicated as &quot;psychotherapy&quot; and
      &quot;psychoeducation&quot;. These treatments will be compared with the treatment usually carried on by
      the mental health centers involved (i.e. treatment as usual, TAU). The factorial design of
      the study will take into consideration the combination of the two treatments (i.e.
      psychotherapy and psychoeducation) as well.

      Another important aim of the study is the investigation of whether the clinical improvement
      depends on the efficacy of the psychological treatments proposed per se, or whether they just
      contribute to increase the compliance with the pharmacological treatment, maintaining the
      patients on treatment longer and allowing the drugs to reach long‐lasting effects. While
      recognizing the general therapeutic efficacy of psychotherapy in the treatment of depressive
      disorders, nevertheless the present study aims at verifying whether an equal therapeutic
      effect may be reached via a better compliance with the pharmacological treatment, fostered
      for example by the psychoeducational intervention. The rationale lays on the ease of
      transferability of psychoeducational interventions to the general clinical practice, that
      usually suffers from lack of resources in implementing structured psychotherapy
      interventions.

    <description>The effect size is conceptualized as the difference between the proportion of patients in the 4 treatment arms showing good compliance at the end of the study.

    <description>Pharmacological treatment consists of the administration of a single antidepressant drug. The treatment will be administered as currently done by the mental health center, taking into due account patient's age, general health, previous response to antidepressant drugs, comorbidity, and potential side effects of drugs.</description>

    <description>Will receive psychotherapy as well (10 sessions). Psychoterapy will consist of 10 weekly sessions, lasting about 50 minutes each. Psychotherapy will begin after 4‐6 weeks from the beginning of the pharmacological treatment, to allow drugs to be effective. The overall list of visits scheduled for the patients is defined during the second psychiatric visit, to allow a reasonable planning of all of the appointments required for that particular patient. Psychotherapists will be free to follow the approach they were trained.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Will receive psychoeducation as well, with phone monitoring and regular follow‐ups. Psychoeducation does not simply mean making the patient aware of depression etiology and drugs effect. In fact, patients should receive additional counselling about how to integrate the pharmacological treatment in their daily routine and to solve possible problems, in order to allow them to be actively and constantly involved in the treatment they are going to receive. Patients will receive 7 sessions of psychoeducation and 7 phone calls during the first 5 months. In addition, all of the patients will receive a brochure explaining the most important aspects of their disorder.</description>
