  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will evaluate the effects of an integrated risk counseling program on
      behavioral and psychological outcomes in African American men and women in a randomized trial
      that is implemented and evaluated collaboratively through the West Philadelphia Consortium to
      Address Disparities. The specific aims of this research are as follows:

        1. To evaluate the effects of integrated versus disease specific counseling on risk
           exposure behaviors. The investigators predict that compared to individuals who receive
           disease specific counseling, those who receive integrated counseling will report greater
           intake of fruits and vegetables and increased rates of physical activity.

        2. To evaluate effects of integrated versus disease specific counseling on psychological
           outcomes. The investigators predict that compared to individuals who receive disease
           specific counseling, those who receive integrated counseling will report greater risk
           comprehension related to cancer and cardiovascular disease and will be more motivated to
           make behavioral changes.

        3. To identify the mechanisms through which integrated risk counseling leads to behavioral
           change. The investigators predict that changes in risk exposure behaviors (e.g., diet
           and physical activity) will be mediated by increased risk comprehension and
           self-efficacy for diet and physical activity.
