      The purpose of this study is to compare the improvement in ankle control and brain activation
      in subjects with stroke resulting from two different forms of telerehabilitation: tracking
      training, emphasizing accurate movements, versus movement training, involving simple
      movements.

      Hypotheses:

        1. The Track group will show greater improvement in ankle range of motion compared to the
           Move group.

        2. The Track group will show greater improvement in ankle tracking accuracy and greater
           changes in fMRI (increase in relative volume of activation for ipsilesional sensorimotor
           cortex, increase in laterality index, and decrease in blood-oxygen-level-dependent
           (BOLD) signal intensity index) compared to Move group.

        3. The Track group will show greater improvement in tracking accuracy at an untrained joint
           (knee) compared to the Move group.

        4. The Track group will show greater improvement in standing balance.

        5. The Track group will show greater improvement in walking speed and ankle dorsiflexion
           during gait compared to the Move group.
