  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy of a range of preladenant doses compared with placebo
      in participants with moderate to severe Parkinson's disease (PD) experiencing motor
      fluctuations and receiving a stable dose of levodopa (L-dopa), as measured by &quot;off&quot; time.
      Participants will continue to receive their stable regimen of L-dopa plus any adjunct
      medications during the study as prescribed by their physician. Several classes of adjunct
      medications may be used, including Amantadine, anticholinergics, dopa decarboxylase
      inhibitors, and dopamine agonists.

      Primary Hypothesis: At least the 10 mg twice daily dose of preladenant is superior to placebo
      as measured by the change from Baseline to Week 12 in the mean &quot;off&quot; time.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean &quot;Off&quot; Time (Hours Per Day) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;on&quot; state is defined as the period of time during which a participant's symptoms of PD improve or disappear following treatment with levodopa (L-dopa) or dopamine agonists. The &quot;off&quot; state is defined as the period of time characterized by the return of symptoms (i..e. tremor, slowness, and rigidity) following treatment with L-dopa or dopamine agonists. Study participants reported their symptoms at half-hour intervals as &quot;off&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, or &quot;asleep&quot; on their daily diary for 3 days before randomization (baseline) and for the 3 days immediately before their Week-12 visit. The mean change from baseline in &quot;off&quot; time was based on a constrained longitudinal data analysis with treatment, time, and treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects, and an unstructured covariance matrix was used to model the correlation among repeated measurements.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to this medicinal product.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment Due to an AE</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With ≥30% Reduction in &quot;Off&quot; Time at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of responders (≥30% Reduction in &quot;Off&quot; Time at Week 12) was analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model with baseline mean OFF time (hours/day) as a covariate and treatment-by-time interaction as a fixed effect, and an unstructured covariance matrix was used to model the correlation among repeated measurements. Responder rates for each treatment arm are presented as are differences from placebo with 95% confidence interval.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean &quot;On&quot; Time Without Troublesome Dyskinesias (Hours Per Day) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>When a participant is &quot;on&quot; without dyskinesias, parkinsonian symptoms have dissipated and the participant is experiencing no uncontrollable extraneous movements. Study participants reported their parkinsonian symptoms at half-hour intervals as &quot;off&quot;, &quot;on without dyskinesia&quot;, &quot;on with non-troublesome dyskinesia&quot;, &quot;on with troublesome dyskinesia&quot;, or &quot;asleep&quot; on their daily diary for 3 days before randomization and for the 3 days immediately before their Week-12 visit. The mean change from baseline in &quot;on without troublesome dyskinesia&quot; time was based on a constrained longitudinal data analysis with treatment, time, and treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects, and an unstructured covariance matrix was used to model the correlation among repeated measurements.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean “Off” Time (Hours Per Day) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The &quot;on&quot; state is defined as the period of time during which a participant's symptoms of PD improve or disappear following treatment with levodopa (L-dopa) or dopamine agonists. The &quot;off&quot; state is defined as the period of time characterized by the return of symptoms (i..e. tremor, slowness, and rigidity) following treatment with L-dopa or dopamine agonists. Study participants reported their symptoms at half-hour intervals as &quot;off&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, or &quot;asleep&quot; on their daily diary for 3 days before randomization (baseline) and for the 3 days immediately before their Week-12 visit. The mean change from baseline in &quot;off&quot; time was based on a constrained longitudinal data analysis with treatment, time, and treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects, and an unstructured covariance matrix was used to model the correlation among repeated measurements.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean “On” Time Without Troublesome Dyskinesias (Hours Per Day) at Week 12</title>
        <description>When a participant is &quot;on&quot; without dyskinesias, parkinsonian symptoms have dissipated and the participant is experiencing no uncontrollable extraneous movements. Study participants reported their parkinsonian symptoms at half-hour intervals as &quot;off&quot;, &quot;on without dyskinesia&quot;, &quot;on with non-troublesome dyskinesia&quot;, &quot;on with troublesome dyskinesia&quot;, or &quot;asleep&quot; on their daily diary for 3 days before randomization and for the 3 days immediately before their Week-12 visit. The mean change from baseline in &quot;on without troublesome dyskinesia&quot; time was based on a constrained longitudinal data analysis with treatment, time, and treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects, and an unstructured covariance matrix was used to model the correlation among repeated measurements.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Mean “On” Time Without Troublesome Dyskinesias (Hours Per Day) at Week 12</title>
          <description>When a participant is &quot;on&quot; without dyskinesias, parkinsonian symptoms have dissipated and the participant is experiencing no uncontrollable extraneous movements. Study participants reported their parkinsonian symptoms at half-hour intervals as &quot;off&quot;, &quot;on without dyskinesia&quot;, &quot;on with non-troublesome dyskinesia&quot;, &quot;on with troublesome dyskinesia&quot;, or &quot;asleep&quot; on their daily diary for 3 days before randomization and for the 3 days immediately before their Week-12 visit. The mean change from baseline in &quot;on without troublesome dyskinesia&quot; time was based on a constrained longitudinal data analysis with treatment, time, and treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects, and an unstructured covariance matrix was used to model the correlation among repeated measurements.</description>
          <population>FAS population, which consisted of all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study treatment; had endpoint data subsequent to at least one dose of study treatment; and had baseline data for those analyses requiring baseline data.</population>
