  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to show that Intradermal Human Fcγ1-Fel d1 fusion protein (GFD)
      is able to block the skin reaction to cat allergen in cat allergic subjects compared to the
      skin reaction to cat allergen alone. This research project is also testing the safety and
      tolerability of this new, experimental treatment, compared to the current treatment of cat
      allergen alone.

    <textblock>
      Researchers are conducting a research study of a new protein developed to treat sensitivity
      to cat allergens. Cat allergy in humans is an allergic reaction to one or more of the five
      known allergens produced by cats. The most common of these is the protein Fel d 1.

      This study will test Intradermal Human Fcγ1-Fel d1 fusion protein (GFD), a new protein that,
      based on animal data, has been developed to block the allergic effects of cat. If this drug
      works the way they think it does, it may become a treatment for cat allergy that is faster
      than the currently available treatments and with fewer side effects. This protein contains
      the molecule from the cat, that causes the allergic reaction, attached to a section of a
      particular antibody (protein involved in immunity) called Fcγ1 that acts like a break. The
      fusion of the two proteins is predicted to interrupt the flow of cellular reactions which
      lead to the allergic response.

      This will be the first time GFD is administered to humans. The study will be conducted in two
      parts. The subjects in part A will be administered intradermal standardized cat hair
      allergenic extract (CAT) and GFD sequentially in 10-fold increasing doses every 20 minutes.
      If Part A demonstrates the safety of GFD,subject in part B will begin by following the same
      treatment as part A followed by a rechallenge of the sites with CAT at 4 hours after the
      first dose of GFD. Each subject will be evaluated 3 times (screening, dosing, and telephone
      follow-up 2 days post dosing) and will return on Day 28 for blood draw.

        <title>Difference in the Doses of GFD and CAT Required to Elicit a Cutaneous Reaction Demonstrated by a Wheal Greater Than or Equal to 10 mm With Surrounding Erythema</title>
        <description>Difference in the doses of human Fcgamma1-Fel d1 (cat allergen) fusion protein (GFD) and standardized cat hair allergenic extract (CAT) required to elicit a wheal ≥ 10 mm with surrounding erythema.</description>
        <time_frame>up to 3 hours after the last injection of GFD</time_frame>
        <population>The experimental protein (human Fcgamma1-Fel d1 fusion protein (GFD)) and the control protein (standardized cat hair allergenic extract (CAT)) elicited comparable reactivity in the first four participants dosed; thus, the trial was discontinued for futility and the primary endpoint was not evaluated</population>

            <title>Control (CAT) - Experimental (GFD)</title>
            <description>Each participant served as their own control: the left arm received the control protein (histamine prick, intradermal diluent and intradermal standardized cat hair allergenic extract (CAT)) and right arm received the experimental protein (human Fcgamma1-Fel d1 (cat allergen) fusion protein (GFD)) administered intradermally (ID). The control arm received CAT at 0.02 milliliters (mL) of 0.01 bioequivalent allergy units (BAU)/mL to 10 BAU/mL (sequentially in 10-fold increments, stopping if dose produced a wheal ≥ 10 millimeters (mm)). The experimental arm received GFD at 0.001 BAU/mL (1/10th the dose of Fel d1 in the lowest dose of CAT) administered at 0.02 mL. Dosing continued sequentially in 10-fold increments until either a wheal of ≥ 10 mm or the maximum dose was reached (maximum of 7 dose increments).</description>
