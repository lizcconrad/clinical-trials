  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study seeks to implement and test a novel approach to teach pediatric residents about
      patient and family-centered care (PFCC). The approach calls for a supervised meeting between
      a family member of a previously hospitalized child and a resident in the context of a
      pediatric residency rotation.

      A specific patient and family centered care module will be implemented in the context of an
      existing training rotation. This module includes a meeting between resident physicians
      (trainees) and parents of previously hospitalized children (members of the Family Faculty in
      our institution), monitored by a senior faculty member. Patient and family centered care will
      be discussed using predefined, manual-driven guidance. This meeting is followed by a
      discussion with the faculty member to identify core components of family-centered care as
      exemplified in the parent interview.

    <description>Family Faculty members agreed to participate in meetings with pediatric residents who agree to participate. Standardized meetings include discussions of the following: 1. Impact of hospitalization on the behavior and development of each participating parent's child. 2. Effective communication with a parent 3. How to gain trust 4. The family meeting: who participates, the agenda 5. Troubleshooting: how to deal with difficult situations (the parents will present a few instances, from their own experience, which they think might be challenging to the clinicians who treated their children). Other core components will be added (or existing ones deleted) based on participants' feedback. The meeting will be attended by two residents, a family council member, and a senior faculty who will serve as monitor. Following the meeting, the residents will have an opportunity to ask questions and offer comments about the experience in a dedicated feedback interview with a senior faculty member.</description>
