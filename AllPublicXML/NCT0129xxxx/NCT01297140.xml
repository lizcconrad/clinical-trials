  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is characterised by a loss of cognitive functions and behavioural
      problems as set out under the term &quot;Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia
      (BPSD)&quot;. The impact of BPSD in everyday life has heavy consequences for the patient and their
      family. The precocity of incidence, the frequency and the intensity of the BPSD are
      associated with a rapid decline in cognitive functions, an alteration in the activities of
      daily living, and a decrease in the quality of life for both the patient and the helper, an
      increased risk of hospitalisation and of institutionalisation as well as an increase in the
      cost to the health system. A greater understanding of the risk factors for the occurence of
      the BPSD would better allow the detection of patients who are particularly at risk for BPSD,
      to anticipate the crisis situations by proposing early and adapted care, and to better target
      the medicinal therapies. Certain observational arguments or results of retrospective studies
      speak in favour of the role of the basic personality in the occurence of BPSD in Alzheimer's
      disease. The investigators propose to clarify this role through a prospective study.
