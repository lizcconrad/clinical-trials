  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Propofol has been routinely used for general anesthesia during pediatric cardiopulmonary
      bypass at our institution without complications. However, propofol may cause propofol
      infusion syndrome (PRIS), a rare, but often fatal complication mainly defined by bradycardia
      with progress to asystolia. Metabolic acidosis is regarded as an early warning sign of PRIS.
      Due to the preconditioning effects of sevoflurane and its availability for cardiopulmonary
      bypass, propofol has recently been substituted by sevoflurane during pediatric
      cardiopulmonary bypass at our institution. In this study the effect of substituting propofol
      by sevoflurane on metabolic acidosis and outcome are examined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this retrospective and partially prospective observational study the charts of 200
      children anesthetised for pediatric heart surgery are analysed since September 2007. 100
      children received propofol and up to now 80 children received sevoflurane during
      cardiopulmonary bypass. Blood gas analysis, laboratory results and vital parameters are
      compared before and after cardiopulmonary bypass for each group. Duration of intensive care
      treatment and time to dismission from hospital are compared between groups. Changes relative
      to baseline are analysed by paired t-Test with correction for multiple testing. Differences
      between groups are analysed by unpaired t-Test with correction for multiple testing
