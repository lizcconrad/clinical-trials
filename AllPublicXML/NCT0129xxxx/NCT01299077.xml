    <textblock>
      DDD (lumbar disc degenerative disease ) patients who have been prescribed triple therapy
      (MBL+ MYO+ NSAIDs) over 2 weeks of triple therapy were enrolled in the study. They were asked
      to assess their overall satisfaction degree on triple therapy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Satisfaction Degree After 2 Weeks Treatment of Triple Therapy (MBL+MYO+NSAID).</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The measurement of overall satisfaction degree was in three scales, that was satisfactory, just so so and dissatisfactory. The measurement was estimated by both the physicians and the patients respectively.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Onset Time of Symptom Relief.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Kaplan-Meier Estimates for the Average Onset Time of Symptom Relief. In this case the onset time of symptom relief was defined as the days between the end of triple therapy and the symptom improvement reported by patients.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient is Scored on JOA at baseline and two weeks. JOA is short for Japanese Orthopedic Association, which consists of 12 items: low back pain, lower extremity pain and numbness, walking ability, straight leg raising, muscle strength, sensory and etc. The first 3 item's scores are range from 0 to 3 and the others are from 0 to 2. Higher score means better condition.
All of these items scores are combined for a total overall JOA score, which is range from 0 to 27.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient is Scored on VAS at baseline and two weeks. VAS is the abbreviation of visual analogue score. There is no subscale in VAS. The maximum value of vas is 10 and the minimum is 0. This is self-evaluation method to present the severity of patient pain. More score number, more pain.</description>

          <population>The primary analysis will be on the Per-protocol (PP) population. PP population includes all subjects who received the dose of study drug without protocol deviation and had all the assessment per protocol.</population>

JOA is short for Japanese Orthopedic Association, which consists of 12 items: low back pain, lower extremity pain and numbness, walking ability, straight leg raising, muscle strength, sensory and etc. The first 3 item’s scores are range from 0 to 3 and the others are from 0 to 2. Higher score means better condition.
All of these items scores are combined for a total overall JOA score, which is range from 0 to 27.</description>
