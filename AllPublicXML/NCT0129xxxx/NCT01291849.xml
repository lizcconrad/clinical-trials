  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After nasal surgery, emergence cough or straining will produce venous engorgement and
      increase bleeding from the surgical site, so the necessity for smooth extubation without
      severe cough during emergence provides a challenge for the anesthetists. Recently,
      remifentanil is commonly used short-acting opioid, and several studies have demonstrated the
      antitussive effect of remifentanil via effect-site target-controlled infusion during
      emergence. However, there may be gender difference in response to opioid, and the previous
      studies about antitussive effect of remifentanil are targeted at female patients and there is
      no investigation of effect site concentration of remifentanil for male patients undergoing
      nasal surgery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect-site concentration of
      remifentanil via target-controlled infusion for preventing cough in man after sevofluorane
      balanced anesthesia.

    <description>The target Ce of remifentanil was determined by the response of the previous patient using Dixon's up-and-down method. If the patients did not cough throughout peri-extubation period, the extubation was defined as a smooth emergence, and the predetermined concentration of remifentanil for the subsequent patient was decreased by 0.5 ng mlâˆ’1. Similarly, if the patient cough anytime around extubation it was considered as failed smooth emergence and the predetermined concentration was increased by 0.5 ng ml-1 for the next patient. The patients were enrolled until getting at least six cross-over pairs in Dixon sequential allocation method.</description>
