    <textblock>
      Our objective is to compare a policy of hospital discharge guided by NT-proBNP levels versus
      discharge guided by conventional clinical criteria, in patients admitted with acute heart
      failure. The hypothesis is that the Nt-proBNP guided discharge will shorten hospital stay
      without worsening the outcome

      Nt-proBNP levels as well as their response to pharmacological treatment are predictive of
      prognosis in patients with heart failure. The purpose of the present project is to
      investigate, in patients hospitalized with acute heart failure, whether a discharge decision
      guided by Nt-proBNP response shortens hospital stay and improves prognosis The included
      patients will be randomly assigned to one of these two strategies: hospital discharge
      according to clinical conventional criteria or discharge guided by Nt-proBNP. All patients
      will be treated following clinical guidelines. In the guided Nt-proBNP strategy, patients
      will be discharged the third day if NT-proBNP levels drops &gt;30% compared to admission values.
      If such a reduction is not achieved, then the pharmacological treatment will be increased and
      NT-proBNP will be measured the following days until reaching the 30% reduction. In the
      conventional strategy, patients will be discharged at criterion of the attending cardiologist
      according to clinical assessment without Nt-proBNP. The main outcome will be the number of
      days of hospitalization at the index episode, and the secondary outcome will be death or
      readmission by heart failure at one and 6 months. Our hypothesis is that the Nt-proBNP guided
      discharge will allow to precisely evaluate the response to treatment and to determine the
      best time for hospital discharge. This will reduce hospital stay and death or readmission
      rate after discharge.
