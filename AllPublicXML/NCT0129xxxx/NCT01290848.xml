  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will evaluate the effectiveness of the Take TIME health promotion campaign. The
      Take TIME (Tobacco free, Injury free, Moving daily, Eating healthy) campaign will target
      parents and caregivers of children up to 8 years of age.

      The study will help answer the following research questions

        1. Are community organizations able and willing to deliver a health-promotion campaign
           targeting young children?

        2. What impact does the Take TIME campaign have on the readiness of the community to
           support healthy childhoods?

        3. What impact does the Take TIME campaign have on awareness and achievement of healthier
           lifestyles for young children?

        4. Can health promotion initiatives be &quot;institutionalized&quot; within the Municipality and
           community organizations so that the campaign will continue beyond the study period?

        5. Are changes in awareness and/or behaviour related to exposure to the Take TIME campaign?

      The Take TIME initiative will be developed and delivered in conjunction with the Township of
      Uxbridge and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario. The Durham Region Health Department,
      the Ministry of Health Promotion and Sport, and 35 schools and community organizations have
      also agreed to collaborate on project activities. The health promotion campaign will occur
      from October 15, 2010 until May 31, 2011. The campaign activities were developed from the
      input of parents and programme/care providers gathered during the planning phase of this
      research.

      The impact of the Take TIME campaign will be evaluated in two ways. The overall readiness of
      the community to support healthy childhoods will be evaluated using the Community Readiness
      Model, which relies on a series of interviews with key individuals in leadership positions.
      Awareness and current behaviour among community members will be assessed through the
      completion of telephone surveys of randomly selected households. Each of these evaluations
      will be completed twice, before and after delivery of the Take TIME campaign. The
      pre-campaign evaluations will be completed in September 2010. The post-campaign evaluations,
      using the same procedures, will be completed in June 2011.

    <description>Household Survey: Randomly selected households will be contacted by telephone to complete the survey questions. The questions address the four key themes of the Take TIME campaign: physical activity, healthy eating, and reducing exposure to injury and tobacco. For each theme, a series of questions are used to assess knowledge, awareness and family behaviour</description>

    <description>A Community Readiness Score will be calculated according to the methods of Findholt for each key stakeholder interview completed. Pre- and post-campaign scores will be compared to determine changes in Community Readiness over the timeframe of the Take TIME for Your Child's Health campaign.
This second analysis will seek to obtain descriptive information on community strengths and barriers that might impact the success of the Take TIME intervention, and identify similarities and differences between the perspectives of the leader participants.</description>
