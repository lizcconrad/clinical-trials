      Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) based skill groups for emotionally dysregulated children
      and their parents

      The investigators propose implementing a Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) skills group
      format for emotionally dysregulated children between the ages of 8 and 12 and their parents.

      Introduction Treatments available for children with emotional dysregulation and behavioral
      problems were shown to be only partially effective.

      DBT combines the western principles of changing behavior with the eastern principles of
      acceptance and mindfulness.

      Efficacy of DBT has been shown across a number of behavioral problems in adults and has been
      successfully adapted for adolescents. The next logical step is modification for younger
      children.

      The investigators chose DBT because of the observed similarities between adults and
      adolescents diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and the children who are referred
      to the investigators clinic with emotional dysregulation.

      Aims: To assess the ability to regulate emotions and problem behaviors before and after the
      proposed intervention

      Method:

      Population: Between 6-10 children between the ages 8-12 will be recruited from The child and
      adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinic at Soroka University Medical Center.

      Inclusion criteria Children suffering from emotional dysregulation All children and at least
      one parent speak Hebrew Exclusion criteria

        1. Schizophrenia

        2. Bipolar disorder

        3. Psychosis i.e an overt thought disorder

        4. Mental retardation

        5. Severe learning disorders

        6. Pervasive developmental disorders.

        7. Children who have suffered brain injury.

      Comparison group: Between 6 and 10 children matched for sex, parents age and education,
      socioeconomic status that fulfill the same clinical criteria for inclusion in the study as
      the study group. The comparison group will receive treatment as usual.

      Procedure The children will participate in a group skills group over 20 sessions, each
      session an hour and a half. The parents will participate in a group skills group over 15
      sessions, each session an hour and a half. Each group will be lead by two therapists. All the
      children will be evaluated by board certified child and adolescent psychiatrist and will be
      diagnosed according to the DSM IV-TR. The parents' the child and a teacher who is familiar
      with the child will fill in questionnaires before the beginning of the group, at the end of
      the group process and 6 months after the group ends.

      The treatment protocol will be based on Linehan's Skills training manual for treating
      borderline personality disorder and on modifications made by Miller for adolescents. The
      groups will be conducted according to a treatment manual which will be written accordingly
      and modified in order to apply the skills to a younger population. Ancillary treatment ( e.g.
      pharmacotherapy) will be provided on an as needed basis.

      The control group the data will be collected at similar intervals to those in the study
      group.

      Written informed consent will be obtained from the child and a legal guardian.
