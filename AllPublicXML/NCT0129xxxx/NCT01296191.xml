      The objective of this study is to compare drug concentrations in aqueous humor following
      ocular instillation of Besivance or VIGAMOX in subjects undergoing cataract surgery. The
      hypothesis of the study is that the aggregate aqueous absorption of Besivance over a six hour
      period is greater than VIGAMOX because of unique properties of Besivance which promote
      increased contact time of this antibiotic with the ocular surface.

      Subjects with scheduled cataract surgery will be screened during their pre-operative visit.
      Eligible subjects will be randomized to treatment with Besivance or VIGAMOX. Subjects will
      self-administer 1 drop of study drug into the operative eye 4 times a day for 3 days prior to
      surgery.Subjects will have one final drop of study medication on the day of
      surgery.Immediately prior to beginning the cataract surgery, a sample of aqueous humor will
      be collected by paracentesis.Concentration of Besivance and VIGAMOX in the aqueous humor will
      be determined by an independent laboratory using standardized high pressure liquid
      chromatography and mass spectrometry assays. Pharmacokinetic parameters determined from the
      aqueous humor concentration-time data will minimally include the area under the curve and the
      maximum concentration.
