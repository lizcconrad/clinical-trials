    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are the following: 1) to determine the effect of daily
      consumption of whole grain barley for six week on risk factors of cardiovascular disease
      compared to a diet low in whole grains, and 2) to compare the effects of daily consumption of
      whole grain barley to those of whole grain oats for six weeks to determine if the response to
      these two grains is different.

    <description>Subjects will provide a baseline blood sample at 15 minutes and 5 minutes prior to consuming a test meal. Subjects will then consume a high fat breakfast of foods such as eggs, buttered English muffins, and donuts. Blood samples will be collected 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, 360, and 420 min following ingestion of the test meal. Measurements will be made for serum triglyceride area under the curve, serum cholesterol, insulin, glucose, and plasma apo B48.</description>

    <measure>Microarray and targeted gene expression testing</measure>
    <time_frame>After 6 weeks of controlled feeding</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples will be used to test how the intervention affects gene expression. Global gene expression will be performed for a complete survey of the RNA response to the intervention. Targeted gene expression will be performed to confirm the findings of the global gene expression analysis.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three treatments: 1) a control diet containing 0.7 daily servings of whole grain, 2) a diet containing at least 4 daily servings of whole grain barley or 3) a diet containing at least 4 servings of whole grain oats. After 6 weeks, risk factors of cardiovascular disease will be assessed after a 12 hr fast. During the seventh week, risk factors of cardiovascular disease will be assessed in the postprandial state.</description>
