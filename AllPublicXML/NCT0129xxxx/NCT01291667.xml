      Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease and the most frequent causes of cancer
      mortality in females worldwide. The situation is same as the world in China. Trastuzumab has
      been proved valuable treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Cipterbin速 is
      developing by Shanghai CP Guojian Pharmaceutical Co.Ltd.Now we carried on the phase III trial
