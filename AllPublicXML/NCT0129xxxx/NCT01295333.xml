    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to compare in a randomized multicentric study the early prophylactic
      introduction of low dose of LT4 (50 µg/d) at 15 days post-ablation (experimental arm)
      compared to a conventional approach based on the initiation of LT4 as soon as the first
      biological signs of hypothyroidism. Two hundred patients with Graves' disease with no or
      minimal (eyelid retraction or oculopalpebral asynergy) and non inflammatory ophthalmopathy
      (clinical activity score to 0) will be included in this study. The administrated iodine-131
      activity will be adjusted to the weight of the thyroid gland (20 MBq/g thyroid tissue).
      Patients will be evaluated at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post-ablation. The
      primary objective will assess differences in terms of quality of life at 3 months using a
      specific questionnaire (ThyPRO). Secondary objectives will compare quality of life outcomes
      at different study visits (using ThyPRO and SF36), fatigue (MFIS) and depression (Beck),
      autoimmune parameters (signs of ophthalmopathy, TSH receptor antibodies assessment), efficacy
      and medico-economic data.
