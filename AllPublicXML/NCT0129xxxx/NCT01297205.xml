      PNEUMOSTEM® is human umbilical cord blood derived mesenchymal stem cells and it is intended
      to treat premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. This study is to assess the
      safety and the efficacy of this study drug.

      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is most common cause of death of children who were born
      prematurely, with low birth weights. In addition, many children who were recovered from this
      disease are suffering from many side effects such as prolonged hospitalization, pulmonary
      hypertension, and failure to thrive.

      The purpose of BPD treatment is to make a baby be able to do spontaneous breathing and to
      spontaneous breathing a baby needs much energy and because of this a baby may have difficulty
      to feed. For this reason, medication with steroid, diuretic and respiratory drugs are
      currently used. However, there is no effective cure so far.

      It has been reported that bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) can
      differentiate to pulmonary epithelial and pulmonary endothelial cells. Some animal studies
      showed that BM-MSC differentiated to bronchial cells and type 2 pneumocytes in rats with
      pneumonia and improve the fibrosis that occur after administration of bleomycin. Based on the
      findings, it is considered that mesenchymal stem cell therapy can help regenerate the damaged
      lung as well as BPD that cause lung inflammation, fibrosis, deficiency of type 2 pneumocytes,
      and so on.

      PNEUMOSTEM® is human umbilical cord blood derived mesenchymal stem cells and it is intended
      to treat premature infants with BPD. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety
      and the tolerability of this study drug and to establish the maximum toxicity dose. The
      latent efficacy will also be assessed.
