      This study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy of
      GW870086X cream formulation in subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Subjects
      will be assigned to take 3 out of the 4 possible treatments for 21 ±2 days: GW870086X 0.2%
      cream, GW870086X 2% cream, FP 0.05% cream (as a positive control) and placebo cream. All
      subjects will be randomised to receive placebo cream. Three index lesions located on the arms
      and/or legs (one on each) will be identified per subject and each treatment will be applied
      to the same lesion.

      This study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy of
      GW870086X cream formulation in subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The
      primary objective of this study is to assess 3 lesions using the Three Item Severity (TIS)
      score. The secondary objectives are to assess safety and tolerability of GW870086X, assess
      individual lesions using the Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) and to assess the
      pharmacokinetics of 21 days dosing of GW870086X administered as a cream. Twenty-five (25)
      subjects with atopic dermatitis will be randomised to receive placebo and 2 of the following
      treatments: GW870086X 0.2%, GW870086X 2%, FP 0.05% and placebo. All subjects will receive
      placebo. Subjects will apply all 3 treatments once daily during the 21 day treatment period.
      Three index lesions located on the arms and/or legs (one on each) will be identified per
      subject and each treatment will be applied to the same lesion throughout the 21±2 day
      treatment period. Each index lesion should represent the most common lesions for each patient
      i.e. not the most or least severe lesions.

    <measure>Change From Baseline Three Item Severity (TIS) Scores Between GW870086 (0.2% and 2%) Versus Placebo at Day 22</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Day 22</time_frame>
    <description>Three target lesions were selected and each of the 3 target lesions were assessed separately using the TIS for erythema, oedema/papulation, and excoriation using a score of 0 - 3 as 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. Each participant had at least 3 index lesions (=&gt; 1square centimeter in size) with a sum score of =&gt;4 and =&lt; 6 for erythema, oedema/populations and excoriations using the TIS rating scale at screening. The index lesions represented common lesions i.e. not the most or least severe lesions. The total TIS score for a lesion was calculated as the sum of each of the component scores i.e. ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 9 (severe symptoms). The values of Day 1 assessments were considered as Baseline values. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline TIS score from Day 22 TIS score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Three Item Severity (TIS) Scores Between GW870086 (0.2% and 2%) Versus Placebo at Day 22</title>
        <description>Three target lesions were selected and each of the 3 target lesions were assessed separately using the TIS for erythema, oedema/papulation, and excoriation using a score of 0 - 3 as 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. Each participant had at least 3 index lesions (=&gt; 1square centimeter in size) with a sum score of =&gt;4 and =&lt; 6 for erythema, oedema/populations and excoriations using the TIS rating scale at screening. The index lesions represented common lesions i.e. not the most or least severe lesions. The total TIS score for a lesion was calculated as the sum of each of the component scores i.e. ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 9 (severe symptoms). The values of Day 1 assessments were considered as Baseline values. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline TIS score from Day 22 TIS score.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Day 22</time_frame>
        <population>The Efficacy Population was defined as participants in the ‘All Subjects’ population with at least one post dose TIS assessment.</population>

For first three days of the study, participants applied their randomly assigned treatments at the same time of day during the clinic visits and study personnel supervised to ensure that the correct application procedures were followed. A full explanation was given to each participant regarding the labeling of pots, use of disposable gloves, the volume of cream to be used for each single application and the size of the area of skin to be treated. Participants applied their study treatments under supervision at the clinic on Days 7, 14 and 21 to allow accurately timed pharmacokinetic blood sampling and assessment of local tolerability. Participants applied their treatments at home on Day 4 to 6, Day 8 to 13 and Day 15 to 20.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline Three Item Severity (TIS) Scores Between GW870086 (0.2% and 2%) Versus Placebo at Day 22</title>
          <description>Three target lesions were selected and each of the 3 target lesions were assessed separately using the TIS for erythema, oedema/papulation, and excoriation using a score of 0 - 3 as 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. Each participant had at least 3 index lesions (=&gt; 1square centimeter in size) with a sum score of =&gt;4 and =&lt; 6 for erythema, oedema/populations and excoriations using the TIS rating scale at screening. The index lesions represented common lesions i.e. not the most or least severe lesions. The total TIS score for a lesion was calculated as the sum of each of the component scores i.e. ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 9 (severe symptoms). The values of Day 1 assessments were considered as Baseline values. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline TIS score from Day 22 TIS score.</description>

        <description>Three target lesions were selected and each of the 3 target lesions were assessed separately using the IGA. The IGA was carried out by a trained dermatologist and score ranged from 0 to 5. The detailed IGA scale is as: 0-Clear: No inflammatory signs of atopic dermatitis, 1- Almost clear: Just perceptible erythema and just perceptible apulation/infiltration, 2-Mild: Mild erythema and mild papulation/infiltration, 3-Moderate: Moderate erythema, and moderate papulation/infiltration, 4-Severe: Severe erythema and severe papulation/infiltration, 5-Very Severe: Very severe erythema, and very severe papulation/infiltration with oozing/crusting. The participant was considered as responder if each lesion at timepoint, IGA score reduced by 1 grade and improved from Baseline by 2 grades.</description>

For first three days of the study, participants applied their randomly assigned treatments at the same time of day during the clinic visits and study personnel supervised to ensure that the correct application procedures were followed. A full explanation was given to each participant regarding the labeling of pots, use of disposable gloves, the volume of cream to be used for each single application and the size of the area of skin to be treated. Participants applied their study treatments under supervision at the clinic on Days 7, 14 and 21 to allow accurately timed pharmacokinetic blood sampling and assessment of local tolerability. Participants applied their treatments at home on Day 4 to 6, Day 8 to 13 and Day 15 to 20.</description>

        <description>AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. SAE include AEs those result in death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.

            <description>Eligible participants applied FP, 0.05% cream to a specific lesion located on the arms and/or legs every day for 21±2 days. For first three days of the study, participants applied their randomly assigned treatments at the same time of day during the clinic visits and study personnel supervised to ensure that the correct application procedures were followed. A full explanation was given to each participant regarding the labeling of pots, use of disposable gloves, the volume of cream to be used for each single application and the size of the area of skin to be treated. Participants applied their study treatments under supervision at the clinic on Days 7, 14 and 21 to allow accurately timed pharmacokinetic blood sampling and assessment of local tolerability. Participants applied their treatments at home on Day 4 to 6, Day 8 to 13 and Day 15 to 20.</description>
