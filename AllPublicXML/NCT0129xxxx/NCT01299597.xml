    <textblock>
      The present study will investigate in humans the enzyme inhibition effects of SB-649868 on
      CYP3A4, using Simvastatin and Atorvastatin as CYP3A4 probe substrates, administered as single
      doses: alone, and on two different occasions after repeat doses of SB-649868, at the same
      time as SB-649868 and 2h before SB-649868.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male subject, as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based
             on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination,
             neuropsychiatric status using the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview,
             laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or
             laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may
             be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the
             finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with
             the study procedures. However,

               -  Subjects with cTpn I values above 99th percentile of normal range of the selected
                  assay should always be excluded from enrollment;

               -  Subjects with alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN should always be
                  excluded (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated
                  and direct bilirubin &lt;35%);

          2. Male between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed
             consent.

          3. Body weight ≥50 kg and BMI within the range 18.5-29.9 kg/m2 inclusive.

          4. Subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in the protocol.
             This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication
             until 3 days post last dose (equivalent to 5 terminal half-lives post-last dose).

          5. Having given written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements
             and restrictions listed in the consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History or presence of significant psychiatric neurological, musculo-skeletal ,
             respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, uncontrolled hypothyroidism. pancreatic or
             renal diseases or of any condition known to interfere with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs.

          2. Subjects, who in the Investigator's judgement, pose a significant suicide risk.
             Evidence of serious suicide risk may include any history of suicidal behaviour and/or
             any suicidal ideation of type 4 or 5 on the C-SSRS in the last 6 months.

          3. History of cardiovascular diseases and/or evidence of repolarization defects.

          4. Family history of heriditary muscular disorders.

          5. Subjects with abnormal ECG defined as: average QTcB or QTcF &gt; 450 msec; PQ &lt; 120 ms or

             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

             juice grapefruit juice or grapefruit within 7 days prior to the first dose of study

             current study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of
             the IP (whichever is longer).

         16. Exposure to more than four new chemical entities (i.e., medical drugs being under
             development) within 12 months prior to the first dosing day.
