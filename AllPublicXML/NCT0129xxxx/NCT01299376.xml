  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two parts. In the first part, the efficacy and safety MK-0954E (losartan
      potassium 50 mg [L50] (+) hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg [H12.5] (+) amlodipine besylate 5mg
      [A5]) will be evaluated and compared to the efficacy and safety of MK-0954H (L50/H12.5) in
      Japanese participants. In the second part, the safety and tolerability of long-term use of
      open-label MK-0954E in participants with hypertension will be evaluated. The primary
      hypothesis is that MK-0954E is more effective in lowering mean trough sitting diastolic blood
      pressure (SiDBP) after 8 weeks of treatment compared to MK-954H (L50/H12.5 mg) in Japanese
      participants with essential hypertension who are not adequately controlled following a 8-week
      treatment with filter period study drug of MK-954H.

    <measure>Change in Trough Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (SiDBP)-Double-Blind Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Sitting diastolic blood pressure was measured by automated sphygmomanometer pre-dose on Day 1 (baseline) and at 24 ± 2 hours after the last study drug administration at Week 8. The difference between the baseline and Week 8 assessments was calculated and summarized by treatment arm.</description>

    <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which was temporally associated with the use of the product, was also an AE. The percentage of participants who experienced at least 1 AE during the 8-week double-blind treatment period were summarized by study drug received.</description>
