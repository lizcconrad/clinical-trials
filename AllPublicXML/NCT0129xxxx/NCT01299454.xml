  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how much of the investigational product gets into
      the blood stream and how long the body takes to get rid of it when given to subjects with a
      range of liver impairment compared to subjects with normal liver function.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, parallel-arm study in 1 group of subjects with normal
      hepatic function and 3 groups of subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment (mild,
      moderate, and severe). Subjects will be confined to the clinic from Day -1 to Day 8. Subjects
      will be contacted via telephone 30 days (+ 2 days) after the last dose of study medication to
      assess any new or ongoing AEs and to record concomitant medications. All groups will receive
      a single oral 2-mg OPC-34712 dose on Day 1 with 240 mL room temperature still water. Subjects
      will be administered the OPC-34712 dose in the fasted state (at least 8 hours of fasting) and
      no food will be allowed for 4 hours postdose.

Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes.
