    <textblock>
      This pilot study is aimed at assessing the short-term effects of Tadalafil on the hemodynamic
      response to exercise and exercise capacity in patients with Fontan circulation. Data
      regarding effect size and drug tolerability will be used in the design of a randomized
      multicenter trial. The long-term goal of this investigation is to systematically evaluate the
      effect of tadalafil therapy on exercise performance, quality of life, and delay of functional
      deterioration in patients with single ventricle physiology.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare the effects of Tadalafil versus placebo on exercise capacity (maximal oxygen consumption: VO2 max) for patients (8-35 years)with the Fontan circulation (8 -18 years).</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Short-term treatment with Tadalafil will augment cardiac output and improve exercise capacity (maximal oxygen consumption: VO2 max) in patients with the Fontan circulation. Primary outcome variables include the change in peak exercise capacity (VO2 max), using cycle ergometry after one week of tadalafil therapy</description>

    <measure>To evaluate the adverse effects of Tdalafil in patients (8-35 years)with the Fontan circulation and compare with the placebo group.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Hypothesis: Short-term treatment with Tadalafil will be well tolerated by children with the Fontan circulation. Adverse effect forms will be used to compare the side effects between Tadalafil and treatment group.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have undergone the Fontan procedure (regardless of type of Fontan
             connection or presence or absence of a fenestration)

          -  Age 8.0 to 35.0 years

          -  Stable clinical condition over the last 3 months (i.e. No change in medication,
             treatments, or development of new symptoms)

          -  Ability to perform exercise testing

          -  Consent and assent (as appropriate to participate in the study after receiving
             information concerning procedures, risks, and possible clinical benefits) o Patients
             will be enrolled without regard to gender, race, and ethnicity. All patients meeting
             study eligibility will be approached for consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class III or IV)

          -  Presence of liver or renal dysfunction based on the latest lab test results
