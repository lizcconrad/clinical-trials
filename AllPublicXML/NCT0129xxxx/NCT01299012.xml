      This investigation will be a retrospective chart review of in type 1 diabetics who have been
      treated with liraglutide. The study will be conducted at Diabetes-Endocrinology Center of WNY
      at Millard Fillmore Hospital, affiliated to the State University of New York at Buffalo.

      Study Population: 40 patients with type 1 diabetes on treatment with either continuous
      subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII; also known as insulin pump) or multiple (four or more)
      injections of insulin per day on continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) will be included
      in the study. These patients with type 1 diabetes have been treated with liraglutide in
      addition to insulin. The investigators would retrospectively review their charts to evaluate
      decreases in fasting, postprandial and the overall mean glucose concentrations.

      The investigators will compare the mean fasting, the mean weekly glucose and the standard
      deviation of weekly blood glucose concentrations as recorded by continuous glucose monitoring
      prior to and following one week and 12 weeks of treatment with liraglutide daily. In
      addition, the investigators will compare the time spent at glucose concentrations &gt;150 and
      200mg/dl and &lt;70 and &lt;40 mg/dl. HbA1c levels before and after 12 weeks of treatment with
      liraglutide daily will be compared.
