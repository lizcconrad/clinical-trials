  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to motivate and support general practice clinics in implementing
      the visions and recommendations presented in two of the disease specific programmes for
      chronic care management (for chronic obstructive lung disease and Type 2 diabetes). These
      programmes describe evidence based treatment and division of tasks between the
      municipalities, the hospitals and general practice.

      The Facilitator Project is funded by The Danish Ministry of Interior and Health.

    <textblock>
      In a cluster randomized trial the investigators will explore the efficacy of up to three
      outreach visits by specially trained GPs. Efficacy data are obtained by means of
      questionnaires at regional databases.

    <description>The 16 facilitators in the project attend an educational programme designed to provide them with the necessary skills and tools for the task. The facilitators visit general practice clinics from March 2011 until the end of 2012. Each clinic is offered three visits. The facilitator is to act as a change agent who motivates and helps the clinic team in the process of defining common goals, and choosing the appropriate means for achieving them.</description>
