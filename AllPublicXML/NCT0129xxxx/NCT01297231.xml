  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tamoxifen is a hormonal treatment for breast cancer. It prevents recurrent disease and
      decreases death. Tamoxifen is given to women with and at high risk for breast cancer. These
      women also commonly have breast MRI to monitor for breast cancer. Some features of normal
      breast tissue visible on breast MRI change depending on patient hormonal status. It has been
      questioned if hormonal changes due to tamoxifen are seen on breast MRI. Pilot data suggests
      this is true. If tamoxifen causes changes in normal breast tissue on MRI, more study could be
      done looking at whether breast MRI could tell us anything about whether tamoxifen is working.

      This study is being done to see if tamoxifen changes normal breast tissue on MRI. It will
      also look at if other factors like taking anti-depressants or gene type have any effect.

    <description>Baseline Breast-MRI within 1 year before starting tamoxifen (allows for surgery, chemotherapy and radiation before the start of tamoxifen).
During Tamoxifen Treatment:
Blood will be drawn for CYP2D6 genotype testing. Analysis of samples will be performed internally at MSKCC.
Follow-up breast MRI after 9-12 months of tamoxifen therapy. In patients whom further breast MRI screening and/or follow-up is clinically indicated, follow-up breast MRIs may be performed within 3 months (before or after) the 2, 3, and 4 year time points during tamoxifen treatment. All breast MRIs will be performed using the same technique.
Follow-up for all patients during and after tamoxifen should include routine standard clinical assessment and imaging such as mammography and breast MRI when clinically indicated.</description>
