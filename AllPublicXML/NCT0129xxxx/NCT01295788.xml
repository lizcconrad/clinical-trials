  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that REAL-Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring (RT-CGM) will be
      more effective if introduced in children and adolescents with established diabetes at the
      same time as they are starting pump therapy. This randomized controlled trial will compare
      the effectiveness of simultaneous vs delayed introduction of RT-CGM in children and
      adolescents with type 1 diabetes who are starting insulin pump therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      REAL-Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring (RT-CGM) improves diabetes control in adults with
      type 1 diabetes. However, studies of RT-CGM in children and adolescents have been mostly
      negative. The lack of effectiveness in the pediatric population appears directly related to
      adherence to RT-CGM, i.e., the willingness of children and teens to wear and use this
      technology. Most previous RT-CGM studies have focused on experienced pump users or children
      with new-onset diabetes. At the time of pump initiation, children and adolescents who have
      been living with diabetes (and their parents) are highly motivated to make changes in their
      diabetes management and to take on additional responsibilities to improve their diabetes
      control and lifestyle, the two primary reasons for initiating pump therapy in the pediatric
      population. The investigators hypothesize that readiness for making changes in diabetes
      management will be greater at the time of pump initiation than at six months after the pump
      start. Further, the investigators hypothesize that readiness for change at the time of RT-CGM
      initiation will predict future adherence to RT-CGM and its effectiveness.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Males and females age 5-18 years old.

          -  Established T1D diagnosis for a minimum of one year.

          -  Na√Øve to CSII therapy and ready to start CSII with the Veo pump (Medtronic) .
