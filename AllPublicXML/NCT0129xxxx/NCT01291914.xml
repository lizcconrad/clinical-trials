  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of FX005
      for the treatment of pain in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to assess FX005, as compared to placebo control, for:

        -  Safety and tolerability

        -  Analgesic effect

        -  Pharmacokinetics

      Analgesic effect will be assessed using the Western Ontario &amp; McMaster University
      Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), the Measure of Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain
      (ICOAP) questionnaire, and patient and clinical observer global assessments.
