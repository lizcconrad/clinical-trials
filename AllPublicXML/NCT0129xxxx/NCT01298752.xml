    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are candidates for routine, uncomplicated cataract surgery.

          -  Subjects must be willing to wait to undergo cataract surgery on the fellow eye until
             after the study has been completed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are expected to require treatment with any systemic or ocular (either
             eye) drugs specified in the protocol during the 18 days following cataract surgery or
             any systemic or ocular corticosteroids within 14 days prior to cataract surgery.

          -  Subjects who have known hypersensitivity or contraindication to the study drug(s) or
             their components.

          -  Subjects who have a severe/serious ocular condition or history/presence of chronic
             generalized systemic disease that the Investigator feels might increase the risk to
             the subject or confound the result(s) of the study.
