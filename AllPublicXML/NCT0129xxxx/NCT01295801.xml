  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Linezolid is the first approved synthetic oxazolidinone that is active against
      multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. Because of its significant efficacy, linezolid
      is widely used in clinical treatment. However, the side effects of linezolid commonly lead to
      anemia and thrombocytopenia. This hematological toxic effects limit its prolonged used. The
      investigators have found that Vitamin B6 application, as a preventive, auxiliary therapy, can
      relieve anemia and thrombocytopenia. The present study was designed to verify the effects of
      Vitamin B6 in the prevention of linezolid-associated cytopenias and investigate its
      mechanism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infected patients receiving linezolid therapy are divided into two groups, i.e. the linezolid
      group and the linezolid + vitamin B6 group, the line of division being whether vitamin B6 is
      to be applied or not in the course of treatment. The purpose is to evaluate the role that
      vitamin B6 plays, during the process of linezolid therapy, in the relief of erythropenia and
      cytopenias.
