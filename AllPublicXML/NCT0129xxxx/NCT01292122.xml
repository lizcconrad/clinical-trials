      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of VCT-01 in split-thickness skin graft
      (STSG) donor site wounds and assess selected parameters of healing at the VCT-01-treated
      donor site.

      An initial cohort of 5 subjects will be allocated to Group A. When all subjects enrolled in
      Group A have completed 14 days of post-treatment follow-up, results of donor site
      evaluations, histological analyses and reported adverse events will be reviewed by the
      Investigator and study Sponsor. If the data is suggestive of clinical benefit following
      treatment and absent any serious and/or unexpected adverse events, which are, in the opinion
      of the investigator, related to the treatment, the remaining subjects will be enrolled and
      randomized to Groups B, C or D.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is at least 18 years of age but no more than 55 years of age.

          2. Subject has a primary wound which requires treatment with a split-thickness skin
             graft; the graft cannot be harvested from a site from which a skin graft was
             previously obtained. If the primary wound is a result of a thermal or chemical burn,
             the total body surface area must be less than 15%.

          3. Females of childbearing potential must have a documented negative urine pregnancy test
             and must agree to use highly effective contraceptives for 6 months post-treatment.

          4. Subject has read, understood and signed a Health Research Ethics Board-approved
             Informed Consent Form.

          5. Subject is able and willing to comply with study procedures and instructions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating.

          2. Clinically significant disease or condition that may compromise graft take and/or
             donor site healing (e.g. the presence of a bleeding disorder, capillary fragility,
             venous or arterial disorder directly affecting the donor site to be treated, known or
             suspected systemic malignancies, human immunodeficiency virus infection, renal or
             liver disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, poor
             nutritional status).

          3. Subjects who are currently receiving or have received within two months prior to
             treatment: systemic, inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids or immunosuppressant
             agents. Subjects receiving therapeutic doses of anticoagulants for pre-existing
             medical conditions (e.g. Plavix, Coumadin, Heparin, low molecular weight Heparin,
             non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, herbal supplements), for whom a dose
             interruption from Screening through 2-Months post-treatment (pre-treatment / treatment
             / biopsy phase) is contraindicated, are excluded from the study.

          4. Any disorder (psychiatric, alcohol or substance abuse [within 12 months of treatment],
             physical disability) that might interfere with obtaining informed consent or the
             subject's ability to comply with study or protocol requirements, as determined by the
             Investigator.

          5. Subjects who have used any tobacco product within 3 months prior to treatment.

          6. Subjects previously treated with Apligraf®, Dermagraft or any other cell-based
             product, including autologous tissue at the treatment site.

          7. Subjects who have received an investigational drug, device or biological/bioactive
             treatment within 30 days prior to treatment (medical or dental).

          8. Subjects, who in the opinion of the Investigator, for any reason other than those
             listed above, will not be able to complete the study per protocol.

          9. Subjects, as determined by Screening immunology testing, that have specific antibodies
             to VCT-01 donor cell human leukocyte antigens.
