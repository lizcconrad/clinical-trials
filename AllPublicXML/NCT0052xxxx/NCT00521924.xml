    <textblock>
      This Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients
      with low disease activity (Disease Activity Score 28 [DAS28] &gt;2.8 and &lt;3.5) is being
      conducted to evaluate induction of remission by adding infliximab to pre-existing treatment
      versus no additional treatment. All subjects eligible for this study, aged &gt;35 to &lt;=65 years,
      will have a diagnosis of RA according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, and
      will be offered additional treatment with infliximab. Prior to the start of treatment,
      subjects must be on a stable regimen of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for at
      least 3 months. Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to basic therapy with or without infliximab
      for a total duration of 38 weeks followed by a follow-up period of up to 6 months. Subjects
      randomized to basic therapy + infliximab will receive infliximab 3 mg/kg at Weeks 0, 2, 6,
      14, 22, 30, and 38. The primary objective of the study is to assess the rate of remission
      according to DAS 28 (&lt;2.6) at the end of treatment (after 38 weeks). Safety assessments
      include the incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and clinically notable
      abnormal vital signs and laboratory values.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged &gt;35 and &lt;=65 years with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
             according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for at least 1 year and
             no more than 10 years prior to start of therapy; have active disease (Disease Activity
             Score [DAS] 28 &gt;2.8 and &lt;3.5), with changes in the DAS 28 score &lt;0.6 within the 6
             weeks before inclusion; have stable RA basic therapy according to standard criteria
             for at least 3 months; have a chest X-ray within 1 month prior to first infusion with
             no evidence of malignancy, infections, or fibrosis; and have screening laboratory test
