  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. This phase II trial is studying the
      side effects and how well sunitinib malate works in treating patients with Kaposi sarcoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the clinical response of sunitinib malate in patients with Kaposi sarcoma (KS)
      in Uganda and Kenya.

      II. Compare clinical response rates in endemic versus epidemic (AIDS) KS. III. Determine the
      safety and tolerability of sunitinib malate in patients with endemic or epidemic (AIDS) KS.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I Monitor the impact of sunitinib malate on underlying HIV-1 and Kaposi sarcoma-associated
      herpesvirus (KSHV) viral infection (HIV-1 plasma RNA and KSHV cell-associated DNA).

      II. Evaluate morphological changes in KS lesions after treatment. III. Determine the
      pharmacokinetic profile of sunitinib malate in patients with KS.

      IV Evaluate KSHV gene expression in endemic and epidemic KS lesions in patients in Uganda and
      Kenya.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to HIV-serostatus
      (endemic [HIV-seronegative] vs epidemic [HIV-seropositive/AIDS] kaposi sarcoma).

      Patients receive oral sunitinib malate 50 mg once daily for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every
      6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo tumor tissue and blood sample collection periodically for correlative and
      pharmacokinetic studies. Samples are analyzed for CD4 lymphocyte counts, HIV-1 plasma RNA
      levels, KSHV specific antibodies, expression pattern of KSHV in vitro and in vivo, expression
      of latently versus lytically expressed genes in tumor tissue, and plasma concentrations of
      sunitinib malate and its active metabolite, SU12662.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 weeks.

    <description>The true response rate will be estimated based on the number of responses using a binomial distribution. The confidence intervals for them can be estimated using same distribution. Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test will be used to examine the difference of response rate between the two cohorts and log-rank test for the difference of survival outcomes.</description>
