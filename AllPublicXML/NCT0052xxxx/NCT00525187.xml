      The prevalence of onychomycosis among diabetic patients is still a debated question as well
      as the best way to diagnose the disease. We conducted a prospective study to assess the
      prevalence of onychomycosis in diabetic neuropathic (DN) patients clinically suspected of
      this disease and to assess the reliability of the diagnosis of onychomycosis.

    <textblock>
      From December 2000 to January 2005, we followed 100 successive diabetic patients, type 1 and
      type 2, suffering from (DN). At baseline we assessed age, gender, medical history and
      medications, foot insensitivity defined by a vibration perception threshold (VPT) &gt;25 volts
      and onychomycosis by clinical diagnosis.

      Multiple samples of the most affected nail, often the big toe, were taken. A potassium
      hydroxide (KOH) test was done by 2 independent and blinded investigators and a culture in a
      laboratory (lab) specialized in mycology.

      Pictures of the nails and particularly of the sampled nail were taken. Apart from the
      laboratory results, two independent and blinded dermatologists gave their diagnosis looking
      at the pictures.
