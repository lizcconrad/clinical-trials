      This study assesses the tolerability, safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of Bardoxolone
      methyl (RTA 402) in advanced solid tumors and lymphoid malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bardoxolone methyl (RTA 402) is a synthetic triterpenoid that has demonstrated significant in
      vivo single agent anti-cancer activity. This is an open-label phase I dose-escalation study
      of Bardoxolone methyl (RTA 402) administered orally for the first 21 days of a 28-day cycle.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histopathological documentation of solid tumor or lymphoid malignancy.

          -  Advanced or metastatic cancer that is either refractory to or have relapsed after
             standard-of-care curative or survival-prolonging therapy, or for whom no such
             therapies exist.

          -  ECOG performance status of less than or equal to 2

          -  Adequate liver and renal function as documented by the following laboratory test
             results within 14 days of starting therapy: total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL; AST (SGOT)
             and ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 ULN or ≤ 5 ULN if liver is involved by tumor; serum creatinine
             ≤2.0 mg/dL OR creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min.

          -  Adequate bone marrow function as documented by the following laboratory test results
             within 14 days of starting therapy: platelets greater than 100,000/mm3, absolute
             granulocyte count greater than 1,500/mm3, hemoglobin greater than or equal to 8.0
