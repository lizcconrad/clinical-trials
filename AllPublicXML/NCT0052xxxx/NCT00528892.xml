  <official_title>An Open-label, Randomized, 48-Week Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability and Activity of Raltegravir When Replacing the Ritonavir-boosted PI Component of HAART in HIV-Infected Individuals With Viral Load Suppression on a Ritonavir-Boosted PI Containing Regimen.</official_title>

    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesis is that switching from a ritonavir-boosted PI to raltegravir may
      be associated with an at least non-inferior effectiveness, virological response and safety,
      and even a better tolerability profile with regard to lipid metabolism, insulin resistance,
      body fat distribution as compared with continuation of the baseline regimen in HIV-1
      seropositive males or females at least 18 years of age and older on ritonavir-boosted PI plus
      at least 2 other drugs and plasma viral RNA below 50 copies/mL.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is a male or female at least 18 years of age.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test (HCG) within
             10 days prior to randomization into the study.

          -  Patients must use adequate birth control measures (barrier method.)

          -  Patients must be HIV 1 seropositive using standard diagnostic criteria.

          -  Patients must have two plasma viral RNA measurements below detection limits with the
             routine ultrasensitive method used at each participating site (at least &lt;50 copies/mL)
             within 180 days prior to randomization into this study.

          -  Patients must be on continuous therapy with HAART consisting of a ritonavir-boosted
             protease-inhibitor (PI) and at least two other antiretroviral agents for at least 6
             months prior to randomization into this study, with no planned drug changes in the
             following 12 months. Boosted PIs can be indinavir, fosamprenavir, saquinavir,
             lopinavir, atazanavir, tipranavir or darunavir.

          -  Patients must be considered clinically stable, in the opinion of the investigator, at
             the time of entry into the study; i.e., clinical status and all chronic medications
             should be unchanged for at least 14 days prior to randomization. Patients currently
             receiving treatment for an opportunistic infection may be allowed into the study as
             long as the above criteria are met. Prophylaxis for opportunistic infections
             consistent with standard treatment is permissible. .

          -  The following laboratory values must be obtained within 2-4 weeks of randomization
             into the study:

               -  Hemoglobin &gt;8.0 g/dL.

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 750/mm3

               -  Platelet count &gt; 50,000/ mm3

               -  Creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL.

               -  Transaminases (ALAT, ASAT) &lt;5xULN

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding or women planning pregnancy during the study duration.

          -  Patients on ART regimens not likely to be maintained during the whole study duration

          -  Prior use of HIV integrase inhibitors.

          -  Use of any investigational agents (other than ART on expanded access programme) within
             90 days of randomization.

          -  Alcohol or substance abuse which in the opinion of the investigator would interfere
             with patient compliance or safety.

          -  Patients with an active opportunistic infection or malignancy. Patients with a
             chronic, stable opportunistic infection will be allowed to enter this study.

          -  Any condition or history of any illness which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             might confound the results of the study or pose additional risk in administering the
             study drugs to the patient.

          -  Any patient with a diagnosis of visceral Kaposi's sarcoma. Patients with lymphedema
             secondary to cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma, or with cutaneous or palatal Kaposi's sarcoma
             that has been treated with systemic immunosuppressive therapy must also be excluded.

          -  Any patient with a diagnosis of acute hepatitis due to any cause. Patients with
             chronic hepatitis including chronic hepatitis B surface antigenemia chronic hepatitis
             C may enter the study as long as they have stable liver function tests and meet all
             inclusion criteria. Patients with acute exacerbations of chronic hepatitis are
             excluded.
