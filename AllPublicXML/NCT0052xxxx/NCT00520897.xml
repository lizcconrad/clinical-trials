  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The eradication of HIV by antiretroviral therapy has thus far been elusive. It has been
      consistently demonstrated that a pool of latently infected, resting CD4+ T cells persists in
      the majority of HIV-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy in whom plasma
      viremia has been successfully suppressed for prolonged periods of time; this pool has emerged
      as the major obstacle in achieving the eradication of HIV. We believe that MK-0518 can
      further the decay and suppression of HIV-1 in patients who have been virologically suppressed
      for a prolonged period of time on effective cART (â‰¥ 4 years).

      The trial is a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with two
      phases: phase I to 48 weeks and phase II to 96 weeks with the primary analysis at 48 weeks.
      HIV-infected individuals who are taking their first standard cART regimen for at least four
      years with complete viral suppression. Upon enrollment, he/she will be randomized to one of
      two arms: the MK-0518 arm or the control arm. As each participant reaches week 48, he/she
      will be unblinded and those in the MK-0518 arm will continue taking MK-0518. Based on the
      results of an interim analysis, the control arm will be rolled over to receive MK-0518 for 48
      weeks. After the screening, baseline visits and week 4 safety visit, follow-up visits will
      occur every 8 weeks for both arms.

In addition, after treatment-intensification in both groups at week 48, a post-hoc follow-up of all participants was conducted up to week 96 to examine if raltegravir intensification had any long-term effects on proviral HIV DNA and CD4+ T cell populations in the blood and gut.</description>

             maximum of two non-consecutive blips of &lt; 100 copies/ml that the study investigator
             deems to be not clinically significant
