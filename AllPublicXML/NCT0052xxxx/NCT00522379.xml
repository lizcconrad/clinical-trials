    <textblock>
      To maintain treatment blind, two different active patch sizes were used (10 cm^2 &amp; 20 cm^2).
      Placebo patches matched according to size and appearance. During the trial subjects applied
      up to three patches, active and placebo, to achieve their assigned daily dose.

        <title>The Change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part IV From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period - Disability: How Disabling Are the Dyskinesias?</title>
        <description>Item = Disability (question #33) in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part IV from Baseline to the end of the Maintenance Period - How disabling are the dyskinesias? Has a possible score of 0 – 4 points (4 = maximum). A higher score indicates more severe symptoms.
Results show the number of subjects per dose group and their change over time either improving (decrease in score), worsening (increase in score), or remaining the same.</description>

Results show the number of subjects per dose group and their change over time either improving (decrease in score), worsening (increase in score), or remaining the same.</description>

          <title>The Change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part IV From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period - What Proportion of the Waking Day is the Subject &quot;Off&quot;, on Average?</title>
          <description>Item = What proportion of the waking day is the subject “off”, on average (question #39) in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part IV from Baseline to the end of the Maintenance Period has a possible score of 0 – 4 points (4 = maximum). A higher score indicates the subject is “off” a larger portion of the waking day.
Results show the number of subjects per dose group and their change over time either improving (decrease in score), worsening (increase in score), or remaining the same.</description>

          <title>The Change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part IV From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period - Does the Patient Have Symptomatic Orthostasis?</title>
          <description>Item = Does the patient have symptomatic orthostasis (question #42) in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part IV from Baseline to the end of the Maintenance Period has a possible score of 0 (no) or 1 (yes). A score of 1 indicates subject has symptomatic orthostasis.
Results show the number of subjects per dose group and their change over time either improving (decrease in score), worsening (increase in score), or remaining the same.</description>
          <population>Of the 502 subjects in the Full Analysis Set (FAS), 495 are included in this analysis. The Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method was utilized.</population>
