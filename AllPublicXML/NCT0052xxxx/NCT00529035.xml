  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety of IL-2 and the highest dose of
      this drug that can be given safely to people with chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD).
      Chronic GVHD is a medical condition that may occur after patients receive a bone marrow, stem
      cell or cord blood transplant. The donor's immune system may recognize their body (the host)
      as foreign and attempt to &quot;reject&quot; it. Traditional standard therapy to treat chronic GVHD is
      prednisone (steroids). Treatment options are limited, and it is thought that IL-2 may help to
      control chronic GVHD.

      -  IL-2 will be given daily through an injection under the skin for a period of 8 weeks. To
           determine the highest safest dose of IL-2, the dose participants receive will increase
           as lower doses are determined to be safe. There will be three dose levels.

        -  Participants will be seen periodically while they are receiving IL-2. Physical exams and
           blood tests will be performed weekly for the first two weeks and then every other week
           until week 8.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Maximum Tolerated Dose and Toxicity Profile of an 8 Week Course of IL-2 in Patients With cGVHD and an Inadequate Response to Steroids.</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants were assessed for toxicities at mandatory study follow-up visits during the 8 week course of study therapy and four weeks post therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Three dose levels were evaluated to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD):
Dose level A: 0.3 x 10^6 IU/m^2/day Dose level B: 1.0 x 10^6 IU/m^2/day Dose level C: 3.0 x 10^6 IU/m^2/day Once the MTD (dose level B) was established, an additional 10 participants were enrolled at this dose.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Number of Participants Who Tolerated at Least 6 Weeks of Subcutaneous Low Dose IL-2.</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants were assessed for toxicities at mandatory study follow-up visits during the 8 week course of study therapy and four weeks post therapy. cGVHD was assessed at Weeks 8 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility: the number of participants who tolerated at least 6 weeks of therapy, and were thus evaluable for response. Efficacy: chronic GVHD response per NIH consensus criteria in evaluable patients.
A complete response was defined as resolution of all reversible chronic GVHD-associated manifestations, a partial response as an improvement of 50% or more on the organ-specific chronic GVHD scale without progression at other organs or sites, progressive disease as an increase of 25% or more on the organ specific chronic GVHD scale, and stable disease as an improvement of less than 50% or increase of less than 25%.

    <description>Changes in the above immune cell populations (CD3+T, CD4+T (including CD4+Treg and CD4+Tcon), CD8+T, NK, NKT and B cell counts were measured at study appointments during the 8-week IL-2 treatment and four weeks post study therapy.
All study participants (n=28) with a sample available were reported in the data table.

        <description>Feasibility: the number of participants who tolerated at least 6 weeks of therapy, and were thus evaluable for response. Efficacy: chronic GVHD response per NIH consensus criteria in evaluable patients.
A complete response was defined as resolution of all reversible chronic GVHD–associated manifestations, a partial response as an improvement of 50% or more on the organ-specific chronic GVHD scale without progression at other organs or sites, progressive disease as an increase of 25% or more on the organ specific chronic GVHD scale, and stable disease as an improvement of less than 50% or increase of less than 25%. Please refer to the Supplementary Appendix in our published report (Koreth et al, NEJM 2011) for further details.</description>
