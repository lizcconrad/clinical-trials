  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. Recurrent infection by
      Chlamydia trachomatis causes a gradual scarring process of the inner surface of the eyelid
      (conjunctiva) leading to in-turning of the eyelids (entropion) and lashes touching the eye
      (trichiasis). The rate of progression and the severity of disease are variable. Some people
      develop severe disease with extensive entropion and trichiasis, whilst others have a mild
      problem with only a few lashes touching the eye, which does not progress.

      In more advanced cases there is a broad consensus that the entropion / trichiasis should be
      corrected by surgery. In mild cases (minor trichiasis: 1-5 lashes touching the eye) the
      optimal treatment is uncertain. Some advocate early surgery to turn the eyelid out for any
      individual with one or more lashes touching any part of the eye. Others consider this to be
      too early for surgical intervention, as surgery can have a high recurrence rate and
      complications can arise. Instead, they recommend that minor trichiasis can be managed by
      epilation (pulling out lashes with forceps). In many endemic regions the uptake of surgery is
      low, with many patients preferring to epilate for mild disease.

      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the outcome of immediate surgery to regular
      epilation for the management of minor trichiasis. The epilation would be done by a person
      with good eyesight using proper epilation forceps.
