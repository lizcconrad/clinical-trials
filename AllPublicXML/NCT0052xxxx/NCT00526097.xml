  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study was to compare the efficacy and safety of 4 weeks treatment with
      bisacodyl (Dulcolax) tablets 10 mg to placebo in patients with functional constipation. In
      addition, the effect of treatment on quality of life and general health status was evaluated.

        <description>A Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movement (CSBM) is a complete non-rescue medication-induced stool.
The number of CSBMs in each of the 4 weeks was divided by the number of days where data were available in this week, multiplied by 7 and rounded off to the next integer. The sum of the resulting numbers were divided by the number of weeks with data.</description>
