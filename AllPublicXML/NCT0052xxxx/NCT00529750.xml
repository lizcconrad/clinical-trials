      Primary:

        -  To evaluate the impact of irbesartan on endothelial function in hypertensive patients
           with metabolic syndrome.

      Secondary:

        -  To evaluate the oxidative stress status in patients with hypertension with metabolic
           syndrome.

        -  To correlate the oxidative stress status with endothelial function in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the effect of irbesartan on the oxidative stress stage in patients with
           metabolic syndrome and to correlate it with the effect on endothelial function .

        -  To correlate the change in endothelial function and oxidative stress stage with the
           change of arterial pressure levels.
