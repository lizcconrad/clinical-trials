    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well a second curettage (removal of the abnormal cancer cells
      in the uterus using a method of surgically removing the lining of the uterus) works in
      treating patients with gestational trophoblastic tumors that did not go away after a first
      curettage (persistent) and has not yet spread to other places in the body (non-metastatic). A
      second curettage may be effective in treating persistent gestational trophoblastic tumors and
      may decrease the likelihood that patients will need chemotherapy in the near future.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the response to second curettage in patients with persistent, non-metastatic
      gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate if response to a second curettage is independent of the tumor burden as
      measured by the quantitative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) assay at study entry.

      II. To evaluate if response to a second curettage is independent of the depth of myometrial
      invasion as measured sonographically following the initial curettage but prior to study entry
      (when persistent disease is first diagnosed).

      III. To estimate the frequency of complications related to a second curettage, specifically
      infection of the fallopian tubes or ovaries, hemorrhage associated with curettage, or
      operative injury to the uterus.

      IV. To estimate the frequency of a change in the uterine histology between the first and
      second curettage.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo a second curettage rather than standard treatment (immediate chemotherapy)
      within 14 days of registration.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 14 days, weekly for 4 weeks,
      and then monthly for 5 months, and then every 3 months for 24 months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had hydatidiform mole treated by evacuation and/or curettage and now
             meet the criteria of low risk GTN, as defined by the International Federation of
             Gynecology and Obstetrics (F.I.G.O.)/World Health Organization (W.H.O.) 2002 staging
             and risk scoring criteria:

               -  A plateau in the beta-hCG assay for 4 consecutive weekly levels over a period of
                  3 weeks or longer; that is, days 1, 7, 14, 21; for this study, a plateau will be
                  defined as less than a 10% decline using as a reference the initial value in the
                  series of values taken over a period of 3 weeks; OR

               -  A rise in the beta-hCG assay of 3 consecutive measurements, or longer, over at
                  least a period of 2 weeks or more; days, 1, 7, 14; for this study, a rise will be
                  defined as an increase of greater than 20% taking as a reference the initial
                  value in the series of values taken over the 2-week period; OR
