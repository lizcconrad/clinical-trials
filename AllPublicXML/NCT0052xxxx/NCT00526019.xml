      This study aims at determining the patterns of asthma remission, the prevalence of these
      different patterns, the various factors associated with such remissions and possible
      recurrences of asthma, in order to determine the mechanisms involved in these processes.

      The investigators therefore want to document these specificities in subjects in complete
      remission of their asthma, and those in only symptomatic remission of their asthma, in
      comparison with mildly symptomatic asthmatic subjects and healthy controls.

      Primary Outcome Measures :

        -  Airway inflammation (% induced sputum eosinophils)

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

        -  Perception of induced respiratory symptoms

        -  Airway response to methacholine and AMP, and perception scores

        -  Diurnal variation in Peak Expiratory Flows

        -  Profile of regulatory T cells in the peripheral blood

        -  Changes in these parameters over time (baseline, 6 months, 1 and 2 years)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  In remission of their asthma: absence of respiratory symptoms, no rescue asthma
             medication need and (for complete remission) an optimal pulmonary function (FEV1 &gt;

          -  With a proven past history of asthma from medical files (reversible airway obstruction
             (&gt; 12% FEV1 after bronchodilator or 20% by other means) proven by spirometry, PEF
             measures or methacholine challenge according to current criteria + previous symptoms
             and asthma medication use), having no more asthma symptoms and not having used asthma
             medication for more than 2 years.
