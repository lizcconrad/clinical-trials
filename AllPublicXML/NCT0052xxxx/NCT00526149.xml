      RATIONALE: BI 2536 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well BI 2536 works in
      treating patients with recurrent or metastatic solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Investigate if BI 2536 demonstrates antitumor activity in the selected tumor types.

        -  Further document its safety profile in the treated patient population.

        -  Describe the plasma concentration time-course following administration of a single
           administration of BI 2536 in patients with different tumor types using an appropriate
           population pharmacokinetic model.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive BI 2536 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood is collected periodically during study. Plasma samples are analyzed for pharmacokinetic
      studies by HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.
