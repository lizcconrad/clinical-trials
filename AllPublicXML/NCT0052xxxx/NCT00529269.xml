      This study will evaluate the impact that GI complaints have on patient-reported outcomes and
      to determine if there is improvement in patient-reported outcomes when converted from
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) to Enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Received kidney transplant at least 1 month prior to study enrollment

             study enrollment

          -  Eligible to convert to enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) because of GI
             complaints OR not currently experiencing GI complaints and stable on current
             immunosuppressive regimen

          -  At least 18 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  GI symptoms assumed or known not to be caused by MPA (Mycophenolic acid) therapy (e.g.
             oral biphosphonates induced, infectious diarrhea)

          -  Acute rejection &lt; 1 week prior to study enrollment

          -  Woman of child-bearing potential who is planning to become pregnant or is pregnant
