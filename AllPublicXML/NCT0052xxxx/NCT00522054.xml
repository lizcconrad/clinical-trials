    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory and systemic disease that mainly affects
      the musculoskeletal system. The disease is often progressive and may result in reduced
      physical function, pain, fatigue, and joint destruction. Exercise programs are reported to
      improve physical functioning in patients with RA.

      Tai Chi is a traditional Chinese martial art that was developed in the 13th century, and
      combines slow and gentle movements with mental focus.

      The aim of this study was to examine the impact of a 12 weeks standardized Tai Chi group
      exercise program on disease activity, physical function and health status in patients with RA
      attending. Further, the patients experiences of possible effects of Tai Chi were to be
      obtained in a focus group interview.
