  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this project is to examine the effects of varenicline treatment used
      concomitantly with antipsychotic medications, on cognitive dysfunction in people with
      schizophrenia. The secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of this combination therapy
      on smoking in people with schizophrenia. This study will be a randomized, double blind,
      parallel group, placebo controlled 8 weeks trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive deficits have been considered as a core symptom domain of schizophrenia.
      Amelioration of or improvement in cognitive impairments is becoming an important focus of
      clinical treatment development. Varenicline is a potent and selective alpha 4 beta 2
      nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist that has been developed for smoking
      cessation. In animal studies, alpha 4 beta 2 receptor agonists significantly improve working
      memory and attention function. Subjects will be assigned in 1:1 ratio to receive varenicline
      or placebo respectively. Assessments will be done using several neuropsychologic tests,
      clinical rating scale including assessment of nicotine withdrawal scales.Varenicline has been
      found to be efficacious for smoking cessation in the general population and animal studies
      have demonstrated the cognitive benefits of this agent. However, no published work is
      available evaluating the cognitive effects in humans. Thus, patients may experience
      improvements in cognitive function and in people who are smokers, these people may be able to
      achieve abstinence in smoking. This will in turn improve long-term functional outcomes and
      health outcomes in people with schizophrenia. This is an exciting opportunity for discovery
      if indeed cognitive abilities could be improved with this adjunctive treatment.
