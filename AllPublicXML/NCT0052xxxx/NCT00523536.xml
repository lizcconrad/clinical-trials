      The purpose of this trial is to study the effect of a patient navigator-nurse team in
      improving the management of hypertension and other cardiovascular disease risk factors in a
      health care system taking care of a vulnerable, mostly Latino population.

      This study represents one phase of a large partnership grant with The Colorado Health
      Outcomes Program of the University of Colorado at Denver Health Sciences Center (UCDHSC) and
      Denver Health and Hospital Authority (DH). The overarching goal of Latinos Using Cardio
      Health Actions to Reduce Risk (LUCHAR) is to improve the primary and secondary prevention of
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Hispanics through a comprehensive research program aimed at
      (1) increasing awareness of CVD risk in the Hispanic community and increasing participation
      of high risk Hispanics in the health care system, (2) developing more effective models of
      care delivery for high risk patients in a health system, and (3) identifying markers that
      will more effectively identify Hispanic patients at high risk of CVD than current approaches
      based on traditional risk factors.

      This trial has been designed to assess the effectiveness of a quality improvement project
      which focuses on the hypertensive multiracial underserved population within the Denver Health
      system. In addition, we are hoping at study end to have developed and validate this project
      as an efficient and sustainable approach to improving blood pressure control and controlling
      cardiovascular risk factors, especially in the vulnerable patient population served at Denver
      Health.

      The objective of this quality improvement program is to conduct a randomized, primary
      care-based, efficacy trial evaluating the effectiveness of a patient navigator-nurse disease
      management intervention for treating hypertension and its associated cardiovascular risk
      factors using information obtained in earlier phases of the LUCHAR grant: i.e., algorithms,
      risk factor profiles, and qualitative data from focus groups and interviews. The study is
      designed to test the hypothesis that a patient navigator-nurse assisted intervention will
      improve blood pressure (BP) in vulnerable hypertensive patients, compared with usual clinical
      care.
