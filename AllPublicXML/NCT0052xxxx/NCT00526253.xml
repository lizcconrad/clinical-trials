      This study injects a person's own stem cells into heart muscle tissue after a person has one
      or more heart attacks. The purpose of the study is whether the stem cells will improve a
      patient's heart performance.

    <textblock>
      Autologous myoblasts are harvested from a patient's skeletal muscle tissue. The myoblasts are
      isolated and expanded in culture in a closed system. When a sufficient number of cells are
      estimated they are taken from culture, packaged in a suspension and sent to the patient's
      interventionalist. The interventionalist uses an injection catheter via femoral artery to
      inject the myoblasts directly into the myocardium.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Eligible patients must meet ALL of the following inclusion criteria during the
        screening/enrollment visit #1 and prior to being randomized into the study.
