  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II, open-label, multicenter study of AUY922 administered intravenously in
      patients with advanced solid malignancies to determine the maximum tolerated dose. Phase II
      expansion arms will investigate efficacy in patients with either HER2 positive or ER positive
      locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Additional patients with advanced solid
      malignancies will also be investigated in a separate expansion arm. Safety, pharmacokinetics
      and pharmacodynamics will be assessed.
