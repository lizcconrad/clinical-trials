  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of combination therapy with Trovax plus
      Docetaxel or Docetaxel alone in patients with prostate cancer with a rising prostate specific
      antigen (PSA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Docetaxel is the most active chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of prostate cancer.

      Trovax is vaccine that targets 5T4 receptors on tumor cells. 5T4 has been detected in the
      majority of primary prostate cancers. Based on pre-clinical and clinical data, it may be
      advantageous to administer a cancer vaccine before chemotherapy to enhance immune responses,
      thus leading to a more therapeutic approach for patients with metastatic androgen independent
      prostate cancer (AIPC).
