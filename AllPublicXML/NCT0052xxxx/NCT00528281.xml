    <textblock>
      This phase II study is a single-arm, two-stage, multicentre study to determine the clinical
      activity of lapatinib in combination with pemetrexed in patients with Non-Small Cell Lung
      Cancer (NSCLC) who have received one prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen. There will be a
      short safety run in portion of the study to determine the optimal treatment regimen (OTR) for
      the combination, since these two drugs have not previously been used together.

      Approximately 27 patients will be enrolled into the first stage of the study and if
      sufficient responses are seen an additional 27 patients will be enrolled into the second
      stage giving an overall evaluable patient number of 54. Patients will be treated with
      pemetrexed plus lapatinib at the determined OTR to disease progression, death or withdrawal
      from the study treatment for any reason.

      Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed on all patients at 6-week intervals, as
      well as at the end of treatment. Patients withdrawn from study treatment with stable disease
      will be assessed every 6 weeks until progression. Thereafter, patients will be followed for
      survival at approximately 12-week intervals until death or to a maximum of 5 years after last
      patient is enrolled, whichever comes first.

    <description>Lapatinib was administered once daily orally. Patients will begin treatment at Dose Level 0, using a lower dose of pemetrexed, 400mg (approved dose is 500mg). Absent a DLT or need for treatment delay in cycle 1, Dose level 0 or 1, patients may be dose escalated to dose level 1 or 2, respectively in cycle 2.</description>
