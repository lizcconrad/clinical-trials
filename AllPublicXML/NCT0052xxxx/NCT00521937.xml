  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 300 million people worldwide will have diabetes by the year 2025. About
      12 percent of those with diabetes will have had a foot ulcer, which is a major source of
      morbidity, concern, and cost.

      The foot ulcers are the leading cause of hospitalization among people with diabetes and often
      lead to amputation. The costs of treatment and the high morbidity and mortality associated
      with diabetic foot problems necessitate the need for a systemic approach to a foot ulcer
      management.

      Current local treatments of this type of ulcer are: dressings (hydrocolloids, alginate…), and
      growth factors. However modern dressings may not avoid infection and the results of the
      clinical studies are not significant in terms of complete healing rate or in terms of time to
      healing. Concerning growth factors, the only one whose therapeutic application made proof is
      the rhPDGF (Regranex®) with an increase in the number of ulcers completely healed at the
      twentieth week compared to placebo (50% and 35%, respectively).

      The advancement of tissue-engineering has made possible dermal replacement on human wounds to
      facilitate healing.

      A new sponge composed of collagen and glycosaminoglycans (chondroitins 4 and 6 sulphate),
      reticulated by ionic bonds with chitosan before freeze-drying, was developed in France. This
      sponge is a non-toxic product due to its non-chemical reticulation (ionic bonds),
      biocompatible and biodegradable processes, handling and storable easily.

      The objective of this study is to demonstrate that such a substitute, cellularized by
      functional allogenic fibroblasts, and complying with all safety conditions, enables to lead
      to healing of diabetic foot ulcers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female or male patient aged ≥ 18

          -  Patient with documented and stable* type I or II diabetes mellitus

          -  With diagnosis of neuropathic foot ulcer located on the plantar surface of the
             forefoot

          -  Ulcer with a surface area comprised between 1 and 15 cm2 included (after mechanical
             debridement of the ulcer)

          -  Palpable pulse evidenced on both feet (presence of dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior
             tibial pulse) or in absence of one pulse, a Systolic Pressure Index (SPI) by Doppler &gt;
             0.9 on the target limb

          -  Presence of diabetic foot ulcer for at least 4 weeks prior to enrolment

          -  Patient's ulcer extending through the dermis without exposure of muscle, tendon, bone,
             or joint capsule *means confirmed by HbA1C at least every 4 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Typical Charcot's foot

             radiological lesion facing the wound (bone erosion or disappearance of the cortical
             bone))
