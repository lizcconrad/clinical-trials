      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of using Seraffix LTB
      system for excisional biopsy wounds closure

      Excisional biopsy of the skin is a biopsy in which an entire lesion is removed. An excisional
      biopsy is in contrast to an incisional biopsy in which only a sample of tissue is cut into
      and removed. It is most frequently done to diagnose a skin growth such as a mole, or cancer
      of the skin.

      The most common method of wound closure of skin excisions is interrupted nonabsorbable
      sutures. The sutures should be removed as soon as adequate intrinsic bonding strength is
      sufficient, depending mostly on the specific body region (from 5-7 days for the face and up
      to 12-14 days for trunk and extremities).

      Laser energy, also known as laser welding, has been used on limited basis as an alternative
      to traditional wound closure method. There have been two fundamental approaches to laser
      assisted bonding of tissues:

        1. Laser welding-heating the approximated edges of cuts in tissues by a laser beam;

        2. Laser soldering- applying a biological solder onto the approximated edges and heating
           the solder (and the underlying tissue).

      Seraffix has developed the Seraffix LTB (Laser Tissue Bonding) System - a laser system for
      soft tissue bonding. This innovative system includes features that make laser soldering
      suitable for clinical use. The Seraffix system is composed of CO2 laser device, propriety
      grip device (Clamps) and soldering agent (Human Albumin).
