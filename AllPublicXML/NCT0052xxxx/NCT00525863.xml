  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to intense ATP-consuming processes in the brain, a high level of brain energy supply is
      required. A popular hypothesis regarding the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of
      schizophrenia postulates hypofunction of neuronal circuits in the prefrontal and
      limbic-temporal areas. An emerging body of data suggests that impaired energy metabolism due
      to mitochondrial dysfunction plays a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

      Under normal conditions cellular metabolic rate, i.e. oxygen and glucose consumption,
      increases proportionally with any increase in neuronal activity. The impaired energy
      metabolism due to mitochondrial dysfunction and frontal lobe hypofunction might be improved
      by increasing O2 supply to the brain. Oxygen-enriched air inhalation has been shown to
      increase brain oxygen supply. Hyperoxia therapy is a useful tool in the treatment of
      neurological and neurotrauma deficits.

      We therefore suggest a randomized double blind cross-over study of enriched inspired O2
      partial pressure in schizophrenia.

      It is surprising given the numerous findings on reduced energy metabolism in schizophrenia
      that simple treatment with inspired enriched oxygen has not been studied.

    <description>Patients will be treated with oxygen for 1 month and then for 1 month with regular air with the same flow rate and procedure or randomly in the opposite order. We propose to enrich the inspired oxygen partial pressure from 21 kPA to ~40 kPa in a double blind cross-over design. Ninety percent oxygen or regular air will be supplied from oxygen concentrators, through standard plastic nasal prongs, at a flow rate of 5 liters/minute, for 7 hours/day, throughout the night.</description>
