  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the event-driven base study is to determine the safety and efficacy,
      especially fracture-risk reduction, of odanacatib in postmenopausal women diagnosed with
      osteoporosis. In a placebo-controlled extension of the base study, participants continue to
      receive the same blinded study medication for a total of up to 5 years of blinded study
      medication combined between the base study and the extension. After all participants receive
      at least 5 years of blinded study medication, they will be invited to enroll into a second
      extension study in which they will receive open-label odanacatib for an additional 5 years.
