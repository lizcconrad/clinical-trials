      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response
      to kill tumor cells that express HER2/neu. Biological therapies, such as GM-CSF, may
      stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. It is not
      yet known whether vaccine therapy is more effective than GM-CSF in treating breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying vaccine therapy to see how well it works
      compared with GM-CSF in treating patients with breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine if the GP2 peptide/GM-CSF vaccine reduces the recurrence rate in
           HLA-A2-positive, HER2/neu-positive, node-positive, or high-risk node-negative breast
           cancer patients randomized to receive the vaccine versus the immunoadjuvant,
           sargramostim (GM-CSF), alone.

        -  To determine if the AE37 peptide/GM-CSF vaccine reduces the recurrence rate in
           HLA-A2-negative, HER2/neu-positive, node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast
           cancer patients randomized to receive the vaccine versus the immunoadjuvant, GM-CSF,
           alone.

        -  To monitor the invitro and invivo immunologic responses to the vaccines and correlate
           these responses with the clinical outcomes.

        -  To monitor for any unexpected toxicities with the vaccines.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to nodal status.
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: HLA-A2-positive patients receive GP2 peptide/GM-CSF vaccine intradermally (ID)
           every 3-4 weeks for a total of up to 6 inoculations.

        -  Arm II: HLA-A2-positive patients receive solely GM-CSF ID

        -  Arm III: HLA-A2-negative patients receive AE37 peptide/GM-CSF vaccine ID every 3-4 weeks
           for a total of up to 6 inoculations.

        -  Arm IV: HLA-A2-negative patients receive solely GM-CSF ID

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for the first 24
      months and then every 6 months for an additional 36 months.

      Booster inoculations are administered at 12, 18, 24, and 30 months from the date of patients'
      enrollment into the study. One booster inoculation is administered at each timepoint (+/- 2
      weeks) and will be the same inoculation (vaccine or GM-CSF only) as what patients received
      during their regular inoculation series.

    <description>Inoculations will be immediately halted if any serious adverse reactions occur which, when based upon appropriate judgment of the PI, are determined to jeopardize the patient or require medical or surgical intervention. Any death or grade 4 adverse drug experience found to be directly related to the experimental vaccine will result in suspension of patient enrollment to the study.</description>

    <time_frame>Immune response will be measured after every monthly inoculation in the regular inoculation series and after each inoculation in the booster series</time_frame>
    <description>Immune response will be measured by proliferation assays, dimer assays, and ELISPOT. Delayed type hypersensitivity reactions will be compared between the vaccinated group and GM-CSF-only group.</description>
