      The purpose of this research study is to find out if taking a multivitamin daily can affect
      the number of canker sores that people get and how long they last. Previous studies have
      shown that people who get canker sores are more likely to be deficient in one or more
      vitamins. It has also been found that correction of such vitamin deficiencies reduces the
      number and duration of canker sores. However, it is not known if taking a multivitamin daily
      will reduce the number and duration of canker sores.
