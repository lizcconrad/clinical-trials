  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing cardiac surgery will be randomized into one of two groups. Group A will
      be administered insulin using the hyperinsulinemic-normoglycemic clamp to normalize blood
      glucose levels intra-operatively. Group B will be administered insulin at the standard of
      care levels established by the participating institution. Patients will be followed at 10
      days, 15 days and one year post-operatively.

    <measure>post operative atrial fibrillation</measure>
    <time_frame>15-30 days post operative</time_frame>
    <description>Evidence suggests that maintaining intra-operative normoglycemia during cardiac surgery while providing exogenous glucose and high-dose insulin may decrease post-operative morbidity or mortality. Using a randomized, controlled design, we propose to test the primary hypothesis that normalization of blood glucose using a hyperinsulinemic-normoglycemic clamp technique reduces the risk of a composite of serious adverse outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery</description>

    <description>New postoperative delirium as determined by a Delirium Battery consisting of the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS), Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE - leaving out the drawing), Memorial Delirium Assessment Scaler, Modified Delirium Symptom Interview, and abbreviated Digit Span. Patients will be assessed twice a day for a maximum of five days postoperatively.</description>
