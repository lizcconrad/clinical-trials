             medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate
             measurement, 12 lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests.

          -  Currently smoking and have smoked an average of at least 10 cigarettes per day during
             the past year, with no period of abstinence greater than 3 continuous months in the
             past year.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          -  Pregnant or nursing women are excluded; women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who
             are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of contraception as outlined in
             the protocol from at least 14 days prior to study medication administration until
             completion of protocol-required procedures are excluded.

          -  Subjects with an estimated creatinine clearance (CLcr) &lt;80 mL/min derived using the
             method of Cockcroft and Gault.
