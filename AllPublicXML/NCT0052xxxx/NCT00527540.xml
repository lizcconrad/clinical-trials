  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pegylation of interferon prolongs the medication half-life which has resulted in Pegylated
      Interferon (PEG-IFN) as the new modality for treatment of chronic hepatitis C. We current
      this clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of domestic PEG-IFN alpha-2a
      (Pegaferon速) in the patients with chronic hepatitis C.

      We enroll 50 patients in to the study. The patients receive Pegaferon速 180 micgr per week
      plus ribavirin 10-15mg/kg per day. The patients are visited every 4 weeks with biochemistry
      lab tests. They are checked with quantitative HCV PCR on the third month after initiation of
      the treatment to assess early virologic response and at the end of the study for complete
      response rate and on the six month after treatment completion for sustained response rate.
      The patients with undetectable HCV RNA are considered as responders.
