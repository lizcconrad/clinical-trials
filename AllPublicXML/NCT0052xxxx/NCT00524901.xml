  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study that evaluates the effect of intravenous administration of a bolus
      EPO on the activation of EPOR-signal transduction cascades and myocardial apoptosis during
      cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Human atrial and ventricular tissue will be collected during
      CABG surgery for 3-vessel disease for the assay of EPOR signaling and apoptosis. Two atrial
      specimens will be collected before and at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
      Concomitantly, two transmural ventricular biopsies will be obtained, at the start and at the
      end of CPB. Immediately after obtaining the first atrial biopsy, one bolus of EPO will be
      administered intravenously. The atrial tissue will be split and appropriate sections will be
      frozen for determination of baseline expression or activity of a number of molecules
      including Erk1/2, STAT5, Akt and caspase-3 or embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemistry.
      Ventricular tissue will only be processed for immunohistochemistry. Additionally, plasma will
      be collected before the procedure and for up to 30 days post-procedure to examine release of
      markers of both myocardial ischemia and stress (CK-MB, Troponin T and NT-proBNP) and renal
      dysfunction (cystatin C, creatinine for eGFR). Before initializing the randomised study, a
      pilot study will be performed with 5 subjects that will not be treated to evaluate the
      feasibility of myocardial sample collection. Initiation of the randomised study will only
      commence if baseline activity of EPOR-STC can be determined in the atrial tissue and
      caspase-3 positive cells can be identified in the second ventricular biopsy.

             3-vessel coronary artery disease with an anticipated aortic cross clamp time of
             approximately 40 minutes and a total bypass time of approximately 90 minutes.

          -  Hemoglobin (Hb) concentration ≥7.4 mmol/l and ≤9.9 mmol/l within 7 days prior to CABG
