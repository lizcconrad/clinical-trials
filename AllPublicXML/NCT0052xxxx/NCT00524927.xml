  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to provide further supportive evidence that Methoxyflurane, a potent
      analgesic, administered using the Penthrox Inhaler is safe and efficacious in adult
      participants, specifically those who experience incident pain associated with a planned bone
      marrow biopsy.
