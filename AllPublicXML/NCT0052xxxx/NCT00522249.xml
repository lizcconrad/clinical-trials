  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the combination of Pegylated Alfa Interferon
      (PEG-Intron), Sunitinib and Tarceva to see if this drug combination delays the disease
      progression of patients with metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma. The first phase of this study
      will determine the best dose of Peg-Intron, Sunitinib and Tarceva when given in combination.
      The safety of giving these drugs in combination and response to treatment will also be
      examined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 75% of RCCs are highly vascularized tumors that overexpress a number of growth factors,
      including VEGF, PDGF, and bFGF. In addition, RCC tumors overexpress the receptors for these
      peptides. These ligands and receptors may be involved in the autocrine stimulation of tumor
      cell growth, or in the paracrine stimulation of neovascular or stromal fibroblast growth that
      supports tumor expansion. Novel treatment that specifically interrupts these signaling
      pathways may have significant anti-tumor activity. When taken together, these data provide a
      rationale for investigation of a combination therapy with PEG-Intron, Sunitinib and Tarceva
      for clear cell and papillary RCC patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or unresectable RCC. Patients
             must have a component of conventional clear cell renal carcinoma or papillary renal
             carcinoma.

          -  No more than three prior systemic therapies of any kind for RCC including: 1)
             Immunotherapy (Adjuvant vaccines, Interleukin-2, Interferon-α) 2) Chemotherapy 3)
             Molecular targeted agents (Nexavar [Sorafenib], Bevacizumab [Avastin]) 4)
             Investigational therapy

          -  Patients with their primary tumor in place who are appropriate surgical candidates
             should be strongly encouraged (but not required) to undergo nephrectomy.

          -  Prior palliative radiotherapy in metastatic lesion(s) is permitted, provided there is

             combination therapy.

          -  No deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus within 12 months of randomization and
             no ongoing need for full-dose oral or parenteral anticoagulation. Low dose coumadin (1
