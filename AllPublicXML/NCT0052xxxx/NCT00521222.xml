    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a study of asthma patients who use fluticasone with
      salmeterol (Advair) or any other combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a long
      acting beta agonist (LABA) to manage their asthma symptoms.

      Participants begin the study by continuing to use fluticasone with salmeterol or substituting
      fluticasone with salmeterol for their current ICS/LABA medication at their regular dose or
      the comparable dose(all study medications are provided) for a six-week period. Patients are
      then separated into 2 groups: one group is asked to use fluticasone (Flovent), the other to
      use fluticasone with salmeterol , twice daily over a 16-week period (patients will need to be
      seen monthly during this time). Neither study personnel nor patients will know which drug is
      being used.

      Patients are also asked to use a peak flow meter and record their daily results on a form,
      along with the number of puffs they use of their rescue inhaler each day. They also record
      any changes in asthma medications and information on any asthma episodes.

      The investigators hypothesize that there are certain patients with asthma who will do better
      when a long acting beta agonist is removed from their maintenance asthma medications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Beta 2 (b2) agonists are the most common type of bronchodilator used to treat asthma. Beta 2
      (b2) agonists are agents that bind to b2 receptors and cause muscle relaxation of the
      airways. There are different variants of the gene (genotypes) that influence how b2 agonists
      perform among the population.

      A recent study demonstrated that patients with mild asthma and the Arg/Arg variant at the
      16th amino acid position have improved lung function and asthma control when albuterol
      (Proventil-HFA), a short acting b2 agonist, is replaced with a different class of
      bronchodilator. The investigators plan to study asthma patients with distinct genetic makeups
      of the b2 receptor; specifically Arg/Arg and Gly/Gly.

      Throughout the treatment period, patients will be instructed to use ipratropium bromide
      (Atrovent-HFA), a bronchodilator which works through a different mechanism for rescue
      therapy; albuterol will be available for use if necessary.

      The goal of this study is to determine if the withdrawal of a beta 2 agonist leads to
      improved asthma control in those asthmatic patients with the Arg/Arg genotype compared with
      those with the Gly/Gly genotype.
