      This Phase I clinical trial is studying the side effects and best dose of ABT-888 when given
      together with Temozolomide (chemotherapy) in treating patients with solid tumors, including
      metastatic melanoma (MM), BRCA deficient breast, ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian
      tube cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

      A Phase 1, multicenter, dose-escalation study evaluating the safety and tolerability of the
      PARP inhibitor ABT-888 in combination with Temozolomide (TMZ) in subjects with
      non-hematologic malignancies (NHM), including metastatic melanoma (MM), BRCA deficient
      breast, ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC).
