  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is some controversy in the medical literature regarding the effectiveness of topical
      lidocaine in children as an adjuvant drug to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. In children,
      deep sedation and general anesthesia are often used to sedate children submitting to this
      procedure. Propofol is an anesthetic drug increasingly popular in this situation, but this
      drug can only be used with an anesthesiologist in Brazil. Its main side effects include
      hypotension, respiratory depression and local pain. Lidocaine is frequently used as
      premedication, and the rationale is that lowering patient discomfort could lower the required
      dose to achieve the endoscopy and reduce potential side effects. Nevertheless, some patients
      perceive this medication as uncomfortable. This study aims to compare sedative drug doses
      between patients who were given either placebo or topical lidocaine.

      This study is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial.

      Primary outcome: propofol doses required to achieve adequate sedation.

      Population: children submitting to upper digestive endoscopy, weight &gt; 30 kg and age between
      8 and 18 years.

      Exclusion criteria: neurological disorders, psychiatric disorders, specific contra-indication
      to either lidocaine or propofol.

      Estimated sample: 160 patients. Placebo: tannic acid 0.5%
