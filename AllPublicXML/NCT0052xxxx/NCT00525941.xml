    <textblock>
      NBI-34060 is an investigational (research) medication being studied in people with insomnia.
      The current study is designed to evaluate how people, who experience a nighttime awakening
      with difficulty returning to sleep, feel during the next day after dosing with NBI-34060. The
      study will also examine the pattern and extent of nighttime awakenings as reported by the
      patients, as well as and the patient's sleep experience during treatment.
