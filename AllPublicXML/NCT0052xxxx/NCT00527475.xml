  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single agent anti-VEGF therapies such as ranibizumab have shown great promise and have set
      the standard for visual outcomes in treating wet macular degeneration. However, they need to
      be administered frequently by intraocular injections with the attendant risk of
      endophthalmitis, lens damage, retinal detachment, and vitreous hemorrhage. The purpose of
      this trial is to see if using photodynamic therapy in combination with ranibizumab will
      decrease the number of treatments with ranibizumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, prospective, multicenter trial will compare two groups of patients with
      subfoveal choroidal neovascularization secondary to AMD. One group will receive 0.5 mg.
      ranibizumab intraocularly initially. This will be repeated monthly for 3 months total and
      then as needed over the period of one year. The other group will receive Reduced Fluence-PDT
      (25 Joules) followed by 0.5 mg. of ranibizumab intraocularly on the same day. The second
      group will receive the combination of ranibizumab and RF-PDT as needed over a period of one
      year. Re-treatment will be determined by the individual investigator based on visual acuity,
      retinal thickness as measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fluorescein
      angiography. Visual acuity and OCT measurements will be performed by masked examiners.
