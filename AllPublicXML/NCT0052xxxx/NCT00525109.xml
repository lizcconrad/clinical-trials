  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the genetic basis of one family's hereditary
      hyper-HDL-emia using multiple modalities such as linkage analysis and gene array.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HDL, or good cholesterol, has been shown to protect against heart attack and stroke. How HDL
      works as a protective agent is not well understood. There is a family that has 4 generations
      of living members with high HDL level. In the study, after consent is obtained, we will
      obtain 2 tablespoons of blood from all the family members in order to study their cholesterol
      levels and to obtain DNA in order to determine if there is a pattern of inheritance for this
      trait. We will also have them fill out a questionnaire about their medical history, diet and
      activity level as all of these can affect their HDL levels. In addition we will obtain
      additional blood (about 2 tablespoons) for plasma, white blood cells and also perform a
      biopsy to obtain skin cells from a matched pair of family members with and without the trait
      in order to determine which genes might be turned on and off because of this trait. We also
      wish to study other families who have members with high HDL cholesterol as well. These
      individuals will be identified from a core database.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  26 living members of a family with HDL levels greater than 90mg/dl and several of whom
             will act as related age matched controls.

          -  The investigators will also identify individuals in a lipid core database with HDL's
             of greater than 90mg/dl who have normal or low LDL and triglyceride levels and
             determine if they have normal or low LDL and triglyceride levels and determine if they
             have family members (parents or siblings) who also have high HDL cholesterol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals who are not a member of the study family and individuals with high HDL's
             and elevated LDL and/or triglycerides.
