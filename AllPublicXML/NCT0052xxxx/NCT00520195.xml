    <textblock>
      This is an intervention study which evaluates the cardiovascular primary preventive effects
      of using stairs instead of elevators at the worksite during a 12-weeks period. We hypothesize
      that stair-climbing during working hours can meet the daily amount of physical activity
      recommended by current public health guidelines.
