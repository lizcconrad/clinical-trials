      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an intense family-centered program to help
      children, 4 to 7 years old, control their weight is more effective than the advise and
      referrals their health provider gives in the primary care office.

      This randomized controlled trial is designed to determine whether an intense 6 month
      family-centered intervention to increase physical activity and health eating patterns,
      primarily directed at parents, followed by a 6 month maintenance period, will be
      significantly more successful in controlling weight in overweight/obese children, ages 4-7
      years, than usual standard care, at 2 years after enrollment. The intervention group (180
      children with a BMI &gt; 85% percentile) will receive standard of care, as well as, additional
      parental counseling. Parents will receive intense counseling regarding developmentally
      appropriate physical activity, strategies for reducing sedentary behaviors, nutritional
      counseling, and behavioral counseling including a self-management program to use with their
      children at home. The group will meet once a week for the initial 8 weeks, biweekly for 8
      weeks, and monthly for 2 months. Following this period (the next 6 months), a case manager
      will call the family on a monthly basis and the family will be sent educational and support
      information by mail. The control group (60 children with a BMI &gt; 85% percentile) will receive
      standard care provided by their primary care provider and be offered a six week optional
      parenting class. All children will have a medical history, physical examination, and
      anthropometric measures, nutritional assessment, measurement of physical activity, and
      behavioral/psycho-social measures provided by study personnel. Outcome measurements will be
      done at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.
