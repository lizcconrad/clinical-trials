      Background and Introduction:

      SDB is increasingly recognized as a co-morbidity with significant impact on overall health.
      The disorder has been implicated in the development of hypertension, atherosclerotic
      cardiovascular disease as well as arrhythmia, stroke and the progression of congestive heart
      failure. The disorder is prevalent among males, estimated to affect upto 24% of the general
      population. Its prevalence increases with age, and it is particularly prevalent among
      patients with congestive heart failure with the prevalence rising to 51% in that group.
      Interestingly, recent evidence points to a potential impact for treating sleep disordered
      breathing, on heart failure patients. At the same time, recent reports of a beneficial impact
      of atrial overdrive pacing on SDB, have stirred interest in a potentially effective and well
      tolerated non-pharmacologic means of therapy for this disorder. Particularly at a time when
      cardiac resynchronization therapy utilizing biventricular pacing has demonstrated significant
      impact on heart failure, the interplay between CHF and SDB pacemaker based therapy begs
      further exploration. The interdependence of potential positive impact on each entity needs to
      be elucidated for further research and refinement of therapeutic tools. Furthermore, this
      study aims to explore potential neurohormonal influence on and affection by each of these
      disorders.

      Specific Aims and Hypotheses:

      Specific Aim #1: To assess the effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with or
      without atrial pacing on SDB in patients with advanced CHF at 8 and 16 weeks after
      implementation of therapy.

      Hypothesis #1: Resynchronization therapy improves SDB, the effect may anticipate or lag
      improvement in heart failure. Atrial pacing has a beneficial effect in addition to CRT.

      Specific Aim #2: To explore the effect of CRT on cardiac neuro-hormonal activity in relation
      to its effects on CHF and SDB.

      Hypothesis #2: CRT neuro-hormonal modulation is a common path in its effects on SDB and CHF.

      Specific Aim #3: To assess prevalence of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in patients with
      advanced congestive heart failure (CHF).

      Hypothesis #3: SDB is prevalent yet under recognized in this patient population.

      Research Design:

      This is an observational study with a built in double blinded prospective randomized
      interventional substudy of a potential confounder i.e. atrial pacing. All patients will
      receive CRT with defibrillator for clinical indications (CRT-D). Investigators other than the
      EP physicians as well as patients will be blinded to the pacing mode. After screening and a
      run in period of back up pacing a baseline polysomnogram (PSG) will be performed. Patients
      will be randomized between atrial overdrive or atrial tracking pacing modes for six months,
      all patients receiving CRT. Sleep studies will be performed at baseline and at three month
      intervals. Subjects: Patients referred for implantation of CRT -D will be recruited for this
      trial. Patients are included only if they are indicated for such a device on clinical
      grounds. Outcome Measures: 1.Sleep quality related Parameters:The following will be collected
      at times of each PSG: MAP-PSQI, PSG parameters of sleep quality and architecture, apnea
      hypopnea index, and oxygen saturation as well as biochemical markers of sleep efficiency.
      2.Heart Failure Parameters: The following will be obtained at times of each PSG: Minnesota
      Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, Clinical and echocardiographic measures of heart
      failure progression and biochemical markers of heart failure severity.

      Power Analysis: An improvement in SDB in both initial randomization arms is assumed, however
      we further assume the atrial overdrive arm will offer improvement over the atrial tracking
      arm of equal magnitude. An arbitrary estimate would be twenty percent improvement in atrial
      overdrive arm. The corresponding estimate is 40% improvement due to CRT. To achieve 0.80
      power thirty four data sets need to be collected.
