  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare collagen composition in the skin and fascia of patients
      with recurrent or incisional hernias versus normal controls. We will identify potential genes
      responsible for genetic alterations in collagen deposition by using gene chip analysis of the
      tissue obtained and comparing the hernia group versus controls. The ultimate goal of this
      study is to identify target genes which may help us eventually predict which patients are at
      risk for developing post-operative hernias.

      This is a prospective, case control pilot study with the aim of identifying potential genetic
      influences on recurrent hernia formation. Patients with recurrent abdominal hernias will be
      compared with normal control subjects. The study endpoints will compare tissue collagen I/III
      ratios between the groups. It will also use gene chip technology to identify potential
      differences in gene expression between the two groups, followed by confirmation of the
      differential expression using RT-PCR.

      Patients will be enrolled from the surgical clinic population. If they consent to the study,
      both the hernia group and the control group will have 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.1 cm3 pieces of skin and
      fascia collected at the time of their surgery. A small piece of tissue will be used for
      immunofluorescene to study collagen I/III ratios. RNA will be extracted from the rest of the
      tissue for the genetic studies.
