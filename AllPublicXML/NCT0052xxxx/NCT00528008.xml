  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if chlorhexidine gluconate solution is better at
      reducing the rate of wound infection after cesarean section compared to povidone-iodine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wound infection is a universal potential morbidity to any type of surgery. Over the years
      many studies have been completed to evaluate ways to decrease this morbidity. Recent
      literature has looked at different types of surgical solutions used in pre-operative
      cleansing. Chlorhexidine and povidone-iodine are two standard surgical prep solutions used on
      a global scale. The most recent literature has shown that chlorhexidine has a decreased wound
      infection rate for longer surgeries. Cesarean section, as a surgical time, varies from 20 -
      60 minutes. There has been no known literature regarding wound infection rates using these
      two solutions in elective cesarean sections. This trial will review the rates of wound
      infection using chlorhexidine and povidone-iodine during elective cesarean section and
      determine if there is any statistically significant difference between the two solutions. The
      results could potentially decrease wound infection rates, decrease morbidity, decrease
      hospital length of stay, and help to guide further surgical management.
