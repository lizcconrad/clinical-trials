        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Candidates with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse of ICS POP-Q Stage II or III,
             suitable for surgical repair. Vaginal hysterectomy, perineal repair and/or mid
             urethral sling procedures for incontinence may be performed concurrently.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Agrees to participate in the study, including completion of all study-related
             procedures, evaluations and questionnaires, and documents this agreement by signing
             the Ethics Committee / IRB approved informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Additional surgical intervention concurrent to the PROSIMA procedure (e.g.
             sacrocolpopexy, paravaginal repair, tubal sterilisation).

          -  Previous repair of pelvic organ prolapse involving insertion of mesh.

          -  Previous hysterectomy within 6 months of scheduled surgery.

          -  Experimental drug or experimental medical device within 3 months prior to the planned
             procedure.

          -  Active genital, urinary or systemic infection at the time of the surgical procedure.
             Surgery may be delayed in such subjects until the infection is cleared.

          -  Coagulation disorder or on therapeutic anticoagulant therapy at the time of surgery.

          -  History of chemotherapy or pelvic radiation therapy.

          -  Systemic disease known to affect bladder or bowel function (e.g. Parkinson's disease,
             multiple sclerosis, spina bifida, spinal cord injury or trauma).

          -  Current evaluation or treatment for chronic pelvic pain (e.g. interstitial cystitis,
             endometriosis, coccydynia, vulvodynia).

          -  Nursing or pregnant or intends future pregnancy.

          -  In the investigator's opinion, any medical condition or psychiatric illness that could
             potentially be life threatening or affect their ability to complete the study visits
             according to this protocol.
