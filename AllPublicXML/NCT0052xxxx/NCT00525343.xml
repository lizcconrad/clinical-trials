      The Avonex Fifteen-year Long-term Follow-up of Patients with Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis:
      ASSessment of Drug Utilization, EaRly TreAtmeNt, and Clinical OutcomEs (ASSURANCE), was a
      single-time-point evaluation of patients conducted 15 years after the pivotal MSCRG study,
      evaluated the impact of IM IFNβ-1a treatment on long-term disability and Quality of Life
      outcomes in patients who completed 2 years in a previous Multiple Sclerosis Collaborative
      Research Group (MSCRG) study.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the impact of early versus delayed
      initiation of treatment on the long-term physical status of patients with relapsing forms of
      MS measured by the self-reported EDSS.

      Primary endpoints for this study were as follows:

        1. Changes in EDSS score from baseline for original Avonex® pivotal trial

        2. Percentage of patients with EDSS scores less than or equal to 4

        3. Percentage of patients with EDSS scores less than or equal to 6

        4. Percentage of patients with EDSS scores less than or equal to 7

      Secondary endpoints were:

        1. Percentage of patients alive

        2. Percentage of patients living independently

        3. SF 36 Quality of Life status

        4. Self-reported VAS of independence with self-care
