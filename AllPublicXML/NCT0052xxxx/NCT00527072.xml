  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of infliximab in patients
      with plaque psoriasis who have been receiving the drug etanercept for treatment of their
      plaque psoriasis for at least four months, without enough improvement in their psoriasis
      symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most common form of psoriasis is plaque-type psoriasis, which is characterized by
      recurrent flaring of thickened, red, scaly patches of skin. Although psoriasis is usually not
      life threatening, these physical discomforts combined with the potential psychological
      effects of the disease may interfere with everyday activities and negatively impact an
      individual's quality of life. Many therapies are available for psoriasis; however, with
      limited effectiveness and significant toxicity. Infliximab is an antibody made in a
      laboratory. Antibodies are proteins that fight other substances in the body that may cause
      infections or diseases. A substance called &quot;tumor necrosis factor&quot; (TNF) naturally occurs in
      the body. TNF is related to the itchy patches of skin (or plaques) of psoriasis. Infliximab
      stops the TNF from working. Other studies have shown that stopping the TNF may reduce the
      plaques. To address the unmet medical need for effective chronic therapies, TNFalpha blockers
      have recently been used to treat patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.
      Etanercept also works by stopping the TNF, but in a different way than infliximab. This
      multi-center, open-label study is designed to test whether or not patients with plaque
      psoriasis who have not responded well to etanercept treatment may benefit from treatment with
      infliximab. Key effectiveness measurements will include the time to onset of symptom
      improvement and health-related quality of life. Safety will be assessed throughout the study.
      Two weeks after their last dose of etanercept, all eligible patients will receive open-label
      5 mg/kg infliximab infusions at Weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, and 22.

    <description>A PASI 50 responder is defined as a patient who has achieved at least a 50% improvement in the overall PASI score from baseline. PASI is an index used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A score less than 10 signifies a mixture of mild and moderate disease; a score greater than 10 but less than or equal to 30 signifies moderate disease; and a score greater than 30 signifies severe disease.</description>

        <title>Number of Patients Achieved Psoriasis Area Activity Index (PASI) 50 Response at Week 10</title>
        <description>A PASI 50 responder is defined as a patient who has achieved at least a 50% improvement in the overall PASI score from baseline. PASI is an index used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A score less than 10 signifies a mixture of mild and moderate disease; a score greater than 10 but less than or equal to 30 signifies moderate disease; and a score greater than 30 signifies severe disease.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 10</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis is based on observed mITT (modified Intent to Treat) patients. Treatment failures are classified as not achieving a PASI 50, 75, 90, or 100 response at all visits after the date of treatment failure. For non-treatment failure patients who did not have a PASI score at the visit due to other reasons, will not have data imputed at that visit.</population>
