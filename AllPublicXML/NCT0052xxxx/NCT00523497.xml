  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the noninvasive ventilation is more
      effective in the treatment of severe comunity acquired pneumonia in comparison with the
      conventional mechanical ventilation with orotracheal intubation.

  <why_stopped>
    Interim analysis of the present study showed a significant decrease in mortality rate (p= 0.04)
    as well as in the number of days at the ICU p=0.0002.
