    <textblock>
      Phantom limb pain is a complication of amputation. Although pre-empitve epidural analgesia
      was once thought to prevent such a com plication, recent studies did not demonstrate this.
      Peripheral blocks are more powerful then epidurals, and can even influence somatotropic
      representation in the brain. This a prospective case series in which the investigators hope
      to show a decrease, against historical control, of the incidence of post-operative amputation
      lower limb phantom pain. The investigators established the block at least 24 hours
      pre-operative and continue it for at least 2 days. Patient are followed daily for the 1st 3
      days and then up to 3 month for the incidence of phantom limb pain. The investigators hope to
      recruit 30 patients.

Once localized, a bolus of 20 mL ropivacaine 1,0% is given through the catheter and is followed by a perfusion of ropivacaine 0,2% 6-10 mL/hre for at least 24 hours pre-op and 48 hours post-op</description>
