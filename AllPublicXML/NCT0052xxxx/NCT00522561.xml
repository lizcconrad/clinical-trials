  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inter-individual variability in energetic cost of running may be partly explained by lower
      limbs mechanical characteristics. The transposition of muscle mechanical model with two
      components (contractile and elastic) to the whole lower limb mechanical behavior analysis
      during running. The main aim of present investigation is to study the effects of lower limb
      mechanical characteristic (force, velocity, stiffness) on the energetic cost of running using
      a lower limb mechanical approach including both contractile and elastic components.Twenty
      healthy men will run on a treadmill at 12km.h-1 in 8 different 5 min-conditions. Through
      conditions, stride frequency, sole stiffness and subject's body weight will be changed to
      allow artificial variations in lower limb mechanical characteristics. Energetic and
      non-invasive mechanical measurements analysis will be performed to obtain energetic cost of
      running and to compute force, velocity and stiffness of lower limbs for each condition.

      Main aim: Identify the effect of mechanical characteristic induced on lower limbs on the
      energetic cost of running.

      Secondary aim : Minimize the energetic cost of running by lower limb mechanical
      characteristics optimization.
