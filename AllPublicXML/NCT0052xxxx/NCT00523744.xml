    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of valsartan and amlodipine in fixed dose
      combination in adults with moderate, inadequately controlled hypertension. There was an
      optional study extension for eligible patients who wanted to participate that contains the
      triple therapy (ie, hydrochlorothiazide+ amlodipine/valsartan).

      Title of study extension: An open-label, multicenter extension to evaluate the efficacy and
      tolerability of a 4 week therapy with hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg plus amlodipine 10
      mg/valsartan 160 mg in hypertensive patients not adequately responding to a 4 week therapy
      each with the combinations of olmesartan 20 mg plus amlodipine 10 mg followed by amlodipine

    <time_frame>Baseline Phase 2 (Week 4) to end of Phase 2 (Week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic pressures were found at study entry was the arm used for all subsequent readings. A calibrated sphygmomanometer and appropriate size cuff were used to measure arterial sitting blood pressure (BP) at trough with the arm supported at the level of the heart. At each study visit, after having the patient in a sitting position for at least 5 minutes, systolic/diastolic blood pressure were measured 3 times at 1-2 minute intervals. A mean was calculated from the 3 measurements. A negative change indicates improvement.</description>
