    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of EZN-2208
      that can be given to patients with advanced cancer or lymphoma. The safety of the study drug
      and its effect on the disease will also be studied.

      Enzon will also perform pharmacokinetic (PK) testing of EZN-2208. PK testing measures the
      amount of a drug in the body at different time points.
