  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Antibody response to each influenza vaccine antigen as measured by Single Radial Hemolysis in elderly subjects (≥65y) in compliance with the requirements of the current EU recommendations for a new formulation of a licensed flu vaccine (CPMP/BWP/214/96)</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days post-vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>The measures of immunogenicity for each antigen are:
the geometric mean area (GMA) on Day 0 and Day 21
the Day 21/Day 0 geometric mean area ratio (GMR)
the percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion1 or significant increase in antibody titer2
the percentage of subjects achieving an SRH area ≥ 25 mm2 on Day 0 and Day 21
Seroconversion is defined as negative prevaccination serum/postvaccination serum area ≥ 25 mm2.
Significant increase in antibody titer is defined as at least a 50% increase in area.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the safety of the administration of a single intramuscular (IM) injection of FLUAD® vaccine (formulation 2007/2008) in elderly subjects (≥ 65 years).</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days, respectively 21 days post-vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Number and percentage of subjects with at least one local reaction between Day 0 and Day 3 after vaccine injection.
Number and percentage of subjects with at least one systemic reaction between Day 0 and Day 3 after vaccine injection.
Number and percentage of subjects with at least one adverse event between Day 0 and the study termination visit (Day 21, window: 20-24).</description>

    <description>A single 0.5mL dose of Novartis adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine, Fluad contained 45μg of viral hemagglutinin, composed of 15μg of the three influenza antigens:
A(H1N1) strain: IVR-145 (Solomon Island/3/2006 - like strain)
A(H3N2) strain: NYMC X-161B (A/Wisconsin/67/2005-like strain)
B strain: (B/Malaysia/2506/2004-like strain) in accordance with the recommendations of the World Health Organization, the EU and the national Regulatory Agencies for the 2007/2008 season.
The vaccine is a milky liquid, and was packaged in ready to use, single dose syringes.
A single dose of FLUAD vaccine was administered intramuscularly, preferably in the deltoid muscle of the non dominant arm.</description>
