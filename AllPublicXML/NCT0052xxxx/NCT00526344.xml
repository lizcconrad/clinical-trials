  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at determining the patterns of asthma remission, the prevalence of these
      different patterns and the various factors associated with such remissions and possible
      recurrences of asthma, in order to determine the mechanisms involved in these processes.

      We therefore want to document these specificities in studying biopsies of subjects in
      complete remission of their asthma and those in only symptomatic remission of their asthma,
      in comparison with mildly symptomatic asthmatic subjects and healthy controls.

      Primary Outcome Measures :

      Airway inflammation and remodeling: in bronchial biopsies

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

      Comparisons of bronchial biopsy features between groups:

        -  Bronchial epithelial morphology

        -  Bronchial mucosa (smooth muscle, reticular basement membrane, submucosal gland,...)

        Subjects with current asthma or in remission of asthma from primary care clinics will be
        allowed to participate to this study. Healthy subjects will also be invited by
        advertisements in newspapers to volunteer for this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  In remission of their asthma: absence of respiratory symptoms, no rescue asthma
             medication need and (for complete remission) an optimal pulmonary function (FEV1 &gt;
             90%) and normal PC20 methacholine for more than two years (with no current treatment).

          -  With a proven past history of asthma from medical files (reversible airway obstruction
             (&gt; 12% FEV1 after bronchodilator or 20% by other means) proven by spirometry, PEF
             measures or methacholine challenge according to current criteria + previous symptoms
             and asthma medication use), having no more asthma symptoms and not having used asthma
             medication for more than 2 years.

          -  Agree to sign the consent form.

          -  No other condition that could interfere with the study measurements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects using inhaled or oral anti-inflammatory agents.

          -  FEV1 &lt; 1.2 L.

          -  Unable to adhere to the protocol requirements.

          -  Other current respiratory disease

          -  Upper or lower respiratory tract infection or use of antibiotics &lt; 1 month.

          -  Use of oral corticosteroids within the last 3 months.

          -  Signs or symptoms of progressive or uncontrolled renal, hepatic, hematologic,
             endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic or cerebral disease.
