  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major cause of premature death in renal transplant recipients is cardio-vascular disease.
      In addition, obesity is becoming a major problem in this patient population. Rimonabant does
      not only seem to have weight reducing properties but also weight reduction independent
      effects on insulin sensitivity and endothelial function, two important cardio-vascular risk
      factors. Rimonabant therefore is an interesting drug for the treatment of transplanted
      patients. Present data also indicate that rimonabant does not interact with essential
      immunosuppressive drugs (CsA and Tac) indicating that it most probably is safe to administer
      to this patient population. However this needs to be investigated in a proper manner.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal transplant recipients are treated with life-long immunosuppressive therapy in order to
      prevent acute rejection episodes. The calcineurin inhibitors (CsA and Tac) are the back-bones
      in the immunosuppressive treatment and they have a very narrow therapeutic index. It is
      therefore essential to assure that new drug to be used in transplanted patients do not
      interact with CsA and Tac. Even though rimonabant is metabolized via the same enzyme as CsA
      and Tac (CYP3A4) previous in vitro and in vivo studies with relevant probe drugs in healthy
      volunteers do not indicate the presence of any relevant pharmacokinetic interaction. However,
      to be absolutely sure that it is safe to administer rimonabant in transplanted patients a
      12-hour pharmacokinetic interaction investigation is included for 16 patients in the present
      pilot study (8 patients on CsA and 8 patients on Tac).
