      The primary objective is to assess for independent predictors of in-hospital mortality (up to
      28 days) in patients with Acinetobacter bloodstream infection. Secondary Objectives include
      the following: To determine the impact of inactive empiric antimicrobial therapy, defined as
      receipt of empiric antimicrobial therapy with no in vitro activity against the offending
      isolate for at least 24hrs, on the outcome (end points defined below) of patients with
      Acinetobacter bloodstream infection. To determine the impact of carbapenem resistance and
      pan-drug resistance (defined as resistance to all antimicrobials except colistin and/or
      tigecycline if these agents were tested) on the outcome of patients with Acinetobacter
      bloodstream infection. To assess the efficacy of varying definitive therapies on the outcome
      of patients with Acinetobacter bloodstream infection. To characterize the molecular
      epidemiology of Acinetobacter on a global level, as determined by pulsed-field gel
      electrophoresis (PFGE) and other techniques, and to assess whether patient outcomes are
      clonally related and to characterize the mechanisms of resistance in Acinetobacter on a
      global scale.

      Medical records will be reviewed and information collected from charts to assess for
      independent predictors of in-hospital mortality (up to 28 days) in patients with
      Acinetobacter bloodstream infection. 24 sites will participate and all information will be
      loaded into a password protected database.
