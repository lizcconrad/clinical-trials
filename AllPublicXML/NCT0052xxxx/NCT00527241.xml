    <textblock>
      This trial will test the impact of a culturally tailored and theory driven primary intimate
      partner violence prevention intervention with Spanish speaking Latino men.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized controlled trial, Spanish speaking Latino men will be recruited from
      community church settings in Southwest Detroit and randomly assigned to: (a) an intimate
      partner violence prevention intervention or (b) a wait-list control condition. Latino men
      assigned to the intervention will receive, in a small group setting, an 8-session, primary
      intimate partner violence prevention intervention based on the Duluth model and culturally
      and linguistically tailored for Spanish speaking Latino men. Measures will be administered at
      pre-test, and at three and six months post-intervention.
