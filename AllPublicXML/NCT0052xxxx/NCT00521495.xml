    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase II study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a large scale
      trial which will evaluate the effectiveness of static magnetic field therapy as a treatment
      for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. This preliminary study will determine which of three strength
      magnets to use in the future.

      Participants will be recruited from three primary sources. 1) Patients with a possible
      diagnosis of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome who have been referred to the Orthopaedic and
      Rehabilitation Clinics of OHSU for Nerve conduction studies. If after conducting these
      studies a potential participant shows evidence of mild to moderate Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
      s/he will be informed about the study and invited to participate in additional screening. B)
      Patients seen at the National College of Natural Medicine (NCNM) Clinics who have a clinical
      diagnosis of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome will be informed about the study and invited to enter the
      screening process for further eligibility. C) Participants will also be recruited from the
      general public including staff and students at OHSU and NCNM).

      Eligibility will be determined through a stepwise process including telephone screening for
      general eligibility, Nerve Conduction screening for electrodiagnostic eligibility, and Boston
      Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire screening for symptom severity eligibility. Those potential
      participants who meet all eligibility requirements will be randomized to one of three
      magnetic field dosages. They will be provided with a ¾&quot; diameter x 1/8&quot; thick magnet which
      they will be required to apply for six weeks during the hours of sleep. Over the course of
      the study participants will have four visits to the General Clinical Research Center of OHSU
      and three visits to the Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Clinics of OHSU for Nerve Conduction
      studies to be performed by either Dr. Nels Carlson or Dr. Hans Carlson.

      Questionnaires to be completed during the course of the study include a general health
      information and demographics questionnaire, the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire, which
      will be completed on six occasions, a general symptoms checklist and a Post Treatment
      Participant satisfaction questionnaire.

      Recruitment, retention, compliance and safety will be analyzed using descriptive statistics.
      Effectiveness of the three different strength magnets will be assessed by comparing
      participants' baseline scores on the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire with their scores
      after six weeks of magnet use.
