  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects 2-3% of the population and leads to a great deal
      of suffering. Many patients benefit from established treatments, the mainstay of which are
      cognitive behavioral therapy and a group of antidepressant medications known as serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors. However, 20-30% of patients get minimal benefit from these established
      therapeutic strategies. New avenues of treatment are urgently needed.

      Existing medications for obsessive-compulsive disorder affect the neurotransmitters serotonin
      or dopamine; but increasing evidence suggests that functional disruptions of a different
      neurotransmitter, glutamate, may contribute to some cases of OCD. The investigators are
      therefore interested in using medications that target glutamate as novel treatment options
      for those OCD patients who do not benefit from established treatments.

      One such medication is the drug riluzole, which is FDA approved for amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig's disease, but may be of benefit to patients with psychiatric
      disorders due to its ability to moderate excessive glutamate. In preliminary studies, in
      which the investigators treated patients with riluzole (in addition to their established
      pharmacological regimen) in an open-label fashion (that is, without a placebo-treated control
      group), the investigators have found about 40-50% of patients to substantially improve over
      2-3 months.

      While immensely promising, these preliminary studies do not prove riluzole is truly a new
      beneficial medication for the treatment of OCD; a more rigorous placebo-controlled trial is
      needed for that purpose. The investigators are therefore now recruiting patients to
      participate in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of riluzole, added to whatever other
      OCD medications they are taking.

    <measure>Partial Responders by Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) is a test to rate the severity of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms. The scale is a clinician-rated, 10-item scale, each item rated from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptoms), yielding a total possible score range from 0 to 40. The results can be interpreted based on the total score:
0-7 is sub-clinical; 8-15 is mild; 16-23 is moderate; 24-31 is severe; 32-40 is extreme.
Improvement was defined apriori as a 25% improvement from baseline</description>

    <measure>Average Hamilton Depression Inventory (HAM-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HDRS (also known as the HAM-D) is the most widely used clinician-administered depression assessment scale. The HAM-D 17-item scale ranges from 0 (normal) to &gt;23 (very severe depression), with a maximum score of 52. The 24-item scale has a maximum score of 75. Severity of depression (e.g. &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;very severe&quot;) is based upon the score in the first 17-items.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Hamilton Anxiety Inventory (HAM-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS or HAM-A) is a psychological questionnaire used by clinicians to rate the severity of a patient's anxiety. Total score ranges from 0 to 56. A score of 17 or less indicates mild anxiety severity. A score from 18 to 24 indicates mild to moderate anxiety severity. A score of 25 to 30 indicates a moderate to severe anxiety severity. A score of 31 or greater represents very severe anxiety severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression (CGI) - Severity of Illness Item</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a patient is assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline mentally ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely ill.</description>

          <description>The Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) is a test to rate the severity of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms. The scale is a clinician-rated, 10-item scale, each item rated from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptoms), yielding a total possible score range from 0 to 40. The results can be interpreted based on the total score:
0–7 is sub-clinical; 8–15 is mild; 16–23 is moderate; 24–31 is severe; 32–40 is extreme.</description>
