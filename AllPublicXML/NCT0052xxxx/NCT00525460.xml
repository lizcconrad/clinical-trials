      The purpose of this study is to ask youn women diagnosed with ovarian cancer who have
      undergone surgery that will allow them to have children in the future, on issues such as:
      education about their options to keep their ability to have children, after-chemotherapy
      treatment decision making, and reproductive history. The second purpose is to determine the
      effect of an early diagnosis of ovarian cancer on the sexual functioning of women.
