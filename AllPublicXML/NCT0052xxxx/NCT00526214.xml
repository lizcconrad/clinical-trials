      1. INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA

             1. Inclusion Criteria

                  -  Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage was documented by CT scanning within 24
                     hours of the onset of symptoms

                  -  Supratentorial location of hemorrhage

                  -  Older than 17 yrs

                  -  Informed consent before study

             2. Exclusion Criteria

                  -  Planned surgical evacuation of hematoma within 24hrs

                  -  Secondary ICH such as trauma or aneurysmal rupture

                  -  Taking anticoagulation previously

                  -  Pregnancy,known allergy to celecoxib, severe liver or kidney disease, or poor
                     performance state were excluded

                  -  Other physical condition, making the patient difficult to participate in this
                     study (decided by the neurologist or the physician).

        2. OTHER THERAPY

           -No limitation of other medications except NSAIDs, anticoagulation and antiplatelet
           agent because of aggravating the symptoms

        3. STUDY DESIGN Multicenter, prospective randomized, comparative open with blinded
           endpoints (PROBE) trial to assess the safety and effectiveness of administration of
           celecoxib for 14 days in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage

    <measure>Change of volume of perihematomal edema as assessed by brain CT</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1st day of admission and repeated at 7th±1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Brain CT scanning for measurement of volumes of ICH and perihematomal edema was performed at 1st day of admission and repeated at 7th±1 day. Considering some possible errors in measurement of edema volume, at follow-up CT scan, the decrease more than 20% from the initial edema volume was coded as &quot;decreased&quot; edema volume; the increase more than 20% was coded as &quot;increased&quot;; the change between -20% and 20% was coded as &quot;unchanged&quot;.</description>

    <description>The secondary endpoints were neurological status at 90 day using E-GOS and mRS. Good outcome was defined as 6 or more in E-GOS score, and 2 or less in mRS score.</description>
