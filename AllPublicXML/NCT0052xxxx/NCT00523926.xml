  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIa, open-label, randomized trial in treatment-naïve, sputum smear-positive,
      subjects with pulmonary TB to assess the extended early bactericidal activity (eEBA) of
      TMC207. The study population will consist of 60 treatment-naive subjects with M. tuberculosis
      infection.

      Subjects will receive orally 25 mg TMC207 po q.d. (Treatment A), 100 mg TMC207 po q.d.
      (Treatment B) or 400 mg TMC207 po q.d. (Treatment C) daily for 7 days. Subjects in treatment
      group D will receive 600 mg rifampin po q.d. daily for 7 days and subjects in treatment group
      E will receive 300 mg isoniazid po q.d. daily for 7 days. After 7 days, subjects in all
      treatment groups will receive appropriate anti-TB therapy according to national standards of
      country TB guidelines and culture and sensitivity results of the sputum specimens until
      clinical and microbiological cures have been achieved. Three once-daily dose regimens of
      TMC207, for 7 days, will be studied versus 2 comparator treatments, rifampin and isoniazid in
      the present trial.TMC207 treatment groups: 25 mg TMC207 po q.d; 100 mg. TMC207 po q.d; 400 mg
      TMC207 po q.d.; TMC207 will be administered as a 10 or 40 mg/mL oral solution. Comparator
      groups: 600 mg rifampin po q.d. administered as capsules containing 300 mg rifampin; 300 mg
      isoniazid po q.d. administered as tablets containing 300 mg isoniazid.
