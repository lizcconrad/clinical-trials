  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intervention to achieve alcohol abstinence represents the most effective treatment for
      alcoholic patients with liver cirrhosis. However no trials have evaluated the efficacy of
      anti-craving drugs in these patients because of the concern that these medications might
      worsen liver disease. Baclofen is effective to reduce alcohol craving improving abstinence in
      alcohol-dependent patients. It is mainly eliminated by kidney. No hepatic side-effects have
      been reported in treated patients. The present study investigates the efficacy and safety of
      baclofen in achieving and maintaining abstinence in alcoholic cirrhotic patients.
