    <textblock>
      Background Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) is a maternally inherited ocular
      disorder associated with a mutation in mtDNA . The common manifestation is visual loss which
      caused by the respiratory chain enzymes complex dysfunction resulting in increased oxidative
      stress enzymes production.

      Purpose To determine whether curcumin which is an antioxidant agent is beneficial to the
      patients with 11778 LHON mutation.

      Material and Method Seventy patients with 11778 LHON mutation were randomly treated with oral
      curcumin (500 mg/day) and placebo for 1 year. The visual acuity, computerized visual field,
      electrophysiologic parameters and oxidative stress enzymes in plasma were compared before and
      after treatment at 3, 6, and 12 months interval.

    <textblock>
      Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a maternally inherited disease that is
      characterized by a simultaneous or more common sequential bilateral loss of central vision,
      which typically occurs during the teenager years or early adulthood. The disease may be
      progressive and the patients eventually become blind. In contrast to blindness in patients
      caused by congenital diseases, the patients who develop blindness caused by LHON will have
      more trouble in their life because they previously had better vision. Although LHON is
      associated with mitochondrial DNA mutation at a variable nucleotide position but no certain
      mechanism of optic nerve injury has been found. It has been postulated that a defect in a
      complex of respiratory chain enzyme which is caused by mitochondrial DNA dysfunction, results
      in an increase of free radical substances that interfere with optic nerve function in LHON.
      Some antioxidant substances have been used to decrease the progression of visual impairment.
      However, there have been few therapeutic trials for LHON.

      Curcumin, a component of tumeric, which comes from the root Curcumin longa has antioxidant,
      anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic activities. There is some evidence which suggests
      that curcumin contributes to the in vitro removal of free radical gradients in thalassemic
      serum and to a clinical improvement of thalassemic patients. We propose a randomized
      controlled trial study of curcumin, which is an antioxidant substance, for LHON. This study
      will provide not only an insight into the therapeutic efficacy of curcumin, a kind of Thai
      herb, for LHON but also the development of future therapeutic strategies to prevent
      blindness.
