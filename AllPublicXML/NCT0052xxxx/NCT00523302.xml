  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, the PI proposes to include 20 African American participants with
      Fibromyalgia to explore the effect of r TMS on pain and depressive symptoms. The focus on
      African Americans is due to the mandate from the funding source (internal), as well as
      possible higher prevalence of FM in AA women. If recruitment is slow, the PI proposes to open
      up the study to other groups. Twenty subjects will be randomized to either sham or active TMS
      condition. Inclusion/exclusion criteria are well thought out and seem appropriate.
      mTreatments will be administered at IOP 5 times/wk with each session lasting 20 minutes. Pain
      intensity and unpleasantness will be measured pre and post each TMS session using three
      different pain evaluation paradigms. GCRC resource is mainly requested for two blood draws
      pre and post first TMS session. The blood samples will be used to measure inflammatory
      cytokines IL-1, IL-6, AND IL-8. The main aim is to ascertain feasibility of the study and
      secondary aim is to gather information on variability in response for power analysis for
      future larger study. The introduction and rationale (including pain evaluation, and methods
      relating to TMS) are clearly presented. Use of GCRC resources seem appropriate.

    <description>TMS stimulates cortical neurons by creating a time varying magnetic field generated by brief but powerful electrical currents. 59 high intensity current is rapidly turned on and off in the electromagnetic coil through the discharge of capacitors. The end result of TMS is thus electrical stimulation of the brain, and some refer to TMS as electrodeless electrical stimulation. Electrical energy stored in a capacitor discharges and creates about 3,000 Amps. Through Maxwell's equations and Faraday's law, this creates a powerful magnetic field, on the order of 2 Tesla. This rapidly changing magnetic field (~30KT/s) then travels across the scalp and skull and induces an electric field within the brain (~30V/m). This induces current to flow in the brain by creating a transmembrane potential (for a thorough discussion see 60). This localized pulsed magnetic field over the surface of the head depolarizes underlying superficial neurons 61, 62 which then induces electrical currents in the brain.</description>

    <description>A specially designed sham TMS coil will be used for all sham conditions. This sham TMS coil produces auditory signals identical to active coils but is shielded so that actual stimulation does not occur. This approach is currently the state-of-the-art approach to sham TMS procedures and is employed in high-quality clinical TMS trials.</description>
