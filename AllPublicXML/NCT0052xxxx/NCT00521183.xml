      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs, such as
      cytochlor and tetrahydrouridine, may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of cytochlor when
      given together with tetrahydrouridine and external-beam radiation therapy in treating
      patients with cancer that has spread to the brain.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Establish the safety and toxicity profile of cytochlor and H4U when given in combination
           with external-beam radiotherapy for 2 weeks after treatment with the drugs alone in the
           previous week.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the effectiveness of H4U to inhibit systemic cytidine deaminase (CD) during
           the course of treatment with cytochlor and H4U.

        -  Perform detailed pharmacokinetic studies to determine the levels of cytochlor and its
           metabolites in serum and in urine in weeks 1, 2, and 3 during treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cytochlor.

      Patients receive cytochlor IV and tetrahydrouridine (H4U) IV over 5 minutes on 3 days in week
      1 and on days 1-5 in weeks 2 and 3. Patients also undergo external-beam radiotherapy 5 days a
      week in weeks 2 and 3 initiated 3-4 hours after infusions of cytochlor and H4U. Treatment may
      repeat in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 3
      months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then yearly
      thereafter.

    <description>The study's starting dose of CldC is 50 mg/m2/day. The dose of CldC will be escalated / de-escalated for patients. Patients will receive CldC+H4U on 3 days (Wed, Thr, Fri) in week 1, which precedes the initiation of radiation therapy. Patients will receive H4U and CldC IV by bolus infusion. Treatment with CldC+H4U will then continue for 5 days (Mon-Fri) during each of weeks 2 and 3, and will be accompanied by radiation therapy at 3 Gy/fraction initiated 3-4 h after bolus infusion of CldC+H4U. Treatment with CldC+H4U and radiation will then stop at the end of week 3.</description>

    <description>A fixed dose of H4U at 720 mg/m2/day will be used, regardless of the dose of CldC administered. H4U will be delivered by an IV bolus infusion over a period of 5 minutes, followed 5 minutes later by an IV bolus infusion of CldC. Patients will receive CldC+H4U on 3 days (Wed, Thr, Fri) in week 1, which precedes the initiation of radiation therapy. Patients will receive H4U and CldC IV by bolus infusion. Treatment with CldC+H4U will then continue for 5 days (Mon-Fri) during each of weeks 2 and 3, and will be accompanied by radiation therapy at 3 Gy/fraction initiated 3-4 h after bolus infusion of CldC+H4U.
