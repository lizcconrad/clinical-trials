             Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total score, extracted from the Positive and Negative
             Syndrome Scale (PANSS), of at least 45 (18-item version, in which 1 indicates &quot;absent&quot;
             and 7 indicates &quot;severe&quot;). In addition, item scores of at least 4 (moderate) will be
             required on 2 of the following BPRS items: conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness,

          -  Patients must receive a rating of 4 (moderately ill) or greater on the Clinical Global

          -  Patients in whom, in the opinion of the investigator, a switch to another
             antipsychotic medication or initiation of an antipsychotic medication is acutely

             olanzapine, in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Patients who have received treatment with olanzapine within 6 weeks prior to Visit 1.

          -  Patients who have received treatment with clozapine at doses greater than 200 mg daily
             within 12 months prior to Visit 1, or who have received any clozapine at all during

          -  Patients who have a history of an inadequate response, in the opinion of the
             investigator, to 2 or more adequate antipsychotic medication trials of at least 8
             weeks duration in the past 12 months prior to Visit 1.

          -  Patients with acute, serious, or unstable medical conditions, including (but not
             limited to) inadequately controlled diabetes (hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 8%), severe
