The evaluation was based on the participant's use of concomitant medications, as well as the number and severity of COPD exacerbations and related emergency room visits and/or hospitalizations since the last visit. The frequency and severity of symptoms ( cough, dyspnea, wheezing) and the impact of these on the participant's ability to exercise were considered.

        predicted normal (visit 1). Subjects must be current or ex-smokers with a smoking history
        of &gt;=10 pack years.

        Subjects must have a Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnea score &gt;= 2.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Subjects who have been treated with maintenance medications for chronic respiratory disease
        within six months prior to screening.

        Subjects with significant diseases other than COPD. Subjects on chronic systemic
        corticosteroids.

        Subjects with any upper and/or lower respiratory tract infection or COPD exacerbation in
        the 6 weeks prior to the initial visit 1 or during the screening period prior to visit 3
        Subjects with a recent (past 6 months) myocardial infarction, any unstable or life
        threatening cardiac arrhythmia requiring intervention or change in drug therapy during the
        last year; or who have been hospitalized for cardiac failure during the past year.

        <description>The physician's global assessment reflected the physician's opinion of the participant's overall clinical condition with respect to COPD. The evaluation was based on the participant's use of concomitant medications, as well as the number and severity of COPD exacerbations and related emergency room visits and/or hospitalizations since the last visit. The frequency and severity of symptoms ( cough, dyspnea, wheezing) and the impact of these on the participant's ability to exercise were considered.

        <description>The physician's global assessment reflected the physician's opinion of the participant's overall clinical condition with respect to COPD. The evaluation was based on the participant's use of concomitant medications, as well as the number and severity of COPD exacerbations and related emergency room visits and/or hospitalizations since the last visit. The frequency and severity of symptoms ( cough, dyspnea, wheezing) and the impact of these on the participant's ability to exercise were considered.

        <description>WPAI: self-administered instrument used to measure effect of general health and symptom severity on work productivity and regular activities and yields 4 types of scores: Absenteeism (work time missed); Presenteeism (impairment at work/reduced on-the-job effectiveness); Work Productivity Loss (overall work impairment/absenteeism plus presenteeism); and Activity Impairment.
Absenteeism, Presenteeism, Work productivity loss, Activity Impairment Scores range from 0 to 100 for each of the above 4 types; higher scores indicate greater impairment.</description>

        <description>WPAI: self-administered instrument used to measure effect of general health and symptom severity on work productivity and regular activities and yields 4 types of scores: Absenteeism (work time missed); Presenteeism (impairment at work/reduced on-the-job effectiveness); Work Productivity Loss (overall work impairment/absenteeism plus presenteeism); and Activity Impairment. Scores range from 0 to 100 for each of the above 4 types; higher scores indicate greater impairment. Difference refers to change in scale between week 8 and baseline.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity as Assessed by the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) Questionnaire: Impairment While Working Due to Health (Week 24)</title>
          <description>WPAI: self-administered instrument used to measure effect of general health and symptom severity on work productivity and regular activities and yields 4 types of scores: Absenteeism (work time missed); Presenteeism (impairment at work/reduced on-the-job effectiveness); Work Productivity Loss (overall work impairment/absenteeism plus presenteeism); and Activity Impairment. Scores range from 0 to 100 for each of the above 4 types; higher scores indicate greater impairment. Difference refers to change in scale between week 24 and baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity as Assessed by the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) Questionnaire: Overall Work Impairment Due to Health (Week 16)</title>
        <description>WPAI: self-administered instrument used to measure effect of general health and symptom severity on work productivity and regular activities and yields 4 types of scores: Absenteeism (work time missed); Presenteeism (impairment at work/reduced on-the-job effectiveness); Work Productivity Loss (overall work impairment/absenteeism plus presenteeism); and Activity Impairment. Scores range from 0 to 100 for each of the above 4 types; higher scores indicate greater impairment. Difference refers to change in scale between week 16 and baseline.</description>

        <description>WPAI: self-administered instrument used to measure effect of general health and symptom severity on work productivity and regular activities and yields 4 types of scores: Absenteeism (work time missed); Presenteeism (impairment at work/reduced on-the-job effectiveness); Work Productivity Loss (overall work impairment/absenteeism plus presenteeism); and Activity Impairment. Scores range from 0 to 100 for each of the above 4 types; higher scores indicate greater impairment. Difference refers to change in scale between week 8 and baseline.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity as Assessed by the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) Questionnaire: Work Time Missed Due to Health (Week 24)</title>
          <description>WPAI: self-administered instrument used to measure effect of general health and symptom severity on work productivity and regular activities and yields 4 types of scores: Absenteeism (work time missed); Presenteeism (impairment at work/reduced on-the-job effectiveness); Work Productivity Loss (overall work impairment/absenteeism plus presenteeism); and Activity Impairment. Scores range from 0 to 100 for each of the above 4 types; higher scores indicate greater impairment. Difference refers to change in scale between week 24 and baseline.</description>

          <description>Moderate or higher intensity is greater than or equal to three metabolic equivalents
Metabolic equivalent threshold (MET): Unit used to estimate the metabolic cost of physical activity, in terms of multiples of the subject’s resting metabolic rate. One metabolic equivalent is, by convention, 3.5 ml of O2 uptake per minute per kilogram body weight, and theoretically approximates the resting metabolic rate.
ln in measure value unit means natural logarithm</description>
