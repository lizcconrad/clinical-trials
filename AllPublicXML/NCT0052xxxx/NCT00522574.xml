  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of XL019 in adults with
      myelofibrosis. XL019 is a selective inhibitor of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase JAK2. JAK2
      is activated by cytokine and growth factor receptors and phosphorylates members of the STAT
      family of inducible transcription factors. Activation of the JAK/STAT pathway promotes cell
      growth and survival, and is a common feature of human tumors. JAK2 is activated by mutation
      in the majority of patients with myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera and essential
      thrombocytosis and appears to drive the inappropriate growth of blood cells in these
      conditions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post-polycythemia vera MF, or
             post-essential thrombocythemia MF and requires therapy, including subjects who have
             received prior MF-directed therapy and relapsed or subjects with refractory disease;
             or if newly diagnosed, then with intermediate or high risk according to the Lille
             scoring system.

          -  The subject is unwilling to undergo or is not a candidate for peripheral stem
             cell/bone marrow transplant.

          -  The subject is ≥18 years old.

          -  The subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤2.

          -  The subject has adequate organ function.

          -  The subject has the capability of understanding the informed consent document and has
             signed the informed consent document.

          -  Sexually active subjects (male and female) must use medically acceptable methods of
             contraception during the course of the study.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at
             screening.

          -  The subject has had no diagnosis of malignancy or evidence of other malignancy for 2
             years prior to screening for this study (except non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ
             carcinoma of the cervix).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             ongoing or active infection, hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within 3 months, or cardiac
             arrhythmias.

          -  The subject is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  The subject is known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          -  The subject is unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully
             with the investigator or designee.
