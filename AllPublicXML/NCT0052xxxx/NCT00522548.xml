  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myfortic (enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium) has been shown to have similar effectiveness
      to CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil) in preventing rejection in kidney transplant recipients.
      However, enteric coated mycophenolate sodium has been thought to possibly be associated with
      fewer gastrointestinal side effects. Mycophenolate mofetil and enteric coated mycophenolate
      sodium pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed and broken down) have not been well-studied
      in African American kidney transplant recipients. The investigators are interested in
      studying enteric coated mycophenolate sodium and mycophenolate mofetil pharmacokinetics and
      gastrointestinal side effects in African American kidney transplant recipients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      African American patients often experience more gastrointestinal (GI) complications after
      kidney transplant than Caucasian patients. In addition, African American kidney transplant
      recipients also experience a higher incidence of acute rejection and have worse outcomes
      compared with all other ethnic groups. Reasons accounting for these differences are not well
      understood.

      In light of the increased risk of GI complications in African American patients, we will
      compare in a pilot study, different regimens (described below) that we commonly use in our
      clinical practice in this population. As part of this study, patients will also fill out a
      GSRS survey at specified time points to help describe gastrointestinal side effects after
      transplant.

      Pharmacokinetic studies (studies looking at how the drugs are absorbed and broken down) for
      mycophenolate mofetil or enteric coated mycophenolate sodium have largely been performed in
      Caucasian populations. There is little information available in African-American patients.
      This is particularly concerning in the face of the worst clinical outcomes observed after
      transplantation in African American kidney transplant recipients.

      Comparisons: Patients will be randomized to one of two groups

        -  Group 1: Myfortic (enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium) in combination with Prograf
           (tacrolimus) or its generic equivalent and corticosteroids

        -  Group 2: CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil) or its generic equivalent manufactured by
           Sandoz in combination with Prograf (tacrolimus) or its generic equivalent and
           corticosteroids

      Since toxicity of mycophenolate mofetil and enteric coated mycophenolate sodium may be
      influenced by pharmacokinetics (studies that look at how the drugs are absorbed and broken
      down) of these respective drugs, we will compare the pharmacokinetics of enteric coated
      mycophenolate sodium and mycophenolate mofetil in a subset of patients. This pharmacokinetic
      data may have the additional valuable benefit of helping to optimize dosing parameters for
      mycophenolate mofetil and enteric coated mycophenolate sodium in African American kidney
      transplant patients in the future.

    <measure>The Incidence of the Requirement of Full Dose Proton Pump Inhibitors in Patients on Enteric Coated Mycophenolate Sodium or Mycophenolate Mofetil or Its Generic Equivalent Manufactured by Sandoz</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>If patients were not on any medications from a medication class known as H-2 antagonists, they were started on ranitidine 150 mg orally twice daily after transplant (with dose adjusted for renal function). Patients were excluded if they were on proton pump inhibitor at time of study screening, however some patients required addition of proton pump inhibitor post-study enrollment. If a patient had upper gastrointestinal side effects such as acid reflux unreleived on ranitidine therapy or nausea, they were switched to a proton pump inhibitor.</description>

    <measure>Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) Score Changes From Baseline to 24 Weeks After Transplant in Patients on Enteric Coated Mycophenolate Sodium or Mycophenolate Mofetil or Its Generic Equivalent Manufactured by Sandoz</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (pre-transplant to two days after transplant) and at 6 months after transplant.</time_frame>
    <description>The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) is a 15-item self-administered questionnaire to assess symptoms associated with common gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, and has been validated in renal transplant recipients. It uses a seven-graded Likert scale, where 1 represents the most positive option and 7 the most negative one and the patient grades symptoms based on the past 7 days. A score of ≥ 2 indicates the presence of GI symptoms. Higher values indicate more unfavorable conditions. The questionairre is divided into 5 sub-scales: diarrhea, indigestion, constipation, abdominal pain, and reflux and a mean score is calculated for each dimension. The lowest mean score possible for each dimension is 1 and the highest is 7. Patients completed a GSRS survey at baseline (pre-transplant to two days after transplant), and at weeks 1,4,12 and 24 after transplant.</description>

        <title>The Incidence of the Requirement of Full Dose Proton Pump Inhibitors in Patients on Enteric Coated Mycophenolate Sodium or Mycophenolate Mofetil or Its Generic Equivalent Manufactured by Sandoz</title>
        <description>If patients were not on any medications from a medication class known as H-2 antagonists, they were started on ranitidine 150 mg orally twice daily after transplant (with dose adjusted for renal function). Patients were excluded if they were on proton pump inhibitor at time of study screening, however some patients required addition of proton pump inhibitor post-study enrollment. If a patient had upper gastrointestinal side effects such as acid reflux unreleived on ranitidine therapy or nausea, they were switched to a proton pump inhibitor.</description>

        <title>Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) Score Changes From Baseline to 24 Weeks After Transplant in Patients on Enteric Coated Mycophenolate Sodium or Mycophenolate Mofetil or Its Generic Equivalent Manufactured by Sandoz</title>
        <description>The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) is a 15-item self-administered questionnaire to assess symptoms associated with common gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, and has been validated in renal transplant recipients. It uses a seven-graded Likert scale, where 1 represents the most positive option and 7 the most negative one and the patient grades symptoms based on the past 7 days. A score of ≥ 2 indicates the presence of GI symptoms. Higher values indicate more unfavorable conditions. The questionairre is divided into 5 sub-scales: diarrhea, indigestion, constipation, abdominal pain, and reflux and a mean score is calculated for each dimension. The lowest mean score possible for each dimension is 1 and the highest is 7. Patients completed a GSRS survey at baseline (pre-transplant to two days after transplant), and at weeks 1,4,12 and 24 after transplant.</description>

        <title>Pharmacokinetics (Mycophenolic Acid Area Under the Curve) of Enteric Coated Mycophenolate Sodium or Mycophenolate Mofetil or Its Generic Equivalent Manufactured by Sandoz in a Sub-set of Patients</title>
        <description>Pharmacokinetics is the study of how a drug is absorbed and broken down in the body. Pharmacokinetics of Enteric-Coated Mycophenolate Sodium or Mycophenolate Mofetil are measured by a level called mycophenolic acid level. Mycophenolic acid levels in this pharmacokinetic study were drawn starting in the morning at time zero (immediately prior to morning dose, also known as trough), then at 0.5, 1,1.5, 2, 2.5, 3,3.5,4,6, 8 and 12 hours post dose. Data was also dose-normalized (concentration was divided by dose). A mycophenolic acid area under the curve value, also known as AUC represents drug exposure.</description>
