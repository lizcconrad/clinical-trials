    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of PRLX 93936 and see what kind of effect it
      has on patients and their cancer. This study will also determine the highest dose of PRLX
      93936 that can be given without causing adverse side effects and the dose of PRLX 93936 that
      should be used in future studies.

      This study will assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of PRLX 93936
      administered intravenously over 1 hr daily for 5 days in patients with advanced solid tumors.
      Patients will be evaluated prior to dosing, during dosing and following dosing, on a 28-day
      cycle. Tumor response will be evaluated every other cycle.

      Three patients will be assigned per dose level until the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is
      reached or a a Dose-Limited Toxicity (DLT) is encountered. Sequential cohorts of three
      patients will be treated with escalating doses until the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is
      reached.
