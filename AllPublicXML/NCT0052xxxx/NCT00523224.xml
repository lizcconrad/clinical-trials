      Study title: A Study of Combined Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) and Blood-Borne
      Autologous Angiogenic Cell Precursors Therapy in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure due
      to Ischemic Heart Disease (ACPs-CHF) Principle Investigator: Kit V. Arom ,M.D.,Ph.D. Deputy
      Director, Chief Cardio-Thoracic Surgeon, Bangkok Heart Hospital Study objective : To
      determine the safety and efficacy of injection of blood-borne autologous ACPs into the
      non-graftable area of the heart of patients with congestive heart failure due to ischemic
      heart disease Its main goal is evaluation of feasibility and safety of the combined
      technique. The efficacy of the treatment will be tested in the following trial.

      Study Design : Phase I , a single center, a non-randomized, open-label trial to test the
      safety, of intramyocardium transepicardium administration of ex vivo expanded autologous ACPs
      administered in combination with CABG operation in patients with congestive heart failure due
      to ischemic heart disease.

      The study is a preliminary training study, under the supervision of the experienced Dr. Patel
      the U.S. principal investigator.

      Study population :

      Total expected no. of patients : 5 main selection criteria :

        1. Patients with or without signs of congestive heart failure due to ischemic heart disease
           who had maximal medical treatments. Not suitable to percutaneous intervention

        2. All patients must have a recent coronary angiogram. Patients must be able to have OPCAB
           and then have Angiogenic Cell Precursors(ACPs) in non-graftable and/or infraction
           regions

        3. Age 18 to 80 years

        4. MRI demonstrating areas of viable and non-viable myocardium Investigational Product :
           The patients will be blood drawn 250 ml at D-8 for producting autologous ACPs
           (VescellTM), On D0 ,at least 1.5 million ACPs with viability &gt;75 % supended in 15 ml
           sterile cell culture medium will be injected 1 cm apart using a 23 gauge angled needle
           in 30 spots (0.5 ml /point) to the same patients by direct intramuscular approach at LV
           during CABG.

      The study consists of 4 periods: Screening ( D-14 to-9&amp; D-8,Treatment(D0),Acute Safety
      follow-up (D1-2&amp; D5-discharge),Chronic follow-up (D30 &amp; D90)period ,total follow-up of each
      case is 3 months.

      Evaluation criteria :

      Safety : no.&amp; duration of adverse event &amp; serious adverse event Efficacy :NYHA, 6-minute
      walking test ,% LVEF by Echocardiography &amp; C-MRI, % infracted scar area on C-MRI , Pro-BNP &amp;
      3 months of QoL(SF-36)

      Five CAD patients who required CABG with or without congestive heart failure will undergo
      screening and receiving of ACPs 's injection by direct intramuscular during CABG operation.
      After that,the patients will come to follow up with investigator at 1 and 3 months post
      surgery in order to evaluate safety and efficacy of stem cells therapy(ACPs).
