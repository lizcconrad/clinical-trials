  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that the allergic airway inflammation in
      asthmatic patients will be enhanced after exposure to ultrafine particles (UFP). In order to
      test this in a controlled study, the researchers combine controlled exposure to carbon black
      model UFP with the well-established model of a segmental allergen challenge, which allows the
      researchers to safely induce circumscript allergic inflammation in the lung in mild
      asthmatics. The effect of the UFP on allergic inflammation will be controlled by an
      inhalation of clean air in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design.

                  pregnant, including any female who is pre-menarchial or post-menopausal, with
                  documented proof of hysterectomy or tubal ligation, or meets clinical criteria
                  for menopause and has been amenorrheal for more than 1 year prior to the
                  screening visit).

               -  Of child-bearing capacity and using a highly effective method of contraception
                  during the entire study (vasectomised partner, sexual abstinence [the lifestyle
                  of the female should be such that there is complete abstinence from intercourse
                  two weeks prior to the first dose of study medication until at least 72 hours
                  after treatment], implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, hormonal
                  intrauterine devices [IUDs]).

          -  Non-smokers, or ex-smokers

          -  Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) &gt; 80% of the predicted value

          -  Positive skin prick test for grass mix at or within 12 months prior to the screening
             visit

          -  Able and willing to give written informed consent to take part in the study

          -  Available to complete all study measurements

          -  Able to restrain from particle rich atmosphere (e.g. passive cigarette smoke) within 1
             week before exposure to UFP or clean air

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Infections of the respiratory tract within the last month

          -  Past or present disease which, as judged by the investigator, may affect the outcome
             of this study. These diseases include, but are not limited to, cardiovascular disease,
             malignancy, hepatic disease, renal disease, hematological disease, neurological
             disease, endocrine disease or pulmonary disease (including but not confined to chronic
             bronchitis, emphysema, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis).

          -  Pathological findings in safety laboratory tests

             inflammatory process

          -  Suspected hypersensitivity to any ingredients of the medication involved with
             bronchoscopy (bronchodilators, sedatives and local anaesthetics)

             restrictions; e.g., language problems, uncooperative attitude, inability to return for
             follow-up visits, and improbability of completing the study
