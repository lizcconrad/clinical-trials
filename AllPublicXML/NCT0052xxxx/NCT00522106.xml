  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We performed a randomized controlled trial to study the effectiveness of Behavioral graded
      activity (BGA) in patients with OA of the hip or knee. It was hypothesised that in the long
      term BGA results in less pain, less limitations in activities, and better patient global
      assessment (i.e. the effect of treatment perceived by patients themselves), compared to usual
      care of physiotherapists (UC). UC was operationalized as physiotherapeutic care according to
      the Dutch physiotherapy guideline for patients with hip and/or knee OA. It was also
      investigated whether specific subgroups of patients benefited more from BGA and which factors
      influenced the success of BGA-treatment. Also, it will be investigated whether differences
      exist in exercise adherence and whether there is a relationship between exercise adherence
      and long-term effectiveness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The principle objectives of managing OA are to control pain adequately, improve function and
      reduce disability. There is strong evidence that exercise therapy has a short term benefit
      for OA. However, these beneficial effects decrease over time and finally disappear. This
      decline is thought to be related to the difficulties people have in maintaining adherence to
      prescribed exercises. Therefore, to enhance long term benefit, adherence to exercise therapy
      is of utmost importance. Recently, the focus of attention within physiotherapy has shifted
      towards behaviorally oriented treatment, like Behavioral Graded Activity (BGA), which focuses
      less on pain and includes psychological and social factors in the treatment-process. Such
      intervention seems appropriate to increase the level of activities of patients with OA in a
      time-contingent way and to increase patients' adherence to these activities.

      However, at the start of the present study the scientific evidence for the effectiveness of
      BGA in patients with a progressive and specific chronic disease, like OA of the hip and knee,
      was not available. Therefore, we performed a randomized controlled trial to study the
      effectiveness of BGA in patients with OA of the hip or knee. It was hypothesised that in the
      long term BGA results in less pain, less limitations in activities, and better patient global
      assessment (i.e. the effect of treatment perceived by patients themselves), compared to usual
      care of physiotherapists (UC). UC was operationalized as physiotherapeutic care according to
      the Dutch physiotherapy guideline for patients with hip and/or knee OA. It was also
      investigated whether specific subgroups of patients benefited more from BGA and which factors
      influenced the success of BGA-treatment. Also, it will be investigated whether differences
      exist in exercise adherence and whether there is a relationship between exercise adherence
      and long-term effectiveness.

    <description>The intervention is directed at increasing the level of activities in a time-contingent way, with the goal to integrate these activities in the daily living of the patients. The intervention is performed by physical therapists in primary care, on individual basis. Treatment period of maximal 12 weeks (with maximal 18 sessions), followed by 5 pre-set boostermoments with a maximum of 7 sessions (respectively in week 18, 25, 34, 42, and 55).</description>

    <description>Treatment according to the Dutch physiotherapy guideline for patients with osteoarthritis of hip and/or knee. This guideline consists of general recommendations, emphasizing provision of information and advice, exercise therapy, and encouragement of a positive coping with the complaints. The treatment consisted of a maximum of 18 sessions within a period of 12 weeks. The treatment could be discontinued within the 12 week period if, according to the physiotherapists, all treatment goals were achieved.</description>

          -  contraindication for exercise therapy;

          -  inability to understand the Dutch language;

             function. A high level of physical function was operationalized on a score of less
             than two on the sections walking ability and physical function of the Algofunctional
