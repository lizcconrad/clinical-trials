  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is clear preclinical in vitro and in vivo evidence of sequence dependent synergy
      between chemotherapy agents and zoledronic acid. The aim of the study is to investigate if
      the synergistic increase in tumour cell apoptosis observed in preclinical studies occurs in
      patients. The hypothesis for this study is that there may be anti-tumour benefits of the
      sequential application of chemotherapy agents followed by zoledronic acid in patients with
      invasive breast cancer.
