  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physiological changes can occur from different types of stress as induced by an infection, an
      environmental toxicant exposure, or an emotional disturbance. The stress-induced effects can
      modify health by lessening defense mechanisms as maintained by the immune system. The ability
      of different forms of stress to alter physiological processes (body functions) will be
      assessed by monitoring the blood profile of cell numbers and functions as well as the plasma
      protein content. It is anticipated that the pattern of blood changes will reflect the types
      of stress and the degree to which body functions could be altered by the stress.

      Blood will be collected from patients with an ongoing infection that has lead to sepsis
      (systemic inflammation) as a index of major stress. The blood will be analyzed for the types
      of proteins that could alter immune system functions and affect organ functions, including
      cardiovascular effects due to blood vessel changes. This will be followed by analysis of
      stress effects on mice and mice that have been generated with human immune cells. The ability
      of stress to alter blood patterns will also be examined in mice with genetic modification of
      metallothionein expression, which is believe to influence oxidative stress.
