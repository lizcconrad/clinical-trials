  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical research study is to determine whether dapagliflozin can improve
      (decrease) blood glucose values in patients with Type 2 diabetes who have never been treated
      with medication or have been taking medication for less than 24 weeks since their original
      diabetes diagnosis. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.

      All eligible participants will receive single-blind placebo medication during the 2-week
      lead-in period. All participants may receive additional open-label treatment with metformin,
      500-2000 mg, as needed for rescue, based on protocol specific criteria.

    <measure>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) (Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF]): Group 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24 (end of Short-term Period)</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c was measured by a central laboratory. Data after rescue medication was excluded from this analysis. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. In cases where time of the first dose or time of the assessment was not available, baseline was defined as the last assessment on or prior to the date of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. If no Week 24 assessment was available, the last postbaseline measurement prior to Week 24 was used. For rescued participants, measurements obtained after initiation of rescue medication were not considered in calculating the primary endpoint. Evening dosing groups were summarized as exploratory endpoints.</description>

    <description>Secondary endpoints were tested using a sequential testing procedure and are presented in hierarchical order. Because the primary focus of the entire dapagliflozin program was on morning dosing in a population with HbA1c ≥7% and ≤10%, only data on AM dosing were summarized in secondary efficacy analyses. Data after rescue medication were excluded from this analysis. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. In cases where time of the first dose or time of the assessment was not available, baseline was defined as the last assessment on or prior to the date of the first dose of the double-blind study medication.

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) (Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF]): Group 1</title>
        <description>HbA1c was measured by a central laboratory. Data after rescue medication was excluded from this analysis. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. In cases where time of the first dose or time of the assessment was not available, baseline was defined as the last assessment on or prior to the date of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. If no Week 24 assessment was available, the last postbaseline measurement prior to Week 24 was used. For rescued participants, measurements obtained after initiation of rescue medication were not considered in calculating the primary endpoint. Evening dosing groups were summarized as exploratory endpoints.</description>

          <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) (Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF]): Group 1</title>
          <description>HbA1c was measured by a central laboratory. Data after rescue medication was excluded from this analysis. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. In cases where time of the first dose or time of the assessment was not available, baseline was defined as the last assessment on or prior to the date of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. If no Week 24 assessment was available, the last postbaseline measurement prior to Week 24 was used. For rescued participants, measurements obtained after initiation of rescue medication were not considered in calculating the primary endpoint. Evening dosing groups were summarized as exploratory endpoints.</description>

        <description>Secondary endpoints were tested using a sequential testing procedure and are presented in hierarchical order. Because the primary focus of the entire dapagliflozin program was on morning dosing in a population with HbA1c ≥7% and ≤10%, only data on AM dosing were summarized in secondary efficacy analyses. Data after rescue medication were excluded from this analysis. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. In cases where time of the first dose or time of the assessment was not available, baseline was defined as the last assessment on or prior to the date of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. If no Week 24 assessment was available, glucose levels were recorded from the last postbaseline measurement prior to Week 24. For rescued participants, measurements obtained after initiation of rescue medication was not considered in calculating the endpoint.</description>

        <description>Group 2 was an exploratory group, included to obtain initial efficacy and safety data. No comparator arm was included. Secondary endpoints were tested using a sequential testing procedure and are presented in hierarchical order. Data after rescue medication were excluded from this analysis. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. In cases where time of the first dose or time of the assessment was not available, baseline was defined as the last assessment on or prior to the date of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. If no Week 24 assessment was available, glucose levels were recorded from the last postbaseline measurement prior to Week 24. For rescued participants, measurements obtained after initiation of rescue medication was not considered in calculating the endpoint.</description>

          <title>Adjusted Mean Change in Total Body Weight at Week 24 (Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF]): Group 2</title>
          <description>Secondary endpoints were tested using a sequential testing procedure and are presented in hierarchical order. Adjusted mean change from baseline in total body weight at Week 24 (or the last postbaseline measurement prior to Week 24 if no Week 24 assessment was available was determined). Data after rescue medication was excluded from this analysis. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. In cases where time of the first dose or time of the assessment was not available, baseline was defined as the last assessment on or prior to the date of the first dose of the double-blind study medication.Group 2 (patients with enrollment baseline HbA1c &gt;10% and ≤2%) was considered an exploratory group, included to obtain initial efficacy and safety data for these patients. No comparator arm was included.</description>

        <description>Secondary endpoints were tested using a sequential testing procedure and are presented in hierarchical order. Therapeutic glycemic response is defined as HbA1c &lt;7.0%. Data after rescue medication was excluded from this analysis. If no Week 24 assessment was available, HbA1c was recorded from the last postbaseline measurement prior to Week 24. Group 2 (patients with enrollment baseline HbA1c &gt;10% and ≤2%) was considered an exploratory group, included to obtain initial efficacy and safety data for these patients. No comparator arm was included. Thus, only key safety and efficacy analyses were performed for Group 2.</description>

          <description>Secondary endpoints were tested using a sequential testing procedure and are presented in hierarchical order. Therapeutic glycemic response is defined as HbA1c &lt;7.0%. Data after rescue medication was excluded from this analysis. If no Week 24 assessment was available, HbA1c was recorded from the last postbaseline measurement prior to Week 24. Group 2 (patients with enrollment baseline HbA1c &gt;10% and ≤2%) was considered an exploratory group, included to obtain initial efficacy and safety data for these patients. No comparator arm was included. Thus, only key safety and efficacy analyses were performed for Group 2.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in Patients With Baseline HbA1c ≥9.0% (Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF])</title>
        <description>Secondary endpoints were tested using a sequential testing procedure and are presented in hierarchical order. If no Week 24 assessment was available, HbA1c was recorded from the last postbaseline measurement prior to Week 24. HbA1c was measured as % of hemoglobin by a central laboratory. The population included randomized patients who received treatment and had baseline HbA1c &gt;9.0%. Data after rescue medication were excluded from this analysis. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of double-blind study drug. In cases where time of the first dose or assessment was not available, baseline was defined as the last assessment on or prior to the date of the first dose of the double-blind study drug. Group 2 (patients with enrollment baseline HbA1c &gt;10% and ≤2%) was considered exploratory, included to obtain initial data. No comparator arm was included. Thus, only key safety and efficacy analyses were performed in Group 2.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in Participants With Baseline Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥27 kg/m^2 (Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF])</title>
        <description>Secondary endpoints were tested using a sequential testing procedure and are presented in hierarchical order. If no Week 24 assessment was available, HbA1c was recorded from the last postbaseline measurement prior to Week 24. Data after rescue medication was excluded from this analysis. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. In cases where time of the first dose or time of the assessment was not available, baseline was defined as the last assessment on or prior to the date of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. Group 2 (patients with enrollment baseline HbA1c &gt;10% and ≤2%) was considered an exploratory group, included to obtain initial efficacy and safety data for these patients. No comparator arm was included. Thus, only key safety and efficacy analyses were performed for Group 2.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Total Body Weight in Patients With Baseline Body Mass Index ≥27 kg/m^2 (Last Observation Carried Forward)</title>
        <description>Secondary endpoints were tested using sequential testing procedure and are presented in hierarchical order. Adjusted mean change from baseline in total body weight at Week 24 (or the last postbaseline measurement prior to Week 24 if no Week 24 assessment was available) was determined. Data after rescue medication was excluded from this analysis. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. In cases where time of the first dose or time of the assessment was not available, baseline was defined as the last assessment on or prior to the date of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. Group 2 (patients with enrollment baseline HbA1c &gt;10% and ≤2%) was considered an exploratory group, included to obtain initial efficacy and safety data for these patients. No comparator arm was included. Thus, only key safety and efficacy analyses were performed for Group 2.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF]): Group 2</title>
        <description>HbA1c was measured by a central laboratory. Data after rescue medication was excluded from this analysis. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. In cases where time of the first dose or time of the assessment was not available, baseline was defined as the last assessment on or prior to the date of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. If no Week 24 assessment was available, the last postbaseline measurement prior to Week 24 was used. For rescued participants, measurements obtained after initiation of rescue medication were not considered in calculating the primary endpoint. Group 2 (patients with enrollment baseline HbA1c &gt;10% and ≤2%) was considered an exploratory group, included to obtain initial efficacy and safety data for these patients. No comparator arm was included.</description>
