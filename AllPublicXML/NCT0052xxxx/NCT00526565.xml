    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial evaluates the efficacy of TAT(Tapas Acupressure Technique)
      compared to a Social Support (SS) group for the primary outcome of weight loss maintenance.
      We recruit obese adults from the Kaiser Permanente Northwest managed care setting. Those who
      meet eligibility criteria are entered into an intensive six-month weekly group-based
      behavioral weight loss program. Those who meet threshold weight loss criteria (n=~288) are
      randomly assigned to either TAT instruction or social support group. Participants in both
      groups attend the same schedule of group meetings with parallel contact hours. Participants
      in the TAT group are advised to practice the technique at home. Participants are weighed and
      questionnaires administered at entry, randomization, and at 12 and 18 months post entry. The
      main outcome measure is weight at 18 months.

    <description>Practice of the TAT technique involves application of pressure to select acupoints combined with specific mental focus. The TAT pose involves lightly touching the tips of the left thumb and 4th finger to the area 1/8 inch above the inner corner of each eye and the 3rd finger to the point midway between the eyes, about Â½ inch above eyebrow level. The right hand is on the back of the head, with the palm cradling the occiput and the thumb just above the hairline. Once in this position, the process is to 1) focus attention on the identified problem or behavior to be changed (e.g., over-eating); 2) focus on a positive thought related to the problem; 3) focus on the thought of healing or clearing the origins of the problem; and 4) focus on an awareness of healing or clearing any storage of the problem, at a cellular, mental, emotional, or energetic level.</description>

    <description>The LIFE SS maintenance intervention will consist of a series of professionally facilitated social support groups where the session content is directed by the participants. The contact hours for SS will match those of the TAT intervention. The initial SS group session will orient participants to the basics of weight maintenance, and subsequent sessions will provide opportunities for participants to share experiences and ask questions. Participants may choose to use behavioral tools as desired. In addition to the basic materials about weight loss maintenance used in both maintenance interventions, will we use the materials already used in the weight loss program for the SS group as needed. We will measure adherence by taking attendance at the SS group sessions.</description>
