    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of your participation in this study is to help answer the following
      research questions, and not to provide you treatment for your condition.

        -  To assess how well treatment with pemetrexed works for patients with your type of cancer

        -  To assess for any side effects that might be associated with pemetrexed.

        -  To look at the characteristics and levels of certain of your genes and proteins to learn
           more about osteosarcoma and how pemetrexed works in your body.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Tumor Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 21 months</time_frame>
    <description>Response using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria: Complete Response (CR) = disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) = at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) = at least a 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD) = small changes that do not meet above criteria. Tumor Response Rate(%) = sum of number of PR + CR observed/number of participants qualified for tumor response analysis * 100.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Treatment Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 21 months</time_frame>
    <description>When the protocol was written, time to treatment failure (TTTF) was included as a secondary endpoint. However, it was subsequently realized that due to the design of the study, participants are treated until disease progression or discontinuation from study treatment, not for a fixed number of cycles. Therefore, it was concluded that analysis of TTTF was inappropriate with the current study design and the analysis was not conducted, since it would be essentially the same as Progression-Free Survival.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation of Disease Outcome With Pharmacogenomic Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 21 months</time_frame>
    <description>It was planned to examine methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) gene deletion, folate receptor alpha (FRα) and folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase (FPGS) expression, and to correlate the results with the clinical data to determine the association between these factors and clinical outcome to treatment. However, due to the small number of participants with partial response (n=1), the planned statistical analyses that would correlate responders/non responders with pharmacogenomics data are no longer valid and the analyses were not conducted.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (Pharmacology Toxicity)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 21 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pharmacology toxicity was defined as serious and non-serious adverse events. Summaries of these adverse events are located in the Reported Adverse Event Section.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 31 months</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) was defined as the time from the first objective status assessment of CR or PR to the first date of progression or death as a result of any cause: CR was achieved if all tumor lesions disappeared; PR was achieved if there was &gt;=30% decrease in sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions (reference: baseline sum LDs) or complete disappearance of target lesions with persistence (but not worsening) of &gt;=1 nontarget lesions and no appearance of new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 10.4 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was from date of study enrollment to first date of objectively determined progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause. For participants who did not die as of data cut-off date and who did not have objective PD, PFS was censored at date of last objective progression-free disease assessment. For participants who received subsequent systemic anticancer therapy (after discontinuation from study drug) before objectively determined disease progression or death, PFS was censored at date of last objective progression-free disease assessment, before post-discontinuation chemotherapy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS) Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 27.6 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS was the duration from enrollment to death. For participants who lived, OS was censored at the last contact.</description>

Stable disease: neither sufficient shrinkage for PR nor sufficient increase for PD; references: smallest sum LD.

        <title>Time to Treatment Failure</title>
        <description>When the protocol was written, time to treatment failure (TTTF) was included as a secondary endpoint. However, it was subsequently realized that due to the design of the study, participants are treated until disease progression or discontinuation from study treatment, not for a fixed number of cycles. Therefore, it was concluded that analysis of TTTF was inappropriate with the current study design and the analysis was not conducted, since it would be essentially the same as Progression-Free Survival.</description>
