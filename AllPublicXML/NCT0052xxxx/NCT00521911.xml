    <textblock>
      Depression is a common disorder among patients with a somatic illness admitted to the general
      hospital. Patients with depression do worse in terms of their somatic symptoms or functioning
      that those without depression. They also stay in the hospital for longer.

      That is the reason that we are interested to know whether patients with depression do better
      if their depression is recognised earlier and treated appropriately. We would like to find
      out which questionnaires are most suitable in clinical practice to help pick up patients with
      a depression. In addition, we would like to know whether a short-term psychological treatment
      of depression would be of any help. We hope to be able to show that this treatment would not
      only result in a reduction of depressive symptoms, but also in a better and quicker recovery
      of the somatic illness.

      The treatment will consist of 6 to 9 weekly sessions of one hour, conducted by a cognitive
      behavioural assistant. Initially, the treatment will take place in the hospital. When
      patients are discharged, treatment sessions will continue at home. The treatment will focus
      on things like recognising and challenging unhelpful thoughts, planning of activities, and
      testing out of predictions by setting up behavioural experiments. Three monthly booster
      sessions will be offered to help patients to maintain their gains and prevent relapse. We
      will reassess the symptoms of the patients at three and six months after the end of
      treatment.
