  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A body of epidemiologic studies show that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a
      protective effect against type 2 diabetes. The importance of both insulin sensitivity and
      insulin secretion in the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance and diabetes type 2 is widely
      recognized. Clinical studies show improved insulin sensitivity after a period of alcohol
      consumption compared to abstention. However, postprandial insulin secretion and beta-cell
      function after a period of moderate alcohol consumption have scarcely been addressed in
      published literature.

      When consumed as an aperitif or with a meal, alcohol is generally expected to stimulate
      appetite and food intake and thus might be a risk factor for over consumption and obesity.
      However the physiological mechanisms for this observed effect are not well understood.
      Furthermore, previous studies lacked a link between physiological parameters and subjective
      parameters of satiety.

      Objective:

      Primary objectives are to study the effects of moderate alcohol consumption on

        -  Postprandial insulin secretion and pancreatic beta-cell function

        -  Physiological and subjective parameters related to satiety and appetite

      Secondary objectives are to study the effects of moderate alcohol consumption on

        -  Miscellaneous markers of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity

        -  Kinetics of alcohol-induced increase of adiponectin

      A tertiary objective is to study the effects of moderate alcohol consumption on

        -  Gene expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue in normal-weight pre menopausal women
           with normal fasting plasma glucose.

      Study design: Randomized, partially controlled, open label, cross-over study with a one week
      wash-out preceding each treatment period

      Study population: 24 apparently healthy pre menopausal Caucasian women with fasting blood
      glucose &lt;6.1 mmol/L, aged 20 - 44 years at inclusion of the study, with a BMI of 19 - 25
      kg/m2, who use oral contraceptives will participate in the study.

      Intervention: Participants will drink daily a test substance for three weeks (2 cans of
      Amstel beer per day; 66 cL ~ 26 gram alcohol) followed by a reference substance (2 cans of
      Amstel alcohol-free beer per day; 66 cL &lt; 0.5 gram of alcohol) for three weeks or vice versa.
      Both treatments are preceded by a one-week wash-out period in which no alcohol is consumed.
