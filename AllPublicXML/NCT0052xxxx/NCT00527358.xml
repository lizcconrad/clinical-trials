  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an evaluation of a primary prevention program to prevent youth violence by improving
      family cohesion, networking among families, school bonding, and access to services for
      Latinos in Langley Park, MD.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To prevent youth involvement in violence, outreach workers will work with families and youth
      to improve school bonding, family cohesion and awareness and utilization of existing
      services; and a youth drop-in center will provide youth with an adult supervised place to
      &quot;hang out&quot;, do homework, or participate in sports and job training.

      Following implementation of the intervention, we will collect detailed process data
      (regarding implementation), and evaluate impact/outcome using a quasi-experimental design
      with baseline (prior to intervention) and two followup data collections in both the
      intervention and a control community (Culmore, Virginia), measuring change in a selected set
      of aggregate community variables that represent mediating factors and outcomes for youth
      violence in Langley Park. Data will be collected via a survey and focus groups.
