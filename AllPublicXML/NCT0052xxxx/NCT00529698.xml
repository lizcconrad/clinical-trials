      This Phase I study is directed at evaluating the safety profile (as a primary end-point) and
      the immunogenicity (as a secondary end-point) of the recombinant HIV-1 Tat vaccine in
      healthy, immunologically competent adult subjects without identifiable risk of HIV-1
      infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of a vaccine against HIV/AIDS has been primary focused on the structural
      proteins (Env, Gag) of HIV-1 with the aim of inducing sterilizing immunity by blocking virus
      entry. Alternative approaches are focused on new vaccine strategies aimed at modifying the
      virus-host dynamic favouring the establishment of a long-term non-progressing disease status.
      Such strategies target regulatory proteins that are the first to be expressed after infection
      and are essential for viral replication, infectivity and pathogenesis. Thus, this approach
      may be effective for both preventive and therapeutic vaccination strategies.

      Being a very early viral regulatory protein necessary for viral gene expression, cell-to-cell
      virus transmission and disease progression, Tat represents a key target protein for the host
      immune response and an optimal candidate for such a vaccination strategy.

      Preclinical studies demonstrated that vaccination with a biologically active Tat protein is
      safe, elicits a broad and specific immune response and induces a long-term protection against
      infection. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in natural infection suggest that the
      presence of an anti-Tat humoral immune response correlates with asymptomatic infection and
      with a slower disease progression while the presence of CD8+ T cell responses to Tat
      correlate with early virus control both in humans and monkeys. Since the immunogenic regions
      of Tat are well conserved among the HIV-1 M group, a vaccine based on Tat may be used in
      different geographic areas of the world.

      The subjects were stratified in two Arms according to the administration route to receive 5
      intradermal or subcutaneous immunizations at 4 weeks intervals.
