    <textblock>
      Accurate documentation in the patient medical record is critical to ensure proper diagnosis
      coding and subsequent hospital reimbursement. Multiple studies have demonstrated that
      clinicians often omit diagnoses which may result in insurance company denials and significant
      delays in payment. In addition, omitting diagnoses decreases the severity of patient illness
      which is often used as a risk adjustment tool to compare institution and physician outcomes.
      Medical informatics has been used to help improve accurate diagnosis documentation as well as
      improve billing efficiency. We plan to utilize a medical informatics program called SIC-IR
      (Surgical Intensive Care - Infection Registry) to improve documentation and attending billing
      efficiency within the surgical and trauma intensive care unit (STICU). We propose a six month
      study: a three month observational evaluation of current billing procedures followed by a
      three month prospective evaluation using a newly created SIC-IR billing module. The outcome
      measures will include the number of ICD-9 and CPT codes at discharge per patient, severity of
      patient illness based on documentation, STICU charges, number of insurance company denials,
      DRG relative weights, as well as a qualitative assessment of attending physician use of the
      electronic billing module. The observational and prospective patient populations will be
      compared for total patient-days in the STICU, ventilator-days, antibiotic-days, infectious
      complications per patient, and injury severity score (trauma patients only) to ensure the
      populations are similar and only the documentation and billing changes can account for our
      measured outcomes. We hypothesize that the SIC-IR billing module will increase the number of
      patient ICD-9 and CPT codes at discharge, increase severity of STICU patient illness via
      accurate documentation, increase total STICU charges, decrease insurance company denials, and
      be an efficient and well accepted electronic medical application.

      1. An observational evaluation will be performed for all STICU patients over a three month
           time period.

             1. Data collected will be the outcome measures listed above (Number of ICD-9 codes at
                discharge, number of CPT codes at discharge, ext)

             2. In addition the total number of STICU patient-days, ventilator-days, central
                line-days, confirmed infectious complications, injury severity scores for trauma
                patients, and antibiotic-days will be collected over the three month period. This
                will serve as a way to ensure the observational and prospective populations are not
                different, and only the documentation and billing methods changed.

        2. The SIC-IR billing module will be released on October 1st, 2007 after attending
           physician training on its use.

        3. A prospective evaluation will be performed for all STICU patients over a three month
           time period

             1. Data collected will be the outcome measures listed above (Number of ICD-9 codes at
                discharge, number of CPT codes at discharge, ext)

             2. In addition the total number of STICU patient-days, ventilator-days, central
                line-days, confirmed infectious complications, injury severity scores for trauma
                patients, and antibiotic-days will be collected over the three month period. This
                will serve as a way to ensure the observational and prospective populations are not
                different, and only the documentation and billing methods changed.

        4. After the 3 month prospective evaluation, the attending physicians will be given a
           survey to document their acceptance or rejection of the billing module.

        5. The observational and prospective documentation and billing data will be compared.
