  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and immune response to
      the DNA HIV vaccine, PENNVAX-B alone, in combination with IL-12, or with 2 different doses of
      IL-15.

    <textblock>
      A vaccine that is effective against multiple strains of HIV remains the best option for
      preventing the spread of HIV. Plasmid DNA vaccines are inexpensive and easy to construct.
      When DNA vaccines are administered in combination with cytokines, such as IL-12 or IL-15, the
      immune response to the vaccine is increased. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      safety and tolerability of the DNA plasmid vaccine, PENNVAX-B when administered alone, or
      with IL-12 or IL-15 DNA adjuvants. The most effective and safe dose of IL-15 will also be
      determined during this study.

      This study will last approximately 12 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to one
      of four groups. Group 1 will receive an injection of PENNVAX-B combined with 0.8 mg IL-15 in
      each deltoid or placebo. Group 2 will receive an injection of PENNVAX-B alone or placebo.
      Group 3 will receive an injection of PENNVAX-B combined with IL-12 in each deltoid or
      placebo. Group 4 will receive PENNVAX-B combined with 2 mg IL-15 or placebo. Injections will
      occur at study entry, Months 1, 3, and 6. Additional study visits will occur on Days 14, 42,
      98, 182, 273, and 364. At these visits a brief physical, blood collection, interview, and
      risk reduction counseling will occur. At some visits HIV testing, urine collection, and
      pregnancy tests will also occur.

      As of 05/30/08, participants will be enrolled into Groups 3 and 4 at a limited pace to allow
      for additional safety reviews for the first few participants in these groups. Additionally,
      safety data will be reviewed for Groups 1 and 2 to determine whether the remainder of
      participants in Groups 2, 3, and 4 will be enrolled.
