  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to test whether increasing the total intake of
      antioxidants to middle-aged smoking men increases the antioxidant defence, reduces oxidative
      damage, and improves biomarkers for oxidative stress.

      The secondary objectives is to test whether this strategy improves other cardiovascular risk
      markers including platelet function, lipid levels, inflammation, and markers of endothelial
      damage.

      In this study men smoking 5 or more cigarettes daily will be invited to participate. We will
      only include individuals with high cardiovascular risk (men rather than women, smokers rather
      than nonsmokers, middle-aged to elderly rather than young individuals), in order to recruit
      people with presumed high oxidative stress who might be most likely to show an effect and
      benefit from our intervention.

      at the time of inclusion, participants will be randomized to three groups; control group,
      kiwi group or phytochemical group. The kiwi group will consume three kiwis a day, whereas the
      phytochemical group will consume an array of antioxidant-rich food stuffs. The intervention
      period is eight weeks.

      Blood samples will be collected before and after the intervention period.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men aged 45-75 years

          -  Daily smoker of a minimum of 5 cigarettes a day

          -  BMI &lt;35 kg/m2 (because of difficulties that may be experienced by morbidly obese
             individuals in following the diet)

          -  Stable weight range of 4 kg or less during the previous 12 weeks

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any symptomatic CVD (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, CABG, PCI, CHF, NYHA
             class III-IV)

          -  Diabetes type I or type II taking drugs for diabetes

          -  Following a vegetarian diet or near-vegetarian diet currently

          -  Allergy to nuts, kiwi fruits, chocolate, strawberries or tomatoes

          -  Clinical disorders including gastrointestinal disease impairing compliance with
             dietary recommendations

          -  History of serious or unstable medical or psychiatric disorder

          -  Current use of or need of lipid lowering drug treatment, aspirin or non-steroidal
             anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), according to assessment of the primary clinical
             investigator. Any &quot;over the counter&quot; headache/ pain or cold remedies taken during the
             study must not contain aspirin or aspirin like drugs such as ibuprofen. These are
             classed as and will interfere with platelet function, making them unresponsive for a
             period of 10-14 days. Paracetamol, however, can be taken as an alternative if required

          -  History of alcohol/or drug abuse

          -  Participation in a drug trial during the previous 30 days

          -  Use of drugs (Xenical, Reductil), nutritional supplements or herbs for weight loss
             within the 4 weeks prior to visit 2 or participation in an active weight reduction
             program

          -  Use of single vitamin or other antioxidants (must be stopped 4 weeks prior to visit 2)

          -  Individuals judged by the clinical investigator to be unable to follow instructions
             and procedures of the study.
