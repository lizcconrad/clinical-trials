      RATIONALE: Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving sunitinib before
      surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be
      removed.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well sunitinib works in
      treating patients with locally advanced bladder cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the pathologic complete response rate of sunitinib malate in patients with
           muscle-invasive locally advanced transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sunitinib malate administered prior to
           radical cystectomy, including surgical outcome and surgical complications.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the clinical effects of sunitinib malate administered prior to radical
           cystectomy and bilateral lymph node dissection, including overall response rate using
           RECIST defined criteria, cytology, and histologic appearance of surgical specimen as
           well as time to progression.

      Tertiary

        -  To assess pre-treatment tissue baseline angiogenic markers and to evaluate the magnitude
           of the difference among these variables with post-treatment tumor tissue after
           neoadjuvant sunitinib malate.

        -  To evaluate the effects of sunitinib malate on immunosuppressive regulatory T cells.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily in weeks 1-4 (1 course). Patients
      undergo restaging within 1 week prior to surgery and then undergo radical cystectomy and
      bilateral lymph node dissection on day 42. Patients achieving a complete pathologic response
      at the time of surgery may receive 6 more courses of adjuvant sunitinib malate beginning 28
      days after surgery at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients found to have
      high-risk features (i.e. pT3 or greater tumor and evidence of disease in any of the lymph
      nodes resected) are offered standard adjuvant systemic chemotherapy at the discretion of the
      treating physician.

      Tumor tissue from pretreatment biopsy and radical cystectomy will be tested for VEGFR-1,
      VEGFR-2 and PDGF-R expression by IHC. Samples are also analyzed for quantification of cell
      proliferation and apoptosis and immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (T-reg) and T-reg
      functions.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 28 days after surgery.

    <description>Evaluate the clinical activity of Sunitinib (Sutent®) given prior to radical cystectomy. Sunitinib will be 50 mg orally once daily as a single agent for 4 consecutive weeks followed by a 2-week rest period to form a complete cycle of 6 weeks. Day 35: re-staging CT scans prior to surgery to capture any potential changes in cytology and cystoscopic examination will be performed.</description>

    <description>Determine if reducing the 2 week rest period that is part of the standard 4-weeks on 2-weeks off schedule of administering sunitinib (Sutent®) will provide sufficient wash-out to avoid any increased morbidity due to the possible impact of an antiangiogenic agent on wound healing and other complications.</description>

    <description>Time to progression will be measured as the time from when the patient started treatment to the time the patient is first recorded as having disease progression or the date of death if the patient dies due to causes other than disease progression.</description>
