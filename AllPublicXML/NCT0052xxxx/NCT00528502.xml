    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      1. To determine if the application of lidocaine to the airway will obtund or abolish the
      laryngeal reflexes. This in turn will lead to a quiescent controlled surgical field.

      Lidocaine is a local anesthetic that causes numbness to the throat when misted into the air.
      This numbness in the throat should stop the urge to clear the throat in the middle of the
      operation. Therefore, this should stop the interruptions during the surgery.

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a
      coin) to one of 2 groups. Participants in Group 1 will receive the saline mist. This will
      moisturize and soothe the throat. Participants in Group 2 will receive the lidocaine mist.
      Lidocaine or saline is misted into the air that you breathe during the surgery. You and your
      surgeon will not be told which group you were assigned to. At the end of the surgery, your
      surgeon will answer some questions to help determine if the use of lidocaine or saline is
      beneficial.

      You will be considered off-study once you are sent to the recovery room after surgery.

      This is an investigational study. Lidocaine is FDA-approved and commercially available for
      local anesthesia. If you are in the lidocaine or the saline group. Up to 105 patients will
      take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
