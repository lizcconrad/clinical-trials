  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of abdominal obesity in the elderly is increasing at alarming rates and thus,
      requires immediate attention. By comparison to younger adults, obesity reduction in the
      elderly presents a unique challenge and requires an innovative approach. We propose a novel
      approach to investigate the effects of different exercise types as independent treatment
      strategies for the reduction of obesity and related health risk factors in older men and
      women. We propose that exercise without caloric restriction will be associated with modest
      weight loss (3-5%), that in turn will be associated with significant reduction in abdominal
      obesity, insulin resistance, and a corresponding increase in skeletal muscle mass and
      function. We will determine the separate effects of resistance and aerobic exercise on these
      primary outcome variables, and, whether a treatment strategy that combines the two is
      optimal.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women between 65 and 80 years of age.

          -  Men and women are self-sufficient, sedentary, abdominally obese (BMI between 27 and
             34.9 kg/m2; waist circumference greater than 88 cm in women and 102 cm in men), weight
             stable (Â± 2 kg) for 6 months prior to the beginning of the study, be non-smokers, and
             not diabetic.

          -  We will study elderly women who are not taking hormone replacement therapy to create a
             homogeneous population in whom the effect of exercise on the principal outcome
             variables can be evaluated with minimal confounding.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Smokers and diabetics.

          -  Women taking hormone replacement therapy.
