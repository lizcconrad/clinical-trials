  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intra-articular (IA) injection of medication is a common procedure in the management of joint
      disorders. In particular, the procedure is effective in the treatment of inflammatory
      conditions, with long acting corticosteroids most commonly used. These agents have been shown
      to reduce the signs and symptoms of inflammation, expressed primarily in the synovium of the
      joint, and are probably capable of slowing the progression of damage to joint cartilage and
      bone in some of these inflammatory conditions. Arthritis that is refractory to IA
      corticosteroid injections may respond to surgical, chemical, or, radioisotope synovectomy,
      procedures in which the inflamed synovial tissue is eradicated. It has been noted that
      infliximab, a monoclonal antibody directed to Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) - α, has high
      affinity for the TNF-α rich inflamed synovium. Recently, clinical benefit from IA injections
      of infliximab has been reported in some cases that were refractory to IA injections of
      corticosteroids. Similarly, the effectiveness of IA infliximab in suppression of joint
      inflammation has also been demonstrated in patients who could not receive systemic therapy
      with infliximab. These reports examined the effect of a single injection of infliximab100 mg
      injected into a large inflamed joint or 2 IA injections 24 hours apart.

      We propose to further evaluate the use of IA infliximab in patients with intractable knee
      monoarthritis, explore the optimal mode of its employment, and assess the degree of
      infliximab systemic absorption from the IA injection. In a pilot study 40 knees will be
      evaluated, 20 injected with infliximab and 20 injected with a corticosteroid comparator
      reflecting the current standard of care.
