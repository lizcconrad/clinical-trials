  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although single breath helium (He) dilution measurement (VASB) is currently used in pulmonary
      function laboratories to assess functional alveolar volume and diffusing capacity for carbon
      monoxide, the extent to which VASB reflects ventilatory and thoracic volume has not been
      prospectively determined in emphysema. We hypothesized that VASB underestimates rebreathe
      helium dilution volume (VARB), and plethysmographic volume (VApleth) as clinical and
      physiologic severity of emphysema increases.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VASB, VARB, and VApleth were measured in 52 consecutive stable outpatients with clinical and
      radiographic emphysema. Thirteen patients with an obstructive ventilatory defect without
      emphysema (OVD) and 18 normal controls were similarly studied. All subjects underwent
      spirometry followed by whole body plethysmography and He dilution volume measurements; VASB
      and VARB order was randomized.

    <description>To test the hypothesis that DLCO SB underestimates DLCO derived by the re-breathe DLCO maneuver, and that VA SB similarly underestimates VA RB. Alveolar volume derived with the two maneuvers will be compared with body plethysmography, the gold standard of total lung volume measurement in patients with emphysema.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All outpatients between the ages of 18 and 81 years referred to the Columbia
             University Medical Center Pulmonary Diagnostic Unit between 1/18/06 and 7/30/07 for
             full pulmonary function evaluation, and with an obstructive ventilatory defect on
             spirometry, were considered eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who did not want to undergo the re-breathe diffusing capacity testing

          -  Patients who could not give informed consent;and

          -  Patients who were too physically compromised to undergo full testing including the
             re-breathe maneuver as deemed by our technicians.
