      To define the relationship between Cardene I.V. dose, serum concentrations, and blood
      pressure reduction in pediatric subjects with hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with acute hypertensive episodes are frequently treated with the same marketed drugs
      as adults. Few drugs are specifically indicated for use in children with severe hypertension.
      Cardene I.V. has been widely used in children with severe hypertension without specific
      dosing recommendations for children in the labeling. This study is designed to examine the
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and efficacy of using Cardene I.V. to reduce
      blood pressure (BP) in children with hypertension and will provide important information to
      guide use in pediatric patients.

  <overall_status>Withdrawn</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to the sale of Cardene IV, the sponsor has stopped enrollment and withdrawn the study. No
    safety issues were identified.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of Stage 1 or Stage 2 systolic hypertension at the time of screening.

          -  Male or female subjects, ages ≥2 to ≤16 years.

          -  Females who meet either of the following criteria:

               -  Non-childbearing potential , as documented by:

                    1. a medical history of non-menstruation or

                    2. surgical sterility from oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy. * A history of
                       tubal ligation or evidence of a sterile sexual partner is insufficient
                       evidence of non-childbearing potential.

               -  Childbearing potential: provide a negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours
                  of administration of study drug and agree to utilize effective contraception or
                  remain abstinent during the entire treatment and follow-up periods of the study.

          -  Signed informed consent provided by an authorized subject representative and assent
             from subject, if feasible (based on local Institutional Review Board (IRB)/ethics
             panel requirements).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with seizures, altered state of consciousness, chest pain, facial palsy or
             intracranial hemorrhage at the time of screening.

          -  Receiving antihypertensive medication within a duration specified prior to screening.

          -  Treatment with cimetidine within 10 hours prior to dosing with study drug.

          -  Any known or suspected allergy to nicardipine hydrochloride.

             limit of normal.

          -  Receiving maintenance hemodialysis at screening or anticipated to require hemodialysis
             within 12 hours following initiation of treatment with study drug.

          -  Receiving a blood transfusion at screening or anticipated to require blood
             transfusions within 12 hours following initiation of treatment with study drug.
