      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intraprostatic
      injection of Botox for the treatment of men diagnosed with chronic nonbacterial
      prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS).

      This is a blinded prospective randomized design comparing the efficacy and safety of
      intraprostatic Botox vs. intraprostatic lidocaine injection, with an optional open label
      extension. Men with a clinical diagnosis of chronic nonbacterial prostatitis/CPPS will be
      treated with intraprostatic Botox™ or 1% lidocaine and followed for 12 weeks (primary
      efficacy analyses), and 24 weeks (long term follow-up) for responders. An open label
      extension will be offered to non-responders.

      A total of 40 males will be enrolled. There will be seven (7) research clinic visits and two
      phone contacts: Visit 1 (screening), Visit 2 (baseline/treatment), Visit 3 (2-week safety
      evaluation - clinic contact), Visit 4 (4-week safety evaluation - phone contact), Visit 5
      (6-week interim efficacy/safety), Visit 6 (12-week primary endpoint evaluation), Visit 7
      (14-week clinic follow up), Visit 8 (16 week phone contact) and Visit 9 (24-week clinic close
      out).
