    <textblock>
      With this study we will like to determine if taking a dose of the study medication, called
      Polypodium leucotomos (PL), prevents some of the changes in the skin caused by the adverse
      effects of UVA, a type of ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet light is a form of radiation which
      is not visible to the human eye. The sun produces different types of ultraviolet radiation,
      and UVA is one of them. More than 95% of the solar UV energy that reaches our skin is from
      the UVA type. UVA penetrates cloud cover and glass windows.

      PL extract comes from a tropical fern plant grown in Central and South America, and it is a
      dietary supplement available in the US. No side effects have been reported with Polypodium
      leucotomos extract since becoming commercially available in 1982. Also, PL extract was
      approved for oral use by the Institutional Review Board of The Massachusetts General
      Hospital, Boston, for studies by Harvard Medical School faculty in human volunteers that were
      carried out for a period of two years, using artificial light and sunlight as ultraviolet
      sources.

      This is an investigator-blinded study, which means that the doctor evaluating you will not
      know if you are receiving the study medication or not. Another doctor will be supplying you
      with the medication and discussing any problems that you may have with the medication.

      You will be assigned to one of the two treatment groups. The group will be assigned by chance
      and you will have a one in two chances of receiving either the study medication or no
      treatment.

      Screening Visit:

      You will read and be explained the informed consent. If you agree to participate you will
      sign the informed consent and a copy will be given to you. Your medical history and the
      exclusion/inclusion criteria will be reviewed. Pictures are going to be taken from both
      forearms with a Nikon camera in each visit . If you are a woman in childbearing age you will
      be asked to take a urine pregnancy test at the research office at baseline (day 0) and final
      visit. If you qualify you will be given an appointment for baseline visit (day 0).

      Baseline visit (day 0):

      You will be randomly (by chance) assigned to either PL supplement or no treatment. You will
      be instructed not to change any of your practices towards the sun during the duration of the
      study, including time spent outdoors each weekday and weekend day, with special attention
      between the hours of 10 AM to 4PM. You will also be asked about sunscreen use and the parts
      of your body where you apply it. You may not apply sunscreen to the anterior aspect of your
      forearms (the part of your forearm that continues with your palm) during the length of you
      participation in our study. As a procedure during this visit, previous local anesthesia, a 3
      mm skin biopsy from your right forearm will be taken. Then, 4 different small square areas or
      your left forearm (18mm each) will be exposed to a source of UVA for a few seconds.

      Supplies and wound care instructions for the biopsied site will be given to you, as well as
      an appointment to return in 24 hours.

      Follow up visit 1:

      You will be asked about adverse events since your last visit. The study doctor will examine
      your left arm and determine the amount of redness present. You will be given an appointment
      to return for follow up.

      Follow up visit 2:

      You will be asked about adverse events since your last visit. If you were assigned to take
      the study medication, PL, you will have to take one dose 8 hours and another dose 2 hours
      prior to beginning of visit 2. Three different small square areas (18mm each) of your right
      forearm will be exposed to different doses of UVA for a few seconds.

      You should return any unused medication. You will be given an appointment to return in 24
      hours.

      Final visit:

      You will be asked about adverse events since your last visit. Three 3 mm skin biopsies will
      be taken from within the previously irradiated squares.

      Supplies and wound care instructions for the biopsied site will be given to you.

      If you are a woman in childbearing age you will be asked to take a urine pregnancy test.

      You will be paid.

      Note: The skin around the areas to be tested during this study will be protected with a UVA
      opaque material. If you experience redness with burning and tenderness, you will be allowed
      to use twice a day hydrocortisone 1%, over the counter cream, to treat the affected area. You
      may contact research personnel for wound care follow-up up to one month beyond the final
      visit, if necessary.

      During the course of the study, pictures of the forearms will be taken on each visit.
