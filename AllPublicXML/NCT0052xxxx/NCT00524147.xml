  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculous (TB) pleurisy can cause clinical symptoms and pleural fibrosis with resultant
      residual pleural thickening (RPT). Therapeutic thoracentesis or initial complete drainage in
      addition to anti-TB drugs have been tried to rapidly relieve dyspnea caused by effusion and
      to decrease the occurrence of RPT. However, contradictory results are reported without clear
      reasons. The researchers' hypothesis is that, in addition to anti-TB medications, early
      effective evacuation of inflammatory exudates with or without fibrinolytic agents may hasten
      resolution of pleural effusion, reduce the occurrence of RPT and finally improve long-term
      functional outcome in patients with TB pleurisy.
