      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To develop a comprehensive sample of nursing home dentists in Ohio.

        -  To document knowledge of oral cancer detection among these dentists.

        -  To describe opinions of these dentists about oral cancer screening competency.

        -  To describe the current oral cancer screening practices of these dentists.

      OUTLINE: Participants are stratified according to geographical location (urban vs rural).

      A comprehensive sample of nursing home dentists practicing in Ohio are contacted through a
      recruitment letter and are asked to respond to questions regarding oral cancer screening
      practices, knowledge of oral cancer detection, and opinions about oral cancer screening using
      a newly developed survey, which is based on parts of an existing, pre-tested instrument (Oral
      Cancer Prevention and Early Detection Survey).
