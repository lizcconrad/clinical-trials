  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the protocol is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of
      subcutaneous MOA-728 versus placebo in subjects with chronic non-malignant pain who have

        <description>A rescue-free bowel movement was defined as a bowel movement where no laxatives were used during the prior 24 hours.

Information on laxative use, bowel movements and bowel movement assessments were reported daily by patient using a telephone interactive voice response system (IVRS). Weekly number of complete RFBM was the total number of complete RFBM reported in study period divided by the number of days with information, and multiplied by 7 for a normalized weekly number.

        <description>A rescue-free bowel movement was defined as a bowel movement where no laxatives were used during the prior 24 hours. Information on laxative use, bowel movements and bowel movement assessments were self reported daily by the patient using a telephone IVRS.

        <description>A rescue-free bowel movement was defined as a bowel movement where no laxatives were used during the prior 24 hours. Information on laxative use, bowel movements and bowel movement assessments were self reported daily by the patient using a telephone interactive voice response system (IVRS). A complete RFBM has a sensation of complete evacuation.</description>
