          -  Presence of cognitive deficit as measured score of -1.5 SD on the SDMT (oral version)
             or a score of -1.0 SD on the SDMT and -1.0 SD on either CVLT-II (total learning or

             normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the
             subject at any time without prejudice to his/her future medical care

          -  Capable of performing the requirements of a neuropsychological test battery including
             having at least 20/70 near visual acuity by near vision chart, with correction (i.e.,
