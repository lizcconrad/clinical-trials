      The purpose of this research study is to see if giving women a hormone called &quot;ghrelin&quot; will
      increase levels of growth hormone in the blood and increase appetite. Ghrelin is a naturally
      occurring hormone that is produced mostly by the stomach and causes secretion of another
      hormone called growth hormone. It also increases short-term appetite and may lower the amount
      of inflammation in the body.

      Some people lose their appetite as they age and have unintentional weight loss. This may be
      caused by a break in the communication between the stomach and the brain. We are particularly
      interested in seeing if there is a difference in the effects of ghrelin in older women who
      have lost weight recently without wanting to and those who have not.

    <description>At time 0, an infusion (ghrelin or saline) will be started in one of the IV sites at a dose of 2.5 pmol/kg/min (an equivalent amount of saline will be infused in a stepwise fashion if it is the placebo dose). After 60 minutes, the infusion rate will be increased to 5 pmol/kg/min. After 120 minutes, the ghrelin infusion will be increased again to a dose of 10 pmol/kg/min, and will be continued until 180 minutes, when the infusion will be stopped. will be administered in an identical fashion.</description>
