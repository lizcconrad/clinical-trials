  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of vigabatrin for the treatment
      of cocaine dependence, based on the twice-weekly qualitative urine toxicologies for cocaine.
      Based on two prior unblinded human studies and 15 years of animal studies, this 100 subject
      double- blind, randomized study is designed to show if with vigabatrin treatment but not
      placebo, even non-hospitalized cocaine dependent individuals with ready access to cocaine
      will become cocaine abstinent if they are self motivated to stop their cocaine habit. To
      accomplish this, cocaine dependent subjects will be randomly assigned to either a placebo or
      vigabatrin treatment group and treated for a nine week period. The primary hypothesis is that
      as compared to the placebo arm, the vigabatrin treatment arm will show a significant increase
      in the number of subjects who are abstinent for the final 3 weeks of the study.

          -  Be seeking treatment for cocaine dependence.

          -  Have a urine sample positive for qualitative cocaine toxicology at initial screening.

          -  Have the ability to understand, and having understood, provide written informed
             consent to comply with the treatment protocol.

          -  Have a history and brief physical examination that demonstrate no clinically
             significant contraindication for participating in the study, in the judgment of the
             admitting physician and the Principal Investigator.

          -  Have normal, or, if necessary, corrected visual acuity, visual fields, and normal
             fundoscopy findings

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  In order to participate in the study, subjects must not:

               -  Meet DSM-IV criteria for current dependence on any psychoactive substance other
                  than cocaine, alcohol, nicotine, or marijuana or physiological dependence on
