    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      1. To compare the efficacy of 1.5T vs. 3T T1 and T2-weighted MR images sequences for the
      detection and evaluation of liver lesions.

      Magnetic resonance imaging is taken with scanners at different magnetic field strength. The
      current practice at UTMDACC is to perform these exams at 1.5 Tesla. Tesla is the unit of
      strength of the magnetic field. This study will compare the images taken at the standard 1.5
      Tesla (T) magnetic field with those at the newer 3.0T magnetic field.

      You are already scheduled to receive a standard 1.5 T MR of the liver area as requested by
      your doctor. As part of this study, you will then be asked to return on a separate date to
      have a similar exam performed with the Signal 3.0T Excite MR scanner. You will return within
      a two week period from the date of your first MRI examination. The examination will be
      performed in a machine that looks similar to the 1.5T scanner. It will also take about the
      same amount of time as the examination at 1.5T.

      The images taken by both scanners will be evaluated and compared. After you have had the
      second scan, your participation in this study will be over. If there are new findings
      identified with the new scan your doctor will be notified.

      This is an investigational study. The 3.0T scan will be performed free of charge. A total of
      20 patients will take part in this study All will be enrolled at UTMDACC.

      This protocol is partially funded by a research grant from General Electric Medical Systems
      (GEMS).
