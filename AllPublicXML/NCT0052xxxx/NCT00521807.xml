      Objective: The study was performed to evaluate the effect of a standardized hypnosis
      treatment used in general practice for patients with chronic widespread pain (CWP).

      Design: A randomized control group-controlled study. Setting and subjects: 16 patients were
      randomized into a treatment group or a control group, each constituting eight patients. Seven
      patients in the treatment group completed the schedule. After the control period, five of the
      patients in the control group also received treatment, making a total of 12 patients having
      completed the treatment sessions.

      Intervention: The intervention group went through a standardized hypnosis treatment with ten
      consecutive therapeutic sessions once a week, each lasting for about 30 minutes, focusing on
      ego-strengthening, relaxation, releasing muscular tension and increasing self-efficacy.

      Main outcome measures: A questionnaire was developed in order to calibrate the symptoms
      before and after the 10 weeks period, and the results were interpolated into a scale from 0
      to 100, increasing numbers representing increasing suffering.
