  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The addition of RAD001, an mTOR inhibitor, to irinotecan and anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab may
      increase efficacy for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who progressed on prior
      chemotherapy. This approach is biologically directed to overall target the cancer cell at
      multiple levels, and potentially preventing chemotherapy and EGFR-therapy resistance.
