  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the response to an additional dose (challenge dose) of hepatitis B vaccine, when
      given to subjects who had received primary vaccination of Engerix™-B vaccine approximately
      72-78 months ago.

      This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the challenge phase. The
      Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.

          -  Subjects who received an additional dose of hepatitis B vaccine outside the context of
             the study between the primary vaccination course and the hepatitis B challenge
             vaccination visit.

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a
             non-investigational product.

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the vaccine.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination.

          -  Acute disease at the time of enrolment.

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as
             determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the hepatitis B vaccine challenge dose or planned administration during the
             study period (one month).

          -  Pregnant or lactating female.
