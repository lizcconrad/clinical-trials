  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study of psychiatric inpatients will assess mood effects of varenicline, as well as
      assess if varenicline decreased nicotine cravings acutely.

      This study will measure mood effects and rapid anti-craving effects of varenicline in
      psychiatric inpatients. Patients will be offered to participate in the trial if they wish to
      stop smoking or wish to decrease nicotine cravings while in the hospital. They will not be
      able to use nicotine replacement products when taking varenicline.

      Patients will be assessed with the QIDS-SR16, Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale as well as
      the Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects (FISER) at baseline and daily during the
      trial; patients will be asked to enroll for the duration of their hospitalization. Patients
      will be assessed as to whether they wish to continue varenicline post-discharge.
