    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is find whether the addition of aldosterone antagonist,
      spironolactone to dual renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade involving angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitor and AT-1 angiotensin II receptor blocker leads to the reduction
      of proteinuria, main prognostic marker of chronic kidney disease progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in the progression of
      chronic kidney diseases (CKD), and inhibition of the RAAS with angiotensin-converting enzyme
      inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) may retard CKD
      progression. Dual pharmacological blockade of the RAAS with ACEI and ARB is recommended as a
      standard renoprotective management at least in patients with nondiabetic proteinuric CKD.
      However, neither ACEI nor ARB, even in high doses or in concomitant usage, abrogate the
      progression of CKD completely. Innovative approaches are needed to keep patients with CKD off
      dialysis. Additional blockade of the aldosterone pathway may prove to be such beneficial
      therapeutic concept.Aldosterone, a final effector of RAAS plays a significant role in the
      pathogenesis of CKD independently of angiotensin II through direct cellular action. This
      includes promoting an inflammatory response, endothelial dysfunction, and fibrosis by
      increasing plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) and transforming growth factor beta-1
      (TGF-beta-1) expression and stimulation reactive oxygen species.A number of observations
      suggest nongenomic vasoconstrictor action of aldosterone leading to raise arterial and
      glomerular capillary pressure.Given these facts additional administration of aldosterone
      antagonist to combination treatment with ACEI and ARB, so called triple RAAS blockade may
      provide additional renal protection. To shed more light on this issue, we performed a
      randomised open controlled study to evaluate the influence of triple RAAS therapy on
      surrogate markers of kidney injury, i.e. proteinuria, markers of tubular involvement and
      kidney fibrosis.

    <description>In the 8-weeks run-in period ACEI, cilazapril (5 mg), telmisartan (80 mg) and hydrochlorotiazyd (12.5 mg) were administered to achieve the target blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg. Next, they were randomly assigned to add (or not) 25 mg of spironolactone in two active treatment periods lasting 8 weeks each.</description>
