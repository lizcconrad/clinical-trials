  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to see if there is a benefit to giving chemotherapy and then
      natural killer (NK) cells. The NK cells must come from a family member who shares half of the
      patients HLA proteins. NK cells are a type of white blood cell. They can recognize and kill
      abnormal cells in the body.

      Patients whose blood cancer is not cured with a stem cell transplant do not have standard
      treatment options. Studies have shown that NK cells from a donor can be given safely and can
      be helpful in treating some blood diseases. These NK cells are collected from the patients
      donor and purified using a separation system called CliniMACS that has been used safely in
      previous studies and is used in this study with the approval of the Federal Food and Drug
      Administration. The researchers want to find out what effects the NK cells will have on blood
      cancer and bone marrow function and how to maximize its benefits in treating blood cancers.
      The researchers hope that giving chemotherapy and then NK cells will be a better treatment
      for the disease than the current available treatment options.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the anti-leukemic efficacy of allogeneic HLA-haploidentical related natural
           killer (NK) cell infusion following a cytoreductive regimen with cyclophosphamide and
           fludarabine in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes
           (MDS), or blastic CML who have relapsed following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
           transplant, where efficacy is defined as the achievement of complete or partial
           remission at one year following NK cell infusion.

      Secondary

        -  To assess treatment efficacy, as defined by achievement of complete or partial
           remission, at 3 and 6 months following HLA-haploidentical related NK cell infusion.

        -  To assess the effects of an HLA-haploidentical related NK cell infusion on the sustained
           engraftment and recovery of an HLA-matched stem cell allograft.

        -  To assess the risk of inducing graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) or altering its severity.

        -  To provide preliminary evidence that specific donor KIR-recipient HLA ligand
           combinations relating to missing self-MHC class I ligand or missing class I ligand are
           associated with higher NK alloreactivity and improved outcome.

        -  To monitor the extent and duration of NK cell donor chimerism.

        -  To monitor NK cell reconstitution through NK receptor cell surface phenotyping
           (CD94/NKG2A, ILT-2, KIR expression) and function (intracellular IFN-γ, cytotoxicity) on
           day 15, 30, 60, 100, and 200 following the NK infusion and to correlate with outcome.

        -  To correlate the magnitude of NK effect with disease and known survival risk factors
           (time from allogeneic HSCT to relapse; &lt; 6 months vs &gt; 6 months).

        Diagnosis and Status

          -  Patients with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of relapsed or persistent resistant
             AML, MDS, or blastic CML following HSCT and who have been deemed ineligible for second
             HSCT after consideration of adequacy of their physical function, extent of disease,
             and prior treatment-related toxicities.

        Eligible patients have evidence of disease with ≥5% bone marrow involvement detected by
        morphology or abnormal cytogenetics (by karyotype or FISH). Patients with molecular
        detection of markers characteristic of the patient's disease from two consecutive bone
        marrow biopsies are also eligible. Following diagnosis of relapsed disease, treatment to
        reduce leukemic burden is allowed prior to protocol therapy without the need for additional
        disease documentation prior to cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.

          -  Patients with extramedullary relapse are eligible except for those with CNS
             involvement.

          -  Patients must have received an allogeneic HSCT.

          -  Patient must not be pregnant and must be using adequate form of birth control.

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky (adult) or Lansky (pediatric) Performance Status ≥ 60%.

             have used systemic immunosuppression for two weeks, or during immunosuppression taper
             have documented two subtherapeutic levels at least one week apart. Immunosuppressive
             agents include but are not limited to systemic steroids, calcineurin inhibitors,
             MTOR-inhibitors, Budesonide, anti-thymocyte globulin. The maximal allowable dose of
             corticosteroids is the equivalent of 10 mg/day prednisone.

          -  Patients with grade I/II acute GVHD or limited chronic GVHD and receiving localized
             GVHD therapy (e.g. topical steroids) are not excluded from this trial.

          -  Patients having received previous adoptive cellular therapy such as donor lymphocyte
             infusion (DLI) are not excluded from this trial as long as their disease has been
             documented to progress within two months of receiving DLI or if the patient has not
             received DLI within two months of NK cell infusion.

          -  Patients who have received cytoreductive therapy following documentation of relapse
             and prior to enrollment are not excluded from this trial. The interval between
             standard reinduction chemotherapy and start of protocol chemotherapy should be a
             minimum of 2 weeks, and all induction chemotherapy-related toxicities should be
             documented to be completely resolved. For patients receiving nonintensive
             chemotherapies such as hydroxyurea or low-dose cytarabine, nonintensive chemotherapies
             should be discontinued upon initiation of protocol chemotherapy.

          -  Each patient must be willing to participate as a research subject and must sign an
             informed consent form. Parents or legal guardians of patients who are minors may sign
