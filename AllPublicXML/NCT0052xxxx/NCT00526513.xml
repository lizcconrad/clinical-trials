      Primary Objectives:

      To determine the effect of insulin glulisine on glycemic control (HbA1c, FBG &amp; PPBG) from
      baseline to the end of the study.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To evaluate the safety of insulin glulisine in basal/bolus regimen by monitoring the
      incidence of hypoglycemia and other adverse events.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus previously treated for 6 months with
             prandial insulin + Basal insulin or Premix (Type I) or by either a basal insulin + OAD
             or basal + RHI/other short acting analogue insulin or Premix (Type II) with HbA1c &gt;7%.

          -  Adequate hepatic and renal functions

          -  Ability and willingness of a tight antidiabetic therapy and to perform blood glucose
             self-monitoring and especially blood glucose profiles, using a blood glucometer at
             home.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating women or women of childbearing potential not using adequate
             contraception.

          -  Patients with hypersensitivity to insulin glulisine or to any of the excipients.

          -  History of diabetic ketoacidosis.

          -  Diabetic retinopathy with surgical treatment (laser photocoagulation or vitrectomy) in
             the 3 months prior to study entry or which may require surgical treatment within 3
             months of study entry.

          -  Alcohol abuse or drug abuse.

          -  Clinically relevant cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, neurological,
             endocrine, hematological or psychiatric illness, other serious illnesses, uncontrolled
             medical conditions or active infections making implementation of the protocol
             difficult.

          -  Medical, psychiatric, or neurologic condition that renders the patient unable to
             understand the nature and scope of the study. Mental retardation or language barrier
             such that the patient is unable to give informed consent.

          -  Participation in an investigational trial within 30 days of study entry.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
