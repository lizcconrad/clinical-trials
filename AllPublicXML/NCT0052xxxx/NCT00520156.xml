  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a well-documented but poorly understood relationship between headache disorders
      (e.g. migraine, cluster headaches, awakening headaches, etc.) and sleep disorders. One
      hypothesis includes an underlying disorder known as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with low
      overnight oxygen saturations and possibly elevated carbon dioxide levels which result in
      awakening headache. Bruxism, or grinding of the teeth, has also been anecdotally associated
      with headache. The converse of these arguments is that the patient may have a primary
      headache disorder, for example migraine, leading to disordered sleep patterns or insomnia.
      The true relationship between the two, as alluded above, is unknown. The actual prevalence of
      the two disorders occurring simultaneously is not known.

      There have been several small, retrospective studies which have attempted to evaluate this
      relationship. One of these studies evaluated those patients diagnosed with OSA who were given
      the standard of care therapy - continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) - and found that
      headaches among these patients were improved after using CPAP. Again, this was a small,
      retrospective study.

      We propose a study whereby patients who are referred for polysomnography (PSG, or &quot;sleep
      study&quot;) are consented, then surveyed on the presence or absence of headache. A brief
      questionnaire is followed up with a more detailed questionnaire to characterize whether this
      headache that the patient has is truly a headache disorder. Following the survey and PSG, the
      patient's sleep study parameters are evaluated to see whether there are certain correlations
      between what has been recorded and the particular headache disorder present.

      Lastly, if the patient was diagnosed with OSA and fitted with a CPAP device, the patient will
      be queried several weeks later to evaluate whether there was improvement or cessation of the
      headache disorder.

      There is a well-documented but poorly understood relationship between headache disorders
      (e.g. migraine, cluster headaches, awakening headaches, etc.) and sleep disorders. The exact
      prevalence of patients with concomitant headache disorder and sleep disorder is not even
      known. Hypotheses surrounding the relationship include low overnight oxygen saturation and/or
      hypercarbia in the case of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with awakening headache, primary
      headache disorder as a contributor to secondary sleep disorder, atypical lengths or
      percentages of time in various sleep stages resulting in disordered sleep patterns and
      subsequent headache, bruxism causing tension type headaches, among others. Our review of the
      literature shows there has not yet been a prospective trial evaluating headache disorders and
      concomitant sleep disorders with attempts to find vagaries or abnormalities in terms of sleep
      parameters as a way to explain headache disorder.

      Additionally, although there have been few retrospective reviews of small numbers of patients
      examining an intervention (in this case, the addition of continuous positive airway pressure
      - CPAP) as a means to correct a sleep disorder with a subsequent evaluation of the patient's
      pre-existing headache disorders, there has yet to be a prospective trial evaluating same. Our
      team identified at least one retrospective study that would suggest that treating OSA with
      standard of care CPAP improved pre-existing symptoms of headache.

      Our study proposes to - after obtaining consent - survey patients with suspected sleep
      disorders who have been scheduled for a sleep study to evaluate the overall prevalence of
      headache disorder among this particular population. We would then evaluate various standard
      sleep study parameters such as lowest oxygen saturation, time in various sleep stages, sleep
      latency, total sleep time, respiratory disturbance index, presence of bruxism, and so on, to
      see whether there is a correlation between certain of these parameters and a particular
      headache disorder. We also would survey those patients diagnosed with OSA following
      institution of CPAP to see whether there was a decrement or cessation in headache frequency
      or intensity.

      Being that a significant proportion of our patients are returning war veterans with possible
      traumatic brain injuries or post-traumatic stress disorder, we would also query patients
      regarding the presence of these disorders. These data would be taken into account as a
      sub-analysis of the overall data set.

      The study will be of 12 months duration. Over 2000 sleep studies are performed at our
      institution in 12 months. We anticipate an enrollment of between 400 to 800 subjects.

    <description>Patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) will be offered standard of care treatment of CPAP (patients given oral appliances for OSA are excluded from our study). Note: our study is a survey-based and observational study following patients who are being evaluated for sleep disorders. Those patients diagnosed with OSA would be offered CPAP or possibly an oral appliance regardless of whether they are entered into our study or not.</description>
