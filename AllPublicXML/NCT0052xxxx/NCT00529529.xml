    <textblock>
      This study was designed to assess the safety of indacaterol (300 µg and 600 µg (2 x 300 μg
      capsules) once daily [od]), compared with salmeterol (50 μg twice a day [b.i.d.]), over 26
      weeks, in patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma.

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With at Least 1 Adverse Event During the 26 Weeks of the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to end of study (Week 26)</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events include asthma exacerbations. An asthma exacerbation was defined as a worsening of asthma as judged clinically significant by the physician, requiring treatment with rescue oral or intravenous (IV) corticosteroids. Asthma worsening that required treatment with inhaled or nebulized short-acting β2-agonists or an increase in inhaled corticosteroids only was not considered an asthma exacerbation.</description>

    <description>The QTc interval (in milliseconds, ms) is calculated from electrocardiogram (ECG) data collected 1 hour post-dose using Fridericia's formula: QTc = QT/RR^0.33. QTc is the interval between the Q and T waves corrected for heart rate and RR is the interval between two R waves. ECGs included all 12 standard leads and a Lead II rhythm strip of at least 10-second duration. All results were sent to a central laboratory for review by a cardiologist.

          <title>Corrected QT (QTc) Interval Using Fridericia's Formula Measured 1 Hour Post-dose at Week 21</title>
          <description>The QTc interval (in milliseconds, ms) is calculated from electrocardiogram (ECG) data collected 1 hour post-dose using Fridericia's formula: QTc = QT/RR^0.33. QTc is the interval between the Q and T waves corrected for heart rate and RR is the interval between two R waves. ECGs included all 12 standard leads and a Lead II rhythm strip of at least 10-second duration. All results were sent to a central laboratory for review by a cardiologist. The analysis included baseline QTc interval and FEV1 pre-dose and 30 minutes post-dose of salbutamol/albuterol during screening as covariates.</description>

        <title>Number of Asthma Exacerbations Per Patient (Without Imputation) During the 26 Weeks of the Study</title>
        <description>An asthma exacerbation was defined as a worsening of asthma as judged clinically significant by the physician, requiring treatment with rescue oral or intravenous (IV) corticosteroids. The number of asthma exacerbations includes events recorded on the asthma exacerbation clinical report form (CRF) page and events recorded on the adverse events CRF page with “asthma” as a key word in the preferred term.</description>
