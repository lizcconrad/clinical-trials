  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic bilateral subthalamic stimulation leads a spectacular clinical improvement in
      patients with motor complications. However, the post-operative body weight gain involved may
      limit the benefits of surgery and induce critical metabolic disorder. The aim of this study
      to determine the energy expenditure in usual conditions of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be studied before (between 3 and 1 months) and after (1 month) STN-DBS surgery.
      Each time the same measurements will be taken. The principal ones will be :

        -  Clinical examination

        -  Autoevaluation dietary questionnaire

        -  Biological tests

        -  Study in calorimetry chamber (only in Clermont-Ferrand centre)

        -  Heart rate recorded during 7 days in usual conditions of life

        -  Energy expenditure recorded during 14 days in usual conditions of life with normalized
           water (18O 10 %) and Deuterium oxide (99.94 %D)

        -  Acute Ldopa challenge (in both conditions of dopa and stim)

        -  Apathy evaluation

        -  Body weight, and body compositions measurements
