      5 Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) Teams from Kingston (n=2), Belleville (n=1), and Ottawa
      (n=2) will be involved in a 12 week randomized controlled trial of our Time Use Intervention.
      20 subjects (4 subjects from each team) will participate in this pilot study and will be
      treated individually by their ACT team Occupational Therapist (1 OT per ACT Team). This pilot
      test will help to determine the clinical utility and efficacy of our treatment protocol.
