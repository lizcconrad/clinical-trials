  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint of the study would be to determine the safety of dalteparin as
      prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in orthopaedic oncology patients.
      Specifically, the goal of the study is to determine whether there are significantly increased
      bleeding complications at the surgical site after major oncologic operations in the lower
      extremity. The study would help establish specific parameters for use of dalteparin in
      complex orthopaedic oncology patients. Not all patients would be appropriate for this
      medication, particularly those with massive hemorrhage during surgery and those with
      underlying coagulopathies. It is likely that patients requiring limited tumor excision,
      particularly those with metastatic carcinoma, would be ideal candidates for dalteparin
      therapy. Patients who require radical resections of tumor may need stricter guidelines for
      the safe use of the medication, since the potential for post-operative bleeding may be
      greater.

      Dalteparin is an FDA-approved blood thinner (prevents clots by thinning the blood).

      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have what are called &quot;screening
      tests.&quot; These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in the
      study. You will have a complete medical history, physical exam and a Doppler ultrasound of
      both legs. The Doppler ultrasound test uses sound waves to check the veins of your legs for
      the presence of any pre-existing deep venous thrombosis (blood clots). You will also have
      blood drawn for routine blood tests (about 2 tablespoons). Women who are able to have
      children must have negative blood or urine pregnancy test before taking part in the study.

      You will be proceed with your scheduled surgery regardless of whether or not you take part in
      this study. During surgery, you will have TED hose and a mechanical compression stocking put
      on the leg that will not be having surgery. TED stands for thromboembolic disease, which
      means &quot;blood clots&quot;. TED hose are special stockings that are worn on the legs to prevent
      blood from clotting. Mechanical compression stockings are air filled stockings that inflate
      and deflate intermittently.

      You will then have TED hose and mechanical compression stockings applied to the leg that had
      surgery in the recovery room. You will be monitored by daily physical exams for any signs of
      deep venous thrombosis (DVT - blood clot) DVT in the veins of the legs. Within 12-24 hours
      following surgery to remove the bone tumor, you will begin treatment with dalteparin. You
      will receive an injection of dalteparin once every day by an injection given deep under the
      skin. The injection site will be varied each day and will be given daily until your are
      discharged from the hospital (about 7-10 days).

      You will also have blood drawn for routine blood tests following surgery (about 2
      tablespoons). A follow-up Doppler ultrasound study of the leg that had surgery will be done
      before discharge from the hospital.

      Participants who experience any complications following surgery, including a DVT, will be
      immediately treated by standard of care procedures.

      Your participation in this study will be over at the time of your discharge from the
      hospital.

      This is an investigational study. Dalteparin is an FDA-approved blood thinner. Its use
      together with TED hose and mechanical compression stockings in this study is experimental.
      The TED hose and mechanical compression stockings used in the study is considered standard of
      care. Up to 70 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
