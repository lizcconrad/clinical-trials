  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a debilitating chronic immune mediated inflammatory disease
      which affects 1% of the European population. RA is associated with significant joint damage,
      disability and an enhanced mortality. Current treatment strategies target patients once
      synovitis has been present for several months and it is clear that the patient has developed
      persistent disease. After the first 3 months of symptoms, we and others have shown that the
      persistence of chronic inflammation in the rheumatoid synovium is driven by hyperplastic
      stromal tissue which inhibits leukocyte apoptosis leading to the accumulation of inflammatory
      cells in the joint. Therapies at this stage of disease, with conventional disease modifying
      anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) as well as drugs targeting TNF-alpha reduce disease activity
      but are unable to cure RA. We have now identified that the very early phase of synovitis in
      patients destined to develop RA (within the first 12 weeks of symptoms) represents a
      pathologically distinct phase of disease. This suggests that late disease is not just more of
      early disease and gives, for the first time, a clear rationale for very early intervention.
      Building on these recent observations, we propose to test the hypothesis that the disease
      processes in the very early stages of RA are fundamentally different to those in established
      chronic disease. This will be done by assessing whether treatment during this phase with the
      well-established gold standard modality of anti-TNF-alpha therapy and methotrexate can
      permanently switch off inflammation, preventing the development of RA and thereby effecting a
      cure of the disease.
