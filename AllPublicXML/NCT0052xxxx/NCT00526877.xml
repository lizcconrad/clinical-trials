  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-acting risperidone
      microspheres (small uniformly-sized spherical particles, of micrometer dimensions, frequently
      labeled with radioisotopes or various reagents acting as tags or markers) in participants
      with schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment
      from reality, often with delusions and hallucinations, and withdrawal into the self) and
      schizoaffective disorders (a mixed psychiatric disorder relating to a complex psychotic state
      that has features of both schizophrenia and a mood disorder such as bipolar disorder), who
      are receiving psychiatric home-care treatment .

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-centric
      (conducted in more than one center), non-randomized and single-arm study of long- acting
      risperidone microspheres in participants with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders.
      The duration of this study will be 6 months and will include following parts: Screening (that
      is, 28 days before study commences on Day 1), run-in period (that is, Week 1 to 3) and
      Treatment period (that is, Week 1 to 24). Participants will receive previous medication for
      the first three weeks during run-in period and previous medications will be tapered off
      during the third week. Participants will receive long-acting risperidone microspheres
      starting at a dose of 25 milligram (mg) every two weeks by intramuscular injection (injection
      of a substance into a muscle). Efficacy of the participants will be primarily evaluated
      through Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndromes Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items and ranges from 30 to 210. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening (28 days before study drug administration), Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP is a clinician-rated scale that reflects social functioning in 4 domains of behavior (socially useful activities including work and study, personal and social relationships, self care, and disturbing and aggressive behaviors). The total score ranges from 1 to 100 (score of 71 to 100 will have a mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; less than or equal to 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision) divided into 10 equal intervals to rate the degree of difficulty (i=absent to vi=very severe) in each of the 4 domains.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening (28 days before study drug administration), Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI rating scale is a 7-point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant. A rating of 1 indicates to &quot;normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 indicates &quot;among the most extremely ill participants&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form-36 (SF-36) - Quality of Life Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening (28 days before study drug administration), Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a survey of participant health. It consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. The eight sections are: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. Each item is scored on a 0-100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100, respectively. All items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Simpson Angus Rating Scale (SAS) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The SAS rates 10 items from 0 (normal) to 4 (extreme), including gait, arm dropping, shoulder shaking, elbow rigidity, wrist rigidity, leg pendulousness, head rotation, Glabellar tap, tremor and salivation. The SAS global score is the average score (total sum of items score divided by the number of items) and ranges between 0 and 4, where the higher score denotes more severe condition of extra pyramidal symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale (ESRS) Total Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The ESRS is used to assess four types of drug-induced movement disorders administered as a questionnaire. Score range from 0 to 6 (0 is absent and 6 is extremely severe).</description>
