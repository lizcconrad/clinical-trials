    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the safety of sub-cutaneous (SC) injections of TG4040
      in non-cirrhotic, treatment-naïve patients chronically infected with HCV (genotype 1).

      Patients will be sequentially treated at an escalting dose of TG4040. All patients will be
      followed up to at least 6 months after his/her first injection. In addition, all patients
      treated at the highest dose will receive a TG4040 boost injection 6 months after the first
      injection, and will be followed up during an additional 6-month period.

      The first nine patients will be sequentially treated in three cohorts of three patients, i.e.
      they will receive 3 SC injections of TG4040 on Days 1, 8 and 15, at the dose of 10e6 pfu
      (first cohort), 10e7 pfu (second cohort), or 10e8 pfu (third cohort).

      There will be a one-week safety interval between the first injection of the patients of a
      given cohort, and a two-week safety interval between the last injection of the last patient
      of a given cohort and the first injection of the first patient of the next one. There will be
      also a two-week safety observation period after the last injection of the last patient of the
      third cohort. If the dose of 10e8 pfu does not raise safety problems, then 6 patients will be
      further enrolled, without safety intervals between patients. They will receive 3 SC
      injections of TG4040 at the dose of 10e8 pfu, on Days 1, 8 and 15.

      All patients will be followed up to at least 6 months after his/her first injection. In
      addition, all patients treated at the dose of 10e8 pfu will receive a TG4040 boost injection
      6 months after the first injection, and will be followed up during an additional 6-month
      period.

      Three additional cohorts of 9 patients will receive a boost injection either at 2, 4 or 6
      months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed consent obtained and signed;

          -  Male or female patients;

          -  With chronic hepatitis C (genotype 1) evidenced by HCV positive serology detectable
             for more than 6 months;

          -  Patients with fibrosis status graded F0 or F1 according to the METAVIR grading system;
             patients with a F2 fibrosis stage could be enrolled on a case-by-case basis after
             being sure that they have a contraindication to be treated with an IFN-based standard
             HCV treatment; patients with F3 or F4 fibrosis stage will not be enrolled; this will
             be assessed either on the liver biopsy performed less than 18 months prior to baseline
             or on a FibroTest® and a FibroScan® performed within 2 months prior to first TG4040
             injection; in case of discordant results, a liver biopsy will be performed prior to
             TG4040 treatment;;

          -  Treatment-naïve patients: patients who have never received IFN-based treatment;

          -  Patients must have compensated liver disease, with:

               -  No history of ascites, hepatic encephalopathy or bleeding from esophageal
                  varices;

               -  Laboratory tests values:

                    -  Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT)less then 2 folds the Upper Limit of
