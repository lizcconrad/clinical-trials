      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intensive dose temozolomide
      treatment alone in parallel to a combination with thalidomide in patients with recurrent
      glioblastoma after standard therapy.

      In the treatment arm A of the study it will be investigated whether or not continuous dosing
      of temozolomide may overcome alkylator resistance in patients with glioblastoma who progress
      on the 5/28 day dosing regimen.

      For treatment arm B it is postulated that the combination of thalidomide and temozolomide is
      effective with respect to time to progression and progression-free survival due to the fact
      that temozolomide and thalidomide have different mechanisms of action.

      -  Primary objectives: To determine the proportion of patients with progression- free
           survival after 6 months of intensive dose temozolomide treatment alone or in combination
           with thalidomide in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme after standard
           therapy.

        -  Secondary objectives: To assess the effects on tumor growth. To determine the time to
           disease progression. To determine the proportion of patients with progression- free
           survival. To assess the safety of intensive dose temozolomide treatment alone or in
           combination with thalidomide.

        -  Explorative evaluations: To assess health related Quality of Life. To assess cognitive
           functioning. To compare the two treatment arms in terms of efficacy and safety.
