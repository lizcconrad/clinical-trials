      The purpose of this study is to determine the best confirmed response rate of daily
      administration of the multiple receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor (including EGFR and
      VEGFR2) XL647 in subjects with NSCLC who have progressed after responding to treatment with
      either erlotinib or gefitinib.

               1. documented (radiological or clinical) progressive disease (PD) following a prior
                  response (including stable disease) to monotherapy with erlotinib or gefitinib
                  that was administered for at least 12 weeks prior to progression OR

               2. a documented T790M EGFR mutation
