      The purpose of this study is to determine clinical and urodynamic risk factors for recurrent
      urinary tract infection in 5-18 years old children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is known, that in the group of young children the most common reason of recurrent UTI is
      anatomic abnormalities, such as vesicoureteral reflux, hydronephrosis. However, not all
      recurrent UTI can be explained by anatomic abnormalities. The vast majority of school age
      children with recurrent UTI have anatomically normal urinary tract. Recent studies discuss
      about the role of behavioral and functional abnormalities (inadequate fluid intake, stool
      retention, infrequent voiding, etc.) that can predispose recurrent urinary tract infections.
      Influence of some these abnormalities for recurrent UTI is controversial. Family history,
      behavioral and functional abnormalities which predispose to urinary tract infections in
      children with normal urinary tract are neglected in most protocols of urinary tract
      infection.

      Children in this study receive a careful evaluation including complete history,
      voiding-drinking diary, bowel questionnaire, physical investigation, sonography, voiding
      cystourethrogram.

      Follow up time - 1 year. Urinalysis once a month and during each episode of fever.
