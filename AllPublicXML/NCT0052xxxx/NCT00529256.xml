  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Department of Family Practice at Michigan State University partnered with BCBSM with a
      grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to recruit primary care practices for a 3 year
      study designed to assess smoking cessation referral rates by primary care physicians in
      Michigan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two main research questions to our study: 1) Whether provider referral rates to
      smoking cessation services and quitline counseling are enhanced by comparative feedback
      profiles to individual providers and provider groups (Study 1) and 2) Whether health plan
      members who receive pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation have higher participation rates in
      smoking cessation services if they receive proactive, invitational phone calls (Study 2).
