  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to define the absorption, breakdown and excretion of a single
      dose of radiolabelled SB-649868 and its breakdown products by measuring their concentration
      in blood, urine and faeces over a 7-10 day period. &quot;Radiolabelled&quot; means that the test drug
      has a radioactive component to help us track the drug. The safety and tolerability of the
      test drug will also be assessed.
