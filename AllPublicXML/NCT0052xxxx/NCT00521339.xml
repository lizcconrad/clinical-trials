  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, open-label, study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of Apremilast in participants with
      recalcitrant plaque-type psoriasis.

      Approximately 31 participants were enrolled and received 20 mg apremilast orally BID and, in
      participants who are non-responders after 84 days of apremilast, 30 mg Apremilast over the
      course of the two study treatment phases. The study consisted of four phases: Screening Phase
      - up to 35 days, Treatment Phase of 84 days, Extension Phase of 84 days and a Observational
      Follow-up Phase of 28 days.

      During the Treatment Phase, participants received two 20 mg Apremilast capsules each day.
      Following the Treatment Phase, participants had the option to continue on treatment during
      the Extension Phase. During the Extension Phase, participants either continued to take two 20
      mg or dose escalated to two 30 mg of Apremilast each day. Participants who were considered
      responders (achieved a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI-75) at the beginning of the
      Extension Phase continued on 20 mg twice per day (BID) while the remaining participants
      received 30 mg capsules BID. The Extension Phase was introduced after some participants had
      already completed the study; therefore, there were several participants who never had the
      opportunity to continue into the Extension Phase. All participants were asked to participate
      in a 4-week post-treatment observational follow-up phase either upon completion of the study
      or upon discontinuation of study drug for those participants who terminated the study early.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Peripheral Blood T Cell, B Cell, and NK Cell Subsets at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>T cells or T lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, play a role in cell-mediated immunity. T cells are distinguished from other lymphocytes by the presence of a T-cell receptor (TCR) on the cell surface and mature in the thymus. B cells, a type of lymphocyte in the humoral immunity of the adaptive immune system can be distinguished by the presence of a protein on the B cells outer surface called a B cell receptor (BCR). This receptor protein allows a B cell to bind to a specific antigen and make antibodies against antigens [(antigen-presenting cells APCs)], and to develop into memory B cells after activation by antigen interaction. Natural Killer Cells (NK) are a type of cytotoxic lymphocyte critical to the innate immune system. Their role is analogous to that of cytotoxic T cells in the vertebrate adaptive immune response. They constitute the third kind of cells differentiated from the common lymphoid progenitor generating B and T lymphocytes and mature in the bone marrow.</description>

    <description>DLQI was the dermatology-specific quality of life (QOL) measure used for the psoriatic population. The DLQI was a validated, self-administered, 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on a participants QoL, based on recall over the past week. Domains include symptoms, feelings, daily activities, leisure, work, personal relationships, and treatment. Possible responses for each of the 10 items are: not at all, a little, a lot, and very much. Each question is rated on a scale of 0 to 3 with a total range of 0 to 30. Higher scores indicate greater impact of disease on QOL</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 was a self-administered instrument consisting of 8 multi-item scales that assess 8 health domains: 1) limitations in physical activities because of health problems; 2) limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems; 3) limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems; 4) bodily pain; 5) general mental health (psychological distress and well-being); 6) limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems; 7) vitality (energy and fatigue); and 8) general health perceptions. A higher score post-baseline is indicative of improvement in the disease state. The summary physical health score included physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain and general health. The summary mental health score included: vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and mental health. The resulting score for each subscale is then standardized, to obtain values ranging from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating a better QOL.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With at Least a 1 Point Reduction on 0 to 5 Point Scale From Baseline in Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The static Physician’s Global Assessment (sPGA) rated the investigator’s overall clinical assessment of a participants plaque thickness, erythema, and scaling on a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear, except for residual discoloration) to 5 (majority of plaques have severe thickness, erythema, and scale). To assign a sPGA score, the investigator examined all psoriatic lesions and assigned a severity score ranging from 0 to 5 for thickness, erythema, and scaling. Scores for thickness, erythema, and scaling are summed and the mean of these 3 scores equals the overall sPGA score. Decreases in sPGA correspond to clinical improvement.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The PASI score was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The total qualitative score (sum of erythema, thickness, and scaling scores) was multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant. These values for each anatomic region are summed to yield the PASI score.</description>

        <description>Time to achieve PASI-75 during treatment phase was not analyzed. The PASI was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the4 anatomic regions was scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The total qualitative score (sum of erythema, thickness, and scaling scores) was multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant. These values for each anatomic region are summed to yield the PASI score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Peripheral Blood T Cell, B Cell, and NK Cell Subsets at Week 12</title>
        <description>T cells or T lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, play a role in cell-mediated immunity. T cells are distinguished from other lymphocytes by the presence of a T-cell receptor (TCR) on the cell surface and mature in the thymus. B cells, a type of lymphocyte in the humoral immunity of the adaptive immune system can be distinguished by the presence of a protein on the B cells outer surface called a B cell receptor (BCR). This receptor protein allows a B cell to bind to a specific antigen and make antibodies against antigens [(antigen-presenting cells APCs)], and to develop into memory B cells after activation by antigen interaction. Natural Killer Cells (NK) are a type of cytotoxic lymphocyte critical to the innate immune system. Their role is analogous to that of cytotoxic T cells in the vertebrate adaptive immune response. They constitute the third kind of cells differentiated from the common lymphoid progenitor generating B and T lymphocytes and mature in the bone marrow.</description>

        <description>DLQI was the dermatology-specific quality of life (QOL) measure used for the psoriatic population. The DLQI was a validated, self-administered, 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on a participants QoL, based on recall over the past week. Domains include symptoms, feelings, daily activities, leisure, work, personal relationships, and treatment. Possible responses for each of the 10 items are: not at all, a little, a lot, and very much. Each question is rated on a scale of 0 to 3 with a total range of 0 to 30. Higher scores indicate greater impact of disease on QOL</description>

        <population>Only those with both a baseline and final/termination visit assessment were included in the analyses of change from baseline. Safety population consisted of all participants who were enrolled and received at least one dose of study medication.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-item Health Survey (SF-36) Scores, Mental and Physical Components to Week 12</title>
        <description>The SF-36 was a self-administered instrument consisting of 8 multi-item scales that assess 8 health domains: 1) limitations in physical activities because of health problems; 2) limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems; 3) limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems; 4) bodily pain; 5) general mental health (psychological distress and well-being); 6) limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems; 7) vitality (energy and fatigue); and 8) general health perceptions. A higher score post-baseline is indicative of improvement in the disease state. The summary physical health score included physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain and general health. The summary mental health score included: vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and mental health. The resulting score for each subscale is then standardized, to obtain values ranging from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating a better QOL.</description>

        <population>Safety population consisted of all participants who were enrolled and received at least one dose of study medication. If participant had a missing evaluation for any time point assessments, the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method of imputation was used.</population>
