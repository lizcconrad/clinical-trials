      The objective of this study is to compare treatment with an endograft prothesis versus
      antihypertensive treatment in patients with a dissection of the thoracic aorta.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients older than 18 years with type B aortic dissection as diagnosed by computed
      tomography or magnetic resonance angiography are randomized to either a thoracic aortic
      endoprosthesis and antihypertensive treatment, called &quot;stent grafting,&quot; or a tailored
      antihypertensive treatment, called &quot;medical treatment.&quot;

      Only patients in a clinically stable condition and without spontaneous thrombosis of the
      false lumen after 14 days of the index dissection are considered eligible for study
      inclusion.

      Primary outcome measure is all-cause mortality. Secondary outcome variables include
      conversion to stent and/or surgery, induced thrombosis of the false lumen, cardiovascular
      morbidity, aortic expansion (&gt;5 mm/y of maximum diameter including true and false lumina),
      quality of life, and length of intensive care unit and hospital stay. The study design calls
      for 136 patients to be randomized and monitored for 24 months.
