      This study provides a continued access registry for cardiac resynchronization therapy with
      defibrillation (CRT-D), which helps to resynchronize (coordinate) the rhythm of the heart by
      helping the left ventricle contract (pump blood) more uniformly, in patients with severe
      heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III or IV).

      Quality of life, adverse events and device success will be analyzed and reported.

      ICDs have been shown to increase life expectancy substantially over various drug regimens in
      patients with life threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Furthermore, large scale studies of
      cardiac resynchronization therapy in ICD-indicated heart failure patients have demonstrated
      improvements in functional capacity and quality of life, without unacceptable increases in
      morbidity or mortality.
