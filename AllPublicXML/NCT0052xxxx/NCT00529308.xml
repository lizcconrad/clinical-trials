    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the clinical efficacy of 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) applied to the supplementary motor area (SMA) in Tourette's Syndrome (TS)
      patients who have not fully responded to conventional therapies. The investigators will
      collect TMS measures of motor cortex excitability to test whether rTMS restores normal levels
      of intracortical inhibition found to be deficient in TS. The investigators will administer
      neuropsychological tests to demonstrate that SMA targeted rTMS can be administered safely
      without significant impairments of cognitive or motor functioning. The investigators
      hypothesize that:

        1. Compared to sham (placebo), active rTMS will improve symptoms of TS as assessed with the
           Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (Y-GTSS) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI).

        2. Active (but not sham) rTMS will normalize levels of motor cortex excitability, as
           reflected by increased intracortical inhibition, motor threshold, and cortical silent
           period, and by decreased intracortical facilitation, relative to pre-treatment baseline.

      This study tests the efficacy of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) in the
      treatment of Tourette's Syndrome (TS). It also examines measures of brain function to study
      the brain basis underlying TS.

      Despite major advances in the study and treatment of TS, patients often do not experience
      full remission from pharmacotherapy or behavioral therapy (Leckman 2002). rTMS is a
      non-invasive procedure that stimulates the brain using magnetic fields. This pilot study
      reported that rTMS may reduce TS symptoms (Mantovani et al., 2006). While promising, prior
      research has several limitations (e.g., relatively small sample sizes, and lack of sham
      [placebo] comparison).

      This study addresses the drawbacks of prior work, and will provide data that will help to
      determine whether rTMS can be useful for TS patients resistant to conventional therapies. 25
      outpatients with TS who have been only partially responsive to conventional therapies will be
      randomly assigned to either active low frequency (1 Hz) rTMS or sham (placebo) stimulation.
      The active or sham stimulation will be applied to the supplementary motor area (SMA) daily
      for three weeks. If rTMS will be added onto ongoing pharmacotherapy, the doses must have been
      stable for four weeks prior to study entry. The SMA was selected because of its connections
      with brain areas implicated in TS. Pilot work indicates that stimulation of SMA with low
      frequency rTMS is beneficial in TS patients. Low frequency rTMS has the added benefit of a
      better safety profile (i.e. no risk of seizure) than high frequency rTMS.

      Rating scales for symptom change will be obtained at baseline, during the rTMS course, and at
      the end of three weeks of treatment. Patients will then be offered an open-label cross-over
      phase for an additional three weeks of daily active rTMS treatment. Patients who meet
      remission criteria in either phase or response criteria following the cross-over phase will
      continue routine clinical care under the supervision of their treating psychiatrist and will
      be invited back for assessment at 1, 3, and 6 months to determine the persistence of benefit.

      Excitability of the motor cortex has been reported to be abnormal in TS, and may relate to
      dysfunction in motor pathways. We will collect measures of motor cortex excitability (with
      single and paired-pulse TMS) at baseline and after each phase to study whether changes in
      these measures may be correlated with clinical improvement.

    <measure>Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (Y-GTSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Y-GTSS is a clinician-rated scale used to assess tic severity. Motor and phonic tics are rated separately from 0 to 5 on several scales including number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference. Thus Motor and Phonic Tic scores can range from 0 to 25; the combined Total Tic Score ranges from 0 to 50. There is also an Impairment score that rates the overall burden due to tics. The Impairment scale yields a single score from 0 to 50 with higher scores indicating higher levels of overall impairment associated with tics.</description>

    <description>Motor Threshold (MT) is thought to be a measure of membrane excitability in pyramidal neurons. MT is defined as the minimum magnetic flux needed to elicit a threshold EMG response (50 µV in peak to peak amplitude) in a resting target muscle in 5 out of 10 trials using single pulse TMS administered to the contralateral primary motor cortex. MT for both right and left hand are determined, and the lowest is used to select the intensity for rTMS.</description>

By convention, 4 = No Change; scores of 5, 6, and 7 move in the direction of worsening; scores of 3, 2, and 1 correspond to &quot;Minimal Improvement,&quot; &quot;Much Improved&quot; or &quot;Very Much Improved,&quot; respectively. CGI-I ratings of &quot;Much&quot; or &quot;Very Much Improved&quot; at post-treatment are used to identify treatment responders.</description>

        <title>Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (Y-GTSS)</title>
        <description>Y-GTSS is a clinician-rated scale used to assess tic severity. Motor and phonic tics are rated separately from 0 to 5 on several scales including number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference. Thus Motor and Phonic Tic scores can range from 0 to 25; the combined Total Tic Score ranges from 0 to 50. There is also an Impairment score that rates the overall burden due to tics. The Impairment scale yields a single score from 0 to 50 with higher scores indicating higher levels of overall impairment associated with tics.</description>

        <title>Motor Cortex Excitability Normalization-Right Motor Threshold</title>
        <description>Motor Threshold (MT) is thought to be a measure of membrane excitability in pyramidal neurons. MT is defined as the minimum magnetic flux needed to elicit a threshold EMG response (50 µV in peak to peak amplitude) in a resting target muscle in 5 out of 10 trials using single pulse TMS administered to the contralateral primary motor cortex. MT for both right and left hand are determined, and the lowest is used to select the intensity for rTMS.</description>

        <description>The CGI-I is a clinician-rated scales that have been used in clinical trials for over 25 years. Clinicians rate patient improvement compared to baseline. By convention, 4 = No Change; scores of 5, 6, and 7 move in the direction of worsening; scores of 3, 2, and 1 correspond to “Minimal Improvement,” “Much Improved” or “Very Much Improved,” respectively. CGI-I ratings of “Much” or “Very Much Improved” at post-treatment are used to identify treatment responders.</description>

        <title>Motor Cortex Excitability Normalization-Left Motor Threshold</title>
        <description>Motor Threshold (MT) is thought to be a measure of membrane excitability in pyramidal neurons. MT is defined as the minimum magnetic flux needed to elicit a threshold EMG response (50 µV in peak to peak amplitude) in a resting target muscle in 5 out of 10 trials using single pulse TMS administered to the contralateral primary motor cortex. MT for both right and left hand are determined, and the lowest is used to select the intensity for rTMS.</description>

        <title>Number of Patients With &quot;Improved or Minimally Improved&quot; in Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI) Scale</title>
        <description>The CGI-I is a clinician-rated scales that have been used in clinical trials for over 25 years. Clinicians rate patient improvement compared to baseline. By convention, 4 = No Change; scores of 5, 6, and 7 move in the direction of worsening; scores of 3, 2, and 1 correspond to “Minimal Improvement,” “Much Improved” or “Very Much Improved,” respectively. CGI-I ratings of “Much” or “Very Much Improved” at post-treatment are used to identify treatment responders.</description>
