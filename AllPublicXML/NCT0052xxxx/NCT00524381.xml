      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF)
      antagonist, etanercept, on the early clinical course of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR).

      PMR is a common inflammatory disease with an unknown etiology that is characterized by
      aching, tender, and stiff proximal muscle. Some evidence suggests that TNF plays a central
      role in the pathophysiology of PMR.

      The preferred treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs) is adequate for most patients, but a
      subset of patients have a more prolonged, relapsing disease course. These patients require
      treatment with GCs for 1 to 2 years. GC related adverse events are frequent during treatment.
