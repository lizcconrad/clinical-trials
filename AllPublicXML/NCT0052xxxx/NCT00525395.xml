      Background

      Phototherapy UVB TL01 currently represents the first choice in treatment to induce the
      repigmentation of vitiligo spots. The problem though is that there are no systems or scales
      which enable an objective evaluation of the therapy, commonly known as percentage of
      repigmentation.

      Recently, a European Task Force (VETF, Vitiligo European Task Force) of experts on vitiligo,
      within the European Society of Pigmentation, has proposed a gravity classification on the
      basis of three parameters/standards - extension, progression and the level of depigmentation
      - and used to classify patients in ten European centres. The aim of the trial is to validate
      the VETF scoring system set up in relation with the therapeutic answer to the standard
      treatment for vitiligo and phototherapy.

      Leaving aside short term side effects, such as sunrush/erythema and sunburn, which are
      reversible and infrequent, the main problem with phototherapy is represented by the
      cumulative long term effects of ultraviolet rays. These can cause premature ageing of the
      skin (photoaging) and the appearance of skin cancer/neoplasia. Therefore the aim is to get
      the best results from phototherapy whilst limiting its length.

      Aims of the trial:

        1. To validate the VETF scoring system. As phototherapy is currently the only universally
           accepted treatment for vitiligo, it seems logical to test the VETF scoring system first
           to evaluate the effectiveness of phototherapy.

        2. Secondly, the target of this multicentric trial is to compare the effectiveness of two
           different phototherapy protocols; a first protocol foresees non-stop treatment for 6
           months; a second protocol foresees periods of interruption during the treatment. This
           will help to verify whether interrupting a cycle of phototherapy is useful or not.

      This interruption might make the ultraviolet rays more effective 'stimulus on the
      melanocytes', and may also reduce long term damage caused by phototherapy.
