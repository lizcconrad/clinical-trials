    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Overall Pathological Complete Response (pCR) After 26 Weeks of Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>A pCR in the breast was defined as no pathologic evidence of invasive disease (residual ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS] or lobular carcinoma in situ [LCIS] was allowed). A pCR in the axillary lymph node(s) was defined as no evidence of breast cancer cells in the lymph node (including subcapsular sinus). Overall pCR was defined as the sum of pCR in the breast and pCR in the lymph nodes. 26 weeks of therapy comprised the 2-week run-in phase, 12 weeks of treatment with FEC, and 12 weeks of treatment with Paclitaxel.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Complete Response (cCR) at 26 Weeks or at End of Treatment (EOT) or Early Withdrawal</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26 or EOT or Early withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>cCR was defined as the percentage of participants achieving either a Complete Response (CR) or a Partial Response (PR) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants (Par.) With Disease-free Survival (DFS) at the End of 5 Years From Randomization</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose date until disease progression, assessed up to a maximum of 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage is the Kaplan Meier estimate of DFS. DFS is time from randomization until disease recurrence (contralateral breast cancer; second primary cancer; progression during neo-adjuvant treatment; or death from any cause). Par. who experienced progression during treatment and were withdrawn were considered to have a DFS event at withdrawal.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With the Indicated Electrocardiogram (ECG) Status at Baseline and at EOT or Early Withdrawal</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and EOT (up to Week 26) or Early withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>12-lead ECGs were performed, and participants were classified as having normal ECG, abnormal- not clinically significant (NCS) ECG, and abnormal-clinically significant (CS) ECG per investigator opinion and reported result.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulative Number of Participants With at Least One Decrease of More Than or Equal to 20% in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) at the Indicated Time Points Compared to LVEF at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 3, 9, and 15; EOT or early withdrawal; and 3- and 6-month survival follow-up after last chemotherapy course</time_frame>
    <description>LVEF is the measurement of how much blood is being pumped out of the left ventricle of the heart (the main pumping chamber) with each contraction and is used to determine cardiac function. LVEF was measured by performing echocardiogram (ECHO). If ECHO could not be performed or if the investigator believed that it was not conclusive to evaluate LVEF, then a multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan was performed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Intra-tumoral Expression of the Indicated Proteins at Baseline and Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumor core biopsy taken at Baseline and Treatment Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Expression (exp) of biomarker proteins (prot) were analyzed to determine if individual prot levels either in the Baseline or Day 14 breast tumor biopsy specimen correlated with breast pCR. A biomarker indicates a change in exp or state of a prot that correlates with the risk or disease progression, or with the susceptibility of the disease to a given treatment. Biomarkers are characteristic biological properties that can be detected and measured in parts of the body like blood or tissue. pCR=yes: participants (par.) had breast pCR. pCR=no: par. did not have breast pCR. Prot exp values are represented as normalized, scaled values; the unit of measurement is unit-less. Raw exp values were processed as follows: background subtraction of the raw exp value, then that value divided by beta-acting exp to normalize the exp value. A Standard Z score was calculated to scale the exp value.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Cancer Stem Cells and the Correlation to Response/Non-response to Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumor core biopsy taken at Baseline and Treatment Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Stem cell data were of poor quality and thus could not be analyzed. Increases or decreases in cancer stem cells and how the changes correlated with response/non-response to treatment were to have been assessed.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Transcriptional Profiling of Total RNA and the Correlation to Response/Non-response to Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumor core biopsy taken at Baseline and Treatment Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Transcriptional data were of poor quality and thus could not be analyzed. Gene pathways that correlate with response/non-response to treatment were to have been evaluated. The unit of measure is unit less; however, the processed values would be considered normalized relative expression level.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have signed an informed consent form (ICF) and a Patient Authorization Form (HIPAA).

          -  Have histologically or cytologically confirmed ErbB2- (HER2/neu-) overexpressing
             invasive breast cancer (T2-4, N0-2).

          -  ErbB2 overexpressing breast cancer, defined as one of the following definitions:

          -  3+ staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC),

          -  a fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) result of more than six HER2 gene copies
             per nucleus

          -  a FISH ratio of more than 2.2.

          -  Have either measurable or evaluable disease.

          -  Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0-1
             (Refer to Section 11.4).

          -  Have LVEF within the institutional range of normal as measured by either
             echocardiogram (ECHO) or MUGA scans. The same modality must be used consistently
             throughout the study.

          -  Be deemed able to tolerate 8 cycles of preoperative chemotherapy, including 4 cycles
             with an anthracycline (epirubicin).

          -  Must be willing to undergo 2 mandatory core biopsies (4 passes each) after diagnosis
             to obtain tissue for biologic expression profiling. Any subject with clinically
             palpable residual disease may undergo an optional third biopsy to allow identification
             of presumed pathways of resistance to therapy. This information might be useful in
             providing the subject with options for other targeted therapies if definitive surgery
             confirms residual disease. Definitive local therapy with surgery and radiation therapy
             as indicated will be performed after completion of 12 weeks of paclitaxel-based
             chemotherapy.

          -  Are able to swallow and retain oral medication (intact pill).

          -  Are able to complete all screening assessments as outlined in the protocol.

          -  Have adequate organ function as defined in Table 4:

        Table 1 Baseline Laboratory Values

        Hematologic:

        ANC (absolute neutrophil count) &gt;1.5 x 109/L hemoglobin &gt;9 g/dL platelets &gt;75 x 109/L

        Hepatic:

        albumin &gt;2.5 g/dL serum bilirubin &lt;1.25 x ULN AST / ALT &lt;3 x ULN if no documented liver
        metastases AST / ALT &lt;3 x ULN with documented liver metastases

        Renal:

        serum creatinine &lt;2.0 mg/dL

          -  OR - calculated creatinine clearance &gt;40 mL/min

          -  Are subjects aged &gt;18 years with any menopausal status:

        Non-child-bearing potential (i.e., women with functioning ovaries who have a current
        documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy, or women who are postmenopausal)

        Child-bearing potential (i.e., women with functioning ovaries and no documented impairment
        of oviductal or uterine function that would cause sterility.) This category includes women
        with oligomenorrhea (severe), women who are perimenopausal, and young women who have begun
        to menstruate. These subjects must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and
        agree to one of the following:

        Complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of the first dose
        of study medication until 28 days after the final dose of study medication; or Consistent
        and correct use of one of the following acceptable methods of birth control: male partner
        who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry into the study and is the sole sexual
        partner for that female subject; any intrauterine device (IUD) with a documented failure
        rate of less than 1% per year; oral contraceptives (either combined or progestogen only)
        where not contraindicated for this subject population or per local practice.; or barrier
        methods, including diaphragm or condom with a spermicide.

        Please note that breast cancer subjects on this trial cannot receive injectable
        levonorgestrel or injectable progestogen due to the potential for an adverse effect of
        anti-hormonal therapies on chemotherapy administered for breast cancer [Albain, 2002].
        Progestogen may also affect the proliferative rate of endocrine-responsive tumors.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        History of uncontrolled or symptomatic angina History of arrhythmias requiring medications,
        or clinically significant Myocardial infarction &lt;6 months from study entry Uncontrolled or
        symptomatic congestive heart failure Ejection fraction below the institutional normal limit
        Any other cardiac condition, which in the opinion of the treating physician, would make
        this protocol unreasonably hazardous for the patient

          -  Are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Have received concurrent treatment with an investigational agent or participate in
             another clinical trial.

          -  Have received concurrent treatment with prohibited medications (refer to Section 5.8.2

        <description>A pCR in the breast was defined as no pathologic evidence of invasive disease (residual ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS] or lobular carcinoma in situ [LCIS] was allowed). A pCR in the axillary lymph node(s) was defined as no evidence of breast cancer cells in the lymph node (including subcapsular sinus). Overall pCR was defined as the sum of pCR in the breast and pCR in the lymph nodes. 26 weeks of therapy comprised the 2-week run-in phase, 12 weeks of treatment with FEC, and 12 weeks of treatment with Paclitaxel.</description>

        <title>Mean Intra-tumoral Expression of the Indicated Proteins at Baseline and Day 14</title>
        <description>Expression (exp) of biomarker proteins (prot) were analyzed to determine if individual prot levels either in the Baseline or Day 14 breast tumor biopsy specimen correlated with breast pCR. A biomarker indicates a change in exp or state of a prot that correlates with the risk or disease progression, or with the susceptibility of the disease to a given treatment. Biomarkers are characteristic biological properties that can be detected and measured in parts of the body like blood or tissue. pCR=yes: participants (par.) had breast pCR. pCR=no: par. did not have breast pCR. Prot exp values are represented as normalized, scaled values; the unit of measurement is unit-less. Raw exp values were processed as follows: background subtraction of the raw exp value, then that value divided by beta-acting exp to normalize the exp value. A Standard Z score was calculated to scale the exp value.</description>
