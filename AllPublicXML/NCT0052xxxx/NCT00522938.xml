  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, multiple-dose, Phase I-II study of CHR-2797
      co-administered with erlotinib in patients with histologically or pathologically confirmed
      Stage IIIB (with pleural effusion), Stage IV, or recurrent metastatic NSCLC. Throughout this
      protocol, &quot;study medication&quot; includes both CHR-2797 and erlotinib.

      This study will involve 2 distinct study phases. Study Phase A will assess safety and
      determine the MTD of the combination of CHR-2797 and erlotinib. In addition, PK profiles for
      the combination of CHR-2797 and erlotinib will be evaluated. In Study Phase B, the dose
      chosen based on the maximum tolerated dose established in Study Phase A will be administered
      in a single-arm treatment design in order to evaluate the efficacy of co-administration of
      CHR-2797 and erlotinib.

      Study Phase A:

      Maximum tolerated dose will be determined during Cycle 1. Tumor assessments will be made
      after Cycle 2 (56 days), although it is not mandatory for Phase A patients to have measurable
      disease. Patients who have satisfactory outcomes after Cycle 2 may continue treatment for up
      to a year with erlotinib 150 mg/day, and the dose of CHR-2797 they received in Study Phase A.

      Study Phase B:

      Patients will be treated with the dose of CHR-2797 selected in Study Phase A and 150mg/day
      erlotinib. Patients will receive 2 cycles of treatment (56 days) before efficacy assessment.
      Patients who have complete response, partial response, or stable disease are eligible to
      continue the study for up to a year until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If a
      patient has complete response, partial response, or stable disease at the end of the 1-year
      study period and the Investigator believes that continuation treatment would be beneficial,
      the patient may continue to be treated at the dose of CHR-2797 under a separate protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically and/or pathologically confirmed NSCLC (cytologic specimens obtained by
             brushing, washing, or needle aspiration of a defined lesion are acceptable). This
             includes the histologic subtypes of squamous cell, adeno, large cell, anaplastic cell,
             bronchioalveolar carcinoma, and NSCLC not otherwise specified (NOS). Note that tumors
             with the presence of small cell anaplastic elements are not eligible

          2. NSCLC with documentation of Stage IIIB (with pleural effusion), or Stage IV, or
             recurrent metastatic disease based on current TNM classification

          3. Disease progression or relapse following failure of platinum-based chemotherapy

          4. For Study Phase A, patients are not required to have measurable disease (according to

             measurable disease according to RECIST, defined by at least 1 lesion that can be
             accurately measured. All other lesions (e.g., pleural effusions) including small
             lesions (&lt;1 cm×1 cm by spiral CT scan) are considered non-measurable for the purposes
             of this study. Baseline tumor measurements are to be completed as close as possible
             to, but no longer than 14 days before the start of study treatment

          5. Prior radiation to the measurable site(s) of disease is not allowed, unless disease
             progression has been documented at that site since the radiotherapy. Patients who have
             had extensive radiotherapy are also excluded, because of the associated
             myelosuppressive effect

             or symptoms of brain metastases

               -  Creatinine ≤1.5×ULN or calculated creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min

         13. Female patients with reproductive potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 72 hours prior to start of study medication. All female patients of
             childbearing potential, and all male patients, must agree to use a medically
             acceptable method of contraception or agree to be abstinent throughout the treatment
             period and for 3 months after discontinuation of treatment. (See Section 4.1for more
             information.)
