  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD), also known as sickle cell anemia, is an inherited blood disease
      that can cause intense pain episodes. The purpose of this study is to collect, test, and
      archive blood and DNA samples from children and adults with SCD to study the role that genes
      play in SCD. Blood and DNA samples will be stored for use in future SCD studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SCD is an inherited blood disorder that is caused by an abnormal type of hemoglobin. Symptoms
      include anemia, infections, organ damage, and intense episodes of pain, which are called
      &quot;sickle cell crises.&quot; The Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers (CSCC) is a network of 10 centers
      that conduct research to improve health care and treatment options for people with SCD. The
      Collaborative Data Project (C-Data) is a CSCC study that is establishing a comprehensive
      database of children and adults with SCD who are receiving medical care at participating CSCC
      research centers. This study will initiate the development of a centralized laboratory that
      will collect, test, and archive blood and DNA samples from participants in the C-Data project
      for use in future SCD studies. The collection of blood and DNA samples will provide
      researchers with an important resource to better define the genetic diversity of SCD. In the
      future, genotype-phenotype correlation studies, population studies, and various other genetic
      studies may be conducted.

      This study will enroll participants taking part in the C-Data project. For this study,
      participants will undergo a blood collection. The blood sample will then be sent to a lab to
      characterize the red blood cells and hemoglobin. DNA will be analyzed to identify genes that
      influence the severity of SCD. Blood and DNA will be stored for future genetic research in
      SCD and closely related disorders.
