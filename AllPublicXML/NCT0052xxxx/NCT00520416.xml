  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endovascular repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) requires a contrast agent
      to identify the vascular anatomy and placement of the stent graft. Iodine contrast has
      traditionally been used, but has the potential to harm the kidneys. Another contrast agent is
      carbon dioxide gas. It has been proven safe to use, but the quality of the images it creates
      needs to be compared to iodine contrast. Patients in this study undergo the endovascular AAA
      repair as they normally, with the iodine contrast. At the end of surgery carbon dioxide gas
      contrast is given as an extra step. The images will be later evaluated.
