      This is a post-market medical device study. This study will compare best medical practice
      with or without adjunctive VNS Therapy in patients who are 16 years and older with
      pharmaco-resistant partial epilepsy. The Sponsor, Cyberonics, provides funding for this
      study. Patients are followed for 26 months, 24 of those months are following the initiation
      of treatment. No study sites will be permitted to enroll study subjects until Institutional
      Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) approval has been received.

      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted between February 2006 and July 2008 and was prematurely terminated by Cyberonics, Inc. due to a low enrollment rate and not as a result of a safety or efficacy signal. There were 9 screen failures out of 131 screened patients, leaving 122 patients who started the study and are described in the Participant Flow.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the Best Medical Practice With Adjunctive VNS Therapy study group or to the Best Medical Practice Without VNS Therapy study group. VNS Therapy is delivered by an implantable device similar to a pacemaker that sends mild stimulation to the left vagus nerve to help improve seizure control.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>QOLIE-89 contains 17 multi-item measures of overall quality of life. Range of values 0-100. Higher scores reflect better quality of life; lower ones, worse quality of life. Adverse Events Profile (AEP) is a 19-item scale used as a systematic measure of adverse effects from antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Scores range from 19-76; higher scores indicate high prevelance and severity of adverse events.</description>
          <population>This outcome measure includes patients from both arms, VNS + BMP (N=30) and BMP alone (N=31), with an overall QOLIE-89 at baseline and any other post baseline visit up to 12 months.

        <description>The Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI-I)is a 7 point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention Scores range from 1-7: 1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse.</description>

        <population>This study was conducted between February 2006 and July 2008 and was prematurely terminated by Cyberonics, Inc. due to a low enrollment rate and not as a result of a safety or efficacy signal.
