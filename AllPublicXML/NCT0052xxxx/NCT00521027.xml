    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the VERSAJET™ device with conventional surgical
      procedures (performed with a scalpel) in the debridement (removal of unhealthy tissue) of
      lower limb ulcers.

      It is hypothesised that the time taken to debride lower limb ulcers will be quicker with the
      VERSAJET™ device than with conventional surgical procedures.

      This is prospective, comparative clinical evaluation to investigate whether there is a
      reduction in the skin-to-skin time of the first surgical debridement with VERSAJET™, compared
      to conventional debridement techniques. Skin-to-skin time is defined as the time of incision
      to the end time of debridement (wound ready for dressing application). Conventional
      debridement is defined as scalpel plus pulse lavage.

      The purpose of this comparison is to demonstrate the resource savings which VERSAJET™ may
      provide in terms of operating room (OR) and personnel time, in addition to the potential to
      reduce the procedure, and possibly anaesthetic, time for the patient. It is envisaged that
      this information, combined with the costs associated with the procedure, will also provide
      valuable economic data to help justify the use of VERSAJET™ from a financial perspective and
      support the future commercial success of the device.

             between the tibia and foot.

          -  Patients undergoing surgical debridement of their reference ulcer in the operating
             room (OR).

          -  Patients undergoing their first surgical debridement of the reference ulcer.

             conventional debridement techniques.

          -  Patients who are able to understand the evaluation and are willing and able to provide
             written consent to participate in the evaluation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             or odour).

          -  Patients with haemophilia

          -  Patients who have been treated with topical steroids, systemic immunosuppressants
             (including corticosteroids), anticoagulants or cytotoxic chemotherapy in the last 30
             days, or who are anticipated to require such medications during the course of the
             study.
