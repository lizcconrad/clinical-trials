      To show the feasibility of face transplantation in patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most facial defects can be reconstructed with autologous tissues using standard plastic
      surgical techniques. However, when the circular facial muscles (eg. orbicularis oculi and
      orbicularis oris) are destroyed by burns, ballistic traumas, tumors, or congenital
      deformities there are no conventional surgical solutions. The study was designed following
      the advice of the French National Ethics Advisory Committee for life sciences and health
      (CCNE). The objectives are to study the feasibility and efficacy of face CTA transplantation,
      functional results, and influence on quality-of-life, as well as the management of
      immunosuppression.
