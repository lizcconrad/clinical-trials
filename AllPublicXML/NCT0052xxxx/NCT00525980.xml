  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will build upon prior, successful research on the effectiveness of an
      interactive computer disk with readable only memory (CD-ROM) for educating women about breast
      cancer and genetic risk. Prior studies found that an interactive CD-ROM for educating women
      about breast cancer risk and genetic testing was effective. The program was well received by
      lay persons and professionals. In a randomized controlled trial conducted at multiple sites,
      the CD-ROM intervention was highly effective in increasing knowledge, especially among women
      at low risk of carrying a breast cancer susceptibility gene 1/2 (BRCA1/2) mutation.

      Researchers now propose to expand the use of the interactive CD-ROM in two innovative ways.
      The overall goal of this proposal is to evaluate the program as a first-line educational
      approach for Hispanic women on the Texas-Mexico border, where educational resources about
      cancer genetics are limited. First, researchers will modify and adapt the program for a
      primarily Hispanic population, in order to make it culturally and linguistically appropriate
      to the needs of that audience.

      Second, researchers will evaluate the program as a first-line educational method among women
      with a personal or family history of breast cancer. Researchers will compare the
      effectiveness of the CD-ROM when implemented with and without the guidance of a trained
      promotora, and in comparison with standard educational materials (usual care condition).

      The specific aims of this study include:

      Aim 1: To modify the interactive CD-ROM to: a) make it culturally and linguistically
      appropriate for Hispanic women residing along the Texas-Mexico border; b) reflect current
      knowledge about breast cancer genetics; c) add a module to help women prepare to discuss
      their family history and cancer risk with a health care provider (n=50 participants).

      Aim 2: To conduct a randomized, controlled evaluation that compares the efficacy of the
      modified CD-ROM when used alone vs. when used with a promotora-assisted approach vs. standard
      written materials (n=414 participants).

      This study will test ways to help improve Hispanic women's knowledge and understanding about
      breast cancer risk and genetic testing for inherited cancer risk. These methods include
      providing printed educational materials, using an educational computer program, and using the
      computer program with the assistance of a lay health worker (a promotora).

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete a questionnaire that will ask
      about your personal health as well as your knowledge and attitudes toward cancer and genetic
      testing. After the questionnaire is completed, you will be randomly assigned (as in the roll
      of dice) to 1 of 3 study groups. One group will be asked to read educational materials.
      Another group will use an educational computer program to learn about breast cancer risk and
      genetic testing without guidance. Another group will use the computer program with the
      guidance of a promotora.

      Each of the 3 study groups should take between 30 and 60 minutes to complete.

      Immediately after participating in your assigned group, you will be asked to complete another
      questionnaire that will ask about your knowledge and attitudes toward cancer and genetic
      testing. You will also be contacted later by telephone to complete similar questionnaires at
      about 1 month and 6 months after your study visit. Some women will be asked to complete an
      additional questionnaire by telephone 1 week after reading the educational materials or the
      computer program, and researchers will ask for permission to audiotape this interview. It
      will take about 20 minutes to complete each of the questionnaires used in this study.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 414 women will take part in this study.
