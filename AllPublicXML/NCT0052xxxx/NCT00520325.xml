  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the dose of EZN-2232 that can be given to
      MBL deficient pediatric cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and safety of the study drug will also be studied.

      MBL deficient patients will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to receive a single dose of
      either 0.5 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg of intravenous rhMBL. A total of 24 patients will be treated in
      each of the rhMBL arms, (12 in the 0.5 mg/kg and 12 in the 1.0 mg/kg. All patients are to
      receive anti-infectious prophylactic supportive therapy as per institutional standards

        Inclusion Criteria: Patients must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for
        enrollment into the study:

          -  Children ages 2 to 17 receiving chemotherapy for hematological/oncological diseases.

          -  Patients must have documented MBL levels &lt;300 ng/mL in serum as evaluated in the
             screening protocol.

          -  Fever defined as an oral temperature equivalent of &gt;100.4°F (38°C).

          -  Neutropenia defined as an absolute neutrophil count ≤1,000/mm3 with the anticipation
             that the counts will fall below 500/mm3.

          -  Receiving broad spectrum antibiotics for fever and neutropenia.

          -  Patients with age-adjusted normal serum creatinine OR a creatinine clearance &gt;60
             mL/min/1.73m2.

          -  Informed consent of the patient, parent or legally authorized representative obtained
             prior to entry.

          -  Reliable and willing to make themselves available for the duration of the study and to

        Exclusion Criteria: Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria will not be
        eligible for enrollment.
