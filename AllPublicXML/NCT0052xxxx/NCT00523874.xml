      Previously our retrospective study showed that almost half of the patients with acute
      alcoholic pancreatitis had a recurrent attack in the long-term, mild pancreatitis and young
      age being risk factors for recurrence. The aim of this prospective follow-up study was aimed
      to find out the risk factors in detail.

      Patients admitted to Tampere University Hospital for first acute alcoholic pancreatitis were
      included. The diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis were epigastric pain, serum amylase
      &gt; 3 x upper normal range, elevated serum CRP and signs of acute pancreatitis in imaging.
      Other etiologies were excluded. Alcohol consumption and dependency were detected. Serum and
      fecal markers of the endocrine and exocrine function and secretin stimulated MRCP were
      studied. The patients were followed median 38 (25 - 61) months for the recurrences and had a
      follow up visit at two years to investigate trends in the alcohol consumption.
