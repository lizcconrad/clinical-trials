    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial pilot study will investigate the efficacy of different amounts
      of total treatment dosage over six weeks in 60 volunteer subjects with lumbar spinal
      stenosis. Subjects will be evenly randomized into four groups of either flexion distraction
      (FD) care or a control: Group 1 with 8 total FD treatment visits, Group 2 with 12 total FD
      treatment visits, Group 3 with 18 total FD treatment visits, or Group 4 with 8 total placebo
      control visits. The study is designed: (1) To determine the feasibility of a larger scale
      study in terms of logistics, recruitment efforts, and sample size estimations and (2) To
      determine among the three treatment groups the change in perceived pain levels and general
      functional health status at the end of six weeks of treatment and at three months post care
      as follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females at least 50 years old with lumbar spinal stenosis

          -  Impingement of the cord and/or exiting nerve roots evidenced on spine imaging studies

          -  Symptomatic with current pain in the back and/or one or both of the legs.

          -  Symptoms must have been present for at least six months with an insidious onset

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Congenital stenosis or other spine deformities such as current spinal fractures,
             spinal infections, or tumors of the spine

          -  Prior lumbar spine surgery such as laminectomy, spinal fusion, or discectomy that
             lacks stability or occurred within the past 3 months.

          -  Currently pregnant or nursing

          -  Co-morbid conditions that may preclude a person from participating in active care
             (laying prone on a treatment table or completing exercises) and outcome measures
             (Treadmill Testing, completion of questionnaires), such as severe cardiopulmonary
             disorders (i.e.: severe coronary artery disease, recent myocardial infarction, or
             vascular claudication), neuromusculoskeletal disorders (i.e.: disabling hip or knee
             arthritis; trochanteric bursitis; piriformis syndrome; need for assisted ambulation),
             or brain disorders (i.e.: dementia or Alzheimer's Disease)

          -  Active conservative care such as physical therapy or chiropractic care for lumbar
             stenosis (excluding the use of oral medications or daily at-home exercises for general
             well-being)

          -  Cauda equina symptoms (i.e.: perianal numbness; loss of bowel and/or bladder control)
