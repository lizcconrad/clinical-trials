  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen
      are commonly used oral analgesics in emergency departments (ED) not only in Hong Kong but
      throughout the world. There are no large-scale (n&gt;100), prospective, randomised studies
      comparing paracetamol with ibuprofen in the management of acute soft tissue injury.

      As paracetamol is cheaper than most NSAIDs, may be as effective in the management of acute
      pain and possibly with fewer adverse effects, a large-scale, randomised, controlled trial is
      needed to answer questions of relative analgesic efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness.
      Previous comparative studies on NSAIDS have been done in this unit and have suggested
      equivalence between two NSAIDs and paracetamol, but numbers were small and drug doses were
      modest.

      Objective: To compare the efficacy, safety and cost between oral ibuprofen and paracetamol in
      pain control for acute soft tissue injuries in an ED setting

      Design: Prospective, double-blind, randomised controlled trial with three arms: oral
      paracetamol with placebo; oral ibuprofen with placebo; paracetamol and ibuprofen in
      combination

      Participants: 783 subjects having sustained isolated soft tissue limb injury without
      significant fracture presenting to the ED of Prince of Wales Hospital

      Main outcome measures: Pain relief profiles of paracetamol, ibuprofen and the combination of
      both; adverse effect profiles of paracetamol, ibuprofen and the combination of both; overall
      cost effectiveness of paracetamol, ibuprofen and the combination of both from the perspective
      of the healthcare provider
