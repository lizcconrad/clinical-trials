      Part A: To compare the glucose and insulin responses of a standard tube feeding product to
      that of a diabetes-specific tube feeding product in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

      Part B: To compare the glucose response of a standard tube feeding product to that of a
      diabetes-specific tube feeding product when consumed by individuals with type 2 diabetes as a
      sole source of nutrition.
