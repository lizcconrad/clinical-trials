  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive subcortical and cortical neuronal
      degeneration. AD patients differ in the time course of neuronal degeneration and accompanying
      cognitive decline.

      With recent advances in MR imaging, including optimized data acquisition and processing
      techniques, tools that are especially well suited for tracking long-term pathological changes
      as well as drug treatment effects have become available. In addition to structural imaging,
      new acquisition and analysis techniques have been developed to determine integrity of
      subcortical fiber tracts in vivo.

      In the present project we propose to determine predictors of disease progression and
      treatment response and investigate potential treatment effects on structural disease
      progression, covering the continuum from axonal degeneration to cortical neuronal loss taking
      advantage of recent advances in MRI acquisition and analysis techniques.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The outlined project will provide data to determine the value of cortical and subcortical
      volumetric and diffusion markers of neuronal degeneration to predict disease progression and
      response to (acetyl-)cholinergic treatment with Galantamine (Reminyl®). Furthermore, analysis
      of longitudinal MRI data in respect to cortical and subcortical atrophy and fiber
      degeneration will provide an estimate of the potential of new MRI analysis techniques to
      determine effects of (acetyl-)cholinergic treatment on rates of disease progression. Finally,
      the proposed study will allow determining the potential value of a new MRI technique,
      diffusion tensor imaging, to show the morphological correlate of cortical disconnection in AD
      and to map progression and treatment related effects on subcortical fiber tract integrity in
      AD.

      The major scientific value of this project is the combined description of the effect of
      Galantamine (Reminyl®) on disease progression on the structural level of analysis in AD. The
      data from this project may help to identify predictors of treatment response and to elucidate
      the mechanisms of drug action of Galantamine (Reminyl®) in AD.

             of Neurological and Communicative Disease and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer's
             Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA) for the diagnosis of clinically
             probable AD

             or neuroinflammatory disorders. No evidence for acute or unstable medical condition.

          -  no risk factors of hypertension, cardiac disease (e.g. angina pectoris, congestive
             heart failure, right bundle branch block, or arrhythmias), diabetes mellitus (stable
