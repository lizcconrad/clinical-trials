  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acrochordon, or soft fibroma, is a common benign skin tumor which is generally regarded as a
      sign of cutaneous aging or as a reaction to friction since it occurs in the intertriginous
      areas. Recent studies have shown the presence of human papillomaviruses, especially the
      mucosal types, on some of the intertriginous lesions. This study is to analyze the different
      clinical presentations of acrochordon and correlate them with pathologic and molecular human
      papillomavirus findings. Further goal is to improve the ability to differentiate acrochordon
      and its possible prevention and treatment. Also, it may have an implication on the
      transmission and prevention of cervical carcinoma.

    <textblock>
      Acrochordon, also called soft fibroma, skin tag or fibroepithelial polyp, is a common
      cutaneous disorder characterized by a polypoid growth composed of fibroblasts in a loose
      collagenous stroma, sometimes with proliferation of blood vessels. They appear as soft,
      skin-colored or light brownish skin tumors. Three types of lesions may occur, (1) multiple
      small, furrowed papules, especially on the neck and in the axillae, (2) single or multiple
      filiform smooth growths in various locations, and (3) solitary bag-like pedunculated growth,
      seen most commonly on the lower trunk. Most regard them as a sign of cutaneous aging.

      The presence of human papillomaviruses (HPVs), especially the mucosal types, has been
      demonstrated in acrochordon. Our previous experience on HPV typing of skin tags also confirms
      this finding. Though HPV is a ubiquitous virus, the presence of mucosal type HPV in
      non-mucosal sites is exceptional. This investigation is trying to correlate the
      clinicopathological and HPV molecular typing of acrochordons. A better understanding of
      acrochordon and its relation to HPV infection may improve the ability to prevent and treat.
