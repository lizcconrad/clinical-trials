  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the trial is to compare Invasive Disease-Free Survival (IDFS) of
      patients randomised to treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy alone or to adjuvant chemotherapy
      with 1 year of bevacizumab.

      The secondary objectives of this trial are to:

        -  compare Overall Survival (OS), Breast Cancer-Free Interval (BCFI), Disease- Free
           Survival (DFS) and Distant Disease-Free Survival (DDFS) of patients randomised to
           treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy alone or to adjuvant chemotherapy in combination
           with 1 year of bevacizumab

        -  evaluate the safety and tolerability of bevacizumab

      An exploratory sub-study (not reported here) was to identify biomarkers (from tumour or
      serum) predictive of toxicity and for the level of benefit from the addition of bevacizumab
      to standard adjuvant systemic treatment.

          <title>Bevacizumab and Chemotherapy</title>
          <description>Participants randomized to receive bevacizumab and chemotherapy.
For these patients, bevacizumab was given in combination with chemotherapy at a dose of 5 mg/kg/week equivalent using 1 of 3 different scheduling options depending on the schedule of the adjuvant chemotherapy selected. After completing chemotherapy + bevacizumab (treatment period 1), patients in this arm received bevacizumab monotherapy up to a total duration of 1 year (treatment period 2).
At the end of treatment (i.e., after approximately 55 weeks), patients were followed up until the end of the study.</description>

        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>Chemotherapy</title>
          <description>Participants randomized to receive chemotherapy alone.
For patients randomized to the chemotherapy alone arm, investigators could select from one of three chemotherapy regimens. After completing chemotherapy (treatment period 1) patients entered a post-treatment surveillance period for the remainder of the first year after randomization (treatment period 2).
At the end of treatment (i.e., after approximately 55 weeks), patients were followed up until the end of the study.</description>

        <description>An adverse event was considered any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Preexisting conditions that worsened during the study were reported as adverse events.
A serious adverse event is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: results in death, is Life-Threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant.</description>
