  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will study the effect of supplementation of 1 L blueberry juice to participants with at
      least one elevated cardiovasculat risk factor.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with at leat one elevated cardiovacsular risk factor, as defined as systolic
      blood pressure between 140 and 165 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 105 mmHg,
      low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ≥3.4 mmol/L, total/high density lipoprotein (HDL)
      cholesterol ratio &gt;4 or smoking a minimum of 3 cigarettes daily.

      Subjects were randomized to two groups, where the blueberry group were supplemented with 1 L
      blueberry juice per day for four weeks. The control group consumed an equal amount of water.

      Clinical markers, as well as biomarkers of antioxidant status, oxidative stress status and
      inflammation were measured in blood samples before amd after the intervention period.
