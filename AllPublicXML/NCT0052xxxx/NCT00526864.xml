      Total 7 institutions will be recruited i.e. Clinical Infectious Disease Research Unit
      Department of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Tropical Medicine Mahidol
      University,Bamrasnaradura Infectious Disease Institute

      ,Pramonkutklao Hospital,Rajavithi Hospital,NationalCancerInstitute,Institute of
      Dermatology,Raj Pracha Samasai Institute

      OBJECTIVES

        -  Measure the burden of illness due to herpes zoster (Zoster) and post-herpetic neuralgia
           (PHN) (severity and duration);

        -  Assess the quality of life (QoL) and quality adjusted life years (QALY) lost due to
           Zoster and PHN;

        -  Describe health care resource utilization associated with Zoster and PHN;

        -  Describe the direct and indirect costs per case of Zoster and PHN

      This will be a prospective cohort study of patients presenting with Zoster rash in 7
      specialized institutions in Thailand.

      Subjects will be entered in the cohort at the time of presentation with Zoster rash. After
      the baseline assessment (day 0) that will be conducted at the investigator's office there
      will be 4 assessments (prospective part of the study) that will be conducted at day 7, month
      1, month 3 and month 6.

      We expect that there will be approximately 150 patients included in the study cohort. Cohort
      assembly will take place between April 2007 and October 2007.

      The study will be conducted in 3 groups

      Eligible patients for each group will include

        -  Group A: Both male and female patients ≥ 50 years of age with Zoster rash.

        -  Group B: Both HIV infected male and female patients ≥ 20 years of age with Zoster rash.

        -  Group C: Both Oncology male and female patients ≥ 20 years of age who on chemotherapy
           with Zoster rash.

      Key exclusion criteria includes patient who refuses to sign informed consent.
