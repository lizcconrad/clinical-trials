  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I trial in individuals who have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes within
      the previous 3-48 months. The study is testing whether two immune system modifying drugs are
      safe when used in combination and if they have immune altering effects that indicate they can
      halt the progression of type 1 diabetes progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the time of diagnosis with type 1 diabetes, 15-40% of beta cells may remain active and
      healthy in the pancreas, capable of producing insulin the body needs to regulate blood
      glucose levels. Because even small amounts of natural insulin production can decrease the
      long term effects of diabetes, it is essential that these cells are preserved.

      This trial will test whether a combination of the drugs Proleukin (IL-2) and Rapamune
      (sirolimus) may be safely administered to recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients and
      whether it causes changes to the immune system that can halt the autoimmune destruction of
      the remaining beta cells. This drug combination has been found to be effective for long-term
      diabetes prevention in mouse models of type 1 diabetes.

      This study is a phase I study for individuals 18-45 years of age who have been diagnosed with
      type 1 diabetes in the past 3-48 months. All participants will be treated with Proleukin
      (administered subcutaneously 3x per week) for 28 days and Rapamune (taken orally, daily) for
      12 weeks. The study will last for 12 months, with additional follow-up of 24 months. The
      majority of study visits occur within the first 6 months. Mixed meal tolerance tests, in
      which participants take a milkshake-like drink and have blood sampled over a 2 or 4-hour
      period, will take place during an initial screening visit and three additional times during
      the first year. All participants will also receive intensive diabetes management designed to
      maintain stable blood glucose levels.
