  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, it will be studied whether early addition of the long acting insulin analogue
      Glargine is capable of increasing the number and differentiation of endothelial progenitor
      cells (EPC) in patients with type 2 diabetes, which can be seen as a marker of vascular
      regenerative potential and cardiovascular risk. In addition, the effect of Glargine on
      microvascular function will be studied. This will be done using laser Doppler measurements of
      the skin; in addition, MRI of the heart will be performed which is capable of quantifying the
      perfusion reserve of the myocardium and additional functional aspects of ventricular
      function. A beneficial effect of early addition of bedtime Glargine on EPC and vascular as
      well as myocardial function in this study might argue for a change in the therapeutic
      approach in type 2 diabetes and possibly improve the cardiovascular outcome in patients
      affected.
