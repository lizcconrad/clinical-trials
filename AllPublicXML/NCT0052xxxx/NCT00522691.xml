  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) is an emerging treatment for patients with severe fecal
      incontinence. The test stimulation is minimally invasive, associated to low morbidity and
      relatively cheap. On the contrary, implantation of the definite stimulator is related to
      higher morbidity and considerable costs. A careful patent selection for definite implantation
      is therefore crucial. However, indication for implantation is actually based only on the
      subjective criteria reported in the patientsÂ´ diary only. Patients and care providers are
      likely to overestimate the real effect of SNS leading to an unjustified overuse of this
      expensive device. It is therefore necessary to evaluate real efficacy of SNS during the
      testing phase in a unbiased setting in order to avoid unnecessary morbidity and costs.

    <textblock>
      Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) is an emerging treatment for patients with severe faecal
      incontinence when conservative measures fail and surgical repair is not indicated. In a
      minimally-invasive approach and under local anaesthesia, an electrode is placed around sacral
      nerve root S2-4 and electrical stimulation is applied to the sacral spinal nerves.
      Effectiveness of SNS is definitively not only explained by placebo effect but the
      pathophysiologic mechanisms remain unclear. Suggested pathways include modulation of afferent
      nerve fibres and direct stimulation of the pelvic floor and anal sphincter muscle. After
      placement of the electrode, the patient is stimulated by an external stimulator for 1-3
      weeks. During this period, the patient documents the number of faecal incontinence episodes
      or urgencies in a symptom diary. By convention, indication for permanent stimulation is based
      on a 50% reduction in the number of episodes. After a successful testing period, the
      permanent stimulator is implanted, generally in the upper gluteal region.

      Previous studies report success rates up to 80%. The only randomized trial with a proper
      sample size evaluated the efficacy of SNS after definite implantation. In this study, 63% of
      the patients felt improved during the placebo period and might not really benefit from the
      device. The real success rate of SNS is therefore likely to be considerably lower. Efficacy
      of SNS during the testing phase has never been assessed in a blinded randomized study.
