      The purpose of this study is to compare various symptoms and signs of dry-eye as well as
      stratify characteristics of the tear film in a group of dry-eyed individuals in comparison to
      a group of non-dry-eyed people. Dry-eye is a condition that significantly impacts the quality
      of life of the sufferer. These are people who are predominantly female and in the older age
      groups. Determining what characterises a person with dry-eyes is of importance to
      understanding the disease process.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye is a multifactorial disease that results in a wide variety of signs and symptoms,
      which are often poorly correlated. Recent work has shown that not only are there changes in
      the composition of the tear film (including cytokines and the presence of various mucin
      species and tear film proteins) but also quantifiable changes in both the structure and
      function of the ocular surface, including corneal sensitivity and the appearance of the
      epithelial cells and the sub-basal neural network. To-date, no published study has attempted
      to correlate various clinical and morphological changes found in dry eye with tear film and
      ocular surface biomarkers.

          2. Is post-menopausal, with menses ceasing more than 12 months ago.

          3. Has moderate or severe dry eye symptoms based on dry eye questionnaire and half of the
             time wants to use eye drops for dry eye symptoms (dry eye group)

          4. Has read, understood and signed an information consent letter.

          5. Is willing and able to follow instructions and maintain the appointment schedule.

             affecting ocular health.

          4. Is using any systemic or topical medications (other than eye drops for dry eye
             symptoms) that may affect ocular health and neuroendocrine system function.
