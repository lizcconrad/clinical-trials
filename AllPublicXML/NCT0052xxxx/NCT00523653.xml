    <textblock>
      Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) affects about 200,000 Canadians. Eighty percent of these cases
      are of unclear cause, often occuring in families. We believe that mutations in specific
      already-identified genes contribute to DCM in Quebec and that certain mutations may account
      for a significant proportion of cases due to the well-documented &quot;founder effect&quot;. Two
      hundred patients with DCM followed in our Heart Function Clinic will be approached for one
      blood sample at their routine clinic visit to test this hypothesis. The samples will be
      tested in the Laboratory of Cardiovascular Genetics at the Royal Victoria Hospital.
