  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, there is a paucity of research focusing on maternal breastfeeding goals, how these
      goals may change after an unexpected event such as a preterm birth, and how mothers of ill
      and preterm infants define breastfeeding success. No studies were identified that focused
      exclusively on the breastfeeding goals of mothers of hospitalized preterm infants

      The purpose of this study is to answer the following research questions: 1) What are the
      breastfeeding goals of mothers with preterm infants in the NICU? and 2) What are mothers'
      perceptions of facilitators and barriers to meeting their breastfeeding goals in the NICU?

      As the objective of this study is to describe the breastfeeding goals of mothers and their
      perceptions of breastfeeding support in the NICU, this study will follow a descriptive,
      qualitative design. Mothers of preterm newborns in the Royal Victoria Hospital will
      participate in a semi-structured interview about their breastfeeding goals and what they
      perceived to be facilitators and barriers to achieving their intended goals. During the
      interviews, the mothers will be asked a set of socio-demographic questions, open-ended
      questions about their breastfeeding goals, and open-ended questions about their perceptions
      of barriers and facilitators to meeting these goals in the NICU Participants may also receive
      one follow-up phone call to clarify their responses to the questions or to validate the
      information obtained from the interview.
