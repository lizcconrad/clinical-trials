      The objective of this study is to conduct a trial in the spirit of providing as much as
      possible the benefit of PG2 treatment to eligible patients and to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of PG2 for relieving fatigue among advanced cancer patients who are under standard
      palliative care (SPC) at hospice setting and have no further curative options available.
      Patient's fatigue status, to be measured by the Brief Fatigue Inventory-Taiwanese Form
      (BFI-T), will be the primary endpoint. The fatigue improvement response rate among patients
      between two study arms will then be compared as the basis for efficacy evaluation at the end
      of the first treatment cycle, and will be the primary endpoint. Other endpoints, the fatigue
      improvement response rate and the mean fatigue scores change from baseline among patients
      within and between cycles will be included in the secondary efficacy endpoints, and will be
      compared between two study arms. Patients' quality of sleep, appetite, pain, fatigue, nausea,
      vomiting and global quality of life (QoL) will be also measured by 11 questions (SS11) from
      EORTC QLQ-C30 for secondary endpoint evaluation. The other secondary endpoints include
      Karnofsky performance scores, and weight change and its related c-reactive protein level of
      the patients.

      * BFI-T (Brief Fatigue Inventory - Taiwan) : The BFI is a 9-item self-administered
      questionnaire which was developed by MD Anderson Cancer Center offers assessing levels of
      fatigue. Subjects rate each item based on how they felt for the preceding week using a 1-10
      numeric rating scale (10 being the most unfavorable response). The single construct of the
      BFI allows for the mean of the nine items to be the overall score. The score is categorized
      as mild (1-3), moderate (4-6), and severe (7-10). The scale is a reliable instrument that
      correlates highly with similar fatigue and performance status measures.

      This is a trial to evaluate use of PG2 for fatigue improvement in advanced cancer patients
      who are under standard palliative care at hospice setting and have no further curative
      options available. Only patients who give consent to participate in this study and meet all
      other inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible to enroll into this study. All
      patients will continue the standard palliative care (SPC) during this study.

      The main aim of this trial is to compare improvement of patient's fatigue status between
      patients with or without PG2 treatment. Patient's fatigue status will be assessed by the
      Brief Fatigue Inventory-Taiwanese (BFI-T) Form. Each patient's fatigue improvement response
      will be defined as an improvement in the mean fatigue scores by at least 10% from baseline.
      Other quality of life parameters will be measured by the 11 questions (SS11) of the EORTC
      QLQ-C30 and by Karnofsky performance scale. Patient's weight change and its related
      c-reactive protein will be followed. There are two study arms in this trial: 1) the PG2 plus
      SPC arm; and 2) the Placebo plus SPC arm.
