      The aim of this study is to determine if 3 monthly infusions of zoledronic acid, given over
      one year, improves the bone mineral density in osteoporotic patients undergoing androgen
      deprivation therapy for prostate cancer

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Androgen Deprivation Therapy is the mainstay of treatment for advanced prostate cancer.
      However they are associated with accelerated bone loss, osteoporosis and fractures. Previous
      studied looking at the use of zoledronic acid have predominantly studied men with a normal or
      osteopenic bone mineral density. However, it has been shown that upto 40% of men presenting
      with prostate cancer have osteoporosis and it is these who are at most risk of osteoporotic
      fractures. Our aim was to evaluate the efficiency of zoledronic acid in 2 groups of
      osteoporotic patients, those undergoing treatment with LHRH agonists and with
      antiandrogens.Peripheral and axial bone densitometry will be used to measure percentage
      changes in bone mineral density over 3 years. The first year with the patients on LHRH or
      antiandrogen, the second year continuing with their androgen deprivation therapy and
      zoledronic acid. Then bone mineral density will be measured one year following the last
      infusion of zoledronic acid to ascertain the optimum frequency of administration.

      The study will also involve monitoring serum and urine bone turnover markers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with locally advanced prostate cancer who progress from normal/ osteopenic
             bone mineral density to osteoporosis while on LHRH agonists (LHRH Group). Also
             patients who have been commenced on Bicalutamide due to osteoporosis at presentation
             (Bicalutamide Group)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with elevated prostate specific antigen, any illness or medication that would
             affect bone and mineral metabolism, previous bisphosphonate treatment, severe hepatic
             or renal insufficiency.
