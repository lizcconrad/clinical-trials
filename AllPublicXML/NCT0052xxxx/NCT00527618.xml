  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the effect of high-dose valacyclovir (1 gram orally twice daily) versus
      standard-dose acyclovir (400 mg orally twice daily) on the frequency of genital HSV
      reactivation and on plasma HIV-1 levels among HSV-2/HIV-1 co-infected individuals. The
      investigators hypothesize that high-dose valacyclovir will result in greater reduction in
      plasma HIV-1 and genital HSV reactivation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to conduct a randomized, open-label, cross-over study of 38 individuals who are
      HIV-1 seropositive and HSV-2 seropositive. Both men and women will be recruited for the
      study. Participants must not be on antiretroviral therapy and must not be planning to
      initiate antiretroviral therapy during the anticipated study period. Participants will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive acyclovir 400 mg twice daily or valacyclovir 1000 mg twice daily.
      After 12 weeks on the initial treatment, each participant will be crossed over to the
      alternative treatment arm for 12 weeks. The treatment periods will be separated by a 2-week
      washout period. During the first four weeks of each treatment period (i.e. weeks 1-4 and
      weeks 15-18), participants will provide self-collected genital swabs daily for HSV DNA
      quantification. Each week during the entire study period plasma samples will be collected
      from participants for HIV-1 RNA quantification.

      Open-label acyclovir and valacyclovir will be used for this trial, as the primary outcome
      measures (genital HSV and plasma HIV-1) are unlikely to be influenced by knowledge of
      treatment assignment. However, laboratory staff performing plasma HIV-1 and genital HSV
      measurements will not be aware of treatment assignment.

      Optional Sub-Study A: Sub-study A will be offered to study participants. The purpose of
      sub-study A is to measure the effect of valacyclovir twice daily on plasma HIV-1 replication.

    <description>Weekly measurements of plasma HIV-1 RNA on each drug were compared. The primary analysis was of the average difference in plasma HIV-1 RNA on valacyclovir and acyclovir as determined by a linear mixed model. The median of the average per-participant plasma HIV-1 RNA levels on valacyclovir and valacyclovir is also listed.</description>

          <title>The Effect of Valacyclovir 1 g Twice Daily Compared With Acyclovir 400 mg Twice Daily on the Quantity of Genital HSV Detected During Shedding Episodes.</title>
          <description>HSV DNA was quantitated from daily self-collected genital swabs for the four weeks of each drug intervention. The quantity of genital HSV DNA present, when HSV DNA was detected, was compared.</description>
          <population>Of the 34 participants who were randomized, 6 participants did not contribute to both arms of the study. The final analysis set therefore included 28 participants.</population>
