  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of Zometa (zoledronic acid, 1
      mg per week versus 4 mg every four weeks) on the circulating vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF) levels in breast cancer patients with bone metastases. Sixty patients will be
      randomized into two groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The administration of Zometa in short intervals has been implied to be more potent in
      maximizing its antitumor and antiangiogenesis effects, while dosing every four weeks is an
      appropriate strategy for the prevention and management of bone metastases. This study was
      designed to explore the relationship between dosing of Zometa and level of circulating VEGF.
