    <textblock>
      Obese patients with type 2 diabetes often fail to loose weight and thus do not succeed in
      improving their sugar and lipid profiles and remain at high risk for diabetes complications

      The study enrolled 259 obese diabetic patients attending HMO clinics in central Israel. Over
      a 6 month period the participants met with a dietitian every fortnight and attended group
      lectures every 2 months.

      The objective of this intervention was to compare three dietary intervention along with close
      monitoring of the patients by dietitians, regarding blood lipid and sugar balance as well as
      weight loss. The three diets are the American Diabetes Association (ADA) diet from 2003; a
      diet containing low glycemic index carbohydrate otherwise similar to the ADA diet; and a low
      glycemic index diet with more fat than the other 2 diets with high proportion of
      mono-unsaturated fatty acids.

      Patients were individually randomized to receive one of the three diets. Among the measures
      obtained every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months thereafter are weight, fasting
      insulin and glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, blood and urine chemistry profiles and lipid
      profile.

MUFA diet included only low glycemic index carbohydrates. The diet consisted of 35% carbohydrates and 45% fat (50% of them were mono-unsaturated fatty acids [MUFA]). Participants were advised to eat 4-6 meals per day according to their lifestyle and to participate in 30-45 min of aerobic activity at least 3 days a week.</description>
