  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this historical-controlled trial is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety
      of conversion to Lacosamide monotherapy in subjects with Partial-onset Seizures who are
      withdrawn from 1 to 2 marketed antiepileptic drugs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sudden unexplained death in epilepsy have been reported in epilepsy patients. A causal
      relationship with the administration of antiepileptic drugs has not been established. The
      most important known risk factor for sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the
      occurrence and frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). Twenty-seven patients
      with only GTCS were enrolled in the conversion to monotherapy study. In this study, two
      patients with only GTCS had SUDEP. Due to the potential increased risk of SUDEP in patients
      with only GTCS in a trial setting, the 1 remaining patient with only GTCS was withdrawn from
      this study.

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects (Using Kaplan-Meier) Who Are Identified As Meeting At Least 1 Pre-defined Exit Criteria By Day 112 Relative To The Start of Withdrawal of Background Antiepileptic Drug(s)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 Weeks Maintenance Period (approximately 112 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Pre-defined exit criteria:
A 2-fold or greater increase in average monthly (28-day) partial seizure frequency (motor and non-motor) compared to average monthly partial seizure frequency (motor and non-motor) during the Baseline Phase
A 2-fold or greater increase in consecutive 2-day partial seizure frequency (motor and non-motor) versus the highest consecutive 2-day partial seizure frequency (motor and non-motor) that occurred during the Baseline Phase.
Note: if the highest consecutive 2-day partial seizure frequency during the Baseline Phase is 1, a 2-day partial seizure frequency of ≥3 is required to meet this exit criterion
Occurrence of a single generalized tonic-clonic seizure if none had occurred in the 6 months prior to randomization
A prolongation or worsening of overall seizure duration, frequency, type or pattern considered by the investigator as serious enough to warrant trial discontinuation
Status epilepticus, or new onset of serial/cluster seizures</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Occurrence of Any Exit Event During The Maintenance Period</measure>
    <time_frame>16 Weeks Maintenance Period (approximately 112 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The time to first occurrence (days) of any exit event was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods and was based on the time from the start of the Maintenance Phase to the earliest date a subject met an exit criterion. Subjects who discontinued during the Maintenance Phase due to non-exit criteria reasons or who completed the Maintenance Phase before 112 days and did not meet an exit criterion were censored as of the last Maintenance Phase dose date. Subjects completing 112 days in the Maintenance Phase were censored as of Day 112.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects (Using Kaplan-Meier) Who Are Identified as Meeting at Least 1 Pre-defined Exit Criteria by Day 112, Withdrew Due to Adverse Event (AE) or Withdrew Due to Lack of Efficacy During The Maintenance Period</measure>
    <time_frame>16 Weeks Maintenance Period (approximately 112 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were classified as having an exit event if they experienced at least 1 of the following events during the Maintenance Phase as of Day 112:
Met at least 1 exit criterion based on the calculations applied for the Primary Efficacy Analysis
Withdrawal due to AE with onset during the Maintenance Phase
Withdrew prematurely due to lack of efficacy during the Maintenance Phase
The date the subject experienced the event was set to the earliest date the subject met an exit criterion or the date of the last Maintenance Phase dose for subjects not meeting an exit criterion but withdrawing due to an AE or lack of efficacy.
The secondary analysis is only conducted on the Lacosamide 400 mg/day group.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Monotherapy Treatment During the Monotherapy Phase of The Maintenance Period (Visit 9 - Visit 12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 9 - Visit 12 (approximately 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Days on Monotherapy Treatment were defined as the number of days during the Monotherapy Phase when the subject took Lacosamide (LCM) only (ie, the total number of days exposed to LCM during the Monotherapy Phase minus any days where a concomitant or rescue Anti-epileptic Drug (AED) was taken by the subject). The days on Monotherapy Treatment did not need to be consecutive.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) From Baseline To Last Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Last Visit (approximately 27 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>For the assessment of the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC), the investigator should provide his/her assessment of the subject's clinical status, compared to Baseline, including an evaluation of seizure frequency and intensity, the occurrence of AEs, and subject's functional status. He was asked the following:Please check the number that best describes the subject's condition over the past 4 weeks compared to Baseline:
Very much improved

A 2-fold or greater increase in average monthly (28-day) partial seizure frequency (motor and non-motor) compared to average monthly partial seizure frequency (motor and non-motor) during the Baseline Phase
A 2-fold or greater increase in consecutive 2-day partial seizure frequency (motor and non-motor) versus the highest consecutive 2-day partial seizure frequency (motor and non-motor) that occurred during the Baseline Phase.
Note: if the highest consecutive 2-day partial seizure frequency during the Baseline Phase is 1, a 2-day partial seizure frequency of ≥3 is required to meet this exit criterion
Occurrence of a single generalized tonic-clonic seizure if none had occurred in the 6 months prior to randomization
A prolongation or worsening of overall seizure duration, frequency, type or pattern considered by the investigator as serious enough to warrant trial discontinuation

Lacosamide : 50 mg and 100 mg tablets provided for 200 mg twice daily dosing for up to 20 weeks.
This study had a single inferential test of the primary efficacy variable for the LCM 400 mg/day treatment arm which was to be compared to an external historical control. As such, no adjustment for multiplicity was required. Additional analyses of the primary efficacy variable for the LCM 400 mg/day and LCM 300 mg/day treatment arms was for exploratory or supportive purposes only. The analysis of the LCM 300 mg/day arm is exploratory due to the 3:1 randomization ratio. Therefore the LCM 300 mg/day arm is not reported for this Outcome Measure.</description>

        <description>The time to first occurrence (days) of any exit event was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods and was based on the time from the start of the Maintenance Phase to the earliest date a subject met an exit criterion. Subjects who discontinued during the Maintenance Phase due to non-exit criteria reasons or who completed the Maintenance Phase before 112 days and did not meet an exit criterion were censored as of the last Maintenance Phase dose date. Subjects completing 112 days in the Maintenance Phase were censored as of Day 112.</description>

        <description>Subjects were classified as having an exit event if they experienced at least 1 of the following events during the Maintenance Phase as of Day 112:
Met at least 1 exit criterion based on the calculations applied for the Primary Efficacy Analysis
Withdrawal due to AE with onset during the Maintenance Phase
Withdrew prematurely due to lack of efficacy during the Maintenance Phase
The date the subject experienced the event was set to the earliest date the subject met an exit criterion or the date of the last Maintenance Phase dose for subjects not meeting an exit criterion but withdrawing due to an AE or lack of efficacy.
The secondary analysis is only conducted on the Lacosamide 400 mg/day group.</description>

This study had a single inferential test of the primary efficacy variable for the LCM 400 mg/day treatment arm which was to be compared to an external historical control. As such, no adjustment for multiplicity was required. Additional analyses of the primary efficacy variable for the LCM 400 mg/day and LCM 300mg/day treatment arms was for exploratory or supportive purposes only. The analysis of the LCM 300 mg/day arm is exploratory due to the 3 :1 randomization ratio. Therefore the LCM 300 mg/day arm is not reported for this Outcome Measure.</description>
