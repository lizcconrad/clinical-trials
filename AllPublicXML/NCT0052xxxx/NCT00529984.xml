      STUDY OBJECTIVES

        1. The primary objective of this protocol is to determine the safety of immunization with
           CEA(6D) VRP in patients with advanced or metastatic CEA expressing malignancies.

        2. The secondary objectives are to evaluate CEA-specific immune response to the
           immunizations and obtain preliminary data on response rate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CEA represents an attractive target antigen for immunotherapy since it is over expressed in
      nearly all colorectal cancers and pancreatic cancers, and is also expressed by some lung and
      breast cancers, and uncommon tumors such as medullary thyroid cancer, but is not expressed in
      other cells of the body except for low-level expression in gastrointestinal epithelium [1].
      That CEA is a potential target for T cell mediated immune responses in humans is demonstrated
      by the observation that CEA contains epitopes that may be recognized in an MHC restricted
      fashion by T cells [2-11]. Specifically, there is support for the existence of human
      cytolytic T cells (CTLs) that recognize CEA epitopes that bind to MHC molecules HLA- A2, A3,
      and A24. For the most part, these T cells have been generated by in vitro cultures using
      antigen-presenting cells pulsed with the epitope of interest to stimulate peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells. In addition, T cell lines have been generated after stimulation with CEA
      latex beads, CEA protein-pulsed plastic adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or DCs
      sensitized with CEA RNA. T cells have also been generated from patients immunized with a
      vaccinia vector encoding CEA immunogen (discussed below). Using high-performance liquid
      chromatography mass-spectrometry-based approaches, HLA A2-presented peptides from CEA have
      been identified in primary gastrointestinal tumors [12]. Of the HLA A2 restricted epitopes of
      CEA, CAP-1, a nine amino acid sequence, has been shown to stimulate CTLs from cancer patients
      immunized with vaccinia-CEA. Cap-1(6D) is a peptide analog of CAP-1. Its sequence includes a
      heteroclitic (nonanchor position) mutation, resulting in an amino acid change from Asn to
      Asp, to enhance recognition by the T-cell receptor without any change in binding to HLA A2.
      Compared with the non mutated CAP-1 epitope, Cap-1(6D) has been shown to enhance the
      sensitization of CTLs by 100 to 1,000 times [3, 5, 13]. CTL lines could be elicited from
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy volunteers by in vitro sensitization to the
      Cap-1(6D) peptide but not to the CAP-1 peptide. These cell lines can lyse human tumor cells
      expressing endogenous CEA.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Cohorts 1-4 only:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic malignancy due to a tumor expressing
             CEA.

          -  The tumor must express CEA as defined by immunohistochemical staining, CEA blood
             level, or a tumor known to be universally CEA positive.

          -  Must have received treatment with standard therapy having a possible overall survival
             benefit or refused such therapy.

          -  Must have received and progressed through at least one line of palliative chemotherapy
             for colorectal, breast, lung, or pancreatic cancer. For other malignancies, if a first
             line therapy with survival or palliative benefit exists, it should have been
             administered and there should have been progressive disease.

        Cohort 5 Only:

          -  Histologically confirmed colon cancer (rectal cancer excluded). Since colon cancer is
             nearly universally CEA positive, CEA staining is not required.

          -  Documented stage III colon cancer with no evidence of disease.

          -  One to six months following standard post-operative adjuvant treatment, which should
             have consisted of 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid or capecitabine with or without
             oxaliplatin for 4-6 months)

        All Cohorts:

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70%.

          -  Estimated life expectancy &gt; 6 months and not expected to require further systemic
             chemotherapy for at least 3 months.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Adequate hematologic function (WBC ≥ 3000/microliter, hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, and
             platelets ≥ 100,000/microliter).

          -  Adequate renal and hepatic function, (serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL, bilirubin ≤ 1.5
             mg/dL, and ALT and AST ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal).

          -  Patients who have received CEA-targeted immunotherapy, if treatment was discontinued
             at least 3 months before enrollment.

          -  Patients who are taking medications that do not have a known history of
             immunosuppression are eligible for this trial.

          -  Ability to understand and provide signed informed consent.

          -  Ability to return to Duke University Medical Center for adequate follow-up, as
             required by protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy (must be at least 3 months
             between any prior CEA-targeted immunotherapy and study treatment and at least 4 weeks
             between any other prior therapy and study treatment).

          -  Patients with previously resected brain metastases will be permitted if a CT or MRI
             scan shows no metastasis within 1 month before enrollment.

          -  History of autoimmune disease.
