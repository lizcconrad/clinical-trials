      The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the clinical benefit as measured by time to
      tumor progression of Abraxane plus hormonal therapy when applied to previously untreated
      patients with unresectable or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate, as well as to assess
      safety and tolerability of the study drug regimen and to evaluate secondary efficacy
      endpoints such as overall survival and duration of response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abraxane is a potent anticancer drug that stops cancer cells from growing and dividing by
      interfering with certain cell structures and killing the cancer cells. Abraxane is the first
      albumin-bound taxane particle of approximately 130 nanometers that takes advantage of
      albumin, a natural carrier of water-insoluble molecules (e.g., various nutrients, vitamins,
      and hormones) found in humans. Albumin is a protein that acts as the body's key transporter
      of nutrients and other water-insoluble molecules and selectively accumulates in tumor
      tissues.

      The delivery of chemotherapy/hormone therapy in a setting of androgen-independent prostate
      cancer has demonstrated: survival benefit associated with a PSA decline and tolerable
      toxicity, thus strongly suggesting that disease modifying potential exists. Preclinical data
      supports the benefit of simultaneous chemotherapy/hormonal therapy and androgen deprivation.
      The stage is set for chemotherapy/hormonal therapy to be given earlier in men with prostate
      cancer. Data suggests a transformation from an androgen-dependent to an androgen-independent
      phenotype is mediated by the expansion of an androgen-independent clone already present at
      the time of androgen deprivation. If this model is correct, it would be feasible to bring
      chemotherapy/hormonal therapy up front when the corresponding tumor burden is minimal.

      It is hoped that by bringing therapy against all components of the tumor initially, the
      emergence of androgen-independent growth will be delayed, ultimately prolonging patient
      survival. This study will test this hypothesis of Abraxane plus hormonal therapy followed by
      standard hormonal therapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic proof of adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          -  Patients must belong to one of four groups: 1) Local/Regional with prior definitive
             therapy: Patients with local/regional recurrence following prostatectomy or radiation
             therapy who still have a normal bone scan. 2) Local/Regional without prior definitive
             therapy: Patients felt to be unresectable, or are felt not to be candidates for,
             radiation therapy. 3) Low volume bone disease: Patients with 1 or 2 bone metastases.
             4) High volume bone/visceral disease: Patients with ≥ 3 metastatic bone sites or
             visceral metastases.

          -  Patients meeting these criteria are eligible even without any radiographically
             demonstrable abnormality. All patients must have an elevated PSA prior to initial
             hormone exposure defined as: 1) For patients with prior prostatectomy, the PSA must be
             rising with an associated doubling time of ≤ 3 months. 2) For patients with prior
             radiation therapy, the PSA must be ≥ 1.0 ng/mL with an associated doubling time of ≤ 3
             months. 3) For patients with the prostate in place, the PSA must be elevated with
             biopsy proven disease and are not candidates for local therapy.

          -  Patients may be on an LHRH agonist (with or without an anti-androgen), or already
             medically castrated, at the time of study entry, provided such therapy was started
             within 3 months of study entry.

          -  No previous cytotoxic systemic therapy of any kind is allowed, including systemic
             irradiation with strontium-89 and samarium. Previous definitive radiotherapy to one
             metastatic site is acceptable. At least 8 weeks must have elapsed since radiation
             therapy to the pelvis. Patients having limited irradiation of a single metastatic site
             are eligible 4 weeks following the completion of radiation.

          -  Patients may have had previous exposure to androgen deprivation therapy if it was
             given for ≤ 6 months to, &quot;downstage&quot; the primary, and provided such therapy completed
             at least 12 months prior to entry into this study.

          -  Patients must be free of serious co-morbidity and have a life expectancy of ≥ 3 years.

          -  Patients must have adequate physiologic reserves as evidenced by Zubrod Performance
             Status (ZPS) of ≤ 2, adequate bone marrow function, renal function and liver function
             and no evidence of active ischemia on ECG (if clinically indicated, documentation of
             EF ≥ 40%.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must not have a second malignancy unless there is confidence of previous
             curative therapy.

          -  Patients with a recent history of TIA (within 6 months), or are requiring regular
             antianginal therapy or are having claudication sufficient to limit activity are not
             eligible. Patients with a previous history of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary
             embolism (within 12 months) are not eligible.

          -  Patients must not have a serious intercurrent medical or psychiatric illness,
             including serious active infection.

          -  Patients must not have Sensory neuropathy of grade 1 or greater.
