      This single arm, multicenter, open-label, phase II study will enroll chemotherapy-naive
      patients with metastatic, histologically-confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate (stage M1
      D2). Treatment will continue until there evidence of disease progression, intolerable
      toxicity, or other withdrawal criteria are met. Non-surgically castrated patients must
      continue the use of LHRH agonists during protocol treatment.

      Thirty-one chemotherapy-naїve patients with asymptomatic metastatic androgen-independent
      prostate cancer will be enrolled and treated with I.V. IMC-A12 (Cixutumumab) at 10 mg.kg
      administered over 1 hour every 2 weeks. An additional 10 patients will be enrolled and
      treated with IMC-A12 at a dose of 20 mg/kg every three weeks. Treatment will continue until
      evidence of disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Radiographic evaluation of response
      will be performed every 8 weeks for the patients treated with I.V. IMC-A12 at 20 mg/kg.
