      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of treatment with valsartan +
      amlodipine to a target systolic blood pressure (SBP)&lt;130 mmHg compared to the Joint National
      Commission on the Treatment of Hypertension 7 recommended target SBP of &lt;140 mmHg on the
      intrinsic diastolic properties of the myocardium in patients with hypertension and
      echocardiographic evidence of diastolic dysfunction.
