  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is the most common sex-chromosome disorder with a prevalence of one
      in 660 men and is a frequent cause of hypogonadism and infertility. It is caused by the
      presence of extra X-chromosomes, the most common karyotype being 47,XXY. The phenotype is
      variable, but the most constant finding is small hyalinized testes, hypergonadotrophic
      hypogonadism, infertility, eunuchoid body proportion, increased height and learning
      disabilities. Klinefelter syndrome has been associated with increased prevalence of diabetes,
      osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases but the pathogenesis is unknown. Accordingly the aim
      of the study was to investigate measures of body composition, insulin sensitivity, bone
      mineral density, echocardiography, as well as biochemical markers of endocrine, metabolic and
      bone function in KS and an age-matched control group.
