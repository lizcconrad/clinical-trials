  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immune response when 13-valent
      pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPnC) and the trivalent inactivated flu vaccine (TIV) are
      given together to healthy adults aged 50-59 years who are naive to 23-valent pneumococcal
      polysaccharide vaccine (23vPS), or when the vaccines are given 1 month apart. It will also
      evaluate the immune response to 13vPnC once per year for 4 years and then to a second dose of
      13vPnC given 5 years after the first dose.

          <description>Participants received 0.5 milliliter (mL) dose of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPnC) intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the left arm along with 0.5-mL trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the right arm at Year 0 on Day 1 (Dose 1, 13vPnC+TIV). Placebo matched to 13vPnC was administered 1 month after (Dose 2, placebo). Participants were further followed-up for 1 month, then attended a 6-month follow-up visit for safety. Participants were then followed-up yearly for 4 years. Participants then received 0.5 mL dose of 13vPnC intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the left arm 5 years after initial vaccination. Participants were further followed-up for 1 month, then attended a 6-month follow-up visit for safety.</description>

        <description>Serotype-specific OPA GMTs for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were determined in the blood samples of participants using a microcolony OPA (mcOPA) assay. GMTs (13vPnC) and corresponding 2-sided 95% CIs were evaluated. Geometric means were calculated using all participants with available data for 1 Month After 13vPnC (Year 5) blood draws. CI for GMTs were back transformations of a CI based on the Student t distribution for the mean logarithm of the titers.</description>

        <description>Serotype-specific OPA GMTs for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were determined in the blood samples of participants using a microcolony OPA (mcOPA) assay. GMTs (13vPnC) and corresponding 2-sided 95% CIs were evaluated. Geometric means were calculated using all participants with available data for before 13vPnC (Year 5) and 1 month after 13vPnC re-vaccinated dose (Year 5) blood draws. CI for GMTs were back transformations of a CI based on the Student t distribution for the mean logarithm of the titers. Participants with immunogenicity data at both Year 5 endpoints.</description>

One month after, participants received either Placebo matched to 13vPnC (Dose 2, placebo), or 13vPnC (Dose 2, 13vPnC). Participants were further followed-up for 1 month, then attended a 6-month follow-up visit for safety. Participants were then followed-up yearly for 4 years. Participants then received 0.5 mL dose of 13vPnC intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the left arm 5 years after initial vaccination.

        <description>GMFR for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were determined from before 13vPnC (Year 5) to 1 month after 13vPnC re-vaccinated dose (Year 5) and were summarized geometric means and 2-sided 95% CIs, which were computed using the logarithmically transformed assay results. CI for GMFRs were back transformations of a CI based on the Student t distribution for the mean logarithm of the mean fold rises. GMFRs were calculated using all participants with available data from both before 13vPnC (Year 5) and 1 month after 13vPnC re-vaccinated dose (Year 5) blood draws. n=participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified serotype from both before 13vPnC (Year 5) and 1 month after 13vPnC re-vaccinated dose (Year 5) blood draws.</description>

One month after, participants received either Placebo matched to 13vPnC (Dose 2, placebo), or 13vPnC (Dose 2, 13vPnC). Participants were further followed-up for 1 month, then attended a 6-month follow-up visit for safety. Participants were then followed-up yearly for 4 years. Participants then received 0.5 mL dose of 13vPnC intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the left arm 5 years after initial vaccination.

        <description>Serotype-specific OPA GMTs for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were determined in the blood samples of participants using a microcolony OPA (mcOPA) assay. GMTs (13vPnC) and corresponding 2-sided 95% CIs were evaluated. Geometric means were calculated using all participants with available data for 1 month after 13vPnC (Year 0),1 month after 13vPnC re-vaccinated dose (Year 5) blood draws. CI for GMTs were back transformations of a CI based on the Student t distribution for the mean logarithm of the titers. Participants in this population must have immunogenicity data at both the Year 0 and Year 5 time points.n=participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified serotype for both 1 month after 13vPnC (Year 0),1 month after 13vPnC re-vaccinated dose (Year 5) blood draws.</description>

One month after, participants received either Placebo matched to 13vPnC (Dose 2, placebo), or 13vPnC (Dose 2, 13vPnC). Participants were further followed-up for 1 month, then attended a 6-month follow-up visit for safety. Participants were then followed-up yearly for 4 years. Participants then received 0.5 mL dose of 13vPnC intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the left arm 5 years after initial vaccination.

        <description>GMFR for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were determined from before13vPnC (Year 0) to 1 month after 13vPnC re-vaccinated dose (Year 5) and were summarized geometric means and 2-sided 95% CIs, which were computed using the logarithmically transformed assay results. CI for GMFRs were back transformations of a CI based on the Student t distribution for the mean logarithm of the mean fold rises. GMFRs were calculated using all participants with available data from both before 13vPnC (Year 0) and 1 month after 13vPnC re-vaccinated dose (Year 5) blood draws.</description>

One month after, participants received either Placebo matched to 13vPnC (Dose 2, placebo), or 13vPnC (Dose 2, 13vPnC). Participants were further followed-up for 1 month, then attended a 6-month follow-up visit for safety. Participants were then followed-up yearly for 4 years. Participants then received 0.5 mL dose of 13vPnC intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the left arm 5 years after initial vaccination.

        <description>Serotype-specific OPA GMTs for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were determined in the blood samples of participants using a microcolony OPA (mcOPA) assay. GMT (13vPnC) and corresponding 2-sided 95% CIs were evaluated. Geometric means were calculated using all participants with available data before, 1 month after 13vPnC (Year 0), at Years 1, 2, 3 and 4 after initial vaccination (Year 0), before, 1 month after 13vPnC (Year 5) blood draws. CI for GMT were back transformations of a CI based on the Student t distribution for the mean logarithm of the titers. n=participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified serotype at before, 1 month after 13vPnC (Year 0), at Years 1, 2, 3 and 4 after initial vaccination (Year 0), before, 1 month after 13vPnC (Year 5) blood draws.</description>

One month after, participants received either Placebo matched to 13vPnC (Dose 2, placebo), or 13vPnC (Dose 2, 13vPnC). Participants were further followed-up for 1 month, then attended a 6-month follow-up visit for safety. Participants were then followed-up yearly for 4 years. Participants then received 0.5 mL dose of 13vPnC intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the left arm 5 years after initial vaccination.

        <description>GMFR for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were determined from before to 1 month after 13vPnC (Year 0), at years 1, 2, 3 and 4 after initial vaccination (Year 0), before, 1 month after 13vPnC (Year 5) and were summarized geometric means and 2-sided 95% CIs, which were computed using the logarithmically transformed assay results. CI for GMFRs were back transformations of a CI based on the Student t distribution for the mean logarithm of the mean fold rises. GMFRs were calculated using all participants with available data from both the baseline and the various time points.</description>

One month after, participants received either Placebo matched to 13vPnC (Dose 2, placebo), or 13vPnC (Dose 2, 13vPnC). Participants were further followed-up for 1 month, then attended a 6-month follow-up visit for safety. Participants were then followed-up yearly for 4 years. Participants then received 0.5 mL dose of 13vPnC intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the left arm 5 years after initial vaccination. Participants were further followed-up for 1 month, then attended a 6-month follow-up visit for safety.</description>

          <description>GMFR for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were determined from before to 1 month after 13vPnC (Year 0), at years 1, 2, 3 and 4 after initial vaccination (Year 0), before, 1 month after 13vPnC (Year 5) and were summarized geometric means and 2-sided 95% CIs, which were computed using the logarithmically transformed assay results. CI for GMFRs were back transformations of a CI based on the Student t distribution for the mean logarithm of the mean fold rises. GMFRs were calculated using all participants with available data from both the baseline and the various time points.</description>
          <population>Subset of all-available immunogenicity population with data at Years 0 through 5 included participants with immunogenicity data at all-time points from Year 0 through Year 5 within the protocol specified time window. n=participants with valid and determinate assay results for both the before 13vPnC (Year 0) and all the specified timepoints.</population>

            <description>Participants received 0.5 milliliter (mL) dose of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPnC) intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the left arm along with 0.5-mL trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the right arm on Day 1(Dose 1). Placebo matched to 13vPnC vaccine (dose 2) was administered 1 month after vaccination 1, dose 1 (13vPnC+TIV).Participants were then followed-up to 4 years (for 1 month, then 6 month and then yearly follow-up) after dose 2 of vaccination 1. Participants then received 0.5 mL dose of 13vPnC vaccine intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the left arm 5 years after vaccination 1. Participants were further followed-up for 1 month and then for 6 months.</description>

          <description>Antibody GMC for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) for adult participants are presented. GMC (13vPnC) and corresponding 2-sided 95 percent (%) CIs were evaluated. Geometric means were calculated using all participants with available data for 1 month after 13vPnC Dose 1 blood draw. CI for GMC are back transformations of a CI based on the Student t distribution for the mean logarithm of the concentrations.</description>

        <description>Antibody GMC for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) for adult participants are presented. GMC (13vPnC) and corresponding 2-sided 95% CIs were evaluated. Geometric means were calculated using all participants with available data before 13vPnC (Year 5) and 1 month after 13vPnC re-vaccinated dose (Year 5) blood draw. CI for GMC are back transformations of a CI based on the Student t distribution for the mean logarithm of the concentrations. Participants in this population must have immunogenicity data at both Year 5 time points.</description>

            <description>Participants received either 0.5 mL dose of 13vPnC intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the left arm along with 0.5-mL TIV intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the right arm at Year 0 on Day 1 (Dose 1, 13vPnC+TIV), or placebo matched to 13vPnC intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the left arm along with 0.5-mL TIV intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the right arm at Year 0 on Day 1 (Dose 1, placebo+TIV). One month after, participants received either Placebo matched to 13vPnC (Dose 2, placebo), or 13vPnC (Dose 2, 13vPnC). Participants were further followed-up for 1 month, then attended a 6-month follow-up visit for safety. Participants were then followed-up yearly for 4 years. Participants then received 0.5 mL dose of 13vPnC intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the left arm 5 years after initial vaccination. Participants were further followed-up for 1 month, then attended a 6-month follow-up visit for safety.</description>

        <description>GMFR for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were determined from before 13vPnC (Year 5) to 1 month after 13vPnC re-vaccinated dose (Year 5) and were summarized geometric means and 2-sided 95% CIs, which were computed using the logarithmically transformed assay results. CI for GMFRs were back transformations of a CI based on the Student t distribution for the mean logarithm of the mean fold rises. GMFRs were calculated using all participants with available data from both before 13vPnC (Year 5) and 1 month after 13vPnC re-vaccinated dose (Year 5) blood draws.</description>

          <description>Antibody GMC for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) for adult participants are presented. GMC (13vPnC) and corresponding 2-sided 95% CIs were evaluated. Geometric means were calculated using all participants with available data 1 month after 13vPnC (Year 0),1 month after 13vPnC re-vaccinated dose (Year 5) blood draw. CI for GMC are back transformations of a CI based on the Student t distribution for the mean logarithm of the concentrations. Participants in this population must have immunogenicity data at both the Year 0 and Year 5 time points</description>
          <population>All-available immunogenicity population at Years 0 and 5. n=participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified serotype for both 1 month after 13vPnC (Year 0),1 month after 13vPnC re-vaccinated dose (Year 5) blood draws.</population>

        <description>GMFR for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were determined from 1 month after 13vPnC (Year 0),1 month after 13vPnC re-vaccinated dose (Year 5) and were summarized geometric means and 2-sided 95% CIs, which were computed using the logarithmically transformed assay results. CI for GMFRs were back transformations of a CI based on the Student t distribution for the mean logarithm of the mean fold rises. GMFRs were calculated using all participants with available data from both 1 month after 13vPnC (Year 0),1 month after 13vPnC re-vaccinated dose (Year 5) blood draws.</description>

            <description>Participants received either 0.5 mL dose of 13vPnC intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the left arm along with 0.5-mL TIV intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the right arm at Year 0 on Day 1 (Dose 1, 13vPnC+TIV), or placebo matched to 13vPnC intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the left arm along with 0.5-mL TIV intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the right arm at Year 0 on Day 1 (Dose 1, placebo+TIV). One month after, participants received either Placebo matched to 13vPnC (Dose 2, placebo), or 13vPnC (Dose 2, 13vPnC). Participants were further followed-up for 1 month, then attended a 6-month follow-up visit for safety. Participants were then followed-up yearly for 4 years. Participants then received 0.5 mL dose of 13vPnC intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the left arm 5 years after initial vaccination.

          <description>GMFR for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were determined from 1 month after 13vPnC (Year 0),1 month after 13vPnC re-vaccinated dose (Year 5) and were summarized geometric means and 2-sided 95% CIs, which were computed using the logarithmically transformed assay results. CI for GMFRs were back transformations of a CI based on the Student t distribution for the mean logarithm of the mean fold rises. GMFRs were calculated using all participants with available data from both 1 month after 13vPnC (Year 0),1 month after 13vPnC re-vaccinated dose (Year 5) blood draws.</description>

        <description>GMFR for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were determined from Before 13vPnC (Year 0) to 1 month after 13vPnC re-vaccinated dose (Year 5) and were summarized geometric means and 2-sided 95% CIs, which were computed using the logarithmically transformed assay results. CI for GMFRs were back transformations of a CI based on the Student t distribution for the mean logarithm of the mean fold rises. GMFRs were calculated using all participants with available data from both before 13vPnC (Year 0),1 month after 13vPnC re-vaccinated dose (Year 5) blood draws.</description>

            <description>Participants received either 0.5 mL dose of 13vPnC intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the left arm along with 0.5-mL TIV intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the right arm at Year 0 on Day 1 (Dose 1, 13vPnC+TIV), or placebo matched to 13vPnC intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the left arm along with 0.5-mL TIV intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the right arm at Year 0 on Day 1 (Dose 1, placebo+TIV). One month after, participants received either Placebo matched to 13vPnC (Dose 2, placebo), or 13vPnC (Dose 2, 13vPnC). Participants were further followed-up for 1 month, then attended a 6-month follow-up visit for safety. Participants were then followed-up yearly for 4 years. Participants then received 0.5 mL dose of 13vPnC intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the left arm 5 years after initial vaccination. Participants were further followed-up for 1 month, then attended a 6-month follow-up visit for safety.</description>

One month after, participants received either Placebo matched to 13vPnC (Dose 2, placebo), or 13vPnC (Dose 2, 13vPnC). Participants were further followed-up for 1 month, then attended a 6-month follow-up visit for safety. Participants were then followed-up yearly for 4 years. Participants then received 0.5 mL dose of 13vPnC intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the left arm 5 years after initial vaccination.

        <description>Specific local reactions were prompted for each day,and reported using an electronic diary.Redness and Swelling were scaled as Any(redness present or swelling present);Mild(2.5 to 5.0 centimeters [cm]);Moderate(5.1 to 10.0 cm);Severe (&gt;10 cm). Pain at injection site was scaled as: Any (pain present); Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated); Moderate (discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity); Severe (incapacitating, with inability to do usual activity). Limitation of arm movement was scaled as Any(no limitation of arm movement);Mild(some limitation of arm movement);Moderate (unable to move arm above head but able to move arm above shoulder);Severe (unable to move arm above shoulder).

        <description>Specific local reactions were prompted for each day,and reported using an electronic diary.Redness and Swelling were scaled as Any(redness present or swelling present);Mild(2.5 to 5.0 centimeters [cm]);Moderate(5.1 to 10.0 cm);Severe (&gt;10 cm). Pain at injection site was scaled as: Any (pain present); Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated); Moderate (discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity); Severe (incapacitating, with inability to do usual activity). Limitation of arm movement was scaled as Any(no limitation of arm movement);Mild(some limitation of arm movement);Moderate (unable to move arm above head but able to move arm above shoulder);Severe (unable to move arm above shoulder). Local reactions were measured only on the participant’s arm vaccinated with either 13vPnC or placebo and were not collected at the TIV injection site.</description>
