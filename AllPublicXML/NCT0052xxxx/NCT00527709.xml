  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is being pursued to observe whether certain medications are given to
      patients within a timeframe where their being given could play a part in a critical event in
      the management of the patient.

      There are general rules about when it would be appropriate for these types of medications not
      to be given. However, it is not current standard practice for the criteria to be put in place
      without the expressed wishes of the ordering physician or their agent.

      Research Question:

      Can the administration of cardio-depressant medications be documented as a significant risk
      factor for hypotensive or bradycardic events?
