  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia), is treatment using
      photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP 120 Watt) as effective and cost-effective as
      the standard treatment of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)? A higher-power
      (120W) laser system has recently been approved by Health Canada for the treatment of an
      enlarged prostate. This system, which uses laser energy to vaporize the prostate tissue, will
      be compared with the current standard treatment of transurethral resection of the prostate.
      This newer generation laser may offer more efficient removal of prostate tissue with fewer
      complications and may result in clinical and economic benefits compared to the standard
      treatment. However, there have been no studies comparing the 120W laser with the standard
      transurethral resection of the prostate. This study will provide currently unavailable
      information for clinicians and decision makers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following a review of treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by the Medical
      Advisory Secretariat (MAS) of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC), the
      Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee (OHTAC) recommended that &quot;a registry study be
      conducted to establish longer term effectiveness and complication rates for PVP given the
      likelihood of increasing diffusion of this technology&quot;. Since then, the Medical Devices
      Bureau of the Therapeutic Products Directorate, Health Canada, has licensed in April 30,
      2007, a 120W-KTP laser system (Greenlight HPS (TM)) for sale in Canada. As several new 120W
      systems will be operating in Ontario in the coming months, there is an urgent need to
      evaluate the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and durability of 120W PVP compared to
      conventional TURP in the treatment of patients with BPH.
