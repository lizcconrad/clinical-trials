      The purpose of this project was to identify methods that Dental Practice-Based Research
      Network (DPBRN) dentist used to diagnose and treat caries lesions. The aims of the
      &quot;Assessment of caries diagnosis and caries treatment&quot; study were to: (1) quantify the
      percentages of DPBRN dentists who reported using selected methods for caries diagnosis; (2)
      quantify the percentage of DPBRN dentists who reported using a caries-risk assessment
      protocol of any variety; (3) quantify the percentages of DPBRN dentists who reported
      intervening surgically at carious states E1, E2, D1, D2, or D3; and (4) test the hypothesis
      that reported use of a caries-risk assessment protocol was associated with a higher
      likelihood of reporting use of a preventive program.

      The aims were met by enrolling at least 200 DPBRN practitioner-investigators in the study,
      each of whom completed a 10-page questionnaire about caries diagnosis and treatment
      assessment. Findings from &quot;Assessment of Caries diagnosis and caries treatment&quot; study will be
      related to treatment that is actually delivered as determined in &quot;Reasons for placing the
      first restoration on permanent tooth surfaces&quot; study and &quot;Reasons for replacement or repair
      of dental restorations&quot; study. This group of three studies will lay a critical foundation for
      subsequent intervention studies designed to move the latest scientific advances about caries
      diagnosis and treatment into daily clinical practice.
