      To investigate the sensitivity of the [18F]fluoroethylcholine (FEC)
      Positron-Emission-Tomography/ Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PET/MRI) method in tumour detection
      and location (side assignment, encapsulation, invasion of the seminal vesicle) and detection
      of affected lymph nodes, and to compare these with presently used detection procedures
      (needle biopsy, digital rectal examination, transrectal ultrasound, and pre-therapeutic
      assessment), with a view to finding out whether the [18F]fluoroethylcholine PET/MRI method is
      comparable to, or superior to, the established method. Postoperative histology served as the
      standard of reference.

    <textblock>
      Prostate carcinoma is today in Germany the most frequently diagnosed cancer disease of men
      and is - after bronchial carcinoma - their second most frequent cause of cancer-related
      death. Around 22% of all new cancer diagnoses among males are prostate-related. This
      corresponds to an age-adjusted incidence rate of nearly 100 per 100,000 males in the
      population, and to well above 40,000 new diagnoses of prostate cancer per year
      [Robert-Koch-Institut, 2010]. The dramatic increase in recent decades is attributable more to
      improved diagnostic methods and a generally increased life expectancy than to an actual
      increase in the incidence of disease [Robert-Koch-Institut, 2010].

      The total annual mortality rate is around 11,000 [Statistisches Bundesamt, 1994]. Prostate
      carcinoma is virtually unknown among men under 40 years of age. The annual prevalence rises
      with increasing age - between the 40th and 80th years of life by a factor of more than 1000.
      Autopsies have shown that among men over 70 up to 80% have a latent prostate carcinoma,
      without it being fatal [Breslow 1977; Börgemann, 2006]. The patients' average age at
      diagnosis is 71 years.

      The five-year prostate-cancer-specific survival rate after diagnosis is about 80-99% for
      tumours that are restricted to the gland itself [Porter, 2006]. For disseminated tumours this
      figure is considerably smaller, not more than 35% [von Eschenbach, 1996]. A prospect of
      complete regression exists only for non-metastasing carcinomas, but there it is quite good:
      under aggressive treatment, 90% of cancers restricted to the prostate itself can be
      completely cured, as can 50% of those that have crossed the gland's capsule [Deutsche
      Gesellschaft für Urologie, 2009].

      At present, there is a lack of adequate pre-therapeutic staging methods. This in turn often
      prevents the reliable choice of a stage-adapted therapeutic regimen, which could possibly
      offer a better prognosis even for carcinomas extending into neighbouring organs. A
      consequence of this uncertainty is that in individual cases the therapy is not ideally suited
      to the stage of disease, and the success of radiation treatment, hormonal therapy and
      chemotherapy can only approximately be matched with the stage of dissemination. Until now,
      the only reliable method for lymph-node diagnosis is operative staging by lymphadenectomy. No
      reliable diagnostic method is available by which the degree of spreading of the tumour within
      the prostate can be established.

      In this context, Positron-Emission-Tomography (PET) examination with radioactively labelled
      choline appears to offer a promising primary imaging-diagnostic staging method, as indicated
      by the studies reviewed below. This diagnostic method as applied to humans was first
      described by Gauthier et al. [1985]. This was followed by two detailed reports from a
      Japanese group: Hara et al. [1997] first investigated the potential of [11C]choline in brain
      tumours and found a clear enrichment of this marker in the tumours of 24 patients, while
      normal brain tissue was not enriched with it. In a subsequent study by the same group [Hara,
      1998], the enrichment of fluorodeoxyglucose was compared with the choline uptake in the
      lesions of ten prostate-cancer patients. Thus, the choline enrichment (SUV, standardised
      uptake value) was 3.48 ± 1.31 in 43 lesions, while in the normal environment of the lesser
      pelvis the corresponding value was below 1.0. De Jong et al. [2003] investigated 67 patients,
      of whom 15 had histologically confirmed lymph-node metastases: the [11C]choline test gave a
      'true positive' result in 12 of 15 patients and a 'false negative' in 3 patients, thus
      indicating that [11C]choline PET is sufficiently sensitive and specific for the pre-operative
      staging of lymph-node metastases of prostate carcinoma. In a pre-operative staging using
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with a combined endorectal and body-phased-array coil,
      Pegios et al. [2003] investigated 42 patients with strong clinical suspicion, or with
      needle-biopsy confirmation, of prostate cancer and were able to differentiate between stages
      of extracapsular growth and seminal-vesicle infiltration (tumor stage T2 versus T3 [T2=tumor
      restricted to the gland itself; T3a=extracapsule growing of the tumor; T3b= tumor
      infiltration into the seminal-vesicles]) with an accuracy of 94-97% (sensitivity 100%,
      specificity between 87% and 93% for observers 1 and 2). The exact, local tumour stage was
      identified with an accuracy of 75%. However, for lymph-node infiltration a sensitivity of
      only 25% was achieved: one of four lymph-node-positive patients was correctly identified. In
      a more recent study, a Japanese group [Yamaguchi, 2005] investigated the application of
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
      choline-PET in 20 patients with needle-biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer. The PET imaging
      achieved a sensitivity of 100%, NMR (quotient [(creatine + choline) / citrate]) 65% and
      unsupported MRI 60%. For 16 patients radical prostatectomy was performed; results correlated
      with those of pre-operative local staging with PET by 81%, and with MRI by 50%. The site of
      choline uptakes in PET was visualised by MRI using the distance of the prostate from the
      femoral head and the pubic symphysis.At present, no data relevant for the present study
      indication are available on the software-fused imaging by combined PET/MRI. The combination
      of high-resolution endorectal MRI with functional PET imaging could come to offer a decisive
      advantage in the staging of prostate carcinoma. The present study was designed to test this
      in an appropriate patient population.

      A system combining PET and MRI was recently granted approval in the U.S.A. by the U.S. Food
      and Drug Administration [FDA, 2011].

    <description>PET scans were performed on a LSO scanner (ECAT ACCEL, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) by using a multiphase protocol starting with a &quot;cold&quot; transmission scan of the lower pelvis. This was followed by a list mode emission scan with 10 frames à 1 minute starting immediately after the administration of 3.3MBq [18F]Fluoroethylcholine chloride (FEC; Eckert &amp; Ziegler EURO-PET Berlin GmbH) as a bolus through the cubital vein. After a short gap due to computer processing time the whole body scan was performed starting at the upper thoracic aperture down to the proximal femur. Acquisition parameters were 3 minutes emission scan and 2 minutes transmission scan for each bed position. Therefore the prostate region was scanned again at 45 minutes p.i. (post injection) A delayed local acquisition at 65 minutes over the lower pelvis with 6 minutes emission and 2 minutes transmission finished the diagnostic acquisition procedure.</description>

          <description>The day before surgery, fasting patients received a bladder catheter right before Positron-Emission-Tomography/ Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PET/MRI) examination to avoid different sizes of the urinary bladder in PET and MRI scan and to reduce bladder FEC-activity overlay of the prostate. After applying the endorectal MRI coil patients were positioned in a vacuum mattress on MRI table. Additionally, 4 PET/MRI multimodality spot markers containing 37kBq [22Na] and a MRI T2w (T2 weighed) hyperintense gel were attached at the hip region to allow landmark PET/MRI fusion. After MRI acquisition the modular MRI table was fixed on the PET table system. Patients kept in the same position during the whole procedure. PET scans were performed by using a multiphase protocol starting with a list mode emission scan immediately after the administration of 3.3MBq [18F]fluoroethylcholine (FEC) as a bolus through the cubital vein.</description>

          <description>The day before surgery, fasting patients received a bladder catheter right before Positron-Emission-Tomography/ Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PET/MRI) examination to avoid different sizes of the urinary bladder in PET and MRI scan and to reduce bladder FEC-activity overlay of the prostate. After applying the endorectal MRI coil patients were positioned in a vacuum mattress on MRI table. Additionally, 4 PET/MRI multimodality spot markers containing 37kBq [22Na] and a MRI T2w (T2 weighed) hyperintense gel were attached at the hip region to allow landmark PET/MRI fusion. After MRI acquisition the modular MRI table was fixed on the PET table system. Patients kept in the same position during the whole procedure. PET scans were performed by using a multiphase protocol starting with a list mode emission scan immediately after the administration of 3.3MBq [18F]fluoroethylcholine (FEC) as a bolus through the cubital vein.</description>

        <description>PET positive lesions were measured on its own and evaluated as malignant just as hypointense lesions on MRI. In PET/MRI analysis, MRI suspect lesions without FEC uptake were considered not to be malignant. PET positive lesions in central periurethral zone with inhomogenous signal intensity and sharp edges on MRI images were also considered to be benign. PET positive lesions in the peripheral zone without a hypointense correlate on MRI were considered to be malignant. At least 1 histological confirmed cancer lesion has to be detected by each of the 3 methods to be patient based true positive.</description>

            <description>PET scans were performed on a LSO scanner (ECAT ACCEL, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) by using a multiphase protocol starting with a &quot;cold&quot; transmission scan of the lower pelvis. This was followed by a list mode emission scan with 10 frames à 1 minute starting immediately after the administration of 3.3MBq [18F]Fluoroethylcholine chloride (FEC; Eckert &amp; Ziegler EURO-PET Berlin GmbH) as a bolus through the cubital vein. Acquisition parameters were 3 minutes emission scan and 2 minutes transmission scan for each bed position. Therefore the prostate region was scanned again at 45 minutes p.i. (post injection) A delayed local acquisition at 65 minutes over the lower pelvis with 6 minutes emission and 2 minutes transmission finished the diagnostic acquisition procedure.</description>

            <description>The MRI examination was performed on a 1.5Tesla MRI system (Gyroscan ACS-NT, Philips, Hamburg, Germany) with combined QBody and endorectal coil. Pelvic assessment and lymph node staging was effected with 5mm T2 weighted (T2w) turbo spin echo (TSE) transversal and a coronal short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence. For prostate assessment, 3mm endorectal T2 weighed (T2w) spin echo (SE) sagittal, transversal and coronal sequences were acquired. Transversal sequences were angulated 90° to intraprostatic bladder catheter to allow exact correlation with histological holoptical slices.</description>

        <title>Lesion Based Analysis of FEC-PET, Endorectal MRI and Combined FEC-PET/eMRI in All Patients</title>
        <description>PET positive lesions (n=128) were measured on its own and evaluated as malignant just as hypointense lesions on MRI. In PET/MRI analysis, MRI suspect lesions without FEC uptake were considered not to be malignant. PET positive lesions in central periurethral zone with inhomogenous signal intensity and sharp edges on MRI images were also considered to be benign. PET positive lesions in the peripheral zone without a hypointense correlate on MRI were considered to be malignant. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, negative and positive predictive values were determined.</description>

            <description>PET scans were performed on a LSO scanner (ECAT ACCEL, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) by using a multiphase protocol starting with a &quot;cold&quot; transmission scan of the lower pelvis. This was followed by a list mode emission scan with 10 frames à 1 minute starting immediately after the administration of 3.3MBq [18F]Fluoroethylcholine chloride (FEC; Eckert &amp; Ziegler EURO-PET Berlin GmbH) as a bolus through the cubital vein. Acquisition parameters were 3 minutes emission scan and 2 minutes transmission scan for each bed position. Therefore the prostate region was scanned again at 45 minutes p.i. (post injection) A delayed local acquisition at 65 minutes over the lower pelvis with 6 minutes emission and 2 minutes transmission finished the diagnostic acquisition procedure.</description>

            <description>The MRI examination was performed on a 1.5Tesla MRI system (Gyroscan ACS-NT, Philips, Hamburg, Germany) with combined QBody and endorectal coil. Pelvic assessment and lymph node staging was effected with 5mm T2w TSE transversal and a coronal STIR sequence. For prostate assessment, 3mm endorectal T2w SE sagittal, transversal and coronal sequences were acquired. Transversal sequences were angulated 90° to intraprostatic bladder catheter to allow exact correlation with histological holoptical slices.</description>

            <description>PET images at 45 min p.i. and 65 min p.i. (post injection) were fused with transversal endorectal and QBody T2w MRI images by using Hermes Medical Solutions Multi Modality landmark fusion tool. The four PET/MRI spot markers served as references. Without any patient movement between both modalities the fused images fitted exactly.</description>

        <description>PET positive lesions in patients with Gleason &gt;6(3+3),n=43 were measured on its own and evaluated as malignant just as hypointense lesions on MRI. In PET/MRI analysis, MRI suspect lesions without FEC uptake were considered not to be malignant. PET positive lesions in central periurethral zone with inhomogenous signal intensity and sharp edges on MRI images were also considered to be benign. PET positive lesions in the peripheral zone without a hypointense correlate on MRI were considered to be malignant. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, negative &amp; positive predictive values were determined.</description>

            <description>PET scans were performed on a LSO scanner (ECAT ACCEL, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) by using a multiphase protocol starting with a &quot;cold&quot; transmission scan of the lower pelvis. This was followed by a list mode emission scan with 10 frames à 1 minute starting immediately after the administration of 3.3MBq [18F]Fluoroethylcholine chloride (FEC; Eckert &amp; Ziegler EURO-PET Berlin GmbH) as a bolus through the cubital vein. Acquisition parameters were 3 minutes emission scan and 2 minutes transmission scan for each bed position. Therefore the prostate region was scanned again at 45 minutes p.i. (post injection) A delayed local acquisition at 65 minutes over the lower pelvis with 6 minutes emission and 2 minutes transmission finished the diagnostic acquisition procedure.</description>

            <description>The MRI examination was performed on a 1.5Tesla MRI system (Gyroscan ACS-NT, Philips, Hamburg, Germany) with combined QBody and endorectal coil. Pelvic assessment and lymph node staging was effected with 5mm T2w TSE transversal and a coronal STIR sequence. For prostate assessment, 3mm endorectal T2w SE sagittal, transversal and coronal sequences were acquired. Transversal sequences were angulated 90° to intraprostatic bladder catheter to allow exact correlation with histological holoptical slices.</description>

The four PET/MRI spot markers served as references. Without any patient movement between both modalities the fused images fitted exactly.</description>

        <description>PET positive lesions were measured on its own and evaluated as malignant just as hypointense lesions on MRI. In PET/MRI analysis, MRI suspect lesions without FEC uptake were considered not to be malignant. PET positive lesions in central periurethral zone with inhomogenous signal intensity and sharp edges on MRI images were also considered to be benign. PET positive lesions in the peripheral zone without a hypointense correlate on MRI were considered to be malignant. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, negative and positive predictive values were determined without malign lesions &lt;=5mm.</description>

            <description>PET scans were performed on a LSO scanner (ECAT ACCEL, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) by using a multiphase protocol starting with a &quot;cold&quot; transmission scan of the lower pelvis. This was followed by a list mode emission scan with 10 frames à 1 minute starting immediately after the administration of 3.3MBq [18F]Fluoroethylcholine chloride (FEC; Eckert &amp; Ziegler EURO-PET Berlin GmbH) as a bolus through the cubital vein. Acquisition parameters were 3 minutes emission scan and 2 minutes transmission scan for each bed position. Therefore the prostate region was scanned again at 45 minutes p.i. (post injection) A delayed local acquisition at 65 minutes over the lower pelvis with 6 minutes emission and 2 minutes transmission finished the diagnostic acquisition procedure.</description>

            <description>The MRI examination was performed on a 1.5Tesla MRI system (Gyroscan ACS-NT, Philips, Hamburg, Germany) with combined QBody and endorectal coil. Pelvic assessment and lymph node staging was effected with 5mm T2w TSE transversal and a coronal STIR sequence. For prostate assessment, 3mm endorectal T2w SE sagittal, transversal and coronal sequences were acquired. Transversal sequences were angulated 90° to intraprostatic bladder catheter to allow exact correlation with histological holoptical slices.</description>

The four PET/MRI spot markers served as references. Without any patient movement between both modalities the fused images fitted exactly.</description>

          <description>The day before surgery, fasting patients received a bladder catheter right before Positron-Emission-Tomography/ Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PET/MRI) examination to avoid different sizes of the urinary bladder in PET and MRI scan and to reduce bladder FEC-activity overlay of the prostate. After applying the endorectal MRI coil patients were positioned in a vacuum mattress on MRI table. Additionally, 4 PET/MRI multimodality spot markers containing 37kBq [22Na] and a MRI T2w (T2 weighed) hyperintense gel were attached at the hip region to allow landmark PET/MRI fusion. After MRI acquisition the modular MRI table was fixed on the PET table system. Patients kept in the same position during the whole procedure. PET scans were performed by using a multiphase protocol starting with a list mode emission scan immediately after the administration of 3.3MBq [18F]fluoroethylcholine (FEC) as a bolus through the cubital vein.</description>
