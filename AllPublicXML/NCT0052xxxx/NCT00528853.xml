  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A major source of graft failure and dysfunction in lung transplantation is known to be
      bronchiolitis obliterans (BO)and its clinical correlate called bronchiolitis obliterans
      syndrome(BOS). In fact, BOS is the leading cause of death in lung recipients beyond one year
      post transplant. Currently, our ability to assess lung injury after transplant is less than
      ideal.

      The purpose of this study is to use new computerized tomography(CT) technology, specifically
      , 64 bit acquisition, to detect and predict the onset of lung injuries, with the hope of
      finding better therapies that currently exist.

      Total enrollment : 10

      Lung transplant patients will undergo CT Scans before scheduled bronchoscopies which are
      routinely performed at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post transplant. Imaging will be done with
      the newest generation scanner, with intent to analyze all pertinent areas of the lung for
      pathology, but especially the bronchial anastomoses, the lung parenchyma with focus on gas
      exchanging lobules of the lung, and any suspected abnormalities from physical exam,
      laboratory tests, or prior chest xray.

      CT imaging will precede bronchoscopy and biopsy so that CT interpretation will be
      unencumbered by changes due to the bronchoscopic procedure.
