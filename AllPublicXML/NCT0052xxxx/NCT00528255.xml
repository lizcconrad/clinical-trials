             Biopsies, including cone biopsy of the cervix, are permitted;

          -  Administration of oxytocin or any cervical ripening or labor inducing agents
             (including mechanical methods) or a tocolytic drug within 7 days prior to enrollment.
             Magnesium sulfate is permitted if prescribed as treatment for pre-eclampsia or
             pregnancy inducted hypertension;

          -  Severe pre-eclampsia marked by CNS findings, HELLP syndrome, or other end-organ
             affliction;

          -  Suspected or confirmed cephalopelvic disproportion and/or fetal malpresentation;

          -  Diagnosed fetal abnormalities;

          -  Suspected or confirmed intrauterine growth retardation (less than 10% estimated fetal
             weight for dates);

          -  Any evidence of fetal compromise at baseline (e.g., non-reassuring fetal heart rate
             pattern or meconium staining);

          -  Receipt of NSAID (including aspirin) within 4 hours of study treatment;

          -  Ruptured membranes ≥48 hours prior to the start of treatment or suspected
             chorioamnionitis;

          -  Fever (oral or aural temperature &gt; 37.5C);

          -  Any condition in which vaginal delivery is contraindicated e.g., placenta previa or
             any unexplained genital bleeding at any time after 24 weeks during this pregnancy;

          -  Known or suspected allergy to misoprostol, dinoprostone, other prostaglandins or any
             of the excipients;

          -  Any condition urgently requiring delivery;

          -  Unable to comply with the protocol.
