      Objective: Chemotherapy regimens containing alkylating agents result in primordial follicle
      death and premature ovarian failure. Depending on the age and the type/dose of chemotherapy,
      some women may continue to menstruate. Our aim was to ascertain the impact of chemotherapy on
      ovarian reserve in patients who previously received chemotherapy by response to controlled
      ovarian hyper stimulation (COH) and anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) levels. Design: Prospective
      study with retrospective controls Materials and Methods: 45 cancer patients underwent
      controlled ovarian stimulation for IVF before (30 patients, 30 IVF cycles) or after (15
      patients, 30 IVF cycles) chemotherapy. Patients with basal serum FSH &gt;13mIU/mL or E2&gt;70pg/ml
      were excluded. AMH was measured on previously stored serum samples from the day of initiation
      of the ovarian stimulation. Results: Mean ages and baseline FSH levels of pre- and
      postchemotherapy IVF patients were similar (36.8±0.91 vs. 36.3±1). The mean interval from
      completion of chemotherapy to IVF was 8.03±1.32 years (range 1-23). Of the 30 IVF cycles in
      post-chemotherapy patients, 22 received alkylating agents and 8 did not.

      There were no significant differences between the study and control cycles regarding day-2
      estradiol (E2), length of stimulation, total gonadotropin dose, and E2 on hCG day (table 2).
      Cycle cancellation rate was 20% and 26.67% for pre and post-chemotherapy patients,
      respectively. The number of oocytes retrieved and fertilized were significantly higher in
      pre-chemotherapy group (p&lt;0.0001). Two clinical pregnancies were achieved in the
      postchemotherapy group, one ending in spontaneous abortion and the other in the delivery of a
      healthy baby (6.67% clinical pregnancy rate and 3.33% delivery rate per attempted cycle). All
      fertilized oocytes in the control group were cryopreserved at 2-pronuclei stage.

      Baseline AMH levels were significantly lower in post chemotherapy IVF patients compared to
      those who underwent IVF prior to chemotherapy (0.270 ±0.077 vs. 0.84±0.27 ng/ml, p=0.03). In
      the pre-chemotherapy group there was a positive correlation between the AMH levels and the
      number of oocytes retrieved (r=0.663, p=0.004 ). This correlation was not detected in the
      post chemotherapy group (r=0.205).
