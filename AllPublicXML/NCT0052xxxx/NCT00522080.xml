      Objective: To study the feasibility and validity of a two-step telephone screening procedure
      for symptomatic knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA) in the general population.

      Method: The screening questionnaire was based on signs and symptoms, previous diagnosis of
      OA, and validated OA criteria. A random sample of telephone numbers was obtained and, at each
      number, one individual aged 40 to 75 years was included. A physical examination and knee or
      hip radiographs were offered when the screen was positive. A sample of individuals with
      negative screens was also examined. The diagnosis of hip/knee OA was based on either American
      College of Rheumatology criteria for signs and symptoms and Kellgren-Lawrence radiographic
      stage 2 or greater. Prevalence rates were estimated with correction for the performance of
      the screening procedure.
