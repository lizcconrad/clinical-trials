      The purpose of this research study is to determine if ranibizumab can prevent the growth of
      neurofibromas. We will also be collecting extra blood and serum samples to help us learn more
      about NF1. Ranibizumab is a drug that affects the development of blood vessels that feed
      tumors. It targets a substance in the body called VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor).
      VEGF helps tumors to grow and survive by supporting the growth of blood vessels that bring
      nutrients to the tumor. VEGF is made by cancerous tumors and also by non-cancerous tumors
      such as neurofibromas.

      -  Participants will receive one injection of ranibizumab into 3 tumors on their skin (one
           dose per tumor) on day 1 of treatment. One other tumor will be injected with normal
           saline solution. The saline solution-called a control-is necessary to determine whether
           injections (without medicine) can cause a tumor to shrink. Tumors will be measured and
           photographed prior to treatment. Ranibizumab tumors will be removed on days 8, 15, and
           29; the saline treated tumor will be removed on day 29.

        -  Participants will come into the clinic once a week for a total of 4 weeks and then again
           on Days 35. 57 and 85 for post-treatment visits. Some of the following tests and
           procedures will be performed: physical examination (including photographs of tumors),
           review of current medications, vital signs, routine blood tests, serum chemistry blood
           tests, interstitial fluid pressure measurements and tumor samples.
