      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate whether a Rituximab plus 2 CdA combination therapy
      is effective and safe in the treatment of patients with advanced or relapsed lymphoma of the
      mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no chemotherapeutic standard treatment for patients with MALT lymphoma
      either presenting with disseminated disease or with relapsing/refractory disease following
      local treatment (including radiation) or eradication of HP. Various compounds have been
      tested, including alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil, the nucleoside
      analog cladribine (2CdA), as well as combination regimens including CHOP or MCP
      (mitoxantrone, chlorambucil, prednisone), but only limited data exists from prospective
      trials. Thus, trials to evaluate the potential of new compounds in patients with advanced
      MALT lymphoma are not only justified, but seem warranted.

      While systemic approaches were until recently thought to be justified only in patients with
      disseminated disease, emerging data suggest that also patients with localized disease
      potentially amenable to radiation may benefit from systemic treatment. This has been
      demonstrated for ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma and recently also for gastric MALT lymphoma in
      a randomized fashion, where application of chemotherapy resulted in a significantly longer
      time to relapse as opposed to surgery or radiation without impairing overall survival.

      Both 2CdA and rituximab have been demonstrated as active single agents in MALT lymphoma with
      mild toxicity profiles and no data on combination therapy with rituximab plus chemotherapy in
      MALT lymphoma have been published to date. This study will therefore evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of Rituximab plus 2CdA in patients with advanced or relapsed lymphoma of the
      mucose associated lymphoid tissue.
