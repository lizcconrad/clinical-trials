  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether computerised cognitive rehabilitation
      training improves cognition in children who have had cerebral malaria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral malaria affects several children in sub-Saharan Africa leaving some survivors with
      cognitive problems especially in attention and memory. There are currently no tested
      interventions for such deficits resulting from infectious diseases like malaria or other
      causes. Providing such interventions will go a long way in helping these children achieve
      their full potential.

    <description>A computerised cognitive training package where children will be required to complete several cognitive tasks. The aim is to strengthen the different cognitive processes during these tasks which in turn may lead to improve cognitive processes.
Children will complete these tasks in 16 session for 8 weeks.</description>
