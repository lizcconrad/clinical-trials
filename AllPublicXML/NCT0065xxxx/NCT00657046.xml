  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In clinical trials in Japan, droxidopa has been shown to be effective in affecting blood
      pressure changes upon orthostatic challenge in patients with autonomic dysfunction, as well
      as reducing the severity and frequency of symptoms of orthostatic hypotension in these
      patients. The efficacy of droxidopa in ameliorating symptoms in patients undergoing dialysis
      has also been demonstrated in the literature and clinical trials conducted in Japan. The
      current study will investigate the clinical efficacy of two different doses of droxidopa in
      patients with intradialytic hypotension over a 4 week treatment period with a placebo
      control. The clinical efficacy will be evaluated by changes in hypotension- related symptoms,
      as well as changes in blood pressure prior to, during and following, HD sessions as compared
      to their pre-treatment baseline values.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of droxidopa in HD patients with intradialytic hypotension.
      The study will be conducted in up to 15 centers, with a sufficient number of patients
      enrolled to allow 75 patients to be randomized into 3 study groups (25 randomized to placebo,
      25 randomized to 400 mg droxidopa, and 25 randomized to 600 mg droxidopa).

      The study will consist of an initial screening period (up to 7 days) to confirm eligibility
      followed by a 2 week baseline, and a 4 week treatment period. During baseline and treatment
      visits SBP and DBP measurements will be collected using a consistent method immediately pre-,
      during and immediately post-dialysis. SBP, DBP and heart rate measurements will be taken
      every 20 minutes during HD sessions.

      There will be 19 scheduled visits, not including the post-treatment follow-up visit, during
      this trial; Visit 1 (Screening), Visits 2 through 7 (baseline and randomization), Visits 8
      through 19 (tri-weekly treatment visits). Each visit will coincide with the patient's normal
      dialysis treatments.

      All patients will be followed for 30 days following the completion of the active treatment
      period (or premature withdrawal) to check for the occurrence of adverse events (AEs).

      Patients will attend the study center as out-patients.

      Eligible patients will be assigned a unique identification number at screening, and prior to
      the first treatment visit will be randomized to one of the following treatment groups:

      Group A: Droxidopa at 400 mg (2 capsules each containing 200 mg droxidopa plus one capsule
      with mannitol substituted for droxidopa) Group B: Droxidopa at 600 mg (3 capsules each
      containing 200 mg droxidopa) Group C: Placebo (3 capsules with mannitol substituted for
      droxidopa) Each patient will take 3 capsules 1 hour prior to each dialysis procedure with
      approximately 100 mL (typically half a glass) of water.

      The primary measure of efficacy will be the change from baseline (visits 2-7) in average mean
      arterial blood pressure compared to that during treatment (visit 14-19).

      The secondary measures of efficacy will be:

        -  Change between baseline (visits 2-7) and treatment (visits 14-19) in average mean nadir
           systolic and diastolic blood pressures during hemodialysis;

        -  Change in the number of hypotension-induced interventions during hemodialysis (HD)
           sessions;

        -  Change in hypotension-induced symptoms measured during hemodialysis;

        -  Change in daily symptoms associated with hemodialysis;

        -  Change in fatigue using the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20). The safety of
           droxidopa will be evaluated based on the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events
           (AE) and specific evaluation of blood pressure, heart rate (HR), ECG, and laboratory
           findings across the study.

    <measure>Change in Average Mean Arterial Blood Pressure During Hemodialysis</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change between average baseline (visits 2-7) mean arterial blood pressure during hemodialysis and average treatment (visits 14-19) mean arterial blood pressure during hemodialysis.
The calculation of MAP was based on the systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure measurements taken during each valid HD session, using the traditional formula:
MAP = (SBP+2*DBP)/3 for each time-point. The mean of the intradialytic measurements was calculated for each valid HD session, and these daily mean values were averaged across the visits within each period.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Hypotension-induced Symptom Severity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The hypotension-induced symptom severity score is the sum of a 6 question scale (each rated 0 [asymptomatic] to 4 [severe]). The questions look at cramps, dizziness, headache, nausea, itchiness, and restless legs syndrome experienced during dialysis.
The outcome looks at the difference between the average baseline score (visits 2-7) and the average on-treatment scores (visits 14-19). The baseline value will be the arithmetic average of the values collected at each of the six baseline visits (visits 2-7). The on treatment value will be defined as the average of the values collected at each of the last six treatment visits (visits 14-19).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Daily Symptoms Associated With Hemodialysis</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Daily symptoms associated with hemodialysis score is the sum of an 8 question scale (each rated 0 [asymptomatic] to 4 [severe]). The questions look at fatigability, malaise/weakness, physical disturbance on standing, coldness of limbs, dizziness/lightheadedness, dizziness on standing, general bad feeling, and sleep disorders and asks how each of these items affected the patients daily activities on that day.
The outcome looks at the difference between the average baseline score (visits 2-7) and the average on-treatment scores (visits 14-19). The baseline value will be the arithmetic average of the values collected at each of the six baseline visits (visits 2-7). The on treatment value will be defined as the average of the values collected at each of the last six treatment visits (visits 14-19).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be measured by the general fatigue domain (items 1, 5, 12 and 16) of MFI-20 and will be summarized by treatment group and treatment period. The scores per item run from 1 to 5. A higher score indicates more fatigue. Therefore, the items indicative for fatigue need to be recoded (1=5, 2=4, 3=3, 4=2, 5=1). This concerns item: 5 and 16. A total score is calculated by summation of the scores of the individual items. Scores can range from the minimum of 4 to the maximum of 20.
The value at baseline (visit 7) will be subtracted from the value on treatment (visit 19 or visit 13 if visit 19 is not available).</description>

    <description>Change from baseline (visits 2-7) to end of study (HD visits 14-19) in the drop in systolic blood pressure from pre-hemodialysis to 5 minutes post-hemodialysis.
The baseline value was the arithmetic average of the values collected at each of the six baseline visits (visits 2-7). The on treatment value was defined as the average of the values collected at each of the last six treatment visits (visits 14-19).</description>

        <description>Change between average baseline (visits 2-7) mean arterial blood pressure during hemodialysis and average treatment (visits 14-19) mean arterial blood pressure during hemodialysis.
The calculation of MAP was based on the systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure measurements taken during each valid HD session, using the traditional formula:
MAP = (SBP+2*DBP)/3 for each time-point. The mean of the intradialytic measurements was calculated for each valid HD session, and these daily mean values were averaged across the visits within each period.</description>

        <title>Change in the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20)</title>
        <description>Fatigue will be measured by the general fatigue domain (items 1, 5, 12 and 16) of MFI-20 and will be summarized by treatment group and treatment period. The scores per item run from 1 to 5. A higher score indicates more fatigue. Therefore, the items indicative for fatigue need to be recoded (1=5, 2=4, 3=3, 4=2, 5=1). This concerns item: 5 and 16. A total score is calculated by summation of the scores of the individual items. Scores can range from the minimum of 4 to the maximum of 20.
The value at baseline (visit 7) will be subtracted from the value on treatment (visit 19 or visit 13 if visit 19 is not available).</description>
        <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>Patients must have completed at least visit 14. Three placebo patients did not complete their Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory during this visit.</population>
