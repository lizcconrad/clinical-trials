      The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of the oral contraceptive YASMIN
      (containing: drospirenone 3 mg/ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg) in comparison with the oral
      contraceptive MICROGYNON (containing: levonorgestrel 150 mcg/ethinyl estradiol 30mcg) on
      factors of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in female subjects

    <description>The study medication was packaged in 21-tablet blister packs. Each subject kit contained 7 blister packs plus 1 reserve blister pack.Subjects randomly assigned to the treatment group received 21 consecutive days of hormonally active tablets (3mg DRSP/0.03 mgEE). In each treatment cycle 21 tablets (1 tablet daily) have to be taken in sequence, followed by a pill-free interval of 7 days. The treatment period was 7 cycles (28 days per cycle).</description>

             Including:

               -  Presence or history of thromboembolic process in veins (such as deep venous
                  thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) or arteries (e.g., stroke, myocardial infarction)
                  or a known genetic component (homozygous), venous thromboembolic event in a close
                  relative (parents or siblings) at younger age (&lt;/= 40 years)

             at least 6 months between the subsidence of a viral hepatitis (normalization of the
             liver parameters) and the start of the study medication.

          -  Use of preparations where experience shows affect on the activity of hepatic enzymes.
