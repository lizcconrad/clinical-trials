    <description>SF-36V2 is a generic 36-item generic health status measure covering 2 summary measures: physical component summary (PCS) and mental health component score (MCS); it consists of 8 subscales. The MCS is represented by 4 subscales: vitality, social function, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. Participants self-report on items in a subscale that have choices per item. Scoring is done for both MCS subscale scores and summary scores; for each, the range is 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>

        <title>Patient's Global Assessment of Arthritis - Visual Analog Score (VAS)</title>
        <description>The Patient’s Global Assessment of Arthritis was an evaluation based on the patient’s disease signs, functional capacity and physical examination, and was independent of the Physician’s Global Assessment of Arthritis. The patient self-assessed how the arthritis affected their lives at the time of the visit using the visual analog scale (VAS).
Patients answered the following: “Considering all the ways in which illness and health conditions may affect you at this time, please make a mark below to show how you are doing.” The patient’s response was recorded using the 100 mm visual analog scale between 0 (Very Well) and 100 (Very Poorly).</description>

        <title>Health Assessment Questionnaire – Disability Index (HAQ-DI)</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI contains a list of items that assessed the degree of difficulty experienced in 8 categories of daily living activities (included in 20 questions) over the past week: Dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and other activities. Each activity category consists of 2 or 3 items. For each question in the HAQ-DI, the level of difficulty was scored from 0 to 3 with 0 equal to &quot;without difficulty,&quot; 1 equal to &quot;with some difficulty,&quot; 2 equal to &quot;with much difficulty&quot; and 3 equal to &quot;unable to do.&quot; Any activity that required assistance from another individual or required the use of an assistive device adjusted to a minimum score of 2 to represent a more limited functional status.

          <description>The HAQ-DI contains a list of items that assessed the degree of difficulty experienced in 8 categories of daily living activities (included in 20 questions) over the past week: Dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and other activities. Each activity category consists of 2 or 3 items. For each question in the HAQ-DI, the level of difficulty was scored from 0 to 3 with 0 equal to “without difficulty,” 1 equal to “with some difficulty,” 2 equal to “with much difficulty” and 3 equal to “unable to do.” Any activity that required assistance from another individual or required the use of an assistive device adjusted to a minimum score of 2 to represent a more limited functional status.
The HAQ-DI score takes values between 0 and 3, with a higher score indicating greater disability.</description>

        <description>The DAS28-4(CRP) score is a measure of the subject's disease activity. DAS28-4(CRP) is based on the tender joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), patient's global assessment of disease activity and CRP. DAS28 provides a number on a scale (0 to 10) indicating current disease activity. A score above 5.1 means high disease activity and a score below 3.2 indicates low disease activity.</description>

        <description>The DAS28-4(CRP) score is a measure of the subject's disease activity. DAS28-4(CRP) is based on the tender joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), patient's global assessment of disease activity and CRP. DAS28 provides a number on a scale (0 to 10) indicating current disease activity. A score above 5.1 means high disease activity and a score below 3.2 indicates low disease activity.</description>

        <description>The SF-36v2 (Acute version) is a 36-item generic health status measure that yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures.
The SF-36v2 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale. The lower the score the more disability, while the higher the score the less disability.</description>

        <description>The SF-36v2 (Acute version) is a 36-item generic health status measure that yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures.
The SF-36v2 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale. The lower the score the more disability, while the higher the score the less disability.</description>

        <description>The SF-36v2 (Acute version) is a 36-item generic health status measure that yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures.
The SF-36v2 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale. The lower the score the more disability, while the higher the score the less disability.</description>

        <description>The SF-36v2 (Acute version) is a 36-item generic health status measure that yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures.
The SF-36v2 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale. The lower the score the more disability, while the higher the score the less disability.</description>

        <title>SF-36 Health Questionnaire - Version 2 (SF-36v2) - Mental Health</title>
        <description>The SF-36v2 (Acute version) is a 36-item generic health status measure that yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures.
The SF-36v2 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale. The lower the score the more disability, while the higher the score the less disability.</description>

        <title>SF-36 Health Questionnaire - Version 2 (SF-36v2) - Mental Health Component Score</title>
        <description>SF-36V2 is a generic 36-item generic health status measure covering 2 summary measures: physical component summary (PCS) and mental health component score (MCS); it consists of 8 subscales. The MCS is represented by 4 subscales: vitality, social function, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. Participants self-report on items in a subscale that have choices per item. Scoring is done for both MCS subscale scores and summary scores; for each, the range is 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>

          <description>The SF-36v2 (Acute version) is a 36-item generic health status measure that yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures. The SF-36v2 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale. The lower the score the more disability, while the higher the score the less disability. Additionally, two summary scale scores can be calculated: the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). Summary statistics were calculated for each of the 8 scales, the 2 summary measures, and changes from baseline for each treatment group.</description>

          <title>SF-36 Health Questionnaire - Version 2 (SF-36v2) - Physical Component Score</title>
          <description>The SF-36v2 (Acute version) is a 36-item generic health status measure that yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures. The SF-36v2 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale. The lower the score the more disability, while the higher the score the less disability. Additionally, two summary scale scores can be calculated: the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). Summary statistics were calculated for each of the 8 scales, the 2 summary measures, and changes from baseline for each treatment group.</description>
