  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Betathalassemia major is a disease of the blood and bone marrow. You were born with it and it
      has made you unable to make normal hemoglobin and red cells. You have been receiving red
      blood cell transfusions all your life. These transfusions do not cure your disease. The
      problem with transfusions is that they contain a lot of iron. With time iron builds up in
      your body and will eventually hurt some of your organs . Because of this buildup of iron ,
      you are taking medicine that helps your body get rid of the extra iron.

      Today, the only other treatment is bone marrow or stem cell transplant. It can only be done
      when a matched donor is available. This is most often a brother, sister, or parent. Bone
      marrow transplant may cure betathalassemia major. If you have a transplant and it is
      successful, you will no longer have the disease. Without a matched sibling or parent, the
      standard treatment is to keep having transfusions.

      In the near future, we will be testing a new treatment for making normal hemoglobin and
      normal red blood cells. We have recreated the healthy hemoglobin gene in a test tube. We are
      able to use it and put it back into cells. This is called gene therapy. We have been able to
      put this gene into the stem cells of mice with thalassemia. These mice were cured. We now
      plan to take that gene and put it into stem cells from people who have betathalassemia major.
      We will then inject those stem cells back into that person's blood.

      In general, we can obtain more stem cells from the blood of a person than from the bone
      marrow . In order to do so, we must give that person a blood growth factor. The growth factor
      stimulates the bone marrow to make more stem cells. That growth factor is called granulocyte
      colony stimulating factor (GCSF), or Filgrastim.

      The purpose of this trial is to find out if the drug GCSF has any side effects on you, and if
      you will make more stem cells in response to it. This trial is not a gene therapy trial. This
      trial will not help your thalassemia.

    <description>Daily injections under the skin of a GCSF. This is done for 5 to 6 days. On days 1, 3,5, and if need on day 6. To collect stem cells, we need good access to this blood. If the patient has good veins, we do this by placing an IV on each one of their arms. The peripheral blood stem cell collection is usually an outpatient procedure and takes about 3 to 4 hours. You will have blood work and a physical exam on days one, three, and five while you are getting GCSF.
These will be done again 24 hours after your stem cells are collected.</description>
