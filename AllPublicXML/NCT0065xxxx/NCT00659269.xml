  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many types of chemotherapy may cause nerve damage as a side effect. This neurotoxicity can
      manifest as peripheral sensory neuropathy (characterized by numbness, tingling, or pain). The
      goal of this study is to determine the efficacy of the combination of vitamin B6 and B12 in
      preventing chemotherapy induced neuropathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathy can be a significant side effect of chemotherapy using platinum compounds,
      taxanes, and vinca alkaloids. There is clinical and preclinical data that vitamin B6 and B12
      may alleviate neuropathy in experimentally induced neuropathy in animal models, or clinical
      neuropathy such as diabetic neuropathy. This is a randomized phase III study of the use of
      multivitamins with or without vitamin B6 and B12 to prevent or relieve neuropathic toxicity
      from chemotherapy in patients receiving chemotherapy. Patients will be stratified by type of
      chemotherapy agent (3 groups), presence or absence of neuropathy at baseline, and randomized
      to receive placebo or vitamin B6/B12 supplementation.

    <description>Neurotoxicity is evaluated using The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Taxane (FACT-Tax) questionnaire. FACT-Tax is a validated, self-reported instrument. The questionnaire consists of 11 questions and possible scores for each question range from 0 (no neurotoxicity symptoms) to 4 (worst possible neurotoxicity symptoms). The total score for any patient can therefore range from 0 to 44. The questionnaire is given to patients to fill out at baseline (prior to chemotherapy treatment) and the mean total score for all patients is reported.</description>

        <description>Neurotoxicity is evaluated using The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Taxane (FACT-Tax) questionnaire. FACT-Tax is a validated, self-reported instrument.

The total score for any patient can therefore range from 0 to 44. The questionnaire is given to patients to fill out at baseline (prior to chemotherapy treatment) and the mean total score for all patients is reported.</description>

          <title>Neurotoxicity Assessment at Cycle 4</title>
          <description>Neurotoxicity is evaluated using The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Taxane (FACT-Tax) questionnaire. FACT-Tax is a validated, self-reported instrument. The questionnaire consists of 16 questions and possible scores for each question range from 0 (no neurotoxicity symptoms) to 4 (worst possible neurotoxicity symptoms). The total score for any patient can therefore range from 0 to 44. The questionnaire is given to patients to fill out at completion of cycle 4 of their chemotherapy treatment and the mean total score for all patients is reported.</description>
