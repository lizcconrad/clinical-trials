  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large number of patients are currently on Antiplatelet inhibition using aspirin or Plavix
      therapy (A Thieno pyridine - ADP mediated platelet inhibitor). A group of these patients
      often require Cardiac and/or Vascular surgical procedures. These patients are at a higher
      risk for perioperative bleeding complications and higher re-operation/re-exploration for
      bleeding and subsequent blood product transfusions.

      The aim of this protocol is to assess platelet function via the &quot;Verify Now&quot; device prior to
      surgery. The Verify Now device requires a small drop of fresh blood for each sample and is an
      FDA approved device.

      Our initial goal is to establish if a certain degree of platelet function abnormality can
      predict a higher bleeding complication or higher transfusions (Phase I, 20 patients). This
      initial study will allow us to determine a sample size for Phase II. Phase II will maintain
      the same protocol, however after completion of Phase I, a more accurate sample size
      determination can be made. Additionally, we want to establish if knowledge of platelet
      dysfunction will change procedure technique or preparation to lower bleeding and/or lead to
      cancellation/rescheduling of procedure (Phase III).

      Participants will be those patients who are taking plavix and are undergoing vascular or
      cardiac surgery. They will undergo a platelet function evaluation measured as Platelet
      Response Unit (PRU) via the &quot;verify now&quot; device on admission/pre surgery. This test involves
      taking 1 drop of blood from the patient, one time, before the procedure. The Verify Now
      device is FDA approved.

      Perioperative bleeding will be assessed by absolute drop in hematocrit immediate post-op
      compared to the immediate preoperative value. An additional discharge hematocrit will be used
      if no blood products have been used during the initial hospital stay. Hematocrit evaluation
      via a complete blood count is a part of standard patient care. Additionally, utilization of
      blood products (factors, PLT, PRBC's, etc.) will be assessed.

      In order to conduct the research, patients will be identified by reviewing the OR schedule.
      All consecutive patients on ASA/Plavix will be mailed a letter in order to introduce them to
      the study. The letter provides a phone number to call if the patient does NOT want to receive
      a phone call from the investigative staff. This letter is uploaded under item 18-02 of the
      study application. If patients do not call the office, then the investigative staff will call
      the potential participants to introduce the study. Final consent will be completed in PACU on
      arrival at the hospital for planned surgical procedure.

      A Hematocrit will be performed on the consented patient preoperatively, immediately post-op,
      and at discharge. A PRU will be assessed using a few drops of the patients' blood
      preoperatively (PACU). Patients' records will be reviewed to assess use of blood products. No
      additional follow up is required.

      Patients' care will be no different than current standard of care, other than the 1 &quot;verify
      now&quot; test, which is done before the procedure.
