    <textblock>
      Background/rationale: Ertapenem is an innovative antimicrobial agent, which is approved in
      the European Union for diabetic foot infections of the skin and soft tissue. Although its
      antimicrobial spectrum and activity against ESBL-strains are promising to treat infected
      ulcers associated with diabetes, there is a lack of data on tissue pharmacokinetics of
      ertapenem in this patient population. However, for antimicrobial efficacy it is important to
      show that the antibiotic achieves sufficient concentrations at the site of infection, i.e. in
      tissue. A recent clinical study by Burkhardt et al. (Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy,
      2006) using the microdialysis technique showed that the free tissue concentrations after a
      single dose of 1 g ertapenem are sufficient and adequate to kill most relevant bacteria,
      suggesting efficacy of ertapenem for soft tissue infections. It is well known that there is
      no accumulation of ertapenem in plasma after multiple doses of 1 g every 24 h in patients
      without significantly impaired renal function. The single dose study by Burkhardt et al. also
      suggests that only negligible drug accumulation can be expected in soft tissues of healthy
      young volunteers after multiple doses. However, it was shown for other antibiotics that
      tissue PK may be significantly different under pathologic conditions, leading to impaired
      penetration, but subsequent accumulation after multiple doses due to a longer tissue half
      life than in healthy volunteers. Since the properties of inflamed tissue may diverge from
      those of healthy tissue it is important to evaluate which concentrations of ertapenem are
      reached in inflamed tissue after multiple doses.

      Clinical study: In the present study we will measure the concentrations of ertapenem over
      time in plasma and infected tissue of 10 diabetes patients after multiple doses. The
      microdialysis technique will be used. The ertapenem concentrations will be measured in
      inflamed tissue and in non-inflamed subcutaneous tissue to identify the effect of
      inflammation on pharmacokinetics. The findings of the present study will help to confirm the
      efficacy of ertapenem for the indication of diabetic soft tissue infections.
