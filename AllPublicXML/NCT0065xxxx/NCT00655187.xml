  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Rotarix™ vaccine in the general population
      in Singapore by monitoring the overall reduction in RV SGE and also by assessing the direct
      protection offered by the vaccine in hospitalised infants through a case-control study.

        Children less than 5 years of age, hospitalised with acute GE, living in Singapore served
        by the hospital participating in the study (KK Hospital) and whose parents/ guardians are
        willing to provide informed consent, will be considered as cases.

        Cases will be limited to those subjects who are born after 1 November 2005, aged at least
        16 weeks and whose stool samples have been tested positive for rotavirus (RV).

        For each case, two controls hospitalised for acute disease with non-GE causes in the same
        hospital during the same period, will be included in the study after matching them by date
        of birth.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion criteria for surveillance subjects

          -  A male or female child aged &lt; 60 months at the time of admission (a child becomes
             ineligible on the day of its fifth birthday).

          -  Subject admitted with acute GE as an inpatient to the study site during the study
             period.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject.
             Selection criteria for cases

        Cases will be limited to those surveillance subjects:

          -  who are born after 1 November 2005 (date of availability of Rotarix™ vaccination in
             Singapore),

          -  who are aged at least 16 weeks at the time of hospital admission.

          -  whose stool samples are tested positive for RV. Selection criteria for controls

        All controls must satisfy the following criteria at study entry:

          -  Admitted for acute disease with non-GE causes in the same hospital as the case , with
             the closest admission date to the cases.

          -  Aged at least 16 weeks at the time of hospital admission.

          -  Born within a range of ± 2 weeks from the date of birth of cases. In case there is no
             suitable match, then the range would be extended to ± 4 weeks.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject's parents/guardians.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For enrolment of surveillance subjects

        The following criteria should be checked at the time of study entry. If any apply, the
        subject must not be included in the study:

          -  The diagnoses at admission to the study site do not include acute GE.

          -  Children for whom stool samples are not available up to 48 hours after admission.

          -  The onset of GE is after 48 hours of admission to the hospital (i.e. nosocomial GE).

          -  Children with a history of chronic and genetic diseases. For selection of cases

        In addition to the exclusion criteria for surveillance subjects, cases will not be selected
        if the following criterion applies:

          -  Subjects who had a previous episode of acute GE less than a week back i.e. recurrent
             GE episode.

          -  Subjects who have been already enrolled in the study.

          -  Subjects whose vaccination history could not be ascertained. For selection of controls

        The following criteria should be checked at the time of study entry. If any apply, the
        controls must not be included in the study:

          -  Child who has symptoms of GE on the day of interview of his/her parent or guardian or
             had an episode of GE within 14 days prior to the day of interview.

          -  Child who has been already enrolled in the study as case or control.

          -  The onset of GE occurs after admission at the hospital.

          -  Child whose vaccination history could not be ascertained.
