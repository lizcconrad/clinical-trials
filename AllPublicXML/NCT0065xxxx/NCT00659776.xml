  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to address safety and efficiency of a new iron particle contrast
      agent, ferumoxytol. This product may be more useful in viewing the vessels of the brain and
      areas in the brain on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or magnetic resonance angiography
      (MRA), than the standard substance, gadolinium, injected during MRI and MRA.

      Other ways in which ferumoxytol may help include the following:

        1. Ferumoxytol may provide the ability to better see inflammatory lesions on magnetic
           resonance imaging (MRI) scans

        2. Ferumoxytol may be useful in its ability to cross blood vessels into inflammatory
           processes, and

        3. Ferumoxytol, because of its size and ability to get into the area next to your
           inflammatory lesion and could assist in the treatment of inflammatory lesions
           association with cardiac surgery or CNS vascular surgery.

      Subjects are recruited as patients in one of the neurology, neurosurgery, neuro-oncology,
      Multiple Sclerosis Clinic or cardiothoracic surgery clinics at OHSU. Eligible subjects will
      be enrolled in different groups based on their disease (MS, cardiac surgery or CNS vascular
      surgery, stroke). Subsequently a MRI and MRA of the brain using the standard contrast agent
      (Gadolinium) will be obtained; this study will be compared with the ferumoxytol-contrasted
      MRA and MRIs performed the next day(s).

      Visit 1: the subjects are enrolled and distributed in their corresponding group; also basic
      laboratory studies are obtained as well as a Gadolinium contrasted MRI and MRA of the brain.

      For Groups 1 and 2 (MS and Stroke):

      Visit 2: Ferumoxytol will be injected as an i.v. bolus. The total dose over 2 hours will not
      exceed 510mg, and can be divided into multiple smaller doses such as 1 mg Fe/kg to optimize
      MRA imaging and may be diluted up to 4 fold in normal saline to reduce T2* effects in the MR
      angiography.

      Visit 3: 24 hours after the second visit an MRI with the standard contrast agent will be
      done.

      Last visit: 1 month after Ferumoxytol administration, the subject will be reassessed with
      physical and laboratory exams.

      For Groups 3 and 4 (Cardiac surgery or CNS vascular surgery):

      After the screening visit (Visit 1) and baseline MRI and MRA you will be randomly assigned to
      one of two groups. These groups are very similar but there are slight differences in the
      schedule of events.

        -  Group 3a and 4a: ferumoxytol infusion (Visit 2) before surgery

        -  Group 3b and 4b: ferumoxytol infusion (Visit 2) after surgery

      Visit 2: Ferumoxytol will be injected as an i.v. bolus. The total dose over 2 hours will not
      exceed 510mg, and can be divided into multiple smaller doses such as 1 mg Fe/kg to optimize
      MRA imaging and may be diluted up to 4 fold in normal saline to reduce T2* effects in the MR
      angiography.

      Visit 3: 24-72 hours after the second visit an MRI with the standard contrast agent will be
      done.

      Last visit: 1 month after Ferumoxytol administration, the subject will be reassessed with
      physical and laboratory exams.

             multiple sclerosis, stroke, or be requiring cardiac or CNS vascular surgery. Subjects
             with a CNS inflammatory lesion that is suspicious for neoplasm or radiation induced
             inflammation (vasculitis) will also be included (group 1a). McDonald's criteria will
             be used for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.

          -  Subjects must be 18 years or older

          -  Subjects will be followed for at least 1 month after the infusion of ferumoxytol.

             and give HIPAA authorization in accordance with institutional guidelines.

          -  Female subjects of child-bearing potential must be postmenopausal, surgically sterile,
             or using a reliable form of contraception for at least a month. These criteria can be
             waved at the discretion of the investigator if the one-month wait required is not in
             the best interest of the patient.

          -  Karnofsky must be 30% or greater

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with clinically significant signs of uncal herniation

          -  Subjects who have a contraindication for MRI: metal in their bodies (a cardiac
             pacemaker or other incompatible device), are severely agitated, or have an allergy to
             Gd contrast material.

          -  Subjects with known allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to parenteral iron,
             parenteral dextran, parenteral iron-dextran, or parenteral iron-polysaccharide
             preparations

          -  Subjects with known hepatic insufficiency or cirrhosis

          -  Subjects with known or suspected iron overload

          -  HIV-positive subjects on combination anti-retroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with ferumoxytol

          -  Pregnant or lactating women are excluded from this study because of possible risk to
             the fetus or infant.
