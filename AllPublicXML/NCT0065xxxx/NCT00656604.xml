      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
      imaging(DCE-MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and tissue proteomics, may help
      doctors find and diagnose breast cancer and plan the best treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying MRI and MRS with or without tissue proteomics
      analysis to see how well they work in evaluating healthy women and women who are undergoing
      surgery for breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To correlate data obtained by DCE-MRI and MRS in healthy women and in women who are
           undergoing surgery for breast cancer with data obtained by conventional X-ray
           mammography, tissue proteomics, and histopathology.

        -  To evaluate the impact of MRSI data on treatment planning for radiotherapy and/or
           surgery.

      OUTLINE: Healthy participants undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI and magnetic
      resonance spectroscopic (MRS) for longitudinal studies of breast imaging and spectroscopy.

      Patients with breast cancers undergo DCE-MRI and MRS prior to initiation of treatment (i.e.,
      surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy). After treatment has begun, patients then undergo
      repeat imaging (not more than 1 per month) for follow-up assessments and longitudinal
      studies.

      Breast tissue samples are collected from patients undergoing surgery. Samples are evaluated
      by histopathological and proteomic analysis for correlation with DCE-MRI and MRS findings.

      The study interventions are discontinued after definitive surgery is performed.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 healthy participants and 40 patients with breast cancer will
      be accrued for this study.
