On Day 0, one drop instilled in affected eye every 5 minutes for the first 30 minutes, every 30 minutes while awake, and every 2 hours after retiring; on Day 1, one drop instilled in affected eye every hour while awake and 4 hours after retiring; on Days 2 to 6, one drop instilled in affected eye every 2 hours while awake; on Days 7 to 21, one drop instilled in affected eye 4 times daily while awake. Treatment continued through Day 21 (or Day 28 if ulcer had not healed but was improving); dosing terminated when re-epithelialization was complete or on Day 28, whichever occurred sooner</description>
