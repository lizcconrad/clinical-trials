  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We wish to improve the swallowing function of patients with advanced cancer of the
      oesophagus, by carrying out a randomised clinical study in which we compare primary stenting
      followed by brachytherapy in the stent, 8 G x 3 with standard brachytherapy 8 Gy x 3.

      The aim of the study is to investigate whether patients who receive a stent followed by
      brachytherapy have a better swallowing function without more pain at week +2,compared to
      patients who receive brachytherapy alone.
