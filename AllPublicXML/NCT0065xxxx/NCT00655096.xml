      This study will allow National Eye Institute (NEI) doctors the opportunity to examine people
      with eye disease, whether the diagnosis is known or not, to determine if they are eligible
      for other NEI research studies. No treatment is offered in this study.

      People of all ages with various eye conditions, including genetic conditions, eye movement
      disorders, inflammatory eye diseases, retinal diseases and external eye diseases, may be
      eligible for this study.

      Participants undergo various tests and procedures to diagnose or evaluate their eye disease.
      The procedures may include the following:

        -  Personal and family medical history

        -  Physical examination and blood tests, including genetic testing.

        -  Eye examination with dilation to measure visual acuity and eye pressure and to examine
           the front and back parts of the eye.

        -  Questionnaire about vision and daily activities.

        -  Conjunctival swab or lacrimal bland biopsy, or both: A sample of cells from the eyes is
           collected by swabbing the surface of the eye or by surgically removing a small sample of
           the surface of the eye or tear gland.

        -  Electroretinogram to examine retinal function: The subject sits in the dark with his or
           her eyes patched for 30 minutes. The patches are removed, the surface of the eyes is
           numbed, and contact lenses that can sense signals from the retina are placed on the
           eyes. The subject then watches flashing lights.

        -  Fluorescein angiography to examine the blood vessels in the eye: A dye is injected into
           a vein in the arm. The dye travels through the veins to the blood vessels in the eyes. A
           camera takes pictures of the dye as it flows through the blood vessels.

        -  Optical coherence tomography to measure retinal thickness: A machine used to examine the
           eyes produces cross-sectional pictures of the retina.

        -  Microperimetry to test how sensitive different parts of the retina are to changing
           levels of light. The subject sits in front of a computer and presses a button when he or
           she sees a light on the screen.

        -  Oculography to record eye movements: Eye movements are measured by contact lenses or
           goggles that the subject wears while watching a series of spots on a computer screen.

      This protocol is designed for the screening of potential research participants with either a
      diagnosed or undiagnosed ocular condition. Participants without any evidence of an ocular
      condition can also be screened using this protocol. This protocol serves as a point of entry
      for individuals who may be eligible and wish to participate in the National Eye Institute
      (NEI) clinical research studies. Participants will be carefully evaluated during the
      screening process to determine whether they are suitable candidates for inclusion in any of
      the ongoing NEI research studies. The screening process will include past and current medical
      history and, as appropriate, a physical examination. Other routine diagnostic procedures and
      tests may also be conducted in order to help determine a participant s eligibility. These
      tests and procedures have minimal risks associated with them. Once the screening process is
      complete and eligibility is determined, participants will be informed of their options to
      participate in one or more of the NEI s current clinical research protocols. If no suitable
      research protocol for their participation is identified, recommendations for other treatment
      options may be given to the individual, their primary provider or referring physician.
