  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the acute and chronic effect of whole-body
      vibration exercise on serum insulin-like growth factor-1 levels in women with fibromyalgia
      (FM). It was hypothesized that women with FM would exhibit an increase in IGF-1 following
      both acute and chronic WBV. Twenty-four women with FM were randomized into two groups:
      Vibration Group (VG) and Control Group (CG). The VG underwent a protocol with WBV exercise
      twice a week for a total of six weeks, whereas the CG performed the same protocol without
      vibratory stimulus. Both groups continued with their usual pharmacological treatment. Serum
      IGF-1 levels were determined using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). To test the
      effect of chronic WBV, serum IGF-1 measurements were taken at baseline and at weeks 1,3, and
      6 of intervention. To test the effect of acute WBV, within week 1, serum IGF-1 measurements
      were taken before and immediately following a session of WBV.
