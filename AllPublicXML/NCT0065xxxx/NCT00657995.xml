    <description>Thirty patients who underwent pancreatic resection for pancreatic neoplasm were prospectively randomized. Perioperative blood glucose levels were continuously monitored using an artificial endocrine pancreas (STG-22). Glucose levels were controlled using either the sliding scale method or the artificial pancreas.</description>
