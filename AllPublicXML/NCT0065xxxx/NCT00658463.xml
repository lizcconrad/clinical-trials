  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Statins have been shown to reduce significantly the risk for cardiovascular events in
      patients with type 2 diabetes and statin therapy is largely recommended in this high
      cardiovascular risk population. However, a residual cardiovascular risk is observed in
      patients with type 2 diabetes treated by statins. This may be due to the fact that statins do
      not correct all lipid abnormalities associated with diabetic dyslipidaemia, such as hyperTG
      and low HDL-cholesterol.

      Rosuvastatin is a statin which, in addition to its efficacy to reduce LDL-cholesterol, has
      been show to decrease significantly plasma triglycerides. However, the effects of
      rosuvastatin on triglyceride rich lipoproteins and HDL remains unknown. The purpose of this
      study is to analyze the effect rosuvastatin 20 mg on the metabolism of triglyceride rich
      lipoproteins and HDL in patients with Type 2 diabetes using and in vivo kinetic study of
      VLDL1-apoB,VLDL2-apoB,IDL-apoB and HDL-apoA1.

      This is a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, monocentric, cross-over study with
      two 6-week periods of placebo or rosuvastatin. Subjects will enter a one month placebo
      lead-in period after which they will be eligible for rosuvastatin 20 mg or placebo for two
      6-week periods.

      An in vivo kinetic study will be performed with stable isotopes (13C leucine) in type 2
      diabetic patients (n=8) before and after a 6-week period of rosuvastatin (20mg) therapy. The
      study is design with a one-month steady state period with placebo then on a cross-over design
      with two 6-week periods of placebo or rosuvastatin (20 mg. An in vivo kinetic study will be
      performed at the end of each 6-week period.

      The kinetic studies performed, in each patient, will assess the production rates and
      fractional rates of VLDL1-apoB, VLDL2-apoB, IDL-apoB, LDL-apoB and HDL-apoA-I.
