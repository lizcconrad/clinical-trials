  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 1.1 million people a year suffer a mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), or
      concussion, in the United States. Although most MTBI patients fully recover, as many as 28%
      have physical, cognitive, and/or emotional symptoms up to 6 months post-injury. When symptoms
      persist past three months, it is known as post-concussion syndrome (PCS). The cause of PCS is
      unknown, as structural neuroimaging and neuropsychological (NP) testing results are often
      normal. However, recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research in concussed
      adults showed differences in brain activity compared to controls on working memory tasks,
      despite normal structural MRI and neuropsychological findings. We propose improving this
      research by assessing brain activation patterns during simple versus complex attention and
      working memory tasks in 10 concussed adults via fMRI. This will be the first study to examine
      brain activation patterns associated with the degree of effort applied to testing, a factor
      known to confound interpretation of NP test performance. Validated computerized measures of
      selective attention (Modified Stroop Interference Task), working memory (n-back), and effort
      (Green's Medical Symptom Validity Test; MSVT) will be used. Ten paid controls will be used
      for comparative purposes. We hypothesize that concussed patients will show less brain
      activation than controls on complex versus simple working memory tasks and that activation
      patterns in concussed patients will generally be lower in those with suboptimal effort. We
      will also characterize self-reported emotional and physical symptoms in the PCS patients,
      which has not been done in prior fMRI research with this population.
