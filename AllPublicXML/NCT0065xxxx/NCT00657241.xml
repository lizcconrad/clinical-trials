  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combination drug therapy is necessary for optimal blood pressure reduction and current
      guidelines mandate the concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and β-blockers in most patients at
      significant risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. There is also continuing interest
      in combining angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) with ACE inhibitors in hypertension based
      on the unsubstantiated belief that &quot;more complete&quot; renin-angiotensin system inhibition is
      desirable. It is more attractive physiologically to combine a long-acting β-blocker with
      vasodilatory actions (Coreg CR) with an ACE inhibitor because this combination addresses more
      directly the two fundamental hemodynamic changes needed to reduce CVD events: lowering
      systolic BP (afterload) and lowering heart rate; the product of the two is a reliable
      surrogate for reduced cardiac work. In fact, clinical trial data suggest that there is no
      appreciable additional BP lowering when ARBs are added to ACE inhibitors and neither class
      lowers heart rate. The present proposal is designed to demonstrate the superior
      &quot;cardioprotection&quot; of Coreg CR compared to ARB (valsartan) when each is added to background
      ACE inhibitor therapy. Principal dependent variables include ambulatory cardiac work (24-hour
      mean ambulatory systolic BP x heart rate) and laboratory stress responses (central systolic
      time-tension indices derived from arterial tonometry pre- and post-bicycle exercise).
      Secondary hemodynamic variables will define changes in flow and pressure (e.g. central
      systolic BP and forward and reflected pressure wave estimations).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with residual (uncontrolled) hypertension on lisinopril monotherapy, defined
             as 24-hour ambulatory diastolic BP &gt;85 mmHg.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject meeting any of the following conditions will be excluded from the study:

          -  History of serious adverse effects with ACE inhibitor, Coreg, or valsartan

          -  Known or suspected causes of secondary hypertension (e.g., renovascular stenosis,
             primary hyperaldosteronism)

          -  Known ischemic heart disease requiring beta-blocker therapy (includes angina, prior
             transmural myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous
             transluminal coronary angioplasty or stenting within 6 months prior to study entry).

          -  Heart failure (NYHA Functional Class II-IV)

          -  Obstructive valvular heart disease or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

          -  Presence of clinically significant ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias (e.g.
             atrial fibrillation/flutter), pre-excitation syndrome, second or third degree AV
             block, other conduction defects necessitating the implantation of a permanent cardiac
             pacemaker, or sick sinus syndrome.

          -  Chronic kidney disease (serum creatinine &gt;2.5 within past 6 months)

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (i.e., a fasting blood glucose &gt;200 mg/dL [&gt;11.1
             mmol/L] or hemoglobin A1c &gt; 10%

          -  History of alcohol or other drug abuse within 6 months prior to enrollment

          -  Concomitant treatment or probable need for treatment with prohibited medications.

             throughout study without dosage change.

          -  Any other medical condition which renders the subject unable to complete the study or
             which would interfere with optimal participation in the study or produce a significant
             risk to the subject

          -  Those with persistent systolic BP elevations above 179 mmHg will be discontinued from
             the study as will those with any significant adverse effect of medication.

          -  Positive pregnancy test or failure to practice adequate contraception in women of
