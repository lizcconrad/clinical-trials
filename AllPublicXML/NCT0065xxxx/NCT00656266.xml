      The objective of this study is to compare the effects of two liver transplant
      immunosuppression regimens on renal function. Patients receiving the standard combination of
      prednisone and high-dose tacrolimus, a drug with known nephrotoxicity (Arm A) will be
      compared to patients receiving prednisone, low-dose tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil
      (MMF) (Arm B). MMF is an immunosuppression agent that has no associated nephrotoxicity. The
      primary end point of the study will be renal function as measured by glomerular filtration
      rate (GFR). Thirty pediatric liver transplant recipients will be randomized to these two arms
      in a 1:1 ratio (i.e. 15 patients in each group). Secondary end points will measure patient
      and graft outcome and incidence of immunosuppression-related complications, including:
      neurotoxicity, diabetes mellitus, growth retardation, vomiting, diarrhea, gastrointestinal
      hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, acute or chronic liver graft rejection,
      posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), viral infections, fungal infections and
      bacterial infections.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  End-stage liver disease or acute fulminant hepatic failure recalcitrant to
             conventional medical or surgical therapy.

          -  Listed as candidate for pediatric liver transplantation listed with United Network for
             Organ Sharing (UNOS).

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or younger.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of autoimmune disease or primary sclerosing cholangitis.

          -  History of end-stage renal disease, dialysis treatment or acute renal failure (not
             including hepatorenal syndrome).

          -  Patients with pretransplant renal insufficiency as determined by a glomerular
             filtration rate (GFR) of &lt;80 mL/min/1.73m2 (see below).

          -  Patients with renal agenesis or hypoplasia, polycystic kidney disease, or hydroureter
             seen on pretransplant renal ultrasound.

          -  Patients with malignancy or previous malignancy.

          -  Patients with active bacterial, viral, or fungal infections.

          -  Patients with a pretransplant diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.

          -  Patients with history of previous transplant or multi-organ recipients.

          -  Patients with serological evidence of HIV, HBSAg or HCV.

          -  Patients with hereditary syndrome that causes genetic deficiency of
             hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HGPRT) such as Lesch-Nyhan or
             Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome.

          -  Patients with history of phenylketonuria.

          -  Females that are pregnant or breastfeeding.

             c) using an acceptable method of contraception (oral contraceptive, implanted devices,
             injection, and barrier devices are acceptable; condoms used alone are not acceptable).

          -  Patients with alcohol abuse, substance abuse or smoking within the previous 6 months.

          -  Patients or caretakers of patients with psychogenic factors that preclude therapeutic
             compliance.

          -  Inability to reach participating hospital within 2 hours of notification.
