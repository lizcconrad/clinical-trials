    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the analgesic efficacy of a single
      intraoperative administration of 4975 vs. Placebo in the management of acute postoperative
      pain in patients undergoing bunionectomy.

      Secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single
      intraoperative administration of 4975.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study
      conducted in the US. A dose of 4975 will be evaluated against placebo in patients undergoing
      bunionectomy. Upon enrollment, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either
      4975 or placebo.

      After the surgery, patients will be admitted to the clinical study site, where trained study
      personnel will monitor them for up to 48 hours. While at the clinical study site, patients
      will undergo safety and efficacy assessments. After discharge, patients will report pain
      severity daily through Day 14 via an interactive voice response system (IVRS). Also, safety
      and patient-reported outcome assessments will be performed at the Day 14 (Week 2) and Day 28
      (Week 4) clinic visits.
