      Assess the efficacy and safety of alefacept with nbUVB compared to alefacept alone in chronic
      plaque psoriasis subjects. Combination therapy may improve the clinical response to psoriatic
      subjects as both modalities have an effect on T cells

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Who Achieve Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI score is a tool that allows investigators to assign an objective number to the degree of severity of a person's psoriasis, and considers: redness, scaling and thickness. Values for PASI score range from 0 (least) to 72 (worst).
PASI 75 was defined as an improvement of at least 75% in PASI as compared to Baseline.
The Last Observation Carry Forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing data.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Who Achieved Physical Global Assessment (PGA) of Clear or Almost Clear at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PGA scale is a tool used to evaluate the degree of overall lesion severity. The scale ranges from 0 (clear) to 5 (very severe). Clear is defined as a score of 0; Almost Clear is defined as a score of 1.
Subjects who achieved PGA of clear or almost clear at any visit during the study were assigned to the YES category for their respective groups.

    <description>The DLQI questionnaire is intended to measure how much a subject's skin problem affects the subject's life. Subjects provide answers considering the past week. The scale of the DQLI ranges from 0 (best) to 30 (worst).
A negative change from Baseline represents improvement.
Change is calculated as Week 36- Baseline.

        <description>The PASI score is a tool that allows investigators to assign an objective number to the degree of severity of a person’s psoriasis, and considers: redness, scaling and thickness. Values for PASI score range from 0 (least) to 72 (worst).
PASI 90 was defined as an improvement of at least 90% in PASI as compared to Baseline.

          <description>The PASI score is a tool that allows investigators to assign an objective number to the degree of severity of a person’s psoriasis, and considers: redness, scaling and thickness. Values for PASI score range from 0 (least) to 72 (worst).
PASI 90 was defined as an improvement of at least 90% in PASI as compared to Baseline.
The Last Observation Carry Forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing data.</description>
