  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a clinical diagnosis of irritable bowel
      syndrome based on patient reported symptoms and a few blood tests is safe, and to determine
      whether a clinical diagnosis is as good for the patient and as economical for the society as
      a diagnosis based on exclusion of a number of organic diseases by performing a number of
      blood tests, fecal analyzes and a scopic examination of bowel.

      The purpose of the second part of the study is to determine which intestinal parasites the
      patients have in their bowel and whether these parasites are the cause of the disease.
