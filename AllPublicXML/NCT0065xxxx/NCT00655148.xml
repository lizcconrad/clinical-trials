    <textblock>
      The trial is a parallel group, multi-centre, randomized, double blind, non-inferiority trial
      investigating the immunogenicity and safety of two DTaP-IPV combination vaccines:

      A)The investigational vaccine: DTaP-IPV containing IPV produced in a vero-cell line
      (DTaP-IPVvero) B)The reference vaccine: DTaP-IPV containing IPV produced in monkey kidney
      cells (DTaP-IPVmkc) The DTaP-IPV vaccines are administered to healthy infants at 2, 3½, 5,
      and 16 months of age concomitantly with Act-HIB vaccine administered as a separate injection
      in the opposite thigh.

      Three blood samples are collected at 6, 16 and 17 months of age. Sera are analyzed for
      antibodies against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and prp.
