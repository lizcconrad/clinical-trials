    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective study was to examine whether protein/creatinine ratios in
      catheterized urine specimens correlate to clean catch specimens in pregnant patients being
      evaluated for preeclampsia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is the new onset of hypertension and proteinuria after twenty weeks of gestation
      in pregnant women. The gold standard for evaluation of proteinuria in the diagnosis of
      preeclampsia is a twenty-four hour urine collection. However, single-specimen
      protein/creatinine ratios have been used to detect preeclampsia without the delay and
      inconvenience that a twenty-four hour urine collection would entail. At our institution,
      women are routinely catheterized for urine collection of protein/creatinine ratios because of
      concerns that vaginal contaminants would falsely elevate protein measurement in urine.
      However, no studies have specifically evaluated whether catheterized urine specimens
      correlate to clean catch urine specimens in protein estimation. Thus, the purpose of this
      prospective study was to examine whether protein/creatinine ratios in catheterized urine
      specimens correlate to clean catch specimens in pregnant patients being evaluated for
      preeclampsia.
