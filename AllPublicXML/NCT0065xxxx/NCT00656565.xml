  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate administration of drugs via dry powder inhalers is dependent on adequate inspiratory
      flow rates and volumes. These vary according to the device being used and its resistance. The
      dry powder inhaler device under investigation is a device approved by the Therapeutic Goods
      Administration (ARTG no. 196255) for use with dry powder mannitol. Dry powder mannitol is
      currently being investigated as a treatment for bronchiectasis. We wish to measure the
      inspiratory flow characteristics of both the low and high resistance devices amongst a group
      of subjects with bronchiectasis.

      We propose that the majority of subjects investigated with varying lung function will achieve
      adequate flow during a controlled inspiration.
