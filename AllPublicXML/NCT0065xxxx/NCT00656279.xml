    <textblock>
      A low phosphorus diet is recommended for patients with chronic kidney disease who exhibit
      high levels of phosphorus. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a more
      intensive, innovative dietary phosphorus educational intervention on reducing serum
      phosphorus levels, as well as improving dietary adherence, dietary satisfaction and
      phosphorus knowledge level in patients with chronic kidney disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High serum phosphorus concentration (hPhos) commonly occurs in chronic kidney disease (CKD)
      secondary to declining renal function. hPhos increases the risk of developing metastatic
      calcification, secondary hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy and cardiovascular
      complications. Patients with hPhos are advised to restrict their dietary phosphorus intake to
      800-1000mg/d, as per National Kidney Foundations'Kidney Disease Quality Outcomes Initiative
      (KDOQI). Adherence to a phosphorus restricted diet is often challenging for CKD patients, as
      they may be required to follow various dietary restrictions, and there is significant
      quantities of hidden phosphorus in processed foods. This randomized controlled trial is
      designed to compare the effectiveness of more intensive phosphorus education (IPE) using the
      innovative Phosphorus Point System Tool© versus standard phosphorus education (SPE) using the
      Choose/Avoid list on 1) serum phosphorus levels (primary outcome) 2) dietary adherence,
      dietary knowledge and satisfaction in patients with pre-dialysis CKD. We hypothesize that
      patients receiving IPE will have lower serum phosphorus than those receiving SPE. Fifty
      patients attending a pre-dialysis CKD clinic with serum phosphorus &gt; 1.49 mmol/L will be
      randomly assigned to IPE or SPE and followed over 12 weeks. Serum phosphorus, dietary intakes
      using the 5-pass repeat 24-hour dietary recall method, dietary knowledge and satisfaction by
      validated questionnaires, will be measured at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks. The study's
      findings on the impact of more intensive innovative dietary phosphorus education in patients
      with pre-dialysis CKD will serve towards developing best practice of care and potentially
      reduce long-term complications.

    <description>Intensive dietary phosphorus education will be completed using the Phosphorus Point System Tool, a booklet listing phosphorus points for food items based on the phosphorus content. Patients will be allotted a maximum of 32-40 phosphorus points daily. Points consumed will be tracked by the patients via daily tracking sheets which require patients to list the phosphorus food items consumed, the number of points, and the time and amount of phosphate binders. Patients in this group will also receive intensive education about phosphorus additives. As a part of the program that supports the tool, patients will receive weekly telephone calls for the first 6 weeks to address any questions about the tool and find phosphorus point values of foods not listed within the tool.</description>
