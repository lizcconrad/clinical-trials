  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic diseases are the primary cause of morbidity and mortality for older Americans. Active
      patient participation in treatment decision-making has the potential to significantly improve
      outcomes in chronic disease care, but interventions to increase participation remain
      underused. Some studies have found that older individuals are less interested in
      participating in clinical decision-making, but other studies find that exposing patients to
      decision aids (PtDAs) increases their desire to take an active role in making decisions with
      their physicians. The present study targets hard-to-reach seniors by showing decision aids
      focused on chronic disease management in senior centers. Decision aids will be made available
      in two senior centers through a lending library and by conducting group screenings of the
      decision aids followed by moderated discussion of the content with participants. A randomized
      encouragement design will be used to test the effectiveness of a modest financial incentive
      on increasing seniors' participation in group screenings. The investigators will evaluate the
      effects of the intervention on seniors' decision-making role preferences, attitudes,
      perceived social norms and self efficacy for asking questions of their physician,
      health-related quality of life, physical activity, and changes in prescribed treatment
      regimens and self-care.
