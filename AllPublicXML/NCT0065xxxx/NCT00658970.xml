      The purpose of this first in human study is to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of
      KX2-391 in patients with solid tumors and lymphoma, who are refractory to conventional cancer
      treatments. In addition, pharmacodynamics will be evaluated using biomarkers in peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells and in tissue biopsy samples.

          -  Normal coagulation profile (PT/INR and aPTT within institutional normal limits) for
             those who give consent to tumor biopsy, within 1 week prior to the procedure.

          -  Negative pregnancy test for females at Screening, preferably done within 1 week before

             days before Day 1 of dosing and 6 months after the last dose for the patient

          -  Signed written informed consent for tumor biopsy for the additional 10 subjects that
             will be dosed at the MTD and who have accessible tumors

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unresolved toxicity of higher than Grade 1 severity from previous anti-cancer
             treatment or investigational agents

          -  Receiving or having received investigational agents or systemic anti-cancer agents
             within 14 days of Day 1 of dosing or 28 days for those agents with unknown elimination

             therapy

          -  Currently taking hormones (i.e., estrogen contraceptives, hormone replacement,
             anti-estrogen), anti-platelet agents or anti-coagulants, e.g. coumadin, except for
             those who are on prophylactic doses of anti-coagulants for indwelling venous catheters

          -  Use of strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 enzymes 2 weeks or 5

             compliance with the protocol
