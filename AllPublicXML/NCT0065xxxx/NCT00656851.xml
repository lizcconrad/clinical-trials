  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the hearts of HIV+ people with The Metabolic Syndrome use and oxidize
      fats and sugars inappropriately, and that this may impair the heart's ability to pump blood.
      We hypothesize that exercise training or pioglitazone (Actos) will improve fat and sugar
      metabolism in the hearts of HIV+ people with The Metabolic Syndrome. This study will advance
      our understanding of cardiovascular disease in HIV+ people, and will test the efficacy of
      exercise training and pioglitazone for improving insulin resistance, heart metabolism and
      heart function in this at risk population.

  <detailed_description>

      We hypothesize that myocardial free fatty acid and glucose utilization and oxidation rates
      are dysregulated in HIV+ people with The Metabolic Syndrome in comparison to HIV+ people
      without The Metabolic Syndrome, and in comparison to HIV-seronegative people with and without
      The Metabolic Syndrome. We hypothesize that dysregulated myocardial fatty acid and glucose
      metabolism is associated with impaired heart function (diastolic dysfunction) in HIV+ people
      with The Metabolic Syndrome. We will use myocardial positron emission tomography, radioactive
      isotope tracers of palmitate and glucose, and echocardiography to evaluate myocardial
      metabolism and function. HIV+ people with The Metabolic Syndrome will receive 16wks of
      exercise training or pioglitazone (Actos), and we will evaluate their potential beneficial
      effects on myocardial metabolism and function.

    <measure>Myocardial Contractile Function During Diastole</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0 and 16</time_frame>
    <description>Echocardiographic quantification of (E/A) early to late diastolic filling velocity. Aria transfer blood to the ventricles in 2 steps:
blood collected in the atria falls into the ventricles when the atrioventricular valves opens. In the left heart, the velocity at which the blood moves during this initial action is called the early or &quot;E&quot; filling velocity.
residual blood in the atria, is emptied during diastole by atrial contraction. The velocity of the blood during atrial contraction is the &quot;A&quot; (for atrial) filling velocity. These are expressed as a ratio (E/A). If A exceeds E velocity (ratio &lt;1.0) this is a clinical marker of diastolic dysfunction. This can occur when the left ventricular wall becomes so stiff as to impair proper filling, which can lead to diastolic heart failure.</description>

             ULN.

        Menstruating women must have a negative urine beta-HCG pregnancy test within 14 days prior
        to study. To control for potential metabolic effects of alterations in female hormones
        during the menstrual cycle, all menstruating women will be studied during the follicular
        phase (serum 17beta-estradiol &lt;165 pg/mL).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Frank obesity (BMI &gt;35kg/m2).

          2. Chronic hepatitis B infection (HB surface antigen positive). Active hepatitis C
             infection (detectable Hep C RNA). Those who have cleared hepatitis B or C infection
             are eligible.

          3. Diabetes [fasting glucose &gt;125 mg/dL, or fasting insulin &gt;45 µU/mL, or 2-hr glucose
             &gt;200mg/dL].

          4. Medications or agents that regulate glucose metabolism (e.g., insulin-sensitizers,
             insulin-secretagogues). Lipid lowering agents that regulate lipid metabolism (i.e.
             fibrate, statin).

          5. Gestational diabetes, pregnancy, or nursing mothers.

          6. Serum triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL.

          7. Hypogonadism [total testosterone &lt;200ng/dL (men) or &lt;15ng/dL (women)]; thyroid

             Replacement testosterone or thyroid hormones to normalize abnormal levels is
             acceptable, as long as treatment and blood levels have been stable for at least 3
             months.

          8. Use of human growth hormone (hGH) or GH-secretagogues (GH-releasing hormone-peptides)

             congenital heart disease, coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass graft,
             stroke. Bundle branch block is exclusionary because it limits the interpretability of
             the resting/exercise ECG. Cardiovascular or physical contraindications to maximal
             exercise testing on a cycle ergometer.

         10. Uncontrolled hypertension (&gt;140/90 mmHg). Certain antihypertensive medications will be
             permitted (diuretics, ACE inhibitors) as long as the medication, dose, and blood
             pressure have been stable for at least 3 months.

         11. Well-trained athletes (defined as &gt;3 exercise training exposures/week; &gt;30min
             regimented exercise/exposure maintained for at least the prior 4 weeks).

             normal activities of daily living (dressing, hygiene, preparing meals, operating a
             vehicle). These might affect peripheral substrate metabolism.

         17. Chronic renal insufficiency/failure or other comorbid conditions (eg. cancer, COPD)
             that alter metabolism.

         18. Pancreatitis, celiac disease, or cirrhosis.

         19. Inadequate macronutrient or energy intake, or malabsorptive disorder.

        <title>Myocardial Contractile Function During Diastole</title>
        <description>Echocardiographic quantification of (E/A) early to late diastolic filling velocity. Aria transfer blood to the ventricles in 2 steps:
blood collected in the atria falls into the ventricles when the atrioventricular valves opens. In the left heart, the velocity at which the blood moves during this initial action is called the early or &quot;E&quot; filling velocity.
residual blood in the atria, is emptied during diastole by atrial contraction. The velocity of the blood during atrial contraction is the &quot;A&quot; (for atrial) filling velocity. These are expressed as a ratio (E/A). If A exceeds E velocity (ratio &lt;1.0) this is a clinical marker of diastolic dysfunction. This can occur when the left ventricular wall becomes so stiff as to impair proper filling, which can lead to diastolic heart failure.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>We did not perform the myocardial metabolic measurements under insulin-stimulated conditions (i.e. hyperinsulinemic clamps). Small number of participants and high measurement variability, efficacy was not found. Study ended to minimize risk/benefit.</limitations_and_caveats>
