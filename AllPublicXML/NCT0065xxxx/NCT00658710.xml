  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this multi-center, randomized controlled study is to acquire and compare
      information on gait performance in patients with chronic hemiplegia (six months to two years
      post-stroke) who either continue to attend two physical therapy sessions per week for two
      months or who stop physical therapy sessions for two months.Following the initial screening,
      subjects will be randomized into two groups: one who continues attending two physical therapy
      sessions per week for two months, or the other one who stops physical therapy sessions for
      two months. Before and after those two months, a 3 days recording will be made using an
      ambulatory system called TRIDENT.

      The aim of this multi-center, randomized controlled study is to acquire and compare
      information on gait performance in patients with chronic hemiplegia (six months to two years
      post-stroke) who either continue to attend two physical therapy sessions per week for two
      months or who stop physical therapy sessions for two months. This will permit us 1) to assess
      the efficacy of continuing physical therapy sessions during the chronic phase of post-stroke
      hemiplegia, 2) to investigate whether the effects of physical therapy in these patients
      gradually decreases during the period of six months to two years post-stroke, and 3) to model
      the relationship between standard measures of gait performance (speed, endurance, balance,
      use of technical aids…) with other multidimensional covariates: social and environmental
      factors (type of housing, presence of a third person,…), cognitive factors (cognitive
      disorders associated) and thymic factors (anxiety, depression) and 4) to assess the costs
      associated with the physical therapy care of chronic-phase stroke patients .

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be aged 18 to 75 years, with a first ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke at
             least six months ago and no longer than two years ago, without subsequent stroke. It
             must have caused initially complete hemiplegia of the right or left hemibody, but they
             must be able of walk alone with or without technical assistance over a distance of at
             least 10 meters They must be able change direction too.

          -  Finally, they must have a Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC) score between 4
             and 6 during the inclusion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  We will exclude patients with a neurological history other than a stroke, a
             psychiatric illness, or an associated debilitating disease.

          -  They must not have an associated cerebella syndrome or a clinical brainstem attack.

          -  We will refuse patients who are pregnant, who have not signed the written consent, and
             who aren't entitled to a social security scheme.
