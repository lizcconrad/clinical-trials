  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of age and the effect of exercise
      intensity of rehabilitation programs on claudication pain symptoms and leg circulation of
      younger and older patients with intermittent claudication.

      Thirty-one patients randomized to low-intensity exercise rehabilitation and 33 patients
      randomized to high-intensity exercise rehabilitation completed the study. The 6-month
      exercise rehabilitation programs consisted of intermittent treadmill walking to near maximal
      claudication pain three days per week at either 40% (low-intensity group) or 80%
      (high-intensity group) of maximal exercise capacity. Total work performed in the two training
      regimens was similar by having the patients in the low-intensity group exercise for a longer
      duration than patients in the high-intensity group. Measurements of physical function,
      peripheral circulation, and health-related quality of life were obtained on each patient
      before and after the rehabilitation programs.
