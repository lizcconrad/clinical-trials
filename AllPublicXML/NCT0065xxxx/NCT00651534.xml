  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of formulation on the relative bioavailability of
      SB-751689 (400 mg) administered to healthy postmenopausal women. Subjects will receive a
      single oral dose of each formulation, with five formulations of SB-751689 tested in total.
      Blood samples will be taken up to 24 hours postdose after each dose administration. This
      study will provide information for future possible formulation development of SB-751689 for
      Phase III.
