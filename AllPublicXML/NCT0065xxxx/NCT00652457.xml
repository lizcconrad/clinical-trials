      To determine if memantine in doses of 10 mg BID affects memory, cognition, and behavior in
      patients with Huntington's disease (HD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Results of several published clinical trials suggest that memantine has a beneficial effect
      in dementing conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease; however, the effects of memantine on
      cognitive and behavioral function in HD are unknown. Our hypotheses are that HD patients who
      are administered memantine will show improved performance on psychometric tests of memory and
      executive functions in addition to behavior and that patients treated with memantine will
      show more improvement after six months than after three months of treatment.

          -  Diagnosis of HD with current complaints of memory or concentration difficulties.

          -  Dementia Rating Scale score of &lt;129, to ensure that patients have sufficient cognitive
             impairment.

          -  Adequate visual and auditory acuity to allow neuropsychological testing.
