  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behavior change and self-efficacy are key for patients with diabetes to sustain blood sugar
      goals, but most care systems do not provide effective support to assist patients in
      successful ongoing self-management. After initial education, many programs are limited by
      allowable Medicare reimbursement for diabetes education which currently requires physician
      referral and cannot exceed two hours of training per year for a beneficiary, plus one hour of
      nutritional services. These services are usually provided either on an individual basis or
      occasionally through a traditional group class approach. For patients with established type 2
      diabetes who are not achieving optimal glycemic control, we propose to develop and formally
      evaluate in a randomized trial a novel group experience to educate and motivate patients with
      established type 2 called IDEA, (Interactive Dialogue to Educate and Activate). This
      multi-site, randomized, prospective trial will randomize 621 patients with inadequately blood
      sugar control levels to one of 3 study groups: (1) IDEA - patients receive group sessions
      totaling 8 hours, with an average of 10 patients per group, using conversation maps as a
      conduit to facilitate dialogue between providers and patients (2) Individual Education (IE) -
      patients receive 2 hours with a nurse educator and 1 hour with a dietitian, and (3) Usual
      care (UC)- patients receive no research intervention. The primary analyses will involve mixed
      model regression to assess whether IDEA improves outcomes compared to IE and UC. Blood sugar
      level, blood pressure, and lipids will be evaluated 6 and12 months post-randomization and
      behavioral, emotional, and satisfaction outcomes through survey at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12
      months. Depending on 12 month results, a longitudinal four year post intervention analysis is
      planned to assess sustainability of treatment effects and cost-effectiveness.
