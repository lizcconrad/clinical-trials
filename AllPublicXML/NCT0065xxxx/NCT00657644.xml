             bpm).

          -  Resting hypotension (a resting systolic blood pressure of &lt; 90 mm Hg) or hypertension
             (a resting systolic blood pressure &gt; 170 mm Hg or a resting diastolic blood pressure &gt;
             110 mm Hg)

          -  NYHA Class III and IV heart failure

          -  Symptomatic postural hypotension within 6 months of visit 1.

          -  Subjects who are taking the following potent inhibitors of cytochrome P- 450 3A4: HIV
             protease inhibitors such as ritonavir or indinavir, the anti-mycotic agents
             itraconazole and ketoconazole (topical forms are allowed) or erythromycin.

          -  Subjects who are taking alpha-blockers.
