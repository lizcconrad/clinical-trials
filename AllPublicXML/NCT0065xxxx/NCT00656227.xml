      This trial will investigate whether four doses of RN1001 (20ng, 50ng, 100ng and 200ng) are
      efficacious in preventing or reducing the resultant scar, as compared to placebo, when
      applied intradermally to wound margins following excision of benign naevi situated on the
      head and neck.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Male and female subjects (aged between 18-85 years) with one or more benign head &amp; neck naevi
      will be invited to participate in the study.

      Each patient will be randomised to a particular dose group, depending on the number of naevi
      suitable for excision. For example, patients with one excised naevi will receive either a
      dose of one of the concentrations of RN1001, or placebo. A patient with 2 excised naevi will
      receive an active dose, and placebo. Patients with 3 excised naevi will receive 2 active
      doses, plus placebo, and patient with four excised naevi will receive 3 active doses plus
      placebo.

      Naevi will be excised using punch biopsy, and then closed with standard sutures. Following
      wound closure, the study drug (active RN1001 or placebo) will be administered via intradermal
      injection at a rate of 100ul per linear cm of wound margin.

      Digital and film photography will be taken pre-dose and post dose (Day 0, day 14, day 28,
      Month 2, 3, 6 &amp; 12, and thereafter at M24, M36, M48 &amp; M60). Additionally, scar assessments
      (completed by Investigator, Research Nurse &amp; Medical photographer) will be completed at
      follow up visits from Day 20 onwards. Silicone moulds of the scars will be taken at M6, M12
      and then annually to M60.

      Patients will be requested to complete a questionnaire to rate their scar
      expectations/assessment on a total of 5 occasions (screening, Day 0, Month 3, Month 6 &amp; Month
      12)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Weight between 50 and 150kg and a body mass index within the permitted range for their
             height, using Quetelet's index-weight (kg)/heightÂ² (m). The permitted index is between
             15-55.

          -  Subjects with one or more benign head and neck naevi which when measured are at least
             3cm apart.

          -  Subjects who are aged 18-85 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who on examination have a naevus or naevi, which appear clinically suspicious
             of malignancy and therefore require specialist referral and treatment.

          -  Subjects who on direct questioning and physical examination have a history or evidence
             of hypertrophic or keloid scarring or tattoo(s) or previous scar(s) in the area to be
             excised.

          -  Subjects with a personal history of a bleeding disorder.

          -  Subjects with a skin disorder that is chronic or currently active and which the
             Investigator considers will adversely affect the healing of acute wounds or involves
             the areas to be examined in this trial.

          -  Subjects with any clinically significant medical condition that would impair wound
             healing including renal, hepatic, haematological, neurological or immune disease.

          -  Subjects with a history of clinically significant drug hypersensitivity to lignocaine
             or allergy to surgical dressings to be used in this trial.

          -  Subjects with any clinically significant abnormality following review of pre trial
             laboratory data and physical examination.

          -  Subjects who are taking, or have taken, any investigational drugs within the last 30
             days, long term oral, topical or inhaled corticosteroid therapy and anti coagulant or
             anti platelet medication.

          -  Certain drugs are not excluded in this trial. These include OTC analgesics including
             paracetamol and codeine, vitamin and mineral supplements and OTC cold remedies
             containing paracetamol as the active ingredient.

          -  Subjects who are pregnant or who become pregnant up to and including Day 0. Subjects
             must use suitable forms of contraception during at least the first two months of the
             trial.

          -  Subjects who have previously had a positive result to the test for HIV antibodies, or
             who admit to belonging to a high-risk group.

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator, a subject who is not likely to complete the trial
             for whatever reason.
