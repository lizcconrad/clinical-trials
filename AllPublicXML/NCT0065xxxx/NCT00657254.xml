      The study was designed to allow for the continuation of treatment with Sorafenib as a single
      agent to those patients who participated in a previous Sorafenib study that had reached its
      designated end-date and who were, in the opinion of the Investigator and the Sponsor, still
      benefiting from treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: - Patients who had participated in a previous sorafenib study that had
        completed, who did not meet withdrawal criteria of the previous study and who were, in the
        opinion of the investigator and sponsor still benefiting from treatment. Exclusion
        Criteria:- The current cardiovascular situation of the patient was carefully re-evaluated
        by both the investigator and the sponsor and an informed decision as to inclusion was then
        made.- Substance abuse, medical, psychological or social conditions that may have
        interfered with the patient's participation in the study or evaluation of the study
        results.- Known or suspected allergy to the investigational agent.- Any condition that was
        unstable or which could jeopardise the safety of the patient and his/her compliance in the
        study.
