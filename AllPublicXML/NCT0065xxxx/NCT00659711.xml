  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sitagliptin is a new oral hypoglycemic anti-diabetic drug used either alone or in combination
      with metformin or a thiazolidinedione for control of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Sitagliptin
      has been shown to have fewer side effects in the control of blood glucose values.

      Obesity and diabetes are states of increased inflammation and can influence the free radicals
      and inflammatory markers (chemicals in the blood which increase due to inflammation in the
      body) and are also major risk factors for atherosclerotic disease. In this study we want to
      see the effect of sitagliptin on these markers. We believe that Sitagliptin may exert an
      anti-inflammatory effect in the human. The purpose of this study is to determine if the
      addition of sitagliptin to diabetic patients will provide added benefit. We believe that
      sitagliptin provides these added benefits by suppressing free radicals (charged substances
      that cause damage to the body) and inflammation.
