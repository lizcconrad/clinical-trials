    <textblock>
      In chronic CLI patients who are appropriate candidates for endovascular procedures - and many
      patients are not because of their advanced age and disease state - the treatment regimen may
      include endovascular procedures such as percutaneous transluminal endovascular intervention,
      as well as reconstructive surgical procedures such as grafts or bypasses. Amputation is a
      last resort where limb salvage cannot be achieved. Despite the success of percutaneous
      intervention for small coronary vessels with lumen diameters less than 3 mm, similar
      techniques have had limited success in the lower extremity vessels. Infra-popliteal, or below
      the knee endovascular intervention, is commonly plagued by subacute thrombotic closure and
      restenosis in as many as 50% of treated patients. As a result of the limited success, these
      percutaneous procedures have been reserved for the severest cases whereby limb loss is
      imminent without intervention. In this context, the sickest of all patients are enrolled in
      these trials and poor outcomes are common regardless of the intervention. Agents that promote
      intracellular cAMP accumulation, including prostacyclin analogues and phosphodiesterase
      inhibitors, suppress smooth muscle proliferation, promote vasodilatation and inhibit platelet
      aggregation. These properties suggest that prostacyclin analogues such as treprostinil will
      be useful adjuncts to peripheral endovascular intervention and perhaps increase the number of
      patients with CLI that can benefit from peripheral endovascular intervention. An orally
      available prostacyclin analogue could represent an important treatment advance in the
      prevention of restenosis following infrapopliteal angioplasty. In the present study, the
      safety and efficacy of oral UT-15C sustained release (SR) tablets will be compared to placebo
      in patients with CLI undergoing an infra-popliteal endovascular intervention.

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, placebo controlled, single-center, evaluation of the safety and
      efficacy of UT-15C SR compared to placebo in patients with CLI with a planned infra-popliteal
      endovascular intervention procedure. Conventional therapy should be continued for all
      patients in the study. Conventional therapy is defined as the customary best medical practice
      at this investigative site for CLI, including analgesics for rest pain, debridement and wound
      care for ischemic wounds, etc., as long as such care meets the other requirements of the
      study and does not include prohibited therapies or investigational medications. A total of 20
      patients will be prospectively randomized (1:1) to conventional treatment and placebo therapy
      in conjunction with an endovascular procedure or conventional treatment and UT-15C SR therapy
      in conjunction with an infrapopliteal endovascular procedure. Treatment is UT-15C sustained
      release (SR) tablets (1.0 mg dosage strength) or placebo. Treatment will be initiated at 1 mg
      twice daily with dose escalation of an additional 1 mg twice daily every 5 days if clinically
      indicated based upon the presence of known prostacyclin adverse events or adverse events that
      in the opinion of the investigator are attributable to UT-15C SR. Doses should be maximized
      throughout the Treatment Phase up to a maximum dose of 5 mg twice daily at the end of
      12-weeks. Patients will return to the institution for the endovascular procedure at least 4
      days after starting study drug and continue study drug, throughout the endovascular procedure
      and to Week 12. All patients will return to the clinic at Weeks 2, 6 and 12 for Treatment
      Phase assessments, and then Weeks 26 and 52 for follow-up assessments.
