    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of ezetimibe coadministered with
      simvastatin compared with simvastatin alone when administered for 12 weeks on endothelial
      function as assessed by brachial artery reactivity testing (BART) using high-frequency
      ultrasound to image the brachial artery vasomotor response to a flow-mediated stimulus
      (high-shear stress) in subjects with high cholesterol. The secondary objectives include
      evaluation of nitroglycerin-induced vasodilation. In addition, lipid parameters
      (low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C],
      triglycerides [TG], total cholesterol [TC]) and C reactive protein (CRP) will be assessed by
      treatment group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults (18 years old and older) with primary hypercholesterolemia with a plasma LDL-C
             &gt;=145 mg/dL and &lt;=250 mg/dL, and plasma TG &lt;=350 mg/dL after adequate drug washout.

          -  Postmenopausal women who are receiving postmenopausal hormonal therapy or raloxifene
             must be maintained on a stable hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or raloxifene regimen
             for at least 6 weeks prior to study entry and throughout the study period.

          -  All subjects must agree to refrain from drinking alcohol or caffeine containing
             beverages for 12 hours prior to each study visit at which a BART assessment is
             performed; be minimally active (eg, avoid excessive physical activity) for 12 hours
             prior to each study visit at which a BART assessment is performed; and be willing to
             observe the NCEP Step I diet, participate in the study, and complete all study-related
             procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or any other situation, condition, or illness that, in the opinion of the

             digestive or central nervous systems including cerebrovascular disease and
