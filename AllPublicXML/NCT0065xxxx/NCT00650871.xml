  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to investigate the effects of GW679769 on sleep and cognition. Potential subjects
      participate in a clinical screening visit and a two-night PSG recording session in the sleep
      laboratory. Eligible subjects then participate in three separate two-night PSG sessions in
      which they are randomized to receive placebo or one of two doses of GW679769 60 minutes prior
      to bedtime, one treatment for each session in a balanced order. Each treatment session is
      separated by a two-week drug-free period and occur on the same day of the week. A safety
      follow-up visit occurs 2 weeks after the last treatment session.

    <measure>Digit symbol substitution test (DSST) as a measure of daytime cognitive function</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and 2 post PSG of each treatment period (Approximately up to 31 days)</time_frame>
    <description>DSST was a widely used measure of performance impairment. It is a typical test of association involved in substituting symbols for digits over a period of time. The number of correct signs substituted was taken as the score. Participants marked a geometric pattern associated with one of the digits displayed on a computer screen. Participants had 90 seconds to match as many geometric patterns as possible. The dependent measure were the number of patterns the participant were able to mark correctly (i.e., number of trials correct). Minimum possible score is 0= impaired cognitive function, there was no upper limit of the score. Higher the score indicated betterment in the daytime cognitive function. Mean DSST was calculated from the observations recorded on days followed by first and second PSG nights and mean over the two nights was reported.</description>

    <measure>Mean Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) score including total recall and delayed recall as a measure of Daytime Cognitive Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and 2 post PSG of each treatment period (Approximately up to 31 days)</time_frame>
    <description>HVLT-R assesses verbal learning and memory. It comprised of four subscales including total recall, delayed recall, retention score, and recognition discrimination index. The total recall score was the number of correctly reported words in each of the 3 learning trials and the score ranged from 0 to 36. The delayed recall score was the number of correctly reported words in the delayed recall test and the score ranged from 0 to 12. The retention score represented the score on the delayed recall test divided by the higher of the recall scores from learning trials 2 and 3, multiplied by 100. It was practically ranged from 0 to 100. Higher score indicated betterment in the daytime cognitive function. The recognition discrimination index (RDI) was calculated by subtracting the total false positives score (semantically-related plus semantically un-related) from the total true-positives score obtained in the delayed recognition test).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HVLT-R (Retention %) as a measure of daytime Cognitive Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Night 1, Day 1 and 2 post PSG of each treatment period (Approximately up to 31 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The HVLT-R offers a brief assessment of verbal learning and memory (recognition and recall) and its use had been validated with brain-disordered populations. Eight distinct forms of the HVLT-R were available, eliminating practice effects on repeated administrations. Each form consists of a list of 12 nouns (targets) with four words drawn from each of three semantic categories. The semantic categories differ across the eight forms, but the forms were very similar in their psychometric properties. The HVLT-R tasks included three learning trials, a delayed recall trial (20-25 minute delay), and a yes/no delayed recognition trial. This latter trial consists of a randomized list that includes the 12 target words and 12 non-target words, 6 of which are drawn from the same semantic categories as the targets. Mean percent retention of the target words was measured as a daytime cognitive function and mean over the three measures recorded at Night 1, Day 1 and 2 are reported.</description>

    <measure>Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire as scales for sleepiness/alertness</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and 2 post PSG of each treatment period (Approximately up to 31 days)</time_frame>
    <description>LSEQ had been used to monitor subjectively perceived changes in sleep during psychopharmacological investigation involving a variety of psychoactive agents. The questionnaire contains ten self-rating 100-mm-line analogue questions pertaining to four consecutive aspects of sleep: getting to sleep (GTS), QOS, awakening from sleep (AFS) and behaviour following wakefulness (BFW). Scores on the four LSEQ subscales vary between 100 (the largest possible positive change experienced after drug administration) and 0 (the largest possible negative change experienced after drug administration).</description>

    <measure>Stanford Sleepiness Scale as scales for sleepiness/alertness</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and 2 post PSG of each treatment period (Approximately up to 31 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Stanford Sleepiness Scale was assessed using the sleep evaluation questionnaire on Day 1 and 7 prior to dosing and at approximately 1 hour intervals after dosing until discharge from the clinic. It was rated on a seven point scale (1-7), where lower score indicates active and higher score indicates sleep onset soon; 1: feeling active, vital, alert, or wide awake, 2: functioning at high levels, but not at peak; able to concentrate, 3: awake, but relaxed; responsive but not fully alert, 4: somewhat foggy, let down, 5: foggy; losing interest in remaining awake; slowed down, 6: sleepy, woozy, fighting sleep; prefer to lie down, 7: no longer fighting sleep, sleep onset soon; having dream-like thoughts and X: asleep. The mean over Day 1 and Day 2 post PSG nights are reported.</description>
