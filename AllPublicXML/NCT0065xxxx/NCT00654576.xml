  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antipsychotic alone is limit to improve the overall outcome of schizophrenia and has a high
      discontinue rate.To solve these problems, we provide practical and available psychosocial
      intervention. We hypothesize that there will be significant difference in the overall
      effectiveness between antipsychotic and antipsychotic combination with psychosocial
      intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a national, multicenter, randomized, naturalistic trial, with
      research assessors intended to be blind to the intervention status.

      We plan to recruit 1400 patients at 10 china sites and randomly assign them to two group. the
      control group only receive antipsychotic and the study group receive antipsychotic
      combination with psychosocial intervention. The course is 12 months. Patients use one of the
      seven study drugs (chlorpromazine, sulpiride, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine,
      and aripitrazole)to the maintain treatment. The psychosocial intervention include
      psychoeducation, family intervention, skills training, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. The
      primary aim is to delineate differences in the overall effectiveness of the two treatment
      model.The assessments include the outcome of symptomatology，neurobiology，social
      psychology，medical economics.
