      The purpose of this study is to conduct a 12-month randomized controlled trial comparing the
      effects of strength training exercise to stretching and relaxation exercise (control) on body
      composition (bone, muscle and fat mass), energy balance, bone turnover, and physical function
      (strength, power, gait, balance and self-report physical function and symptoms) in women who
      experienced premature menopause from chemotherapy for breast cancer.

      As a result of treatment, breast cancer survivors typically experience unhealthy changes in
      body composition (bone, muscle and fat). Treatments disrupt normal bone and energy balance
      resulting in bone and muscle wasting and fat gain. Premenopausal women are at greatest risk
      for these declines because most are thrust into early menopause from chemotherapy. Hormone
      manipulation therapy (i.e., tamoxifen or arimidex) may further affect these tissues. Exercise
      can prevent bone and muscle loss and promote fat loss. However, the ability of exercise to
      reverse unfavorable changes in all components of body composition in women experiencing early
      menopause from breast cancer treatment has not been specifically studied.

    <intervention_name>Flexibility Training</intervention_name>
    <description>60 minute session 3 times a week focusing on whole body flexibility (stretching) and relaxation (progressive neuromuscular relaxation, focused breathing) exercises. Exercises are selected to be non-weight bearing and require minimal muscle strength in order to provide a contrast to the intervention arm. Two sessions are conducted in a supervised setting at a university fitness center and the third is a home-based version of the program performed at home.</description>
