    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate morphine intake in the first 4 hours after abdominal
      surgery. Morphine intake is compared between patients on placebo and patients on
      parecoxib/valdecoxib.

      This study was prematurely terminated because subject recruitment was slower than expected,
      it was determined that the study was not going to achieve the statistical power necessary to
      address the primary objective. Letters were sent to the sites informing them of study
      termination on 26 February 2004. The decision to terminate the trial was not based on any
      safety concerns.
