    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether lidocaine vaginal gel is safe and effective
      for preventing or reducing the severity of dysmenorrhea (painful menstrual periods) compared
      to placebo (inactive gel).

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 10% (150 mg) lidocaine gel
      compared with placebo in reducing the severity and onset of primary dysmenorrhea in women
      with recurrent dysmenorrhea.

      The secondary objectives of this study are the following:

        -  to assess the safety of 10% (150 mg) lidocaine gel compared with placebo

        -  to evaluate electrocardiograms (ECGs) for potentially significant QT changes at
           approximate peak lidocaine plasma concentration after 4 days of dosing with 10% (150 mg)
           lidocaine gel.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Experiences primary dysmenorrhea requiring pain medication for moderate-to-severe pain
             (as measured by a 4-point categorical rating scale) by the subject's own report for at
             least four of the previous six menstrual cycles.

          2. Has a history of primary dysmenorrhea with onset within 4 years of menarche.

          3. Has regular menstrual cycles (i.e. onset of menses predictable within 1 - 2 days each
             month) for the 3 month period preceding enrollment. If a subject has had regular
             cycles for the past 12 months but had a single cycle that was not regular within the 3
             month period preceding enrollment, the subject may be enrolled at investigator
             discretion after consultation with sponsor.

          4. Taking the same strength and type of hormonal contraception on a monthly cycle for at
             least the previous 6 months prior to screening and plans to remain on this hormonal
             contraception for the duration of participation in the study or is on an acceptable
             method of birth control including surgical sterilization (i.e. bilateral tubal
             ligation, partner vasectomy), double-barrier methods, and total abstinence (at the
             discretion of the investigator in cases where age, career, lifestyle, or sexual
             orientation of the patient ensures compliance).

          5. Is a tampon user and/or must be willing to use tampons throughout the study dosing
             period.

          6. Age 18 to 40 years (inclusive).

          7. Has a Body Mass Index (BMI) ≤ 35 kg/m2.

             requirements.

          2. Experiencing pelvic pain other than that thought to be associated with primary
             dysmenorrhea, such as chronic pelvic pain occurring at times other than exclusively
             during menses and/or dyspareunia.

          3. Experiencing dysmenorrhea symptoms that are effects of or thought to be effects of (at
             least in part) secondary causes of dysmenorrhea, such as uterine fibroids,
             endometriosis, and/or currently symptomatic ovarian cysts.

          4. Experienced dysmenorrhea that did not require, in the opinion of the subject, the use
             of analgesic medication during four of the previous six menstrual episodes.

          5. Has dysmenorrhea refractory to treatment with commonly used analgesic medications for
             the treatment of menstrual pain (e.g., ibuprofen or naproxen sodium).

          7. Currently using contraceptive injection, implant, or extended cycle OC (hormonal

         12. A history of past or ongoing clinically significant disease, illness, or disorder
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, makes the subject unsuitable for study
             participation including active vaginal, vulvar, and cervical lesions.

         13. Laboratory abnormalities that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could
             contraindicate study participation such as liver function tests &gt; 1.5 times the upper
             limit of normal (At the Investigator's discretion, laboratory tests may be repeated
             once for verification.)

         14. A history of, within the past 4 years, or ongoing significant psychiatric illness

             following: psychotropic drugs, antidepressants, sedative-hypnotics, sedating

             informed consent until 24 hours after the final treatment cycle. Selective serotonin
             reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and
             St. John's Wort are permitted for indications other than pain if the subject has been
             on a stable dose for at least 2 weeks before providing consent for this study and
             agrees to remain on a stable dose throughout the course of the study.

         17. Unwilling to use only those medications that are allowed in the study for the
             treatment of their dysmenorrhea, i.e., study drug and rescue medication.
