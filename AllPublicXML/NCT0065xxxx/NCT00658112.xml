    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see how often benzoyl peroxide is applied for acne.
      Use of medication was monitored electronically.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We give subjects topical benzoyl peroxide, a standard first line acne treatment, in a
      container that records when the container is opened and closed. Subjects will simply be asked
      to &quot;return in six weeks to see how well benzoyl peroxide works for them.&quot; Subjects initially
      will not be told that they are participating in a formal study. When they return with their
      medication, we will seek their informed consent to participate in the study. Verbal consent
      will be obtained at the beginning of the study. There will be no written consent obtained
      until the end of the study. By doing this, subjects will not be aware that adherence is being
      measured. Subjects will not be aware that they are participating in a study. Only if they
      consent would we then collect the medication container and monitor and retrieve the adherence
      data. If they do not consent, we will not have collected any research data on them except
      baseline acne severity measures which may have been collected anyway as part of their clinic
      treatment.

          -  Introduction of any other prescription medication, topical or systemic, for acne
             vulgaris while participating in the study.

          -  Subjects should not be using topical retinoids or benzoyl peroxide products, including
             ProactiveÂ® or topical prescription medications for the treatment of acne vulgaris for
