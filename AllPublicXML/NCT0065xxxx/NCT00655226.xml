      The purpose of this study is to determine whether cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is
      effective in the prevention of depression during interferon and ribavirin treatment for
      hepatitis C infection.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment for active hepatitis C in both HCV mono-infected and HCV/HIV co-infected
      patients is a long and difficult course, involving combination therapy of interferon and
      ribavirin for 6 to 12 months, a therapy with significant side effects. Up to 40% of patients
      being treated will develop depression due to the medication, which in turn leads to
      discontinuation of therapy and lost opportunities to prevent end stage liver disease. In
      fact, the presence of depression prior to interferon treatment often excludes patients from
      receiving interferon therapy, thereby denying them a potentially life-saving treatment.
      Non-pharmacological therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) have demonstrated
      efficacy in treating primary depression in numerous studies including in patients under going
      treatment with chronic medical illness. CBT is a well-established treatment modality and has
      been shown in several large randomized trials to be as effective, and in some cases more
      effective, than antidepressants. CBT has also shown efficacy in preventing the development of
      depression and other emotional disorders in high-risk populations. Offering CBT prior to and
      during treatment with interferon to non-depressed patients is a unique method that may reduce
      rates of depression and increase adherence to treatment without exposing patients to the risk
      of an additional medication.
