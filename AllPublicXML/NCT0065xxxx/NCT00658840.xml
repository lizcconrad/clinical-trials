  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The only curative option for pancreatic cancer patients is surgery, but the patients within
      20% of them are possible for a radical surgery. Accordingly, concurrent chemo-radiation
      therapy is generally used for palliation of unresectable pancreatic cancer patients. So far,
      the use of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was the traditional method of chemotherapy. However, these
      days, oral anti-cancer medicine, capecitabine(Xeloda®), was developed and considered as an
      alternative medicine of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Furthermore, according to the recent results
      of clinical trials, the clinical use of capecitabine(Xeloda®) with radiation therapy was
      proved to be very effective and safe. The purpose of this trial is to improve the therapeutic
      effects by using proton therapy and chemotherapy concurrently.

    <description>Primary objectives :
To evaluate the tumor response rate, local control rate and compliance (acute and late toxicity, esp. gastrointestinal tract toxicity) of concurrent chemo-radiotherapy with oral capecitabine in patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma
Secondary objectives :
To evaluate the impact of concurrent chemo-radiotherapy with oral capecitabine in patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma by analyzing the progression-free survival rate and overall survival rate.</description>

    <intervention_name>Capecitabine (Xeloda®)</intervention_name>
    <description>Capecitabine is administered orally at a dose of 800 mg/m2 twice daily (total daily dose 1600mg/ m2) continuous regimen regimen during RT (5 days of treatment followed by a 2 day rest: Saturday and Sunday). Capecitabine is given approximately 12 hours apart and taken orally with water within 30 minutes after ingestion of food (breakfast or dinner).</description>

    <description>Radiation dose and planning
Total dose 55.8Gy, 28 fractions, 6-7 weeks (1.8 Gy/day). A cone down after 45 Gy will be performed to emcompass GTV with a margin of 1-1.5cm.
Dose prescription : 90% isodose volume of prescribed dose encompassed PTV
The dose-volume histogram (DVH) of targets, such as GTV, CTV, and PTV, and the normal tissues, such as the liver, duodenum, stomach, the kidneys, spinal cord, etc., was calculated.</description>
