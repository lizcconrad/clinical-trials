    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to examine the efficacy and tolerability of ziprasidone
      intramuscular (IM), and to assess the effect of switching from IM to oral ziprasidone for the
      treatment of acute exacerbation of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in a Latin
      American population.

    <description>IM ziprasidone at an initial dose of 10 or 20 mg for the first 3 days; additional doses could be administered according to clinical need, with the maximum total daily IM dose of 40 mg. On Day 4, IM treatment was switched to oral (PO) treatment at an initial dose of 40 mg twice daily for the first 2 days; doses could be subsequently adjusted within the range of 40 to 80 mg twice daily. Total treatment duration was 6 weeks.</description>
