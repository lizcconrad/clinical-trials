  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some nutraceuticals are often advised for their lipid lowering effects. Although many
      clinical trials have been conducted to assess their efficacy many doubts remain whether they
      could be considered an effective alternative to statins therapy.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the lipid lowering effects and the improvement of
      endothelial dysfunction in patients with hyperlipidemia, treated with a nutraceutical product
      (Armolipid Plus)
