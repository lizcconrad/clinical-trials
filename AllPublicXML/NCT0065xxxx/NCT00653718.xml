  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2005, the EBCIG demonstrated the efficacy of tamoxifen in improving overall survival in
      hormone receptor positive breast cancers. However, tamoxifen shows partial estrogen agonist
      activity, which is responsible for the drug's detrimental effects such as endometrial
      carcinoma, thromboembolism, and tamoxifen resistance. More recently, aromatase inhibitors
      have been shown to be superior to tamoxifen in the metastatic and adjuvant settings. The ATAC
      trial demonstrated improved disease-free survival (DFS) for 5 years of anastrozole compared
      to 5 years of tamoxifen 3. The BIG 1-98 trial results demonstrated that after a median
      follow-up of 25.8 months, letrozole improved DFS and distant DFS when compared to tamoxifen.
      Based on these results, adjuvant hormonal therapy with Aromatase Inhibitors (AI) has become
      the preferred therapy for post-menopausal woman.

      However, AI therapy is also associated with toxicities that merit in-depth studies, one of
      them being an increase in musculoskeletal pain. In the ATAC trial, at a median follow-up of
      5.7 years, arthralgia was significantly higher (35.6% vs. 29.4%) and fractures were also
      increased (11.0% vs. 7.7%) when anastrozole was administered for 5 years following surgery
      with or without chemotherapy 3. The incidence of arthralgia was also significantly higher in
      the MA-17 trial, with 25% of patients receiving letrozole developing arthralgia compared with
      21% in the placebo group following 5 to 6 years of tamoxifen 5.

      Traditionally in cancer clinical trials, the reporting of musculoskeletal pain has been based
      on the &quot;Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&quot;, which covers a wide range of
      symptoms and does not facilitate the documentation of a pain syndrome in a specific manner.
      Therefore, there is a need to design a study that will describe the nature of the pain
      associated with the administration of AI therapy using tools that have been validated for
      capturing a multidimensional phenomenon such as pain.
