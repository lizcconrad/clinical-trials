    <textblock>
      The clinical trial objectives were to evaluate the dialysability of the sugammadex-rocuronium
      complex; it's safety and efficacy in participants with severe renal impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current trial was designed to evaluate the dialysability of the sugammadex-rocuronium
      complex in participants with severe renal impairment. A dose of 4.0 mg/kg sugammadex was
      administered 15 minutes after administration of 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium. Blood and dialysate
      samples were collected before, during and after hemodialysis/filtration, for calculation of
      clearance of sugammadex-rocuronium complex and assessment of rebound.

    <measure>Clearance of Sugammadex by Dialysis as Measured by the Reduction Ratio (RR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Starting on Day 1 dialysis was performed on four separate occasions using a Fresenius 40008H hemodialyzer, with a hemodiafilter standard helixone membrane FX 600. Dialysate samples were collected before, and after hemodialysis, with concentrations of sugammadex determined using a liquid chromatographic assay with mass spectrometric detection. The clearance of sugammadex at each dialysis session was calculated by measuring the ratio of plasma concentration at the end of dialysis, average duration of 6 hours, compared with that immediately before the start of dialysis, called the RR.</description>

        <title>Clearance of Sugammadex by Dialysis as Measured by the Reduction Ratio (RR)</title>
        <description>Starting on Day 1 dialysis was performed on four separate occasions using a Fresenius 40008H hemodialyzer, with a hemodiafilter standard helixone membrane FX 600. Dialysate samples were collected before, and after hemodialysis, with concentrations of sugammadex determined using a liquid chromatographic assay with mass spectrometric detection. The clearance of sugammadex at each dialysis session was calculated by measuring the ratio of plasma concentration at the end of dialysis, average duration of 6 hours, compared with that immediately before the start of dialysis, called the RR.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Reoccurrence of Neuromuscular Blockade at Day 1</title>
        <description>Neuromuscular function was monitored by applying repetitive train of four (TOF) electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing the magnitudes (heights) of the first twitch (T1) and fourth twitch (T4) response at the adductor pollicis muscle with a TOF-Watch® SX. Stimulation continued until the T4/T1 ratio reached at least 0.9. Higher T4/T1 ratios represent greater recovery from neuromuscular blockade; with a value of 1.0 representing full recovery. Reoccurrence of neuromuscular blockade is defined as a decline in the T4/T1 ratio from &gt;= 0.9 to &lt; 0.8 in at least three consecutive measurements.</description>

        <description>Neuromuscular function was monitored by applying repetitive train of four (TOF) electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing the magnitudes (heights) of the first twitch (T1) and fourth twitch (T4) response at the adductor pollicis muscle with a TOF-Watch® SX. Stimulation continued until the T4/T1 ratio reached at least 0.9. Higher T4/T1 ratios represent greater recovery from neuromuscular blockade; with a value of 1.0 representing full recovery.</description>

        <description>Starting on Day 1 dialysis was performed on four separate occasions using a Fresenius 40008H hemodialyzer, with a hemodiafilter standard helixone membrane FX 600. Dialysate samples were collected before, and after hemodialysis, with concentrations of rocuronium determined using a liquid chromatographic assay with mass spectrometric detection. The clearance of rocuronium at each dialysis session was calculated by measuring the ratio of plasma concentration at the end of dialysis, average duration of 6 hours, compared with that immediately before the start of dialysis, called the RR.</description>

        <title>Rate of Clearance of Sugammadex From Dialysate</title>
        <description>Starting on Day 1 dialysis was performed on four separate occasions using a Fresenius 40008H hemodialyzer, with a hemodiafilter standard helixone membrane FX 600. Dialysate samples were collected from a port in the outflow of the dialyzer before, during and after an average of 6 hours of hemodialysis. The concentrations of sugammadex were determined using a liquid chromatographic assay with mass spectrometric detection. The clearance rate from dialysate at each dialysis session was assessed by averaging across all available collection time points.The data from the fourth dialysis are not presented as they were not calculable.</description>
