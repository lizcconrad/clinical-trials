  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that there are unique sonographic characteristics of antibiotic-associated
      diarrhea. We will compare the ultrasound findings in patients who received antibiotics and
      developed diarrhea to toxin analysis for clostridium difficile in stool in order to find
      differences in the sonographic findings in the positive and negative cases.
