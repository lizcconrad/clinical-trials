      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a four months strength
      training program on physical and psychological health in patients with prostate cancer during
      androgen deprivation therapy. It is hypothesized a beneficial effect of the intervention on
      physical and psychological health in patients with prostate cancer treated with androgen
      deprivation.

    <description>Patients in the control group are not discouraged from performing normal activities. They are however asked not to start a strength training program or increase their activity level in the same period as the experimental group is performing their strength training program. We will offer the control group a modified strength training program after the post-intervention assessment.</description>

    <description>After 5-10 months on androgen deprivation therapy the patients in the intervention group go through a four months strength training intervention. The patients will perform three strength-training sessions per week, two under supervision of a sport instructor. Each session will consists of one-three sets of nine strength-training exercises, performed at an intensity of 6 or 10 repetitions of maximum (6-10 RM).</description>
