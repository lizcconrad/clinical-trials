    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female adults, 18 through 65 years of age at time of randomization;

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject prior to beginning study procedures
             or receipt of any study medication;

          -  Previously documented diagnosis of asthma of ≥ 1 year duration, based on episodic
             symptoms of airflow obstruction; post-bronchodilator reversibility of airflow
             obstruction ≥ 12% (in USA only - if subject does not achieve this during screening,
             proof of ≥12% reversibility within 1 year of randomization is acceptable) or proof of
             a positive response to a methacholine challenge during screening with prior approval
             from MedImmune (in USA only - within 1 year of randomization is acceptable) as
             represented by a provoking concentration of methacholine to cause a 20% fall in FEV1
             (PC20) &lt; 8 mg/ml [American Thoracic Society (ATS), 2000)]; and exclusion of
             alternative pulmonary diagnoses (eg, cystic fibrosis, COPD);

          -  Asthma symptoms are adequately controlled on a therapeutic regimen that has not
             changed in the last 4 weeks prior to Study Day 0, and the subject is willing to
             maintain the same therapeutic regimen and doses from the time of screening to the time
             of the first follow-up bronchoscopy with airway mucosal biopsies (Study Day 28 for
             Cohort 1; Study Day 84 for Cohort 2);

          -  Pre-bronchodilator FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio that is below the
             age-adjusted normal limit as defined by the 2007 National Heart Lung and Blood
             Institute Asthma guidelines (Appendix D) and post-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 65% at
             screening;

          -  Must have ≥ 2.5% eosinophils in sputum;

          -  Have had no hospitalizations due to asthma in the last year prior to screening;

          -  Women of childbearing potential, unless surgically sterile or at least 1 year
             post-menopausal, must use 2 effective methods of avoiding pregnancy

          -  Able to complete the follow-up period as required by the protocol;

          -  Willing to forego other forms of experimental treatment and study procedures during

             formulation;

          -  Lung disease other than asthma (eg, COPD, cystic fibrosis, eosinophilic pneumonia);

          -  Current use of any systemic or inhaled immunosuppressive drugs [oral (up to a maximum
             dose of 10 mg/day or 20 mg every other day) and inhaled corticosteroids are allowed if
             dose has been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to study drug administration on Study
             Day 0].

          -  Current use of any β-blocker (eg, propranolol);

          -  Acute illnesses or evidence of clinically significant active infection, such as fever
             ≥ 38.0ºC (100.5ºF) at screening and through the time of the study drug administration

             84 for Cohort 1 or Study Day 140 for Cohort 2);

          -  Pregnancy (women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test prior to study drug administration on
             Study Day 0);

          -  Breastfeeding or lactating;

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse &lt; 1 year prior to Study Day 0;

          -  History of immunodeficiency or infection with HIV-1, HIV-2, or hepatitis A, B, or C

          -  Evidence of any systemic disease or respiratory disease (other than asthma), history
             of any disease, or any finding upon physical examination, screening laboratory test,
             chest X-ray (CXR), or ECG that, in the opinion of the investigator or medical monitor,
             may compromise the safety of the subject in the study or confound the analysis of the
             study results;
