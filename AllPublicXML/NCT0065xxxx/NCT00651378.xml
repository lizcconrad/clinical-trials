    <textblock>
      This study assesses whether adding ezetimibe 10 mg/d to ongoing treatment with atorvastatin
      10 mg/d is more effective than switching the subject to treatment with rosuvastatin 10 mg/d
      or doubling the dose of atorvastatin to 20 mg/d is more effective in achieving goal
      LDL-cholesterol of &lt;2.5 mmol/L. Treatment phase is 6 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years to 75 years of age;

          -  Stabilized on atorvastatin 10 mg daily and by subject reported history had taken at
             least 80% of daily doses for the 4 weeks preceding Visit 1;

          -  Clinical laboratory tests (CBC, blood chemistries, urinalysis) taken at Visit 1 must
             have been within normal limits or clinically acceptable to the Investigator;

             antagonist/agonist, or oral contraceptives, must have been maintained on a stable dose
