          -  No more than 1.0 D of refractive difference between eyes.

          -  Stable prescription in both eyes as defined by &lt;0.25 D change over the preceding 2
             years.

          -  Subjects who require Mitomycin C following their PRK.

          -  Subjects with any ocular disease or corneal abnormality, including but not limited to:

               -  Decreased corneal sensation / neurotrophic cornea;
