    <textblock>
      This is a pharmacokinetic study designed to compare the metabolism of ARQ 197 in normal
      healthy volunteers who are extensive metabolizers (EM) or poor metabolizers (PM) as defined
      by CYP 2C19 genotype. This is an open-label, single-dose, parallel group design in which
      healthy volunteer subjects will receive a single dose of ARQ 197
