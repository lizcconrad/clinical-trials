      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and cisplatin, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or
      carry tumor-killing substances to them. Cetuximab may stop the growth of esophageal cancer by
      blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether giving paclitaxel and cisplatin
      together with radiation therapy is more effective with or without cetuximab in treating
      esophageal cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing how well giving paclitaxel and
      cisplatin together with radiation therapy works with or without cetuximab in treating
      patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate whether the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel,
           cisplatin, and radiotherapy improves overall survival compared with paclitaxel,
           cisplatin, and radiotherapy alone in patients with esophageal cancer treated without
           surgery.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate whether the addition of cetuximab to paclitaxel, cisplatin, and radiotherapy
           improves local control by increasing the clinical complete response and decreasing local
           recurrence in these patients.

        -  To evaluate adverse events in these patients.

        -  To evaluate endoscopic complete response rates in these patients.

        -  To evaluate if the addition of cetuximab to paclitaxel, cisplatin, and radiotherapy
           improves the Esophageal Cancer Subscale (ECS) score of the Functional Assessment of
           Cancer Therapy - Esophagus (FACT-E) quality of life tool.

        -  To evaluate the quality-adjusted survival of each treatment arm using EQ-5D if the
           primary endpoint supports the primary hypothesis.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to histology
      (adenocarcinoma vs squamous), cancer lesion size (&lt; 5 cm vs ≥ 5 cm), and disease status of
      celiac nodes (present vs absent). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

    <time_frame>From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis was planned to occur after at least 281 deaths had been observed. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 74.5 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Survival time is defined as time from randomization to date of death from any cause and is estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients last known to be alive are censored at the date of last contact. This analysis was planned to occur after at least 281 deaths have been observed, unless an early stopping rule was satisfied.</description>

    <time_frame>From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis was planned to occur after at least 281 deaths had been observed. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 74.5 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Local failure (LF) was defined as residual cancer on posttreatment biopsy findings or biopsy-proven recurrent primary disease and local failure time was measured from randomization to failure or last follow-up. Nonprotocol surgery to the primary site with gross residual disease was considered a LF as of the surgery date. Patients with no viable disease or microscopic residual disease at nonprotocol surgery were censored for LF as of the surgery date. Local failure was estimated by the cumulative incidence method with death considered a competing risk.</description>

    <time_frame>From start of treatment to 90 days from end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AE) are graded using CTCAE v3.0. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE v3.0 assigns Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild AE, Grade 2 Moderate AE, Grade 3 Severe AE, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5 Death related to AE</description>

    <measure>Endoscopic Complete Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to 6-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiation (11-14 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>All patients were to undergo a repeat endoscopy (EUS) 6-8 weeks after the completion of chemoradiation. At the time of EUS a visual inspection of the site of the original primary disease would be documented. Those patients found to be free of disease were NOT required to undergo repeat biopsy. These patients would be scored as clinical complete responses (cCR). Patients deemed to have residual disease or suspicion of residual disease would undergo a biopsy in order to pathologically confirm findings. Any patient with pathologically confirmed residual disease would be scored as a local failure. Patients who were pathologically proven to have no evidence of disease would be scored as cCRs.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Improvement in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Esophagus (FACT-E) Esophageal Cancer Subscale (ECS) Subscale After Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiation , 1 year and 2 years from treatment start.</time_frame>
    <description>The ECS is a 17-item self-report instrument designed to measure multidimensional quality of life in patients with esophagus cancer. It is to be administered with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G). There are 5 responses options, with 0=Not a lot and 4=Very much. All items are added together to obtain a total score which ranges from 0-68. Certain items must be reversed before it is added by subtracting the response from 4. It requires at least 50% of the items to be completed while the overall response rate of the FACT-E including the FACT-G must be greater than 80%. If items are missing, the subscale scores can be prorated. A higher score indicated better QOL. Improvement in FACT-E score is defined as an increase from baseline score of at least 5 points.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiation, 1 year and 2 years from treatment start.</time_frame>
    <description>The protocol states that this study endpoint will be addressed ONLY if primary outcome results are positive, i.e. support the primary hypothesis of this study. The primary hypothesis was not supported therefore this outcome measure is not reported.</description>

               -  9.5 Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) based upon current Centers for
                  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition; note, however, that human
                  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing is not required for entry into this
                  protocol. The need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary
                  because the treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly
                  immunosuppressive. Protocol-specific requirements may also exclude

             willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception; this exclusion is
             necessary because the treatment involved in this study may be significantly
             teratogenic.

         11. Women who are nursing.

        <title>Percentage of Patients With Improvement in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Esophagus (FACT-E) Esophageal Cancer Subscale (ECS) Subscale After Treatment</title>
        <description>The ECS is a 17-item self-report instrument designed to measure multidimensional quality of life in patients with esophagus cancer. It is to be administered with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G). There are 5 responses options, with 0=Not a lot and 4=Very much. All items are added together to obtain a total score which ranges from 0-68. Certain items must be reversed before it is added by subtracting the response from 4. It requires at least 50% of the items to be completed while the overall response rate of the FACT-E including the FACT-G must be greater than 80%. If items are missing, the subscale scores can be prorated. A higher score indicated better QOL. Improvement in FACT-E score is defined as an increase from baseline score of at least 5 points.</description>
