  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that a transit-time ultrasonic sensor can help doctors diagnose a
      malfunctioning shunt valve.

      The study will simulate an implanted shunt flow monitoring system by placing the flow sensor
      and a programmable shunt valve into the patient's Extra-Ventricular Drainage line. Flow will
      be measured as the doctor raises/lowers the drainage bag to simulate the patient sitting
      up/lying down. The doctor will simulate a malfunctioning shunt by changing the valve's
      pressure release settings for each cycle of raising/lowering the bag.

      By monitoring shunt flow during these changes, the doctors hope to develop new ways to
      diagnose malfunctioning shunt valves when implanted shunt flow monitors become available.
