      The purpose of this study is to determine if consumption of whey protein, compared with soy
      protein or a carbohydrate food decreases blood pressure along with reducing risk factors for
      heart disease.

      Several lines of evidence suggest that consumption of dairy foods, and specifically whey
      protein, may reduce blood pressure. This proposed study is designed investigate the effect of
      whey protein compared to another protein source.

      Since blood pressure is a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular disease, if there is
      clear evidence that whey protein reduces blood pressure, dietary recommendations may be made
      regarding whey protein intake. However, dietary recommendations to consume whey protein as a
      means to improve health status must be science-based. Results from this study will provide a
      scientific basis for dietary recommendations regarding whey protein intake.

          -  Use of vitamin and mineral supplements or antacids containing magnesium or calcium.

          -  Use of prescription or over-the-counter antiobesity medications or supplements (e.g.,

          -  Active cardiovascular disease (such as heart attack or procedure within the past three
             months or participation in a cardiac rehabilitation program within last three months,
             stroke or history/treatment for transient ischemic attacks in the past three months,
             or documented history of pulmonary embolus in past six months).
