        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provide written informed consent

          2. Willing to attend all required study visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known hypersensitivity to Clostridial collagenase

          2. Anticoagulants (blood thinners, including aspirin) within two weeks

          3. Congenital skin disorder which affects keratinocytes, elastin, or collagen

          4. Any dermatologic disease which may be aggravated or provoked by the wounding procedure

          5. Dark skin pigmentation to a degree which is very likely to obscure the assessment of
             vascularization post-wounding

          6. At risk of keloid or hypertrophic scar formation

          7. Scars, tattoos or deformities (i.e., contractures) on the inner aspect of the upper
             arm area where the wound will be placed

          8. Any skin disorder which causes delayed healing

          9. Disrupted lymphatic drainage of the arm to be studied, or previously diagnosed
             thoracic outlet syndrome

         10. Taking concomitant medications at doses which are known to interfere with healing,
             such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-neoplastic drugs, or
             immunosuppressive drugs
