    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in the Mean 24-hour Ambulatory Diastolic Blood Pressure (MADBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>An Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) device was attached to the non-dominant arm of the participant. The mean of Blood Pressure readings during the 24 hour period were calculated. The difference of the 24 hour MADBP from baseline to the 24 hour MADBP at 6 weeks was calculated using an Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline mean 24 hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure as a covariate.</description>

    <description>An Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) device was attached to the non-dominant arm of the participant. The mean of Blood Pressure readings during the 22-24 hour period were calculated. The difference from the last 3 hours MADBP at baseline to the last 3 hour MADBP at Week 6 was calculated using an ANCOVA model with baseline mean 24 hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure as a covariate.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in the Mean Sitting Systolic and Mean Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>After the patient had been sitting for 5 minutes, with the back supported and both feet placed on the floor, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured 3 times using a calibrated standard sphygmomanometer and appropriate size cuff. The repeat sitting measurements were made at 1-2 minute intervals and the mean of these 3 sitting blood pressure measurements was used as the average sitting blood pressure for that visit. A negative number indicates lowered blood pressure. The ANCOVA model used baseline as a covariate.</description>

    <description>After the patient had been sitting for 5 minutes, with the back supported and both feet placed on the floor, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured 3 times using a calibrated standard sphygmomanometer. The mean of these 3 sitting blood pressure measurements was used as the average sitting blood pressure at visit 3 (week 6).
Blood pressure control was defined as having a mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (msDBP) &lt;90 mm Hg and a mean sitting systolic blood pressure (msSBP) &lt;140 mm Hg.</description>

        <description>An Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) device was attached to the non-dominant arm of the participant. The mean of Blood Pressure readings during the 24 hour period were calculated. The difference of the 24 hour MADBP from baseline to the 24 hour MADBP at 6 weeks was calculated using an Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline mean 24 hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure as a covariate.</description>

        <description>After the patient had been sitting for 5 minutes, with the back supported and both feet placed on the floor, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured 3 times using a calibrated standard sphygmomanometer. The mean of these 3 sitting blood pressure measurements was used as the average sitting blood pressure at visit 3 (week 6).
Blood pressure control was defined as having a mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (msDBP) &lt;90 mm Hg and a mean sitting systolic blood pressure (msSBP) &lt;140 mm Hg.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Blood Pressure Control at Week 6</title>
          <description>After the patient had been sitting for 5 minutes, with the back supported and both feet placed on the floor, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured 3 times using a calibrated standard sphygmomanometer. The mean of these 3 sitting blood pressure measurements was used as the average sitting blood pressure at visit 3 (week 6).
Blood pressure control was defined as having a mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (msDBP) &lt;90 mm Hg and a mean sitting systolic blood pressure (msSBP) &lt;140 mm Hg.</description>
