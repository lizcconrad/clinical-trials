        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is either male or female between 18 - 55 years of age inclusive.

          -  Subject has a BMI within the range 19-27 kg/m². [BMI = Weight (kg) ÷ Height (m)²].

          -  Subject is in good general health with (in the opinion of the investigator) no
             clinically significant and relevant abnormalities as assessed by medical history,
             physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory test results
             (hematology, biochemistry and urinalysis) are within normal limits.

          -  If female, subject of childbearing potential is practicing a reliable method of
             contraception in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Subject understands and is willing, able, and likely to comply with all study
             procedures and restrictions.

          -  If female, subject is pregnant, has a positive serum pregnancy test during screening,
             or is breast-feeding.

          -  Subject has a disease or condition that may interfere with the oral absorption of the
             study drugs.

               1. A medical history that, in the opinion of the investigator, might jeopardize the
                  safety of the subject (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, circulatory problems, recent
                  myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident within 12 weeks prior to first
                  study session, unstable or worsening angina pectoris, Prinzmetal's angina or
                  severe cardiac arrhythmia).

               2. A medical history which, in the opinion of the investigator, might impact the
                  validity of the study results and may require pharmacotherapy or prevent the
                  subject from finishing the study.

               3. Oral surgery within 4 weeks of dosing, dental work or extractions within 2 weeks
                  of dosing, or presence of any clinically significant (as determined by the
                  principal investigator) oral pathology including lesions, sores or inflammation.

             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test result.

          -  Subject has known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to any of the study
             materials or closely related compounds or any of their stated ingredients.

          -  Subject has a genetic deficiency with an inability to metabolize aspartame or
             phenylalanine, or has been diagnosed with phenylketonuria.

          -  Subject has participated in another clinical study or received an investigational drug
             within 30 days of the first study session or previously participated in this study.

          -  Subject has donated or experienced significant blood loss within 56 days of Visit 2,
             donated plasma within 7 days of Visit 2, or has a hemoglobin value of &lt;12.0g/dL.

          -  Subject has been treated with any known enzyme-altering agents (e.g., barbiturates,
             phenothiazines, cimetidine, theophyllines) within 30 days prior to the first study
             session.

          -  Subject has used any nicotine replacement therapy within 21 days prior to the first
             study session.

          -  Subject has used any over-the-counter (OTC) medication or herbal supplements within 48
             hours prior to administration of study treatment.

          -  Subject has used any prescription medication within 14 days prior to each study
