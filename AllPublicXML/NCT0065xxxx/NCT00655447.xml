      At the time of hysterectomy for benign disease, the overall health benefits of preserving
      ovarian function in a large population of women have not been established.

    <textblock>
      We are conducting a prospective, observational study of 32,175 women participants of the
      Nurse's Health Study who had a hysterectomy with or without removal of both ovaries. We are
      evaluating mortality and morbidity due to the following conditions: coronary heart disease,
      stroke, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, other cancer, hip fracture and death from all causes.
