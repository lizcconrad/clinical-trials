      To determine if intravenous unfractionated heparin (with standard therapy) for treatment of
      anaphylaxis results in faster time to recovery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening entity that requires both immediate recognition
      and aggressive treatment. Although anaphylaxis is infrequent, comprising only 1% of
      approximately 1.03 million visits to the ED each year that are related to allergic reactions,
      it is none the less a generally under-recognized and under-treated disease, that is worthy of
      study due to the potential for a fatal outcome. Recently, there has been renewed interest in
      a commonly used and inexpensive drug (heparin) as a novel component of therapy for
      anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions. Heflin eft al. induced anaphylactoid reactions in pigs
      and compared intravenous unfractionated heparin in one treatment arm to standard therapy
      (intravenous epinephrine and diphenhydramine) versus placebo. The study revealed that heparin
      rapidly reversed the shock similar to that of standard emergency treatment. Of course this
      single study done in pigs will not change practice, but it does warrant further investigation
      into the role that heparin plays in anaphylaxis in humans.
