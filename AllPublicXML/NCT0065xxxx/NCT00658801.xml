  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The only curative option for pancreatic cancer patients is surgery, but the patients within
      20% of them are possible for a radical surgery. Accordingly, concurrent chemo-radiation
      therapy is generally used for palliation of unresectable pancreatic cancer patients. So far,
      the use of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was the traditional method of chemotherapy. However, these
      days, oral anti-cancer medicine, capecitabine(Xeloda®), was developed and considered as an
      alternative medicine of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Furthermore, according to the recent results
      of clinical trials, the clinical use of capecitabine(Xeloda®) with radiation therapy was
      proved to be very effective and safe. Proton therapy is a new radiation therapy which
      remaining energy is released when they reach the tumor, delivering the most effective dose of
      radiation and which can minimize the exposure to normal tissues. The purpose of this trial is
      to improve the therapeutic effects by using proton therapy and chemotherapy concurrently.
