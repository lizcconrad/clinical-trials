    <measure>Least Squares Means of Measured Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) (Iohexol Serum Clearance in Milliliters Per Minute [mL/Min])</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>Glomerular filtration rate (GFR): an index of kidney function. GFR described the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. GFR was calculated using iohexol serum clearance. For determination of iohexol serum clearance, iohexol was administered as an intravenous (IV) bolus over 5 minutes immediately after morning dosing of Tofacitinib or CsA on day of GFR evaluation. Blood samples for iohexol (3 millilitres [mL] each to provide a minimum of 1 mL serum) were collected into appropriately labeled tubes containing no additives at 120, 180, 240, and 300 minutes after the end of the iohexol IV bolus. A normal GFR is greater than (&gt;) 90 mL/min, although children and older people usually have a lower GFR. Lower values indicated poor kidney function. A GFR less than (&lt;) 15 mL/min indicated kidney failure.</description>

    <time_frame>Months 24, 36</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 v2 is a self-administered 36-item generic health status measure with 8 general health concepts which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section: Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Emotional, and Mental Health. Each scale is transformed into a 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum) scale on the assumption each question carries equal weight. These concepts were also summarized into 2 summary scores; Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary (both a 0-100 scale). The 8 subscales, 2 summary scores and transition Question 2 (TR Scale, measured on a scale of 1 [minimum] to 5 [maximum]) were subjected to analysis. Higher domain, summary scores, and TR scale scores indicate better health status. Model contained treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction as fixed effects and Baseline (predose in Study A3921030) as a covariate.

          <description>CsA was administered for up to 60 months as CsA microemulsion (Neoral® brand in the United States) orally twice daily (BID) in 2 equal doses approximately 12 hours apart. The dosage was adjusted to achieve a 12 hour trough whole blood level of approximately 75 to 200 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). Participants also received oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 1 to 2 gram tablet daily throughout this extension study (or up to 3 mg daily for Black participants). Prednisone 5mg daily (or equivalent) was also maintained through at least 12 months posttransplant (parent study).</description>

        <description>Glomerular filtration rate (GFR): an index of kidney function. GFR described the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. GFR was calculated using iohexol serum clearance. For determination of iohexol serum clearance, iohexol was administered as an intravenous (IV) bolus over 5 minutes immediately after morning dosing of Tofacitinib or CsA on day of GFR evaluation. Blood samples for iohexol (3 millilitres [mL] each to provide a minimum of 1 mL serum) were collected into appropriately labeled tubes containing no additives at 120, 180, 240, and 300 minutes after the end of the iohexol IV bolus. A normal GFR is greater than (&gt;) 90 mL/min, although children and older people usually have a lower GFR. Lower values indicated poor kidney function. A GFR less than (&lt;) 15 mL/min indicated kidney failure.</description>

        <title>Kaplan-Meier Analysis of Percentage of Participants With First Biopsy Proven Acute Rejection (BPAR) by Visit</title>
        <description>BPAR was category acute rejection as interpreted by the central blinded pathologist according to the Banff 97 working classification. The 'Number' and 'Other Confidence Interval Level' columns represent cumulative proportions and 60% confidence intervals (CIs) as estimated from the fitted Kaplan-Meier curves for each treatment at scheduled visits.</description>

            <description>CsA was administered for up to 60 months as CsA microemulsion (Neoral® brand in the United States) orally twice daily (BID) in 2 equal doses approximately 12 hours apart. The dosage was adjusted to achieve a 12 hour trough whole blood level of approximately 75 to 200 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). Participants also received oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 1 to 2 gram tablet daily throughout this extension study (or up to 3 mg daily for Black participants). Prednisone 5mg daily (or equivalent) was also maintained through at least 12 months posttransplant (parent study).</description>

        <title>Kaplan-Meier Analysis of Percentage of Participants With Treated Clinical Acute Rejection by Visit</title>
        <description>Treated clinical acute rejection was defined as an acute rejection episode that was diagnosed based on local biopsy readout and received anti-rejection treatment. The 'Number' and 'Other Confidence Interval Level' columns represent cumulative proportions and 60% confidence intervals (CIs) as estimated from the fitted Kaplan-Meier curves for each treatment at scheduled visits.</description>

        <title>Kaplan-Meier Analysis of Percentage of Participants With Efficacy Failure by Visit</title>
        <description>Efficacy failure was the first occurrence of BPAR diagnosed by the central pathologist or graft loss including participant death. BPAR (category acute rejection) was interpreted by the central blinded pathologist according to the Banff 97 working classification. The 'Number' and 'Other Confidence Interval Level' columns represent cumulative proportions and 60% confidence intervals (CIs) as estimated from the fitted Kaplan-Meier curves for each treatment at scheduled visits.</description>

        <title>Kaplan-Meier Analysis of Percentage of Participants With Combined Banff Rejection by Visit</title>
        <description>Banff 97: standard classification for scoring and classifying rejection of kidney transplant biopsies in 6 diagnostic categories: normal, antibody-mediated rejection, borderline changes: ‘suspicious’ for acute cellular rejection, acute/active cellular rejection, chronic/sclerosing allograft nephropathy, and other. Combined Banff rejection was calculated from categories of antibody-mediated rejection (Category 2) plus borderline changes (Category 3) plus acute rejection (Category 4), as interpreted by the central pathologist. The 'Number' and 'Other Confidence Interval Level' columns represent cumulative proportions and 60% confidence intervals (CIs) as estimated from the fitted Kaplan-Meier curves for each treatment at scheduled visits.</description>

        <title>Kaplan-Meier Analysis of Percent of Participants With Graft Survival With Death Censored by Visit</title>
        <description>Graft loss was defined as graft nephrectomy, subject death, retransplantation, or return to dialysis for at least 6 consecutive weeks. The 'Number' and 'Other Confidence Interval Level' columns represent cumulative proportions and 60% confidence intervals (CIs) as estimated from the fitted Kaplan-Meier curves for each treatment at scheduled visits. Included data up to 2 months postdose in the clinical Follow-up visit.</description>

            <description>CsA was administered for up to 60 months as CsA microemulsion (Neoral® brand in the United States) orally twice daily (BID) in 2 equal doses approximately 12 hours apart. The dosage was adjusted to achieve a 12 hour trough whole blood level of approximately 75 to 200 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). Participants also received oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 1 to 2 gram tablet daily throughout this extension study (or up to 3 mg daily for Black participants). Prednisone 5mg daily (or equivalent) was also maintained through at least 12 months posttransplant (parent study).</description>

            <description>Tofacitinib was administered for up to 60 months. During the parent study (A3921030), participants received 15 milligram (mg) tablet orally BID for Months 1 to 3 posttransplant then 10 mg tablet orally BID from Month 4. On entry to this extension study (Month 12), the dose was continued and tapered to 5 mg BID as early as Month 12 and by Month 18 posttransplant. Total tofacitinib LI treatment was up to 72 months posttransplant (12 months parent study and 60 months extension). Participants also received oral MMF 1 to 2 gram tablet daily throughout this extension study. Prednisone 5mg daily (or equivalent) was also maintained through at least 12 months posttransplant (parent study).</description>

        <title>Least Square Means of Estimated GFR Calculated Using the Nankivell Equation by Visit</title>
        <description>GFR: an index of kidney function. GFR described the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. GFR was measured directly or estimated using established formulas. GFR was calculated using Nankivell formula, where:
Creatinine clearance (mL/min) = 6.7/serum creatinine (millimols per litre [mmol/L]) - serum urea (mmol/dL)/2 + actual body weight (kilograms [kg])/4 - 100/Height (metres [m])^2 + (35 for male or 25 for female).
A normal GFR for adults is &gt; 90 mL/min. Lower values indicate poor kidney function. A GFR &lt;15 is consistent with kidney failure.
Model contained treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction as fixed effects. An unstructured variance-covariance structure was used.</description>

        <title>Least Squares Means of Estimated GFR Calculated Using the Cockcroft-Gault Equation by Visit</title>
        <description>GFR: an index of kidney function. GFR described the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. GFR was measured directly or estimated using established formulas. GFR (mL/min) was calculated using Cockcroft-Gault equation. GFR by Cockcroft-Gault equation= body weight (kg)*(140 minus age in years) divided by (72*serum creatinine [mg/dL]). For females value obtained was multiplied by 0.85. A normal GFR is &gt;90 mL/min, although children and older people usually have a lower GFR. Lower values indicated poor kidney function. A GFR &lt;15 mL/min indicated kidney failure.
Model contained treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction as fixed effects. An unstructured variance-covariance structure was used.</description>

        <description>GFR: an index of kidney function. GFR described the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. GFR was calculated using MDRD equation. GFR (mL/min/1.73 m^2) by MDRD equation = 170 * (serum creatinine [mg/dL])^(-0.999) * (age in years)^(-0.176) * (0.762 if female) * (1.18 if black) * (blood urea nitrogen concentration [mg/dL])^(-0.170) * (serum albumin concentration [g/dL])^(0.318). A normal GFR is &gt;90 mL/min/1.73 m^2, although children and older people usually have a lower GFR. Lower values indicated poor kidney function. A GFR &lt;15 mL/min/1.73 m^2 indicated kidney failure.
Model contained treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction as fixed effects. An unstructured variance-covariance structure was used.</description>

        <title>Least Squares Means of Short Form 36 Version 2 (SF-36 V2) Component and Domain Scores at Months 24 and 36</title>
        <description>SF-36 v2 is a self-administered 36-item generic health status measure with 8 general health concepts which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section: Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Emotional, and Mental Health. Each scale is transformed into a 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum) scale on the assumption each question carries equal weight. These concepts were also summarized into 2 summary scores; Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary (both a 0-100 scale). The 8 subscales, 2 summary scores and transition Question 2 (TR Scale, measured on a scale of 1 [minimum] to 5 [maximum]) were subjected to analysis. Higher domain, summary scores, and TR scale scores indicate better health status. Model contained treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction as fixed effects and Baseline (predose in Study A3921030) as a covariate. First-order autoregressive variance-covariance structure was used.</description>

            <description>CsA was administered for up to 60 months as CsA microemulsion (Neoral® brand in the United States) orally twice daily (BID) in 2 equal doses approximately 12 hours apart. The dosage was adjusted to achieve a 12 hour trough whole blood level of approximately 75 to 200 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). Participants also received oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 1 to 2 gram tablet daily throughout this extension study (or up to 3 mg daily for Black participants). Prednisone 5mg daily (or equivalent) was also maintained through at least 12 months posttransplant (parent study).</description>

        <description>ESRD-SCL: a 43-item disease specific self-administered questionnaire. Participants’ rated the question “At the moment,how much do you suffer?” for each item on a 5 point scale, range (Ra) from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Consisted of 6 subscales: Cardiac and Renal (CR) dysfunction; Ra 0 to 28, Increased(In) Growth of Gum and Hair (IGGH); Ra 0 to 20, Limited Cognitive Capacity (LCC); Ra 0 to 32, Limited Physical Capacity (LPC); Ra 0 to 40, Side Effects (SEs) of Corticosteroids; Ra 0 to 20, Transplantation Associated Psychological Distress (TAPD); Ra 0 to 32. Total Score: 0 to 172, higher scores indicate greater dysfunction.
Model contained treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction as fixed effects and Baseline (predose in Study A3921030) as a covariate. A first-order autoregressive variance-covariance structure was used.</description>

        <title>Least Squares Means of Severity of Dyspepsia Assessment (SODA) Subscales at Months 24 &amp; 36</title>
        <description>SODA:17-item health scale, assessed participant-reported perceptions of dyspepsia; consists of 3 subscales: Pain Intensity (PI, 6-items to assess pain and intensity of abdominal discomfort; Range: 2 to 47, higher score indicates greater pain and abdominal discomfort), Non-Pain Symptoms (NPS, 7-items to assess severity and impact of non-pain symptoms: burping/belching, heartburn, bloating, flatulence, sour taste, nausea, and bad breath; Range: 7 to 35, higher scores indicate increased symptom severity and influence), and Satisfaction (4-items to assess degree of satisfaction with abdominal discomfort; Range: 2 to 23, higher scores indicate more satisfaction).
Model contained treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction as fixed effects and Baseline (predose in Study A3921030) as a covariate. A first-order autoregressive variance-covariance structure was used.</description>

The participant was instructed to follow a 12 hourly schedule for these 6 doses of tofacitinib, with each dose administered within 1 hour of the scheduled time. Trough samples were collected 0 to 10 minutes prior to the morning dose. 1 hour postdose samples were required within 10 minutes of the nominal time point. Samples taken at -2 hours predose and at time points &gt;1 hour post dose were required within 30 minutes of the nominal time point.</description>
