      This project will study whether reminder prompts increase Pre-Admission Medication List
      (PAML) Builder application feature utilization. PAML Builder is an application designed and
      maintained by Partners Information Systems that assists clinicians in medication
      reconciliation - a process important for patient safety and quality of care. We have
      determined that several potentially helpful features of the application are not being
      utilized as frequently as had been expected. These features include:

        1. copying the pre-admission medication list (PAML) to the clipboard

        2. viewing the detailed audit trail of all changes made to the PAML

        3. sorting the list of medications obtained from other electronic sources by therapeutic
           class.

      Reminder prompts (sometimes referred to as &quot;Tip of the Day&quot;) have been employed to increase
      user awareness of underutilized application features. However, anecdotally some users find
      them unhelpful and potentially irritating. It is therefore important to determine whether
      reminder prompts accomplish the stated task of increasing application feature utilization.
      This project will compare PAML Builder application feature utilization before and after a
      pilot rollout of reminder prompts to determine whether they should be implemented
      permanently.
