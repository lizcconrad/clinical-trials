  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) is the curriculum used to teach providers how to
      care for newborns in the delivery room. Breakdowns in teamwork and communication contribute
      to NRP quality problems. Adding teamwork instruction to NRP may be a method to improve
      communication, teamwork, and the overall quality of neonatal resuscitation. This study uses
      simulation to incorporate team training into NRP and to evaluate both the effectiveness and
      duration of the team training. Furthermore, because high fidelity simulation is very
      expensive and not widely available, we will compare NRP with low fidelity team training to
      NRP with high fidelity team training.

      Our hypotheses are:

        1. NRP with low fidelity team training results in a) better teamwork, and b) better quality
           of care compared with standard NRP.

        2. NRP with high fidelity team training does not result in better teamwork or better
           quality of care than NRP with low fidelity simulation.

        3. NRP with high fidelity team training does not produce a longer lasting effect on
           teamwork than NRP with low fidelity simulation.

    <measure>Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) Quality as Assessed by NRP Performance Score</measure>
    <time_frame>During the megacode, which was performed about 1 hour after the training</time_frame>
    <description>We analyzed 2 measures of NRP quality: performance score and resuscitation duration. The performance score was calculated by averaging the scores (ranging from 0 to 2 - higher values represent a better outcome) for each NRP step (some of which occurred multiple times). Those scores were summed and divided by the total possible score (2 times the number of steps that should have been performed). When a step was not indicated for the specific resuscitation scenario (e.g., meconium aspiration), that step was not scored by the observers and it was not included in the denominator for performance calculation. This produced a measure of performance percentage ranging from 0 percent to 100 percent (higher values represent a better outcome) for each resuscitation.</description>

    <measure>Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) Quality as Assessed by Resuscitation Duration</measure>
    <time_frame>During the megacode, which was performed about 1 hour after the training</time_frame>
    <description>Resuscitation duration is time required to complete the resuscitation. The total duration for each resuscitation was calculated from the start of the instructor's reading of the scenario to the team's statement that the infant should be transferred to the NICU. When any teaching moments occurred during the simulation, the total teaching time was subtracted from the resuscitation duration.</description>

    <description>Crew Resource Management (CRM) is an aviation training program mandated for all crew members that teaches human factors concepts, communication skills, and teamwork behaviors that can prevent and manage error. Over the last six years the study team has translated these behaviors to neonatal resuscitation and demonstrated that they can be reliably measured. Adding teamwork instruction to the existing NRP, based upon CRM, may be a method to improve communication, teamwork, and the overall quality of neonatal resuscitation.</description>

        <title>Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) Quality as Assessed by NRP Performance Score</title>
        <description>We analyzed 2 measures of NRP quality: performance score and resuscitation duration. The performance score was calculated by averaging the scores (ranging from 0 to 2 - higher values represent a better outcome) for each NRP step (some of which occurred multiple times). Those scores were summed and divided by the total possible score (2 times the number of steps that should have been performed). When a step was not indicated for the specific resuscitation scenario (e.g., meconium aspiration), that step was not scored by the observers and it was not included in the denominator for performance calculation. This produced a measure of performance percentage ranging from 0 percent to 100 percent (higher values represent a better outcome) for each resuscitation.</description>
