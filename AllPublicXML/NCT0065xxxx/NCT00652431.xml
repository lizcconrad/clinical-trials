        Inclusion Criteria:

        The subject must meet ALL the criteria listed below for entry:

          -  Subjects must be willing to give written informed consent and able to adhere to dose
             and visit schedules.

          -  Subjects of either sex and of any race between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive,
             having a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 19 to 32, inclusive. BMI = weight (kg)/height
             (m^2).

          -  Subjects' clinical laboratory tests (CBC, blood chemistry, and urinalysis) must be
             within normal limits or clinically acceptable to the investigator/sponsor. Subject's
             liver function test results (AST, ALT, and GGT) must not be elevated above normal
             limits at Screening and on Day-1. Subjects' CPK test results must not be elevated more
             than 1.25 times the upper limit of normal, at Screening and on Day -1.

          -  Subjects must be free of any clinically significant disease that would interfere with
             the study evaluations.

          -  Screening ECG conduction intervals must be within gender specific normal range (QTc
             males &lt;=430 msec and females &lt;=450 msec).

          -  Vital sign measurements (taken after ~3 minutes in a seated position) must be within
             the following ranges:

               -  oral body temperature between 35.0°C to 37.5°C

               -  systolic blood pressure, 90 to 140 mm Hg

               -  diastolic blood pressure, 45 to 90 mm Hg

               -  pulse rate, 40 to 100 bpm

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             (beta-hCG) at Screening and have a negative urine pregnancy test upon each admission
             to the study center.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use medically accepted methods of
             contraception prior to screening, while receiving protocol-specified medication, and
             for 30 days after stopping the medication. Acceptable methods of contraception
             include:

               -  Condoms (male or female) with spermicide,

               -  Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide

               -  Medically prescribed IUD with spermicide, and

               -  Surgical sterilization (eg. hysterectomy or tubal ligation). Vasectomy of the
                  partner should be considered a single barrier and one additional contraceptive
                  methods listed above must be used. Females who are not currently sexually active
                  must agree and consent to use one of the above-mentioned methods should they
                  become sexually active while participating in the study.

          -  Female subjects must be surgically sterilized (eg, documented hysterectomy or tubal
             ligation) or be postmenopausal. (Defined as 12 months with no menses and with an
             estradiol level of &lt;30 pg/mL.)

          -  Men must agree to use a medically accepted method of contraception prior to Screening,
             while receiving protocol-specified medication, and for 30 days after stopping the
             medication.

             the study), or are breastfeeding.

             distribution, metabolism or excretion of any drug. The investigator should be guided
             by evidence of any of the following and be discussed with the sponsor prior to
