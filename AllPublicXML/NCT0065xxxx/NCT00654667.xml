    <textblock>
      Sirtuin activators may prove useful in treating age-related diseases and extending lifespan
      in humans. Resveratrol (RSV), a polyphenol found in red wine, has been shown in vitro to
      enhance SIRT1 activity. RSV is associated with some of the beneficial effects of red wine or
      the &quot;French Paradox&quot;. Recently RSV has been associated with increasing lifespan in mice on a
      high calorie diet and improved metabolic profile and activity levels. The effect of this
      small molecule in humans is unknown. Preclinical observations suggest that RSV is safe and
      has enormous potential in the treatment of obesity and insulin resistance in humans. This
      pilot study will examine the effect of RSV on improving the metabolic profile of adults with
      insulin resistance. Specifically, this randomized double blind placebo controlled study will
      examine the effects of 4 weeks of supplementation with RSV 5.0 grams daily, compared to
      placebo control (PC) on the metabolic profile of 36 men and women over the age of 50 with
      insulin resistance (IR) consuming a typical western diet consisting of at least 40% calories
      from fat.

      Hypotheses for this study:

      4 weeks of supplementation with RSV 5.0 grams daily compared to placebo control in
      individuals with insulin resistance will: 1) Increase insulin sensitivity (assessed by the
      insulin sensitivity index as derived from glucose and insulin levels obtained during a 2 hour
      oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)and insulin growth factor (IGF)-1 levels) 2) Improve
      cholesterol metabolism (lower LDL, raise HDL and lower triglyceride (TG) levels); and 3)
      physical activity levels measured by pedometer and 7 day physical activity recall (PAR).

      Secondary hypotheses are: Treatment with RSV 5.0 grams daily in individuals with IR will
      result in: 1)No change in energy intake as measured by food intake by 3 day food diary; 2)No
      change in body fat mass or distribution (via dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), body mass
      index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio; and 3)Improved Quality of life as assessed by SF-36,
      compared to PC group.

      We will also examine self-reported appetite and satiety as well as biomarkers leptin and
      adiponectin in the RSV versus PC group. Finally, we will examine the effects of RSV on
      hepatic (serum Ala aminotransferase, asp aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline
      phosphatase, bilirubin, albumin), pancreatic (serum amylase) and renal (BUN and creatinine),
      function and red blood cell count (CBC with differential) in the IR compared to the PC group.
