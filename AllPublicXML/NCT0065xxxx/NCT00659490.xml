  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate if AZD1940 can relieve the pain induced by
      the surgical removal of one lower wisdom-tooth. This will be done by comparing the effect of
      AZD1940 to placebo (&quot;inactive substance&quot;) on pain. A number of patients will instead receive
      the common painkiller naproxen for comparison purposes. Rescue medication, acetaminophen,
      will be allowed if a need for additional painkillers would arise. A number of patients will
      receive Naproxen as control.

    <measure>Maximum Deterioration in Visual Analogue Mood Scale (VAMS) Stimulated</measure>
    <time_frame>Between dosing and 12h post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective qualities of mood in the subject are measured by letting the subject rate their subjective experiences of a number of adjectives using a series of visual analogue scales. Subjects are required to rate on 100-mm lines the extent to which they felt each adjective at a given time point from 'not at all' on the left end of the scale to 'extremely' on the right end of the scale. The VAMS commonly used in studies with cannabinoids consists of six adjectives and visual analogue scales: stimulated; high (as in drug high, elated); anxious; sedated; down (as in moody, depressed) and hungry.</description>

        <title>Maximum Deterioration in Visual Analogue Mood Scale (VAMS) Stimulated</title>
        <description>Subjective qualities of mood in the subject are measured by letting the subject rate their subjective experiences of a number of adjectives using a series of visual analogue scales. Subjects are required to rate on 100-mm lines the extent to which they felt each adjective at a given time point from ‘not at all’ on the left end of the scale to ‘extremely’ on the right end of the scale. The VAMS commonly used in studies with cannabinoids consists of six adjectives and visual analogue scales: stimulated; high (as in drug high, elated); anxious; sedated; down (as in moody, depressed) and hungry.</description>

        <title>Time to Max Deterioration in VAMS High</title>
        <description>Subjective qualities of mood in the subject are measured by letting the subject rate their subjective experiences of a number of adjectives using a series of visual analogue scales. Subjects are required to rate on 100-mm lines the extent to which they felt each adjective at a given time point from ‘not at all’ on the left end of the scale to ‘extremely’ on the right end of the scale. The VAMS commonly used in studies with cannabinoids consists of six adjectives and visual analogue scales: stimulated; high (as in drug high, elated); anxious; sedated; down (as in moody, depressed) and hungry.</description>
