  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a debilitating brain disorder that affects over 4.75
      million people in the US and Canada. People with AD have difficulty remembering general facts
      and previously experienced autobiographical events. Animal and human research demonstrates
      that this type of memory depends on neural function within specific brain areas, and that it
      may be possible to enhance memory with electrical stimulation of these brain areas. We have
      recently shown that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of a brain area called the fornix enhances
      memory in a human.

      Hypotheses: We hypothesize that fornix DBS will safely enhance memory in early AD patients by
      activating memory circuits in the brain.

      Methods: Six early AD patients will take part in a phase I clinical study over a 1-year
      period. The study involves bilateral fornix DBS implantation, detailed neuropsychological and
      neurological testing, and brain imaging to detect alterations in brain activity induced by
      stimulation. These assessments will occur one month before surgery, then again at one month,
      6 months, and 12 months after surgery.
