      A Pivotal Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness and Safety of ExAblate Treatment of Metastatic
      Bone and Multiple Myeloma Tumors for the Palliation of Pain in Patients Who are not
      Candidates for Radiation Therapy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bone is the third most common organ involved by metastatic disease behind lung and liver [7].
      In breast cancer, bone is the second most common site of metastatic spread, and approximately
      85% of patients dying of breast cancer have bone metastasis. Breast and prostate cancer
      metastasize to bone most frequently, which reflects the high incidence of both these tumors,
      as well as their prolonged clinical courses.

      The increasing longevity of the population coupled with better therapeutic management of
      cancer patients contributes to the high incidence and prevalence of metastatic bone lesions.
      Pain from bone metastases is the most common cause of cancer pain and as more patients are
      living with bone metastases, improving their quality of life becomes a major challenge. In
      patients who die from breast, prostate, and lung cancer, autopsy studies have shown that up
      to 85% have evidence of bone metastases at the time of death [7-9].

      Current treatments for patients with bone metastases are primarily palliative and include
      localized therapies [10], systemic therapies (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy,
      radiopharmaceutical, and bisphosphonates), and analgesics (opioids and non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs). Recently, radiofrequency ablation has been tested as a treatment
      option for bone metastases [11]. The main goals of these treatments are improvement of
      quality of life and functional level. These goals can be further described:

        1. Pain relief

        2. Preservation and restoration of function

        3. Local tumor control

        4. Skeletal stabilization

      Treatment with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is the standard of care for patients
      with localized bone pain, and results in the palliation of pain in the majority of these
      patients. More than 66% of patients with a limited number of well-localized bony metastases
      can be treated effectively by external-beam irradiation. However, approximately 30% of
      patients treated with radiation therapy do not experience pain relief [8, 12-16].
      Furthermore, there is an increased risk of pathologic fracture in the peri-irradiation period
      due to an induced hyperemic response at the periphery of the tumor. This weakens the adjacent
      bone and increases the risk of spontaneous fracture. Adding to this, patients who have
      recurrent pain at a site previously irradiated may not be eligible for further radiation
      therapy secondary to limitations in normal tissue tolerance. The speed of response to
      radiation therapy varies; from the patients that respond most symptomatic bony metastases
      begin to respond over the course of 10 to 14 days, 70% of patients experience some pain
      relief within 2 weeks of starting therapy and, within 3 months 90% of patients achieve pain
      relief.

      Patients, who had EBRT and failed to improve, may need to seek other therapies such as radio
      frequency ablation, surgical resection, etc., which are less efficient and have higher
      treatment related morbidity. Because the ExAblate system is designed to non-invasively ablate
      tissue, ExAblate may meet the need of these EBRT failed patients. The ExAblate system has the
      potential to achieve the first three of the four above mentioned goals, as well as changing
      the treatment limits and resulting morbidity in accordance with the above-mentioned goals
      [17]. The palliative effect of ExAblate is achieved by heating the bone periosteum, thus
      ablating the sensory origin of the pain.

      Based on the FDA approved phase-1 initial study (IDE # G050177 ) results and the results of
      the study that was performed outside the United States that the sponsor has done, palliation
      effects are significant in terms of mean improvement, the number of treated patients who
      reported symptomatic improvement and in their potential durability.

      Based on the above ExAblate treatment has a potential to be treatment of choice for radiation
