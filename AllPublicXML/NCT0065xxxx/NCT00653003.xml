        Indication of successful hysterectomy. No spontaneous menses for al least 1 year, must have
        luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone(FSH) levels within postmenopausal
        range.

        Indication of successful bilateral oophorectomy.

          -  Body weight within 20% of the appropriate weight for the subject's height and frame
             (as published in the 1983 Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Scale, Statistical
             Bureau)

          -  Negative for:

        HIV Hepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis C antibody Urine tests for drugs of abuse
        (marijuana, amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, benzodiazepines and methadone).

        Serum HCG consistent with pregnancy.

          -  No significant disease or clinically significant findings in a physical examination.

             electrocardiogram(ECG)

          -  Subjects who have received leflunomide within 4 months must have an
             A77-1726(Metabolite) level below 0.01ug/ml and no subsequent administration of
             leflunomide since that test. Note: The 30 day screening limit does not apply to this
             inclusion criterion.

          -  Be informed of the nature of the study and given written consent prior to receiving
             any study procedures.

          -  Known history or presence of:

          -  Hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to leflunomide and/or any other drug
             substances with similar activity.

          -  Alcoholism within the last 12 months.

          -  Drug dependence and/ or substance abuse.

          -  On a special diet within 4 weeks prior to drug administration(e.g. liquid, protein,

             prior to drug administration.

          -  Donated up to 250 ml of blood in the past 45 days OR donated from 250 ml to 500 ml in
             the past 45 days OR donated 501 ml or more of blood in the past 56 days (based on the
             Canadian Blood Services guideline for blood donation).

          -  Requirement of any medication (prescription and/ or over-the-counter) on a routine
             basis, with the exception of hormonal replacement therapy, nutritional supplements
