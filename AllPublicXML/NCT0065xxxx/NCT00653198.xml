  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to estimate the effectiveness of Rotarix™ vaccine which is used nationwide as
      a part of the expanded program on immunization (EPI), in preventing RV SGE among hospitalised
      children born after 1 March 2006, which corresponds to the date of introduction of Rotarix™
      in the national immunization program.

        Cases will include those children born after 1 March 2006, at least 12 weeks of age and
        hospitalised for RV SGE in the study hospital, during the designated study period. For each
        case, three hospital controls and three neighbourhood controls will be included in the
        study, after matching by date of birth. Hospital controls will be children hospitalised for
        non-GE causes in the study hospital during the same time period as the case. Neighbourhood
        controls will be children without any symptoms of GE or SGE, and residing in the same area
        as the case at least for three consecutive months.
