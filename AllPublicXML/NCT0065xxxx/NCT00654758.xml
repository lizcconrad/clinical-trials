      The primary purpose of this study is to examine the safety of volociximab in combination with
      a standard treatment of carboplatin and paclitaxel in subjects previously untreated with
      chemotherapy for advanced stage (IIIB/IV) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      This Phase 1b, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study will evaluate the safety and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of volociximab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel (C/P) as
      first-line treatment in subjects with Stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
      Volociximab doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg (or 15 mg/kg if 20 mg/kg is not tolerable) with
      carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy will be tested for determining the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD). Subjects will be dosed once very 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles.

      Volociximab is a high-affinity, chimeric monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to α5β1
      integrin, a cell-surface receptor for fibronectin. Volociximab blocks the binding of α5β1 to
      fibronectin, thereby inhibiting a pivotal interaction required for angiogenesis.

      More than 170 subjects with various solid tumor types have received volociximab in Phase 1
      and Phase 2 single and combination studies. At the doses tested, there has not been a dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT) or a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) defined.

    <description>Volociximab will be administered via IV infusion at 10, 20, and 15 or 30 mg/kg with an additional loading dose in the 10, 20, and 15 mg/kg dose levels during the first cycle. Volociximab will be given for at least 6 cycles (3 weeks/cycle) and subjects who have stable disease at the end of 6 cycles may continue to receive volociximab alone until disease progression. Carboplatin is administered via IV infusion and dosed based on the Calvert formula (with a target area AUC of 6 mg/mL/min) for up to 6 cycles (3 weeks/cycle). Paclitaxel is administered via IV infusion and dosed at 200 mg/m2 for up to 6 cycles (3 weeks/cycle). All three drugs, when given in combination, will be infused on the same day in the following sequence: volociximab, paclitaxel, carboplatin.</description>
