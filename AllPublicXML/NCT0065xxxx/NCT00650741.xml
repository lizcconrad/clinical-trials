  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of the Endotect
      compared with an ultrasound device in a flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) test.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study compares the results obtained with Endotect with the results obtained from a
      brachial ultrasound FMD test, with and without nitroglycerin.

      The results from 3 patient groups (see below) will be compared

      1: 10 subjects, Half with Endothelial Dysfucntion (according to previous ultrasound FMD) ,
      Half with no endothelial dysfucntion (according to previous ultrasound FMD), no repetition of
      test 2: 10 subjects, Half with Endothelial Dysfucntion (according to previous ultrasound FMD)
      , Half with no endothelial dysfucntion (according to previous ultrasound FMD), Repetition
      with Nitroglycerin 3: 10 subjects, Half with Endothelial Dysfucntion (according to previous
      ultrasound FMD) , Half with no endothelial dysfucntion (according to previous ultrasound
      FMD), repetition of test with the Endotect
