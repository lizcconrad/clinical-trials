      Our study has three parts has three parts, and the main aim of the study is to find out if
      corneal hysteresis was associated with myopia or even a predictor of myopia poor control
      predictor:

        -  Part 1 of our study: patients with anisomeropia whose spherical equivalent refraction as
           measured by cycloplegic autorefraction between the two eyes differ greater than 1.5 D.

        -  Part 2 of our study: Minus spherical equivalent refraction as measured by cycloplegic
           autorefraction.

        -  Part 3 of our study: patients with minus spherical equivalent refraction as measured by
           cycloplegic autorefraction who are under regular atropine for the treatment of
           myopia;patients who are prescribed with atropine treatment are in need of myopia control
           instead of for research interest
