      Several hormones involved in body weight regulation increase the subject's ability to burn
      fat for energy. The purpose of this study is to investigate how burning fat for energy may
      affect those hormones and body weight in children. The study will also determine if eating a
      diet higher in protein alters the amount of fat you burn and how these hormones control body
      weight.

      A role for mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in the peripheral signaling cascade of leptin,
      adiponectin and insulin has recently been proposed from animal studies but has not been
      investigated in humans. Children with trifunctional protein (TFP, including deficiency of
      long-chain hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase) and very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD)
      deficiency, inherited disorders of long-chain fatty acid ÃŸ-oxidation, lack an ability to
      oxidize fatty acids for energy. They have increased levels of body fat and circulating leptin
      and a high incidence of obesity. Current therapy for children with these disorders is based
      on frequent meals and consuming a low fat, very high carbohydrate diet. Despite treatment,
      exercise induced rhabdomyolysis is a common complication of TFP and VLCAD deficiency that
      frequently leads to exercise avoidance. The effects of these genetic defects on body
      composition and weight regulation have not been investigated. The contribution of fatty-acid
      oxidation during moderate intensity exercise in children has also not been reported.

      Two groups of subjects were recruited: one group of subjects had a long-chain fatty acid
      oxidation disorder (n=13). The other group is a group of controls (n=16). We studied
      peripheral signals of body weight regulation, glucose tolerance, body composition, and
      exercise metabolism in subjects with a long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorder compared to
      normal controls.

    <description>Body composition by DEXA was measured in subjects with a long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorder (n=13). Twelve age, sex and BMI matched controls and 4 heterozygotes for a long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorder were recruited who also completed body composition measures.

    <measure>An Outcome of This Study is the Difference in Glucose Tolerance Between Subjects With a Long-chain Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorder and Normal Controls.</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects will be compared to controls at one point in time.</time_frame>
    <description>Glucose tolerance was estimated by the Matsuda Index using glucose and insulin values from a standard oral glucose tolerance test. The Matsuda Index is calculated by the following formula: 10,000/ sq root of (fasting glucose mg/dl X fasting insulin in units/ml) X (mean glucose (mg/dl) X mean insulin (units/ml) and correlates with insulin sensitivity measured by the gold standard method of a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Values of 2.5 or greater are considered insulin sensitive. Values of 2.4 or less are considered insulin resistance.
The Matsuda Index of Insulin Sensitivity was measured in subjects with a long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorder (n=12). Twelve age, sex and BMI matched controls and 4 heterozygotes for a long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorder were recruited who also completed an oral glucose tolerance test. The difference in Mastuda Index between subjects and age matched controls was compared by t-test.</description>

        Subjects were patients with a diagnosis of mitochondrial trifunctional protein, long-chain
        3-hydroxyacylCoA dehydrogenase, very long-chain acylCoA dehydrogenase or carnitine
        palmitoyltransferase 2 deficency. They were recruited through advertisements on the FAO
        support website, or physician referral. Control subjects were from the greater Portland

        <title>An Outcome of This Study is the Difference in Percent Body Fat (%BF) Between Subjects With a Long-chain Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorder and Normal Controls.</title>
        <description>Body composition by DEXA was measured in subjects with a long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorder (n=13). Twelve age, sex and BMI matched controls and 4 heterozygotes for a long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorder were recruited who also completed body composition measures. The difference in body composition between subjects and age matched controls was compared by t-test.</description>
        <time_frame>Subjects will be compared to controls at one point in time.</time_frame>
        <population>Study design was based on 1 to 1 matching of subjects and controls. Thirteen subjects but only 12 controls completed the protocol. We report results of 12 subjects compared to 12 matched controls.</population>

        <title>An Outcome of This Study is the Difference in Glucose Tolerance Between Subjects With a Long-chain Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorder and Normal Controls.</title>
        <description>Glucose tolerance was estimated by the Matsuda Index using glucose and insulin values from a standard oral glucose tolerance test. The Matsuda Index is calculated by the following formula: 10,000/ sq root of (fasting glucose mg/dl X fasting insulin in units/ml) X (mean glucose (mg/dl) X mean insulin (units/ml) and correlates with insulin sensitivity measured by the gold standard method of a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Values of 2.5 or greater are considered insulin sensitive. Values of 2.4 or less are considered insulin resistance.
The Matsuda Index of Insulin Sensitivity was measured in subjects with a long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorder (n=12). Twelve age, sex and BMI matched controls and 4 heterozygotes for a long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorder were recruited who also completed an oral glucose tolerance test. The difference in Mastuda Index between subjects and age matched controls was compared by t-test.</description>
