      This study was designed to evaluate the symptomatic effects or potential disease progression
      slowing down effect of a kind of Herbal Medicinal Mixture in Parkinson's disease (PD)
      patients. The treatment phase includes 12 months period of Herbal Medicinal Mixture per day
      or placebo and 1 month wash-out period without herbal medicine and placebo.

      The design of the study was a prospective, randomized, multicenter, double-blind
      placebo-controlled protocol. The intervention includes Herbal Medicinal Mixture Bid or
      matched placebo for 12 months plus 1 month wash-out period.

      Participating study centers include Neurological University Outpatient Clinics and
      Neurological Departments of Community-based Hospitals experienced with PD patients.

      The primary outcome measure was the combined Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
      (UPDRS).

      The hypothesis of this study was that Herbal Medicinal Mixture improves the overall wellbeing
      of PD patients and thus may leads to an improvement of parkinsonian symptoms in PD patients.
