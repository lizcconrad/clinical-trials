  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a randomized study to directly compare the performance and the outcome of
      syringe and needle procedures with a standard syringe or the new reciprocating procedure
      device (RDP), which is a type of safety syringe. Over a 5 year period, 820 subjects who
      require and assent to a syringe and needle procedure for their usual and customary care will
      be randomized to either a conventional syringe or the RPD with one arm with and without
      ultrasound guidance. The RPD is designed to be safer, faster, less painful, and more
      effective for the patient, and the mechanics of the RPD are intended to provide the physician
      with better needle control, resulting in less needle trauma to patient tissues, and thus,
      reduced bleeding and pain for the patient. This clinical trial will address whether the RPD
      is indeed superior to the conventional syringe for shots, injections, and needle procedures,
      and whether it is a safer, less painful syringe.

      * BACKGROUND

      The syringe is an ancient device designed principally to inject medications. However, because
      of the inherent biomechanics of the human hand and the interaction of the hand with the
      piston, the syringe is very stable and easily controlled the injection phase, but is
      extremely unstable and difficult to control in the aspiration phase. New reciprocating
      technology that accommodates the biomechanics of hand function has great promise of improving
      the stability and safety of hand-held devices, including procedure syringes.

      * EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND METHODS

      The study design is a randomized study to directly compare the performance and the outcome of
      syringe and needle procedures accomplished either with a standard syringe or the new
      reciprocating procedure device (RDP). Over a 5 year period, 820 subjects who require and
      assent to a syringe procedure for their usual and customary care will be randomized to either
      a conventional syringe or the reciprocating syringe. The following syringe procedures will be
      studied: 1) local anesthesia, 2) centesis (arthrocentesis, paracentesis, thoracentesis,
      amniocentesis, pericardiocentesis), 3) aspiration and puncture (aspiration of bursa, cyst,
      abscess, shunt, bone marrow, and other syringe aspiration procedures), 4) injection of a
      therapeutic or diagnostic substance into a joint, bursa, vessel, or other body structure, 5)
      fine needle biopsy with syringe vacuum of a mass or tissue, 6) irrigation procedures (wound,
      bladder, and other irrigation procedures), and 7) vascular access (introduction of a wire,
      catheter, or sheath into a blood vessel), and 8) with and without ultrasound guidance.

      In a subject with multiple individual procedure sites, or requires multiple separate
      biopsies, each will be randomized between the two syringes, and each biopsy or fluid sample
      will be analyzed separately (as is medically appropriate). The physicians who will perform
      the syringe procedures will be those physicians who usually perform the syringe procedures
      and are credentialed to do so. Outcome data collection will occur first by one of the
      investigators observing the procedure and collecting the data by real time interview and by
      chart review including cost analysis. Outcome data will include effectiveness (preprocedural
      pain, pain at 2 weeks post procedure, and pain at 6 months postprocedure), procedure time,
      patient pain, operator satisfaction, trauma to tissues, complications, diagnostic yield,
      overall medical care costs and hospital stay. Retrospective review of 30 charts of the device
      used clinically has also been approved (2006). Analysis of data will be performed by a
      statistician blinded to treatment group.

      *SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed study will be the first to study the clinical performance
      characteristics of a medical device that incorporates the new reciprocating technology
      designed to take advantage of the inherent biomechanical stability characteristics of the
      human hand. The preclinical studies presented in the preliminary data demonstrate markedly
      enhanced device performance characteristics, and much greater control and stability, strongly
      suggesting that reciprocating devices will be safer, more effective, more economical, and
      provide better patient outcomes.

The RPD is used to performed the syringe and needle procedure and outcome (effect of procedure (pain scores at 2 weeks and 6 months compared to preprocedural pain scores), and procedural pain (pain scores during procedure) - are determined. Thus, pain scores as measured by the standard 10 cm Visual Analogue Pain Score are used to primary outcome as is standard in the field of pain. These scores from the two treatment arms are then compared statistically with each other by appropriate methods.

Thus, pain scores as measured by the standard 10 cm Visual Analogue Pain Score are used to primary outcome as is standard in the field of pain. These scores from the two treatment arms are then compared statistically with each other by appropriate methods. It is hypothesized that the RPD will be more effective (reduced pain scores at 2 weeks and 6 months) and less pain (reduced procedural pain scores) compared to the same procedure with the conventional syringe.</description>

          <description>Conventional Syringe - The conventional syringe is used to performed the syringe and needle procedure and outcome (effect of procedure (pain scores at 2 weeks and 6 months compared to preprocedural pain scores), and procedural pain (pain scores during procedure) are determined). The comparison is with the same procedure performed with the RPD syringe with and without ultrasound. It is hypothesized that the RPD will be more effective (reduced pain scores at 2 weeks and 6 months) and less pain (reduced procedural pain scores) compared to the same procedure with the conventional syringe.</description>
