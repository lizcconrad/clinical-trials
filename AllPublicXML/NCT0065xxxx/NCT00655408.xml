  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This work aims at establishing the effectiveness of weekly doses of ferrous sulfate
      administered by mothers compared with weekly supplements administered directly by healthcare
      professionals, to reducing anemia prevalence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some studies have shown satisfactory results in reducing the prevalence of iron deficiency
      using weekly doses of ferrous sulfate, thereby avoiding these side effects. This deficiency
      is the most common nutritional disorder during childhood and does not only affect individuals
      from developing countries but also those from industrialized nations.

      For infants with ages between six and 24 months, iron supplementation is the main treatment
      for iron deficiency. In this age range the prevalence of anemia is at least 20%. However,
      studies have shown a low rate of compliance by mothers during the recommended period, which
      may be caused by a lack of care or, more probably, due to the side effects caused by
      long-term daily ferrous sulfate supplementation, which include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
      staining of teeth and abdominal pain.

      This specific study is randomized clinical trial study, achieved in a government healthcare
      clinic in Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil. This study was carried out using two
      intervention groups. All children received 12 weekly doses of 25 mg of elemental iron, either
      administered in the government healthcare clinic or at the children's home.

      The study showed treatment compliance in both groups. Prevalence of anemia for all children
      was 75% at the beginning of supplementation and 46.3% at the end of the period (p &lt; 0.0005).
      Reduction rate for anemic children was 38.3%. Average increases in hemoglobin concentration
      levels were 0.75 g/dL and 0.65 g/dL, respectively, for home interventions and healthcare
      clinic administration (p &lt; 0.00005).
