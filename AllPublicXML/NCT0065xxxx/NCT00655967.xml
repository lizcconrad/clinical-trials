  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol abuse and dependence are very prevalent and result in significant morbidity,
      mortality and cost to society (Harwood 2000). Pharmacotherapies to assist with alcohol
      dependence consist of disulfiram, naltrexone and acamprosate. Of these, acamprosate is unique
      in that it is not metabolized by the liver, but rather completely excreted renally. In
      contrast, naltrexone is metabolized by the CYP450 system of the liver and less than 2% is
      excreted unchanged and can cause liver damage (PDR 2005). Multiple cases of hepatitis,
      including both cholestatic and fulminant hepatitis, as well as hepatic failure resulting in
      transplantation or death, have been reported with administration of disulfiram (PDR 2005).
      The incidence of liver disease among alcoholics is high and increases with age and years of
      drinking and this may preclude the use of antabuse or naltrexone to help alcohol dependent
      patients with liver disease or that are elderly . Thus acamprosate has a unique safety
      profile that would make it ideally suited for treating alcohol dependence in the elderly,
      even in the presence of hepatic impairment. The current study is to evaluate the safety
      profile of acamprosate in elderly patients with alcohol dependence.

      Acamprosate, calcium acetyl homotaurinate, has been approved in most European countries and
      the U.S. for the maintenance of abstinence in recently detoxified alcoholics. The mechanism
      of action involves primarily the restoration of a normal N-methyl- D -aspartate (NMDA)
      receptor tone in glutamatergic systems (Rammes et al 2001). Several trials of acamprosate
      confirm its efficacy in the maintenance of abstinence in alcohol dependence (Lesch et al.
      2001; Slattery et al. 2003; Mann et al. 2004; Verheul et al. 2004). It also reduces the
      severity of relapse in alcoholics in abstinence based treatment programs (Chick et al. 2003).
      There is limited data on the safety of acamprosate in the elderly (PDR 2005).

      For the purposes of this study, elderly will be defined as 60 years or older.

      STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the short-term safety of Acamprosate in the treatment of
      alcohol dependence in the elderly.

      STUDY DESIGN: This trial will be conducted as an open-label, fixed dose design for safety of
      Acamprosate in the elderly. Subjects will receive Acamprosate for 12 weeks. The schedule of
      visits will include screening, baseline and three monthly follow-up visits at days 30, 60 and
      90. We will recruit 25 subjects in the total study period of 15 month.

      Regarding the number of subjects, chi-squared analysis of the total number of side effects
      (61%, i.e. 1230 out of 2018 subjects in prior studies) and the possible number of subjects in
      the study with side effects (from 0 to 25), indicates that a significant (alpha=0.05)
      difference from the previously observed rate would occur if less than 11 (p&lt;=0.05) or more
      than 20 (p&lt;=0.025) subjects report side effects. Side effects in 11 to 20 subjects would be
      nonsignificantly different from the previously published rates. Thus 25 subjects are
      sufficient to detect significant deviation in frequency of overall side effects in this
      sample compared to the subjects in prior studies. Total number of side effects was used for
      this calculation because there is no single common or significant side effect that would lend
      itself as an appropriate surrogate for the side effects overall.

      During the course of the study subjects will be supplied with 333mg tablets of Acamprosate
      provided by the Sponsor. The study medication will be administered at a dose of 666mg (=two
      tablets) three times a day for subjects with a creatinine clearance &gt;50. The dose will be
      333mg three times a day for subjects with a creatinine clearance in the range of 30-50.

      Safety will be monitored by subject's report of adverse events at all treatment visits
      throughout both, open label and double blind phases of the Trial. The report of adverse
      events or new symptoms by the subject will be reviewed and summarized. This may also include
      any clinically significant changes in the vital signs (blood pressure and pulse readings,
      weight, temperature), physical examinations, laboratory evaluations (blood chemistry,
      hematology, urinalysis, EKG) and recording of concomitant treatment. A DSMB plan has been set
      up.

      Treatment compliance will be monitored by counts of returned medication, and subjects are to
      be counseled if they do not adhere, or if they are thought to be at risk for not adhering to
      the medication regimen.

             determined by Time Line Follow Back report by patient and patient's spouse, partner or
             friend. Significant amounts is defined for these purposes as at least one episode of 5
             or more drinks, with a drink defined as one bottle of beer, one glass of wine or one
             shot of liquor.

             requirements.

          5. Patients, who signed the written informed consent given prior to entering any study
             procedure and completed the informed consent quiz.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with the following concurrent DSM-IV Axis I diagnoses as determined by the
             relevant sections of SCID I:

               -  Current, acute psychosis regardless of etiology
