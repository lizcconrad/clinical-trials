  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an inherited disorder of unknown etiology,
      characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, peritonitis and/or pleuritis.

      Fever is the cardinal manifestation of FMF and is present in most attacks accompanied by
      abdominal pain.

      Another clinical manifestation in patients with FMF is exertional muscle pain, usually in the
      thigh, which appears even after minor exercise or physical activity in young patients with
      generally good health (other than FMF) and in good physical condition. Some patients also
      complain of ankle edema after relatively minor physical activity, which subsides after a
      night rest. Although these manifestations are quite common in FMF patients and form part of
      the minor criteria for the diagnosis, the etiopathogenesis has not been examined.

      The purpose of the suggested study is to evaluate and characterize the anatomical and
      biochemical changes in the muscles of the thigh and in the ankle triggered by physical
      activity in FMF patients complaining of exertional lower leg myalgias and edema after minor
      physical exercise.
