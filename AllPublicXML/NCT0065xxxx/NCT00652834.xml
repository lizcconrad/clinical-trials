  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about symptoms and gastrointestinal lesions
      associated with taking myfortic® by switching patients to a delayed release formulation that
      is developed to alleviate GI symptoms. A comparison of the frequency and severity of GI
      symptoms observed in patients treated with MMF (cellcept®) after conversion to myfortic® will
      be measured by using a self-assessed questionnaire called Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating
      Scale (GSRS). To prove the incidence and improvement of GI lesions in patients treated with
      MMF (cellcept®) after conversion to myfortic® will be measured by using Small Bowel Capsule
      Endoscopy (SBCE).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myfortic® recently introduced to the market has shown to be similar to MMF in how effectively
      it works and how well it is tolerated. Both drugs have the same active ingredient, but they
      are different in the way that they deliver them to the body. Myfortic® is an advanced,
      enteric coated formulation of mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) that delays the release of the
      active ingredient, MPA. MPA has more potent effects on the lymphocytes than other cells. This
      makes for improved GI tolerability of the MPA therapy.

    <time_frame>one month</time_frame>
    <description>The GSRS has a seven-point graded Likert-type scale where 1 represents absence of troublesome symptoms and 7 represents very troublesome symptoms.
A higher GSRS indicate worse symptoms and a difference between D30 and last SBCE scores greater or equal to 0.3 can be considered as a clinically significant improvement in the symptoms.</description>

    <description>This was a four-week study designed to investigate GI mucosal lesions by SBCE in kidney transplant recipients who were using MMF, and to examine the changes in clinical symptoms and intestinal mucosa lesions 30 days after switching over from MMF to EC-MPS. The patient was switched from MMF to EC-MPS (Myfortic) on the equimola basis.</description>

A higher GSRS indicate worse symptoms and a difference between D30 and last SBCE scores greater or equal to 0.3 can be considered as a clinically significant improvement in the symptoms.</description>

            <groups_desc>The results of the initial SBCE exams were evaluated by a visually challenged GI specialist who gave us a descriptive report.

There were no comparison groups. Each patient is their own control. Given that this is a pilot study there is no power calculation.</groups_desc>
