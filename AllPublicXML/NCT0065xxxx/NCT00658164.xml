      Patients will be randomized to lifestyle changes alone or lifestyle changes associated with
      iron depletion.

      Iron depletion will be achieved by removing 350 cc of blood every 10-15 days according to
      baseline hemoglobin values and venesection tolerance, until ferritin &lt; 30 ng/ml and
      transferrin saturation &lt; 25%. Weekly phlebotomies will be allowed for carriers of the C282Y
      HFE mutation. Smaller phlebotomies (250 cc) will be allowed for carriers of beta-thalassaemia
      trait. Maintenance phlebotomies (as much as required) will then be instituted to keep iron
      stores depleted (ferritin &lt; 50 ng/ml and transferrin saturation &lt; 25%, MCV &lt;85 fl). Before
      starting treatment, patients will undergo ECG, and in the presence of hyperglycemia or
      hypertension also echocardiography (see exclusion criteria).

      Change in diabetes medication dosage or start of new therapy will be allowed for HbA1C values
      &lt;6% or ≥ 7%. According to accepted criteria, previously untreated patients should be treated
      with metformin. If possible, newly diagnosed hypertension should be treated with
      Ace-inhibitors.
