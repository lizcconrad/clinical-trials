  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if providing free-of-charge access to a group-based
      lifestyle intervention delivered in partnership with the community is cost-effective for the
      prevention of type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trials have shown that modest lifestyle changes can prevent or delay
      the onset of diabetes in adults with pre-diabetes. Unfortunately, despite the increasing
      prevalence of pre-diabetes and diabetes in all facets of the population, intervention
      programs needed to achieve these goals are costly and remain unavailable in most clinical
      settings. Over the past 3 years, we have demonstrated the feasibility of training community
      instructors to deliver a group-based adaptation of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)
      lifestyle intervention. In this pilot research, this new delivery model achieves a level of
      weight reduction that was associated with diabetes prevention and improved cardiometabolic
      risk factor control in the DPP. This new, large-scale randomized effectiveness trial is
      designed to evaluate the costs and effectiveness of a partnered approach to identify adults
      with pre-diabetes in primary care settings, deliver brief advice for diabetes prevention, and
      provide access to a group-based adaptation of the DPP lifestyle intervention offered by the
      community. This study will compare costs and outcomes to a standard care, brief clinical
      counseling approach delivered by Registered Dietitians.
