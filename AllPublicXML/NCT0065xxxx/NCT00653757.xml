      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Using scintigraphy
      to plan specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the
      tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best way to give
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with
      stage I, stage II, stage III, or stage IV prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To assess the feasibility of radioimmunoguided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)
           for stage I-IV prostate cancer.

        -  To determine the toxicity and tolerance of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To determine the tumor response based on physical examination and serial measurements of
           the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in these patients.

        -  To determine the outcome of patients treated on this study with radioimmunoguided IMRT
           compared to 2 control groups of patients treated at Mayo Scottsdale Clinic (MSC).

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo radioimmunoguided intensity-modulated radiotherapy once daily, 5
      days a week for 8½ weeks. Beginning the last week of radiotherapy, some patients receive
      leuprolide acetate intramuscularly every 3-4 months or goserelin subcutaneously every 3
      months for 6 months, 12 months, or until disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-4 months for 1 year, every
      6 months for 4 years and annually thereafter
