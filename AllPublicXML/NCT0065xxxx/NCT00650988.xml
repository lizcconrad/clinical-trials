    <textblock>
      This is a single center study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new ablation technique
      involving the spray of liquid nitrogen through a catheter (cryotherapy) via an upper
      endoscopy (EGD) to ablate Barrett's esophagus with changes of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or
      intramucosal cancer (IMCA) and patients with esophageal cancer limited to the esophageal
      wall, in whom there are no standard treatment options available.

      The Cryo-Ablator System is a cryosurgical unit with a liquid nitrogen cooled cryocatheter and
      accessories to destroy tissue during surgical procedures by applying extreme cold.

      Patients will prepare for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in the standard fashion using an
      overnight fast with only clear liquids and required medications allowed up to 2 hours before
      the procedure. The EGD will be performed using a therapeutic Olympus endoscope. The
      cryocatheter is passed into the therapeutic channel of the endoscope. Liquid nitrogen is
      sprayed through the cryocatheter for a duration of 10 seconds as measured by the device
      integrated timer. This process will be repeated four times in piecemeal fashion such that for
      any given area treated it will be maintained in a frozen state for a total of 40 seconds.
      Following circumferential treatment, the process will be repeated again applying the spray to
      the same section of mucosa for a duration of 20 seconds. Patients will be contacted the
      following day to assess for any immediate complications.

      Patients will repeat treatment every 6 weeks if no evidence of esophageal mucosal injury,
      until complete ablation of the Barrett's mucosa has been achieved. Follow up period of five
      years to monitor healing and progression.

    <description>Liquid nitrogen spray with a cryospray catheter through an upper endoscope that enables the direct visualization of mucosal freeze (cryoburn) of the mucosa treated which avoids the need for direct tissue contact. Frozen state is defined as mucosa appearing white. Cryofreeze is preformed in cycles of 10 second sprays with a minimal thaw of 60 seconds each spray. This cycle is repeated 4 times in each area of treatment.</description>
