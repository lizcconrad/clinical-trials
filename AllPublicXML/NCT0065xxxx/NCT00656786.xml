    <textblock>
      This is a clinical research study of an experimental new medication, Menadione Topical Lotion
      (MTL). The study lotion is experimental and has not been approved for public use. Hana
      Biosciences, Inc., the company that is developing MTL, is the sponsor of this study. EGFR
      inhibitors are used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreatic cancer,
      colorectal cancer, breast cancer and head and neck cancer. One of the side effects of EFGR
      inhibitors is skin toxicities including an acneform skin rash.

      This study is a Phase 1 study. The main purposes of this study are:

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of Menadione Topical Lotion as an emergent and
           pre-emergent treatment for EGFR inhibitor-associated rash

        -  Evaluate the systemic absorption and bioavailability of Menadione Topical Lotion as an
           emergent and pre-emergent treatment for EGFR inhibitor-associated rash

      It is planned that up to 24 patients undergoing EGFR inhibitor therapy will take part in this
      study at multiple clinical centers.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria are not eligible for enrollment.

          1. A skin examination reveals the presence of any active disease (e.g., eczema), tattoos
             or other problems, such as open lesions, that could make the application site
             unacceptable for study drug lotion application, located on the face/neck and/or upper
             chest that, in the Investigator's opinion, could confound the evaluation of the rash;

          2. Any clinically significant safety laboratory or diagnostic results that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would place the subject at undue risk if the subject were
             to participate in the study;

          3. Any clinically significant finding or concurrent clinical illness in the physical
             examination or medical history that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would place
             the subject at undue risk if the subject were to participate in the study;

          4. Undergoing any current treatment for cancer other than the prescribed EGFRI that in
             the opinion of the Investigator, would place the subject at undue risk if the subject
             were to participate in the study;

          5. Prior treatment with any other marketed or investigational EGFRI therapy within the 3
             months prior to screening (Visit 1);

          6. Treatment with topical antibiotics, topical steroids, and other topical treatments on
             the face/neck and upper chest within 14 days of first study lotion application;

             of the study;

          8. Treatment with vitamin K supplements or multivitamins containing any form of vitamin K
             should be stopped at Visit 1;

          9. Known hypersensitivity to menadione or similar compounds including any of the inactive
             ingredients;

                       documented liver metastasis

                    -  Total bilirubin &gt; 2 × institutional ULN or &gt; 5 × institutional ULN if
                       documented liver metastasis

         13. Treatment with any cosmetic cream, make-up or products such as sun screen, oils,
             powders, perfumes, lotions, ointments, etc. to the anticipated study lotion
             application area within 3 days before treatment or during the treatment period;

         14. Known or suspected pregnancy, lactation or planned pregnancy (females and males);

         15. Clinically significant mental illness (to be determined by the Investigator);

         16. Exposure to any investigational agent within 2 weeks or 3 half-lives prior to
             randomization (Visit 3, Day 1 for Group 1 or Visit 2, Day 1 for Group 2);

         17. The subject will be disqualified if they have a rash for longer than 5 days at a grade
             of 3 or more prior to administration of first menadione dose (per CTCAE v3.0
             terminology [see Appendix 2]);

         18. Subject has a condition the Investigator believes would interfere with the ability to
             provide informed consent or comply with study instructions, or that might confound the
             interpretation of the study results or put the subject at undue risk.
