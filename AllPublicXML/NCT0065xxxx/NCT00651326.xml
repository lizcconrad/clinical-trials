      RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such
      as flutamide, bicalutamide, leuprolide, buserelin, and goserelin, may lessen the amount of
      androgens made by the body. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet
      known whether giving androgen suppression therapy together with radiation therapy is more
      effective with or without docetaxel in treating prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying androgen suppression therapy, radiation
      therapy, and docetaxel to see how well they work compared with androgen suppression therapy
      and radiation therapy in treating patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer.

      CLOSURE: This trial closed to further accrual in November 2009. The study endpoints will not
      be reached.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To compare disease-free survival rates in patients with high-risk localized
           adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with androgen suppression therapy and
           radiotherapy with vs without docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  To compare overall survival.

        -  To compare time to biochemical disease progression.

        -  To compare time to local disease progression.

        -  To compare time to distant disease progression.

        -  To compare time to next anticancer therapy.

        -  To compare progression-free survival.

        -  To compare degree of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) suppression prior to radiotherapy.

        -  To compare quality of life (QOL) using EORTC QLQ C30 and EORTC QLQ PR25 questionnaires
           and a trial-specific checklist.

        -  To compare the nature, severity, and frequency of adverse events.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to Gleason score (≤ 7
      vs ≥ 8), baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (&gt; 20 ng/mL vs ≤ 20 ng/mL), and
      participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive androgen suppression therapy comprising oral flutamide three
           times daily or oral bicalutamide once daily for 4 weeks AND leuprolide subcutaneously
           (SC) or intramuscularly every 1-6 months, buserelin SC every 2 or 3 months, or goserelin
           SC every 1 or 3 months for 3 years. Patients also receive docetaxel IV over 60 minutes
           on day 1. Treatment with docetaxel repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses. Beginning
           at least 4 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo pelvic radiotherapy
           once daily 5 days a week for up to 8 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive androgen suppression therapy and undergo pelvic radiotherapy as
           in arm I.

      Patients complete quality of life questionnaires at baseline, periodically during treatment,
      and then every 6 months for 5 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3 and 6 months, every 6 months
      for 5 years, and then annually thereafter.
