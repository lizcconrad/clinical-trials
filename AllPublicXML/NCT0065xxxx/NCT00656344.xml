  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is exploring the use of an intervention designed to treat PTSD in individuals with
      comorbid PTSD and substance abuse resulting from the attacks of September 11 or from military
      service in Iraq. A cognitive behavioral treatment protocol will be used to treat PTSD. The
      exposure component of the protocol will be enhanced with the use of virtual reality in which
      the client will view a virtual environment while describing their trauma.
