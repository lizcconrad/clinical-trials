      The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of Prometheus liver support
      dialysis on intracranial pressure, cerebral metabolism and circulation in patients with acute
      liver failure.

      Acute liver failure (ALF) is a highly mortal medical condition often complicated by
      multiorgan failure. Apart from severe coagulopathy ALF is characterized by onset of hepatic
      encephalopathy and in many cases intracranial hypertension (ICH) with the risk of cerebral
      incarceration. The pathogenesis behind ICH is incompletely understood and the therapeutic
      options are limited. Prometheus (R) liver support dialysis offers a system that apart from
      regular high-flux hemodialysis to a certain extent is able of removing albumin-bound
      substances from the patient - a feature that theoretically could benefit patients with ALF.

      In this study we intend to investigate the effect of 6-8 hours of Prometheus (R) liver
      support dialysis on cerebral metabolism, ICH and cerebral bloodflow (CBF) in patients with
      ALF. The study is designed as a open, prospective and randomized study, where a control-group
      treated with 6-8 hours of continuously veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) and standard
      medical treatment (SMT) is compared to the intervention group treated with Prometheus (R)
      liver support dialysis and SMT. The study is designed as a cross-over study so that included
      patients will be treated in both groups in a randomized order.

      The primary end-points are treatment effect on intracranial pressure, CBF and cerebral
      oxidative metabolism (lactate/pyruvate-ratio). We use a intracranial monitoring system from
      Integra/Camino (R) (United States) in combination with CMA microdialysis system and bedside
      analyzer (CMA-600) (Stockholm, Sweden).
