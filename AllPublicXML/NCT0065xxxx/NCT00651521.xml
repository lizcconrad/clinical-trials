  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence and mortality rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) patients is high. The prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in CKD population
      ranges from 38 to 65%, with an average of 3.3 coronary lesions per person. The relative risk
      for death from myocardial infarction and CAD is 1.18 in CKD patients with GFR &lt; 60 ml/min.
      Because of this high prevalence of CAD and its high mortality, reducing and preventing CAD
      risk factors is crucial in the clinical management of CKD patients.

      Low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) constitutes an important independent risk factor for
      CAD. Several pathogenic factors play role in the genesis of cardiovascular dysfunction in
      chronic kidney disease. Increased traditional CAD risk factor, endothelial dysfunction,
      sympathetic hyperactivity, renin-angiotensin system activation, increased glycosylated end
      products, all contribute to the characteristic medial calcification of cardiovascular disease
      in CKD patients. Hypertension, fluid overloading and anemia further aggravated the cardiac
      loading, leading to myocardial hypertrophy with chamber dilatation, heart failure and death.

      The mortality rate of CAD in CKD patients is extremely high. The NHANES II (National Health
      and Nutritional Evaluation Survey) found an increased of mortality rate&gt; 51%, when the GFR
      decreased from &gt; 90 to &lt; 70 ml/min. The 1-year mortality rate in different CKD stage were
      0.7% (normal renal function patients), 2.0% (patients with proteinuria), 3.5% (overt
      proteinuric patients) and 12.1% (dialysis patients), respectively. However, the clinical
      feature and outcome of CAD in different stage of CKD remains unclear.

      We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving all patients admitted for coronary
      angiography from 1992 to 2004. The patients were categorized into five stages of CAD to
      compare the risk factor, clinical feature and outcome. Determination of this relationship can
      help to establish factors for early detection of CAD in CKD patients and also prognostic
      factor to improve outcome of these patients.

      All patients who underwent cardiac catheterization for assessment of CAD at Keelung Chang
      Gung Memorial Hospital between 1992 and 2004 with continuous serum creatinine values measured
      before admission were included in this analysis. Data were obtained from medical records of
      the database center of our institution. Demographic and clinical data were assessed. The age,
      sex, body mass index (BMI), body surface area (BSA), underlying comorbidities, CAD risk
      factors (including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, and obesity,
      defined as a BMI &gt; 30) and clinical presentation were included in this study. Hemodynamic
      parameters including the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and left
      ventricular ejection fraction were also obtained. Coronary angiography was performed using a
      low-osmolarity non-ionic contrast medium (iodixanol) by experienced cardiologist. Coronary
      artery disease was defined as a 50% or greater lumen narrowing of a major epicardial artery
      or its branches. A left main stenosis of 50% or greater was regarded as equivalent to
      2-vessel disease. Blood samples were collected during admission before angiographic
      procedure. Values of hemoglobin, white blood cells, platelet, high sensitivity C-reactive
      protein (hs-CRP) and troponin I was included. The treatment modality was divided into three
      categories: medical, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, including balloon angioplasty
      with or without stent placement) and coronary artery bridge graft (CABG) on the basis of
      clinical condition and angiographic finding. The outcome was followed-up until 12 months
      after angiographic procedure. The estimated total study patient number is approximately 1000
      patients.
