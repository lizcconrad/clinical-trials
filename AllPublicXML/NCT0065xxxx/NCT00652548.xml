      This studies investigates the hypothesis that bedside ultrasound is as accurate as plain
      x-rays for diagnosing clavicle fractures in children in a pediatric emergency department.
      Children with shoulder injuries are enrolled and receive both an ultrasound imaging
      (experimental) and x-rays (standard-of-care) to see if ultrasound has the same (or
      better)accuracy, with less cost, time, and radiation.
