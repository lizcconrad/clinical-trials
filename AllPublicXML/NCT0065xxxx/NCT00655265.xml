      This study is designed to assess whether colesevelam given as third line treatment added to a
      maximal tolerated and stable dose of a statin and ezetimibe is able to further decrease the
      level of LDL cholesterol in a safe and efficient manner in difficult to treat Familial
      Hypercholesterolaemia patients who are not at their target level of LDL cholesterol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a clinical diagnosis of Familial Hypercholesterolaemia defined as
             EITHER a.Presence of a documented LDL-receptor mutation OR b. History of untreated
             LDL-cholesterol level above the 95th percentile for sex and age in combination with
             documentation of at least one of the following: i.Presence of typical tendon xanthomas
             in the patient or first degree relative. ii. An LDL-cholesterol level above the 95th
             percentile for age and sex in a first degree relative. iii. Proven coronary artery
             disease in the patient or in a first degree relative under the age of 60.

          -  Patients must have provided and undergone lifestyle changes for more than 6 months at
             the time of Screening

          -  Patients must have been treated for at least 3 consecutive months preceding the
             Screening visit with a lipid lowering treatment regimen consisting of maximal
             tolerated combination of a statin with ezetimibe and are still above their target for
             LDL cholesterol being 2.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dL)

          -  Patients must be committed to following the protocol requirements as evidence by
             written informed consent

             study

          -  Patients with a bowel or biliary obstruction

          -  Patients with secondary causes of hypercholesterolaemia, e.g., dysproteinaemia,
             hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome (defined as proteinuria &gt;2 g/L), obstructive liver
             disease, other pharmacological therapies, alcoholism

             transaminases

          -  Patients on fenofibrates or on concomitant cholestyramine as this will affect the area

             complete all protocol requirements

          -  Fertile women who are pregnant, nursing or using either no or an inadequate form of
