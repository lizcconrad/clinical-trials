  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescence is the highest risk period for depression onset. More than 1.3 million youths
      suffer from major depression annually in the United States, and there is evidence for an
      increasing trend. Because many adolescents have their first depressive episode in adolescence
      and adolescent depression often leads to recurrent mood disorders in adults, effective
      treatment during early illness can minimize the negative consequences of initial and repeated
      episodes. Although some antidepressants (particularly Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
      (SSRIs)) are effective treatments for juvenile depression, recent warnings about suicide and
      the use of SSRls highlight the need for new and safe treatment for juvenile depression. Data
      in adults suggest that supplementation with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) might be
      useful for the treatment of depression. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
      safety and efficacy of PUFA for the treatment of adolescent depression.
