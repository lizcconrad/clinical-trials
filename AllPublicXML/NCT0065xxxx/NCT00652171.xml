      Objective: This study reports a clinical trial evaluating lamotrigine safety and efficacy as
      an antidepressant augmentation agent in treatment resistant depression, therefore adding more
      empirical evidence to the limited number of studies on the use of lamotrigine.

      Method: A double-blind pilot study was conducted with 34 nonbipolar, nonpsychotic patients
      who had DSM-IV major depressive disorder and were resistant to at least 2 antidepressants.
      The subjects were on taking antidepressant therapy and were randomly assigned to receive
      placebo or lamotrigine as an adjunct therapy for 8 weeks. They were evaluated on a biweekly
      basis in order to access assess the efficacy and the safety of the drug.
