      The objectives of this study were to assess the safety and tolerability of LDP-02 in patients
      with active Crohn's disease who were not receiving corticosteroids or immunosuppressives, to
      assess the ability of LDP-02 to reduce Crohn's disease activity, and to obtain
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic(PD)information for LDP-02 in patients with active
      Crohn's disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 to 80, nonhospitalized, male or nonpregnant, nonlactating females voluntarily
             able to give informed consent.

          -  Crohn's disease of at least 6 months' duration.

          -  Endoscopic and/or histopathological and/or radiological documentation consistent with
             Crohn's disease obtained preferably within 24 months of screening.

          -  Crohn's disease involving the colon and/or the ileum.

          -  CDAI score from 220 to 400 (inclusive) at the time of the Screening visit. The CDAI
             must have remained between 220 and 400 after the 1-week Screening period for the
             patient to be eligible.

          -  Patients may have been receiving oral or topical 5-ASA compounds provided the dosage
             had been stable for at least the 14-day period before the Screening visit. Patients
             were to be maintained on the 5-ASA compound at a constant dose at least through Day
             57.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with evidence of current GI infection (bacterial or parasitic) or significant
             infection within 45 days of the screening visit.

          -  Patients with a serious underlying disease other than Crohn's disease including
             presence or history of malignancy (except basal cell carcinoma) and histological
             evidence of dysplasia.

          -  Patients with significantly impaired liver or renal function. This includes those with
             established chronic liver disease including hepatitis B or C.

          -  Patients with the laboratory abnormalities

          -  Patients using ethanol or consuming illicit drugs which, in the investigator's
             opinion, may interfere with compliance with the study procedures.

          -  Patients with active psychiatric problems which, in the investigator's opinion, may
             interfere with compliance with the study procedures.

          -  Patients who have previously received or who are currently receiving treatment with a
             monoclonal antibody.

          -  Patients receiving any investigational therapy, excluded medications as defined in
             protocol, or any approved therapy in an investigational protocol within 30 days prior
             to screening.

          -  Patients unable to attend all the study visits or comply with study procedures.
