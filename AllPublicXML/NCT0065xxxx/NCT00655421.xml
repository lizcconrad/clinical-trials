      A feasibility study to compare the test characteristics of three different oral cancer
      screening techniques performed by trained primary health care workers:1)Unaided Visual
      Inspection, 2)VelScope Assisted Examination, and 3) Examination after application of
      Toluidine Blue dye.

    <textblock>
      Oral cancer is the most common cancer among men in India mainly due to the habit of using
      smokeless tobacco. Pre-cancerous lesions like leukoplakia, melanoplakia, erythroplakia,oral
      submucous fibrosis and indolent ulcers can be easily detected by periodic examination of the
      oral cavity of the at-risk populations. Several methods of oral cancer screening have been
      tried over the past three-four decades with varying success. This study investigates the
      feasibility of application and compares the test characteristics of three oral cancer
      screening techniques: Unaided Visual Inspection, VelScope assisted examination and
      examination after application of Toluidine blue dye by primary health care workers among
      tobacco users attending a cancer early detection clinic, in Mumbai, India.
