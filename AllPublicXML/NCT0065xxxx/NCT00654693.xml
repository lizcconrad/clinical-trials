      -  Determine the accuracy of the NTX wireless monitoring system alerts

        -  Evaluate patient compliance with wearing device

        -  Determine false alarm rates

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 150 patients will have wireless monitors attached to their arm. They will have
      their vital signs filtered through software that generates alerts and records data. The alert
      engine will produce pager and application based pop-up alerts which will be sent to the
      research nurse. Low and high limit alarms will be set according to the published guidelines
      (Hillman, K. et. Al., Resuscitation 48(2): 105-10, 2001) and adjusted at will by the response
      team.

      During this portion of the study, the following research related procedures will be
      performed:

        -  begin continuous vital signs monitoring (BP - 1x per hour, 3 lead ECG -continuous, HR -
           continuous, SpO2 - continuous)

        -  PI or Co-PI will review each alert that's generated. The clinical significance will be
           determined and recorded in the study database

        -  Record patient's signs and symptoms daily

        -  Assess concomitant

        -  Assess AE's, SAEs

        Participants will be recruited in the Vanderbilt University Medical Center pre-operative
        clinic or in the Round Wing, after the effects of anesthesia have worn off. Before
        performing any trial-related procedures, written Informed Consent and HIPAA authorization
        will be obtained.
