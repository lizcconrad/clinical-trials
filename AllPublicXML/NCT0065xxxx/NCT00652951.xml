  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a pneumococcal
      conjugate vaccine when co-administered with DTPa-IPV-Hib or DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib in infants as a
      three-dose primary immunisation course during the first 6 months of life and as a booster
      dose at 11-12 months of age. The impact of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on
      nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae in children in their first two
      years of life will also be assessed. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply
      with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.
