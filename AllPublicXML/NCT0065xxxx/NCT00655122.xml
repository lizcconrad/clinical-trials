      The primary objective was to study the clinical benefit with dalteparin sodium in
      thromboprophylaxis in primary care medical subjects. The secondary objective was a
      pharmacoeconomic evaluation of hromboprophylaxis with dalteparin sodium in primary care
      medical subjects.

      The study was prematurely terminated on December 9, 2003. The reason for the early
      termination was not related to a safety or efficacy issue. It was related to the difficulty
      in recruiting patients.
