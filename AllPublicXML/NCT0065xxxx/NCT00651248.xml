      The purpose of this study is to identify the relation of the salivary flow and the buffer
      capacity of the saliva with medicine, buccal discomfort and auto-related illnesses in aged
      people.

      Study clinical of prevalence. 68 aged, average 70.4 years, SD ± 7.27 represented
      institution's residents of long permanence. Questionnaire was applied, organizing the data
      for Software SPSS version 15. The test qui-square of Pearson was used, level of significance
      5% and reliable interval 95%. 80% presented pH normal. The salivary Flow: 32.3% very low,
      41.2% reduced and 25.5% normal. 30.9% mentioned dry mouth, 22.1% tasting's problems, 17.6%
      dysphagia and 14.7% burning mouth. Main systemic illnesses: 48.5% declared cardiovascular
      problems, 17.6% diabetes and 16.2% osteoporosis. 76.5% used medicine. There was a
      significance statistic between medicine taking and dry mouth (p=0.013), buffer capacity and
      burning mouth (p=0.019), salivary flow and medicine taking (p=0.048). The low salivary flow
      and the buffer capacity of the saliva influence in the aged people's health condition, as the
      drugs influence the results.
