  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will assess the endocrine and immune effects of leptin replacement in leptin-deficient
      children, from a consanguineous Turkish family. We hypothesize that leptin replacement will
      have significant effects on immune and endocrine function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study of the treatment of a child with congenital leptin deficiency will permit
      to elucidate key aspects of human endocrine and immune function, and will give new insights
      on the role of leptin in human endocrine regulation.

      Leptin administration in leptin-deficient children will possibly increase energy and fat
      metabolism by increasing sympathetic nervous system activity. To test this hypothesis, we
      will measure food intake, energy expenditure, body composition and sympathetic nervous system
      activity in patients homozygous due to a leptin gene mutation, before and throughout the
      leptin replacement therapy.

      Leptin modulates T-cell function and affects the phagocytic activity of macrophages. Immune
      function will be assessed during the course of this study. Specifically, tests for antibody,
      complement and phagocytic function, tests for T-cell immunity, flow cytometry, TREC PCR,
      thymus imaging studies will be performed. Antibody levels for pathogen organisms will be
      checked and the child will be vaccinated if needed.

      Leptin also has important roles on thyroid, adrenal and gonadal functions. Morevover, leptin
      is correlated with levels of lipids, glucose and insulin. To test the effects of leptin
      replacement in leptin-deficient humans, endocrine and metabolic parameters will be measured,
      before and during treatment.

      Leptin determines changes on bone mineral density. To evaluate these changes, bone function
      and densitometry will also be assessed in this leptin deficient child.

      Finally, leptin may have a role in brain growth and development. We will conduct volumetric
      brain imaging studies in this patient during the course of leptin replacement, ensuring safe
      exposure to radiation. Neuropsychological evaluation will also be undertaken.
