      To evaluate whether using the drug bortezomib at the start of remission will prevent relapse
      for a longer period of time.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma have led to improved remission rates,
      the risk for serious relapse is very high. The drug Bortezomib has been highly effective for
      treatment of the disease in an advanced stage such as post-transplant relapse. Due to the
      need of maintenance therapies, it is necessary to look to certain drugs that may prolong
      remission and increase the quality of life. Bortezomib, when taken at the beginning of
      remission, may prove to be a beneficial maintenance drug for the management of multiple
      myeloma.

    <description>The number of patients on Bortezomib that have maintained event-free survival, compared to the patients on observation was not analyzed due to low attrition rates.
Event-free survival is a measure of the proportion of people who remain free of a particular complication of disease (called an event) after treatment that is designed to prevent or delay that particular complication.</description>
