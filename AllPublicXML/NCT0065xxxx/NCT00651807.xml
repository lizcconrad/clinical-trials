  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted to evaluate the effect of etonogestrel in comparison to placebo on:

        -  the prostate volume and the urinary complaints;

        -  the urinary flow and the urinary volume in the bladder after voiding;

        -  the progression of the disease;

        -  the sexual function, well-being and urinary complaints-related Quality of Life. In
           addition the safety and the way the drug is absorbed and excreted by the body will be
           analyzed.
