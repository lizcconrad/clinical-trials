      -  The purpose of the Phase I portion of this study is to evaluate the safety of this
           combination of medications and to determine the appropriate dose of VNP40101M to be used
           in combination with infusional cytarabine (araC) in elderly patients with Acute Myeloid
           Leukemia (AML) and High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS).

        -  The purpose of the Phase II portion of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness
           (overall response rate) for patients treated with VNP40101M and infusional cytarabine
           induction therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no known standard chemotherapy that is considered effective for older patients with
      AML or high risk MDS at this time, and with current treatment, tumor reduction can be
      difficult to achieve and is short-lived. We are, therefore, interested in developing new
      drugs that might have a longer-lasting effect against disease.

      Laromustine is a new drug that has been shown to have anti-cancer activity in animal and
      human studies. It interacts with the DNA of a cancer cell and kills the cell. Cytarabine
      (AraC) is a commercially available chemotherapy drug that is active against leukemia and used
      routinely when the disease is first diagnosed. In previous studies, when higher doses of
      laromustine were given, laromustine and AraC achieved more responses than patients treated
      with AraC alone. However, this advantage was offset by the fact that more patients given
      laromustine/AraC died to due side effects. We wish to determine the effectiveness of
      laromustine in combination with infusional AraC in AML and high risk MDS patients who are 60
      or more years of age.
