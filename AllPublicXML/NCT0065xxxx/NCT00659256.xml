    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of treatment for hepatitis C on atherosclerosis, or
      hardening of the arteries. Hepatitis C is a disease of the liver caused by a virus that can
      cause permanent damage to that organ. Treatment can clear the virus in at least half of
      patients and reduce the risk of serious complications of the disease. Atherosclerosis is an
      accumulation of cholesterol and fat in the arteries that can narrow blood vessels, leading to
      chest pain, heart attack or stroke.

      Because the liver controls cholesterol and fat levels in the blood, hepatitis C infection may
      be a risk factor for atherosclerosis by increasing cholesterol and fat in blood vessels.
      Treatment of the hepatitis C may reduce the risk of atherosclerosis and its consequences.
      This study will determine what effect hepatitis C treatment has on the rate of
      atherosclerosis and narrowing of blood vessels and on the risk of heart attack or stroke.

      Patients 30 years of age and older with current or past infection with hepatitis C may be
      eligible for this study. Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

        -  Questionnaires regarding risk factors for heart disease and stroke

        -  Measurements of blood pressure, heart rate, weight, height, waist and hips

        -  Blood tests

        -  CT scans and ultrasound tests to measure the degree of blood vessel hardening and
           narrowing in the heart and neck region

      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with changes in lipid metabolism in the liver
      and the peripheral blood. Patients with chronic hepatitis C infection tend to have low levels
      of cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. These levels increase in many patients after treatment
      and successful eradication of the virus. However, it is not known whether this increase is
      associated with increased cardiovascular risk and thus may increase their risk for
      atherosclerotic disease. To determine whether eradication of HCV affects atherosclerosis
      progression, we propose to examine up to 200 patients with chronic hepatitis C for markers of
      atherosclerosis and the risk of its complications. Up to 100 patients who have cleared HCV
      and recovered will be matched and compared to patients who failed to respond and continue to
      have chronic hepatitis C. The atherosclerosis assessment will include careful history for
      cardiovascular risk factors, a battery of blood tests for lipid levels and relevant
      biomarkers followed by specialized imaging tests of the carotid and coronary arteries,
      including ultrasound imaging of intima-media thickness of the carotid arteries and
      computerized axial tomography of the heart and coronary arteries. The primary end point in
      the assessment will be differences in maximal carotid intima media thickness and secondary
      end points will include differences in coronary artery calcium score, Framingham risk scores
      and other measurements or atherosclerosis. This cross-sectional study will set the stage for
      a more formal prospective assessment of cardiovascular risk factors and evidence of coronary
      and cerebrovascular disease among patients being treated with antiviral agents.
