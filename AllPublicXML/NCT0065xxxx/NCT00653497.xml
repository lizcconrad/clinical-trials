      The purpose of this study was to estimate the cost and outcomes of the Arthritis Foundation
      aquatic exercise classes.

        -  DESIGN. Randomized trial of 20-week aquatic classes.

        -  SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Recruited 249 adults from Washington State aged 55 to 75 with a
           doctor-confirmed diagnosis of osteoarthritis

        -  MEAURES. The Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB), Current Health Desirability Rating
           (CHDR), Health Assessment Questionnaire(HAQ), Center for Epidemiologic
           Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), Perceived Quality of Life Scale (PQOL)
