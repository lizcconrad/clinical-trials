  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether S-1 is effective as 2nd line therapy in
      slowing tumor activity in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The study is
      also looking at the safety of S-1.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced non-small cell lung cancer is relatively unresponsive to chemotherapy. This is true
      for the nucleoside analogue gemcitabine, with a response rate of approximately 10%, as well
      as for 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Even when gemcitabine is combined with other chemotherapeutic
      drugs or biological agents, the overall tumor response rate remains basically unchanged. S-1
      is a new generation oral fluoropyrimidine that combines Tegafur
      (5-fluoro-1-(tetrahydro-2-furanyl)-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione [FT]), an oral prodrug of 5-FU,
      with two modulators, Gimeracil (5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine [CDHP]), which inhibits 5-FU
      degradation by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) inhibition, and Oteracil potassium
      (Oxo), which inhibits 5-FU phosphorylation in the digestive tract. This combination of 3
      compounds is designed to achieve enhanced antitumor activity while decreasing
      gastrointestinal toxicity.

      This is an open-label, multicenter, single-arm, 3-stage, Phase 2 study evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of single agent S-1 as 2nd line therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC.
      The 3 stages of this study correspond to a futility stage (stage 1), a decision stage (stage
      2), and a stage for improvement of precision of ORR (stage 3).
