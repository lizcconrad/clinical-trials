  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether S-1 in combination with Cisplatin is
      effective as 1st line therapy in slowing tumor activity in patients with advanced non-small
      cell lung cancer. The study is also looking at the safety of S-1.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced non-small cell lung cancer is relatively unresponsive to chemotherapy. This is true
      for the nucleoside analogue gemcitabine, with a response rate of approximately 10%, as well
      as for 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Even when gemcitabine is combined with other chemotherapeutic
      drugs or biological agents, the overall tumor response rate remains basically unchanged. S-1
      is a new generation oral fluoropyrimidine that combines Tegafur
      (5-fluoro-1-(tetrahydro-2-furanyl)-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione [FT]), an oral prodrug of 5-FU,
      with two modulators, Gimeracil (5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine [CDHP]), which inhibits 5-FU
      degradation by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) inhibition, and Oteracil potassium
      (Oxo), which inhibits 5-FU phosphorylation in the digestive tract. This combination of 3
      compounds is designed to achieve enhanced antitumor activity while decreasing
      gastrointestinal toxicity.

      This is an open-label, multicenter, single-arm, 3-stage, Phase 2 study evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of S-1 in combination with cisplatin as 1st line therapy for patients
      with advanced NSCLC. The 3 stages of this study correspond to a run-in tolerability stage
      (stage 1), futility stage (stage 2), and decision stage (stage 3). The run-in tolerability
      stage will be conducted to assess any additional toxicity associated with a more frequent
      schedule of administration of cisplatin (75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) compared with the dosing
      regimen established in a prior Phase I study in patients with advanced gastric cancer (75
      mg/m2 every 4 weeks). The futility stage (stage 2) will be conducted to ensure that this
      treatment combination is sufficiently efficacious to expose a sufficient number of patients
      to be able to make a decision (stage 3) on whether this combination treatment warrants
      further evaluation in future studies.
