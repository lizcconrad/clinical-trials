      Objective: Whether temporary endoscopic decompression by Self-expanding metal stents (SEMS)
      could allow these patients to undergo successful laparoscopic resection (endo-laparoscopic
      approach) has never been previously studied. This randomized trial aims to compare this
      approach with emergency open surgery in the management of obstructing left-sided colon
      cancer.

      Introduction:

      First reported in 1991, laparoscopic assisted colectomy is increasingly practised world-wide.
      Abundant evidence exists in the literature suggesting laparoscopic assisted colectomy, when
      compared with its open counterpart, is associated with more favourable short-term outcomes,
      better cosmesis, and better patient's satisfaction. Moreover, recent reports from large-scale
      randomized trials support the use of this minimally invasive technique in the treatment of
      colorectal cancer, a malignant condition common in many parts of the world. However, around
      8-29% of patients with colorectal cancer present as acute large bowel obstruction, a
      condition used to be considered as a contraindication to laparoscopic surgery due to poor
      exposure and potential hazard of injury to the distended bowel. Thus, most cases of malignant
      large bowel obstruction mandate an emergency open surgery to relieve the obstruction and
      resect the tumour, with many patients, especially those with obstructing left-sided colon
      cancer, ending up with temporary or permanent stoma which can adversely affect their
      health-related quality of life.

      Self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) was first described by Dohmoto in 1991 as an endoscopic
      palliative alternative for treating inoperable colon cancer. Three years later, Tejero et al.
      published a preliminary report of using SEMS as a 'bridge' to surgery in two patients with
      colonic obstruction 13. Since then, a number of publications as well as systemic review have
      shown that endoluminal stenting is a relatively simple and safe alternative to standard
      surgical management of acute malignant obstruction of the left colon, thereby obviating the
      need of emergency surgery or colostomy. However, whether temporary endoscopic bowel
      decompression by SEMS could allow patients with malignant left colonic obstruction to undergo
      successful laparoscopic resection (endo-laparoscopic approach) has never been studied in
      detail before. We therefore conducted the current trial to study the outcomes of this
      endo-laparoscopic approach in patients with obstructing left-sided colon cancer.

      Patients and Methods:

      This study is a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the outcomes of the
      endo-laparoscopic approach for patients with obstructing left-sided colon cancer, using
      patients undergoing emergency open surgery as controls. Only patients with obstructing
      left-sided colon cancer were studied because of the reported high incidence of stoma creation
      in this condition10,11, and because a homogeneous group of patients could be ensured to
      facilitate comparison of the two different approaches. A single surgical team consisting of
      two surgeons (C.C.C. and M.K.W.L.) and one camera assistant in the case of laparoscopic
      resection performed all operations with the patient under general anesthesia. The study was
      approved by the hospital ethical committee and was not supported by any commercial funds or
      sponsorship.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Consecutive adult patients (aged 18 or above) presenting with clinical features of
             left colonic obstruction were potential candidates.

          -  In the absence of peritonitis, right lower quadrant tenderness or grossly distended
             caecum (10cm or above in maximal dimension) on plain abdominal radiograph, an urgent
             water-soluble single contrast enema was performed to determine the level of
             obstruction within 24 hours of admission.

          -  Patients were recruited if the lower border of an obstructing tumour was found between
             the splenic flexure and rectosigmoid junction.

          -  Informed consent was obtained from every patient recruited in the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who did not give informed consent

          -  Patients who were considered unfit for operative treatment

          -  Patients with previous laparotomy

          -  Patients with clinically palpable tumor on abdominal examination.
