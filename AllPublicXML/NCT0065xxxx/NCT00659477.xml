  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to compare two treatment regimens (insulin Lantus as basal insulin vs
      insulin NPH) plus oral antidiabetics in type 2 diabetic patients and confirm superiority of
      insulin glargine. Comparison is focused on: blood glucose (BG) variability of the two
      treatment regimens, quality of diabetes compensation (HbA1c, FBG/Fasting blood glucose), body
      weight development, dose of insulin and occurrence of symptomatic hypoglycaemia and other
      adverse events.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diabetes type 2

          -  Patients treated NPH insulin with stable dosage of OADs (Oral antidiabetic drugs) for
             at least 2 months prior to study start and OADs treatment with metformin at least 1,7
             g /day in combination with sulfonylurea or glinides.

          -  Patients must have a HbA1c range of &gt;= 4,5% ( 6,2% DCCT/Diabetes Control and
             Complication Trials) and &lt;= 8% ( 9,4 % DCCT/Diabetes Control and Complication Trials)

          -  Ability and willingness to perform continuous glucose monitoring system / CGMS
             (examination within the study)

          -  Written informed consent obtained prior to enrollment in the study

          -  Women are either not of childbearing potential or women of childbearing potential must
             not be pregnant and must use a reliable contraceptive measure for the duration of the
             study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Fasting value C peptide &lt;= 400 pmol/l

          2. Active proliferative diabetic retinopathy, as defined by the application of
             photocoagulation or surgery, in the 6 months before study entry or any other unstable
             rapidly progressing retinopathy that may require photocoagulation or surgery during
             the study.

          3. Pregnant women or women planning gravidity during clinical study protocol

          4. Breast-feeding

          5. History of hypersensitivity to the study drugs or to drugs with a similar chemical
             structure

          6. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids in the 3 months prior to study entry and
             during study and other treatment, that can significantly have impression to glycaemia.

          7. Likelihood of requiring treatment during the study period with drugs not permitted by
             the clinical study protocol

          8. Clinically relevant cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, endocrine, or other major
             disease making implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study results
             difficult

          9. Impaired hepatic function as shown by Alamine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or Aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) greater than three times the upper limit of normal range at
             study entry

         10. Impaired renal function as shown by serum creatinine &gt;/= 133 micromol/L in men and &gt;/=

         11. History of drug or alcohol abuse in the last year

         12. Mental condition causing the patient unable to understand the nature, scope and
             possible consequences of the study

         13. Patient unlikely to comply with protocol, e.g., uncooperative attitude, inability to
             return for follow-up visits and unlikelihood of completing the study

         14. Use of insulin glargine outside the scope of the current SPC (Summary of Product
             Characteristics)

        16. Patients included in other clinical studies

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
