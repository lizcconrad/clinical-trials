    <textblock>
      A multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the short-term and
      long-term efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in reducing proteinuria and
      preserving renal function in patients with IgAN who have pre-treated (and continue to be
      treated) with angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), compared to the corticosteroids.

    <textblock>
      There are four phases of study for each subject. Phase 1 the screening phase. During this
      phase each potential subject will be evaluated to determine if he/she is eligible for the
      study.

      Phase 2 the ARB lead-in phase will last for three months. Phase 3 the intervention phase.
      Each subject will be randomly received 12 months treatment with the study drugs (MMF,
      prednisone or MMF plus prednisone) Phase 4 following-up phase. All the patients will be
      followed by 3 years after study drug stopped.
