    <textblock>
      An increased skeletal fracture risk in diabetes has only recently been recognized. Human
      studies of patients with diabetes using bone mineral density and bone markers have noted low
      bone mass and mixed results on remodeling activity. Mouse models of diabetes have suggested
      that low bone turnover is the underlying problem. Low bone turnover could lead to an
      accumulation of microdamage that is not repaired causing compromised bone strength. Low bone
      turnover has not yet been confirmed in humans. This human study is designed to elucidate the
      effect of Type 1 diabetes on 1) bone remodeling, including histomorphometric and biochemical
      measures of bone formation and resorption, and 2) on structure, including micro architectural
      arrangement of trabeculae and bone mineral density.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 19 yrs or &lt; 50 yrs.

          -  The diabetic subjects must have a diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes clinically defined as
             diabetes onset before age 50, acute presentation or diabetic ketoacidosis, with normal
             BMI. If history is equivocal, GAD antibodies &gt; 1.45 U/mL will be used to define
             diagnosis.

          -  Diabetic subjects must be on insulin treatment.

          -  All subjects must have BMI between 18-30

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  On any medications that are known to interfere with bone metabolism including loop
             diuretics, steroids, anticonvulsants, bisphosphonates, metformin, glitazones

          -  Have normal or only mildly impaired kidney function defined as a calculated GFR
             greater than 60 mL/min/1.73m2

          -  History of cancer other than skin cancer

          -  Unstable angina, myocardial infarction, uncontrolled hypertension, malabsorption,
             active rheumatoid or collagen disease.
