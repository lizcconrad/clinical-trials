      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as S-1 and cisplatin, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation
      therapy together with more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving S-1 and cisplatin together with
      radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage IIA, stage III, or stage IVA
      esophageal cancer that can be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate response rate in patients with stage IIA-IVA resectable esophageal cancer
           treated with chemoradiotherapy comprising S-1, cisplatin, and radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate overall survival of these patients.

        -  To evaluate progression-free survival of these patients.

        -  To evaluate toxicity in these patients.

        -  To correlate initial squamous cell carcinoma antigen and C-reactive protein with
           response and survival in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral S-1 twice weekly, cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1, and
      undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week in weeks 1 and 2. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2
      courses.

      Tumor tissue samples are collected by esophagoscopy with biopsy and brushings for analysis of
      initial squamous cell carcinoma antigen and C-reactive protein correlation with response and
      survival.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 6 months.
