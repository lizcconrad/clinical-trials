      The primary objective of the proposed pilot study is to determine the efficacy of oxymorphone
      hydrochloride and propoxyphene/acetaminophen combination in prolonging the time to onset of
      pain and reducing the severity of pain associated with walking in patients lumbar spinal
      stenosis that have clinical symptoms of neurogenic claudication. Neurogenic claudication is
      defined as movement induced leg pain, numbness, heaviness, or vague discomfort in part or all
      of one or both legs provoked with walking and standing and relieved by sitting, squatting, or
      forward flexion posturing. The secondary objective is to examine the functional benefit of
      oxymorphone hydrochloride and propoxyphene/acetaminophen combination with respect to
      improvement in duration and distance of walking.

      A computer-generated randomization plan was used for assignment of subjects to one of six
      treatment sequences (4 subjects per sequence): oxymorphone/propoxyphene/placebo,
      oxymorphone/placebo/propoxyphene, placebo/oxymorphone/propoxyphene,
      placebo/propoxyphene/oxymorphone, propoxyphene/oxymorphone/placebo, or
      propoxyphene/placebo/oxymorphone. One dose of blinded study drug (opana, propoxypehen, or
      placebo) was given at study days 1, 5, and 9. The primary endpoint was time to first symptoms
      of moderate intensity (NRS ≥ 4/10) during treadmill ambulation. Ambulation assessment was
      performed during the screening visit. Ambulation assessment was also performed 90 minutes
      after administration of study drug on days 1, 5 and 9, to evaluate pain intensity associated
      with walking as well as distance covered by the patients. Quantitative assessment of
      ambulation was conducted on a treadmill at 0° ramp incline at 1.2 miles per hour (mph).
      Measurement of self-reported symptom severity using the NRS at baseline, and every 30 seconds
      for a maximum of 15 minutes was recorded. The following information was also recorded: time
      to first symptoms, total ambulation time. The examination was stopped after 15 minutes or at
      the onset of severe symptoms. Severe symptoms were defined as the level of discomfort that
      would make patients stop walking in usual life situations. No one was encouraged or prompted
      to continue walking beyond this point. Patients were instructed to walk with an upright
      posture. They were not permitted to lean forward or hold onto the handrails during the
      examination. Secondary outcome measures included area under the curve of present pain
      intensity with ambulation at each specified time point, final pain intensity with walking,
      walking tolerance, time to return to baseline pain level after ambulation, as well as the
      results of a series of pain related questionnaires including: Visual Analog Scale (VAS),
      Patient Global Assessment (PGA), NRS, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), modified
      Brief Pain Inventory short form (mBPI-sf), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Swiss Spinal
      Stenosis (SSS).

    <time_frame>study visit</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) (0=no pain, 10=worst pain imaginable)the time to first symptoms (Tfirst) with a NRS score greater than or equal to 4 (moderate pain level), with treadmill ambulation was measured. Patients were excluded from the trial if there pain at rest was greater than or equal to 4/10.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Under the Curve</measure>
    <time_frame>study visit</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were instructed to walk on the treadmill and to tell the research coordinator to stop testing when they reached the point at which they typically would need to stop and sit down, or until 15 minutes had elapsed. At defined intervals (every 30 seconds) subjects were asked what their pain level was according to the NRS. The area under the curve of present pain intensity is the total area combined for the amount of time the subject walked.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Distance</measure>
    <time_frame>study visit</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were instructed to walk on the treadmill and to tell the research coordinator to stop testing when they reached the point at which they typically would need to stop and sit down, or until 15 minutes had elapsed. When the subject reached their maximum distance, the treadmill testing was stopped. This was recorded as total distance based on number of minutes and seconds walked. Minutes was converted to meters based on calculation of defined speed of the treadmill.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Recovery Time</measure>
    <time_frame>study visit</time_frame>
    <description>After the subject completed the treadmill test they were asked to immediately return to the seated position. At this point a timer was started. When the subjects pain level returned to baseline (level of pain subject felt in a seated position before walking) the time was stopped. This was recorded as recovery time. Maximum recovery time is 15 minutes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>study visit</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS asked subjects to place a mark indicative of their low back pain during the past day on a 100mm line, with 0mm representing no pain and 100mm representing extreme pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Assessment (PGA)</measure>

          <description>The mBPI is a series of questions that rates the severity and impact of pain on daily function. The questionnaire is made up of 4 pain severity items using the NRS scale, and seven 11-point pain interference scales (0 indicating no interference and 10 indicating complete interference). For the interference score, a total score of 10 indicates pain completely interferes with activities.</description>

        <description>Subjects were instructed to walk on the treadmill and to tell the research coordinator to stop testing when they reached the point at which they typically would need to stop and sit down, or until 15 minutes had elapsed. At defined intervals subjects were asked what their pain level was according to the NRS. When the subject reached their maximum distance, they were asked their NRS score. This was recorded as final pain intensity.</description>

          <title>Final Pain</title>
          <description>Subjects were instructed to walk on the treadmill and to tell the research coordinator to stop testing when they reached the point at which they typically would need to stop and sit down, or until 15 minutes had elapsed. At defined intervals subjects were asked what their pain level was according to the NRS. When the subject reached their maximum distance, they were asked their NRS score. This was recorded as final pain intensity.</description>
