    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I single and repeat dose escalation study of GSK1265744 in healthy
      subjects and a single repeat dose cohort in HIV-1 infected subjects. The study is planned to
      consist of three parts. Part A will enroll two cohorts with a total of 18 subjects in a
      single dose escalation to evaluate safety, tolerability and PK. Part B plans to enroll three
      cohorts of 10 subjects to evaluate repeat doses of GSK126744 on safety, tolerability and PK.
      Part A and B will enroll healthy volunteers. Part C will enroll HIV-1 patients in a single
      cohort of 10 subjects. This cohort will evaluate the effects of repeat dose on safety,
      tolerability, PK and efficacy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Parts A and B: The subject is healthy. Healthy as determined by a responsible
             physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical
             examination, laboratory tests and 12-lead ECG. A subject with a clinical abnormality
             or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied
             may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the
             finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with
             the study procedures.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential

             - Is pre-menopausal with a documented bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy
             (removal of the ovaries) or hysterectomy, or Is post-menopausal defined as 12 months
             of spontaneous amenorrhea. A follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level will be
             performed to confirm a post-menopausal status. For this study, FSH levels &gt; 40 mlU/ml
             is confirmatory.

          -  A male is eligible to enter and participate in the study if he is surgically sterile
             OR if he either agrees to abstain from sexual intercourse with a female partner or
             agrees to use a condom/spermicide, in addition to having his female partner use
             another form of contraception as in protocol

             within 0.7 log of the screening HIV-1 RNA and must meet the screening HIV-1 RNA (i.e.,
             &gt; 5000) requirements for the subject to be included.
