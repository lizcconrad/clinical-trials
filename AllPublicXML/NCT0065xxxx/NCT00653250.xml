      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue, blood, and urine from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying celecoxib in treating patients with stage I, stage
      II, or stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To assess cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity in patients with early-stage non-small cell
           lung cancer (NSCLC) and correlate the results with serum vascular endothelial growth
           factor (VEGF) levels, tumor microvessel density score, tumor prostaglandin E2 (PGE_2)
           and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) levels, and the major urinary metabolite of PGE_2,
           PGE-M.

        -  To assess the effect of specific COX-2 inhibitors (celecoxib) on COX-2 expression within
           the primary tumor, serum VEGF levels and tumor microvascular density, tumor PGE_2 and
           MMP levels, and urinary PGE-M in a cohort of patients with early-stage NSCLC.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral celecoxib 400 mg twice a day for 5 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unaccepted toxicity. Patients with early-stage disease then undergo
      surgery.

      Biopsy, serum, and urine samples are obtained at baseline and after celecoxib treatment. The
      biopsy specimen are examined for the expression of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), PGE_2, and
      selected MMPs by immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and northern blotting. Serum and
      urine samples are analyzed for VEGF and PGE-M expression. COX-2 tumor expression is
      correlated with serum VEGF levels; tumor MMP-2, MMP-9, and PGE_2 expression; urinary PGE-M
      and microvessel density scores.
