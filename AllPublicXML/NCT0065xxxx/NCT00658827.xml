    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is collection and analysis of information pertaining to pregnancy
      outcomes in women exposed to infliximab during pregnancy, relative to the background risk in
      similar but non-biologic exposed patients; and information pertaining to health status,
      during the first year following delivery, of infants born to women following prenatal
      exposure to infliximab and their unexposed counterparts.

      This registry will analyze birth outcomes data from Medical Birth Registers on approximately
      370 women who have become pregnant and have been exposed to infliximab with the diseases of
      interest: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Crohn's Disease [CD] and Ulcerative Colitis [UC]),
      Rheumatoid Arthritis [RA], Psoriatic Arthritis [PsA], Ankylosing Spondylitis [AS], and
      Psoriasis (Pso) as well as all women with the same diseases who have not been exposed to
      infliximab. Demographics and information related to the diseases of interest, past medical
      history, infliximab exposure during pregnancy (and up to 3 months prior to conception), use
      of other medications, and pregnancy outcomes information and infant birth information will be
      collected from the Swedish national health registries (a. Swedish Medical Birth Register
      [SMBR] b. Swedish Prescribed Drug Register c. Swedish Patient Register [PAR]), Danish
      national health registries (a. Danish Medical Birth Register [DMBR] b. Danish Register of
      Medicinal Product Statistics c. Danish National Patient Registry), and Finnish national
      health registries (a. Finnish Medical Birth Register [FMBR] b. Finnish Register on Prescribed
      Medicine c. Finnish National Care Register for Health Care Institutions [HILMO] d. Finnish
      Register on Congenital Malformations) during the study period. The health status of infants
      born to these women will be followed for 1 year after birth. During the 1-year follow-up
      period, information related to hospitalizations and antibiotic use will be obtained. No study
      medications will be administered in this registry. Treatments are as prescribed by the
      physician on the basis of usual clinical practice.
