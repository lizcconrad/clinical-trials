  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Damage to the ligaments of the wrist occurs frequently, however, it is not well publicized or
      understood. Our previous and current biomechanical studies have shown that damage to certain
      wrist ligaments is the likely cause of wrist instability and pain. Based on our three
      dimensional models and animations of actual cadaver motions with various ligaments intact or
      sectioned, we have identified several changes in how the carpal bones move and are positioned
      relative to the radius with various levels of instability. Using this information, we have
      developed a mathematical model that can predict in cadaver wrists which groups of ligaments
      have been injured. We started, under IRB approval, a prospective clinical study to evaluate
      the reliability of this mathematical model. During the past 5 years we have studied 13
      patients with suspected wrist ligament injuries who were previously scheduled for surgical
      treatment. CT scans have been performed of the injured wrist and for comparison purposes, the
      contralateral, uninjured wrist. During these 5 years, there were no problems with the conduct
      of the study. During these 5 years the only changes to the original study application were

        -  a) to include a CT scan of the contralateral wrist for comparison purposes

        -  b) a paper handout given to potential subjects

        -  c) to add additional people to the study team.

      The principal investigator, blinded to the results of the CT scan, surgically explores and
      treats these patients in the same manner that he would for any patient with suspected wrist
      ligament injuries. During the surgery, the investigator determines the integrity of the
      various wrist ligaments. The prediction of which ligaments are damaged, based upon the CT
      scan information and mathematical model is compared to the actual surgical findings. The
      importance of this study is to develop a tool that will allow one to rapidly and non
      invasively diagnose wrist instability and initiate treatment before further damage is done.
