      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. GM-CSF may stimulate
      the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. GM-CSF, given by
      inhalation, may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and prevent metastases from forming.
      Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving combination
      chemotherapy together with radiation therapy and GM-CSF before surgery may make the tumor
      smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving these
      treatments after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy together
      with radiation therapy and GM-CSF before and after surgery works in treating patients with
      stage III soft tissue sarcoma that can be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate 2-year pulmonary metastatic progression rates in patients with primary
           high-grade extremity soft tissue sarcoma who have received preoperative I-MAP, plus
           aerosol GM-CSF, plus irradiation with concomitant MAP followed by post-operative aerosol
           GM-CSF.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate survival of these patients.

        -  To evaluate time to progression in these patients.

        -  To evaluate toxicity in these patients.

        -  To evaluate tumor response in these patients.

      Translational

        -  To observe and describe sequentially before treatment, after treatment, and after
           recovery from treatment the frequency of skin test anergy and cellular immunity in
           extremity soft tissue sarcoma receiving systemic GM-CSF preoperatively and aerosol
           GM-CSF as part of both preoperative and postoperative treatment.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Neoadjuvant treatment: Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 2 hours on days 0 and 1 and
           cisplatin IV over 4 hours, mitomycin IV and doxorubicin IV on day 1. Treatment repeats
           every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity. Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) every 12 hours
           on days -6 to -3, 2-14, and 22-25. Beginning on day 84 patients also undergo
           radiotherapy once daily, five days a week, continuing for five weeks. Patients also
           receive GM-CSF SC twice daily on days -3 and 2 -15 and aerosol GM-CSF twice daily on
           days 85 - 91, 99 -105, and 113 - 119.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Beginning 4 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
           patients undergo radiotherapy (RT) once daily, 5 days a week, for 5 weeks. Patients also
           receive aerosolized GM-CSF twice daily on days 2-8, 16-22, and 30-38 and mitomycin C IV,
           doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, and cisplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 29.

        -  Surgery: Four weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo surgery. Patients
           may also undergo intraoperative RT electron boost or intraoperative high-dose
           brachytherapy.

        -  Adjuvant treatment: Beginning 4 weeks after surgery, patients receive aerosol GM-CSF
           twice daily on days -7, 15-21, 35-42, 56-63, and 77-84. Some patients may undergo
           external beam RT 2-4 weeks after surgery.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and at 4 and 14 weeks after surgery. Samples are
      tested for NY-ESO-1 by staining, for T-cell subset by flow cytometry, and for autologous
      lymphocyte proliferation. Patients may also be tested for delayed-type hypersensitivity and
      skin test anergy.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4
      months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and at 5 years.
