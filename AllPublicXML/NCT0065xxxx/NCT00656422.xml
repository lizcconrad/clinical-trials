      The main objective of this clinical trial is to investigate hepatic fat as the primary
      endpoint along with body fat, and weight changes after initiation of a basal insulin therapy
      together with data acquisition that is today's standard in studies investigating obesity and
      eating patterns with insulin detemir and insulin glargine.
