  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether a system that couples automated screening of
      Pap Tests with transmission of machine selected digital images, and review by cytologists at
      a remote location, performs to a clinically effective standard of accuracy.

      This clinical study uses the automated screening capabilities of the FocalPoint Primary
      Screening System (BD) for gynecologic cytology specimens (Pap tests) to allow for automated
      field of view (FOV) selection, digital image capture, and subsequent Internet-based
      transmission to a custom designed computer-based image reading station. The system utilizes
      liquid-based cytology preparations (ThinPrep, SurePath). In such a system, no skilled
      cytology human resources are necessary at the scanning site, and all expertise can be
      centralized. Pilot studies showed that the task was feasible to a clinically relevant
      standard of care. Phase 1 trials on preselected and seeded specimens confirmed this clinical
      standard. The phase 2 trials extend the concept to a prospectively enrolled population of
      patients from 2 sites (Walter Reed, Mass General) thereby testing the concept in a population
      of normal disease prevalence. The final phase 3 will be a larger study with intended use
      design, siting a screening device at the 121st Army Hospital in Korea and interpreting the
      specimen images in the US. In addition to the reading of the specimens, the system is
      designed to give immediate &quot;loop closing&quot; results back to each specimen's originating point
      immediate upon completion of the test.
