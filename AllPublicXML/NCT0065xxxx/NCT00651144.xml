      The purpose of this study is to obtain data of the coadministration of ezetimibe and
      rosuvastatin to support the concomitant use of these two drugs in patients requiring
      additional cholesterol-lowering management. Treatment is administered for 14 days.

             interfere with the study evaluations.

          -  Subjects must have a normal or clinically acceptable physical exam and ECG (12-lead
             recorded at 25 mm/s and reporting heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals).

          -  Subjects' clinical laboratory tests (CBC, blood chemistries, and urinalysis) must be
             within normal limits or clinically acceptable to the investigator/ sponsor.

             study entry.

          -  Subjects with pre-existing gallbladder disease or a history of liver function test
             abnormalities.

          -  Subjects who smoke more than ten cigarettes or equivalent tobacco use per day.

          -  Subjects who have a clinically significant allergy or intolerance to foods or drugs,
