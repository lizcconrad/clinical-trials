      Purpose: to evaluate the effect of a brief computer program to prevent alcohol misuse for
      patients consulting in an emergency department and screened for alcohol misuse.

      Design: A randomized controlled trial with patients blinded of study hypotheses.
      Randomization will be stratified on centers and the sex

      Interventions:

      Patients randomized in the experimental group will participate in an interactive computer
      program with video, questionnaires and information related to alcohol misuse. They will also
      be contacted by phone at 1 month and 3 months to reinforce the effect of the intervention.

      Patients randomized in the control group will participate in an interactive computer program
      with questionnaires and information related to healthy diet. They will also be contacted by
      phone at 1 month and 3 months to reinforce the effect of the intervention.

      Participants: all patients consulting in an emergency department will be screened regarding
      their alcohol consumption and misuse. All patients screened as having alcohol misuse will be
      invited to participate in the trial.

      Outcomes: the main outcome is the declared alcohol consumption at 12 months. Patients will be
      evaluated by phone at 3, 6 and 12 months by an independent outcome assessor.

      Analyses: An intention to treat analyses will be performed Number of patients: 600 patients
      will be included Number of centers:3 centres (university hospital) will participate
