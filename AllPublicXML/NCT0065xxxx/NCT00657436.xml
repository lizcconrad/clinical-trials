    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is the evaluation of multiple biomarkers related to acute coronary
      syndromes, including myeloid-related protein 8/14 (MRP 8/14), along with established clinical
      markers, for early diagnosis and risk stratification in patients presenting with acute chest
      pain at the emergency department.

      Study hypothesis: MRP 8/14, alone or together with other established or new biomarkers,
      increases the earliness, sensitivity, and specificity of diagnosing acute coronary syndromes.
