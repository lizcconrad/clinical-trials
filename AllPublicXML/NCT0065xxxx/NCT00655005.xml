      RATIONALE: Collecting information by questionnaire about the quality of life of patients with
      head and neck cancer may help doctors learn more about the disease.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is testing a questionnaire for assessing pain control, head and
      neck symptoms, and general symptoms of illness, demographics, moods, alcohol and tobacco
      history, and quality of life related to cancer in patients with newly diagnosed head and neck
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To pilot test a questionnaire measuring the collection of the following data from
           patients with newly diagnosed head and neck cancer: head and neck cancer-related
           symptoms, general demographics, pain control, general symptoms, mood, smoking and
           drinking history, and quality of life.

        -  To identify questions that may be unclear or difficult for patients to understand.

        -  To determine the time required for each patient to complete the questionnaire and assess
           the feasibility and burden to the patient.

        -  To determine the baseline incidence of symptoms and psychosocial issues in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients complete a timed questionnaire comprising questions of head and neck
      symptoms, demographic information, pain control, symptom control, mood, smoking and drinking
      history, and anxiety and depression under the supervision of the investigator.

    <description>collection of the following data from newly diagnosed HNC patients:
head and neck cancer-related symptoms • general demographics • pain control
general symptoms • mood • smoking and drinking history • quality of life
Questions will be identified that may be unclear or difficult for patients to understand for future revision.</description>

    <measure>Time required for questionnaire completion by each patient</measure>
    <time_frame>at time of patient exam</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator will verbally explain the purpose of the study using a script (provided with this packet) and obtain verbal consent from the patient. The questionnaire will be handed to the patient with instructions on how to complete it. The investigator will remain available in the room to address any concerns regarding the questionnaire and to time how long the patient takes to complete the survey.
When the patient has completed the questionnaire, the investigator will review it for completeness with the patient. The patient's participation in the study ends at this time.</description>
