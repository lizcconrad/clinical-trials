      The major hypothesis to be tested is that the treatment of intraabdominal infections that
      have been adequately treated operatively or by percutaneous techniques with three to five
      days of antibiotics will result in outcomes equivalent to the current standard where
      treatment is carried out until the patient has returned to normal (normal white blood cell
      count, temperature, and intestinal function), and that patients treated for three to five
      days will receive fewer days of antibiotics than the control group that has traditionally
      received seven to 14 days of treatment.

      Overall, this is a prospective, randomized, single-blinded (analysis), fifteen-center study
      using intent to treat analysis. Patients will be identified and after informed consent is
      obtained, will be randomized to receive antibiotics for 3 to 5 days (4 ± 1 days) after the
      initial surgical or percutaneous intervention or antibiotics until two calendar days after
      the patient's white blood cell count, systemic temperature, and gastrointestinal function
      have normalized (maximum of 10 days). The primary endpoint is the composite rate of
      in-hospital death and/or recurrence of intraabdominal infection and/or occurrence of surgical
      site (wound) infection. Secondary endpoints include the occurrence of any infection at any
      site and infection with antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Patient data through the thirty days
      following the initial intervention or until hospital discharge (whichever is longer) will be
      tracked

          -  ability to obtain informed consent from the subject or surrogate

             managed with open, laparoscopic, or percutaneous intervention.

          -  Gangrenous appendicitis or peritonitis without confirmatory cultures or with cultures
             without bacterial or fungal growth

          -  Ischemic or necrotic intestine without perforation and without positive bacterial or
             fungal cultures

          -  Intraabdominal infection associated with active necrotizing pancreatitis
