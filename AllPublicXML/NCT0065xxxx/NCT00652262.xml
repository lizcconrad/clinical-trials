      BAY 38-9456 10 mg and 20 mg can be given as safe and efficacious medications to patients with
      spinal cord injury suffering from erectile dysfunction, and that erectile dysfunction can be
      improved by uptitration to BAY 38-9456 20 mg when the treatment with 10 mg is not
      sufficiently effective
