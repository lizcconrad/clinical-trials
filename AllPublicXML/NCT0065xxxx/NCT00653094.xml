  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, there is no available equipment specifically designed for the procedure of
      instillation of fibrin glue for the repair of perianal fistulae. The currently used equipment
      involves surgical tools generally used for fistula surgeries, and injection syringes designed
      for general use. The injection of biological adhesives is performed using standard adhesive
      syringes that are not specially designed for use in perianal fistulae. The use of the
      semi-flexible metal probes can cause trauma to tissue and injure the fistula tract, creating
      an additional path, and the injection syringe and catheter are often inconvenient for
      perianal use. This study was design to test the use of Halevy kit, by gastroenterology
      specialist, as a non traumatic probing, mechanical debridement and injecting or inserting
      device for treatment substances in perianal fistulas. In this study a gastroenterologist will
      perform the procedure, in each procedure a trained colorectal surgeon will be present during
      the surgery to oversee the procedure and to provide surgical help if required.
