  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective dose escalation study of the administration of adult human stem cells
      in patients with end stage liver failure. Successive groups of two patients will receive
      ascending doses of autologous adult human stem cells starting at 1x10[9] cells. Following
      expansion in an approved GMP facility the cells will be infused into either the hepatic
      artery or portal vein of research participants.

      The aim of this trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of autologous adult stem
      cells when infused into either the hepatic artery or the portal vein. The maximum dose that
      would be given would be 5x10 to the ten [10].

      To assess improvement in liver function as measured by serological and biochemical analysis
      and determine whether there are any symptomatic improvements as reported by the patients.
