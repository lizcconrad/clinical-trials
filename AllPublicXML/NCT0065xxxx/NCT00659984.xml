      RATIONALE: Radioactive drugs, such as iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), may carry
      radiation directly to tumor cells and not harm normal cells. A bone marrow or peripheral stem
      cell transplant using stem cells from the patient may be able to replace blood-forming cells
      that were destroyed by I 131 MIBG.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of iodine I 131 MIBG
      followed by a stem cell transplant in treating young patients with relapsed or refractory
      high-risk neuroblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To establish the maximum tolerated dose of iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine
           (^131I-MIBG) in patients with relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.

      Secondary

        -  To describe toxicity following treatment with ^131I-MIBG in patients with
           relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.

        -  To estimate radiation absorbed doses to measurable lesions and to a standard set of
           normal organs following a 0.1 mCi/kg [3.7 MBq/kg] (minimum dose of 1.0 mCi [37 MBq] but
           not to exceed 5.0 mCi [185 MBq]) intravenous administration of ^131I-MIBG in patients
           with relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.

        -  To describe, within the confines of a phase IIa trial, objective tumor response
           following treatment with ^131I-MIBG in patients with relapsed/refractory high-risk
           neuroblastoma.

        -  To explore dose-response following treatment with ^131I-MIBG in patients with
           relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.

        -  To explore quality of life assessment following treatment with ^131I-MIBG in patients
           with relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Dosimetry: Patients receive a dosimetric dose of iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine
           (^131I-MIBG) IV over 1-3 minutes. Patients then undergo 2 or 3 MIBG scans within 5 days
           of the dosimetry dose to assess biodistribution and tumor uptake. Patients with normal
           tumor uptake and biodistribution proceed to treatment.

        -  Treatment: Within 1-4 weeks of the dosimetric dose, patients with normal tumor uptake
           and biodistribution receive a therapeutic dose of ^131I-MIBG IV over 1 hour on day 0 and
           undergo MIBG scan on day 7. Patients then proceed to autologous stem cell infusion.

        -  Autologous stem cell infusion: Patients receive an infusion of autologous stem cells
           from peripheral blood or bone marrow on day 14. Patients with an ANC of &lt; 500/µl at any
           point after autologous stem cell infusion receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or
           subcutaneously once daily until ANC is &gt; 2,000/µl.

      Patients complete a quality of life questionnaire at baseline and then at day 60.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at day 60 and periodically
      thereafter.

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 60 +/-10 or Engraftment, whichever comes first</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the dose immediately below the level at which dose escalation would be stopped due to dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). Once the MTD was reached, an additional 3 patients were to be treated at that dose level, for a total of 6 patients at that planned dose level. DLTs were defined as any of the events that are possibly, probably or definitely attributable to UltratraceTM iobenguane I 131. The MTD was supposed to be the highest dose tested at which fewer than 1/3 of pts experience a DLT when 6 patients have been treated at the MTD but the dosimetry results indicated that the maximal dosage allowed to normal organs would be exceeded if the highest planned dose (21.0 mCi/kg) was administered, so the highest dose administered in the study was 18.6 mCi/kg .</description>

    <measure>Dosimetric Estimation of Radiation Absorbed Doses to Measurable Lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5 post Dosimetric Dose</time_frame>
    <description>The dosimetric endpoint was to estimate radiation absorbed doses to measurable lesions and to a standard set of normal organs following an imaging dose of 0.1 mCi/kg Ultratrace™ Iobenguane I 131. Biodistribution was assessed by determination of total body residence (TBR) time and by visual examination of whole body camera images. 3 timepoints were used, the 1st image was taken within 1hr after the imaging dose, the 2nd image was taken at ~24hr after imaging dose, the 3rd image was taken 2-5d after imaging dose. Whole body radiation absorbed dose estimates &amp; kidney, liver, and lung were calculated using the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) schema.TBR time is derived from time integration of curve-fitted injected activity across all 3 timepoints when the isotope is emitting radiation.Three points are sampled to estimate a singular value for each organ and tissue according to the commonly used methods of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging Committee on MIRD.</description>

    <measure>Overall Objective Tumor Response Post Therapeutic Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 60 +/- 10 days post Therapeutic Dose</time_frame>
    <description>The International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC) were utilized as a basis for the overall response criteria, which incorporated responses in MIBG positive lesions,bone marrow disease, and CT/MRI lesions that met NANT-modified RECIST criteria. Efficacy success was defined as the proportion of pts who were successful overall [i.e., achieving a Complete Response (CR), Very Good Partial Response (VGPR), or Partial Response (PR)] determined by independent reviewers. CR = Disappearance of all target lesions, homovanillic acid/ vanillylmandelic acid (HVA/VMA) normal (NL); VGPR = &gt; 90% decr of disease for CT/MRI target lesions, all pre-existing bone lesions with CR by MIBG; MIBG scan can be SD/CR in soft tissue lesions. CR in bone marrow, no new tumor sites, and NL HVA/VMA.; PR = At least 30% decr in disease measurement for CT/MRI target lesions. Bone marrow with CR, MIBG with either PR/CR in bone lesions, MIBG may be SD /CR in soft tissue lesions, and HVA/VMA may still be elevated.</description>

    <measure>Tumor Response in CT/MRI Lesions Post Therapeutic Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 60 +/- 10 days post Therapeutic Dose</time_frame>
    <description>Measurable disease was defined for a conventional CT scan by the presence of at least one lesion that could be accurately measured in at least one dimension with the longest diameter at least 20 mm by Independent Review. Efficacy success was defined as a patient achieving a Complete Response (CR)=disappearance of all target and non-target CT/MRI lesions; or, Very Good Partial Response (VGPR)=greater than 90% decrease of the disease measurement for CT/MRI lesions, taking as reference the disease measurement done to confirm measurement disease at study entry. Non-target CT/MRI lesions stable to smaller in size; or, Partial Response (PR)=at least 30% decrease in the disease measurement for CT/MRI lesions, taking as reference the disease measurement done to confirm measurable disease at study entry. Non-target CT/MRI lesions stable to smaller in size.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 60 +/- 10 days post Therapeutic Dose</time_frame>
    <description>Patients (aged 5-18) and parents (of patients aged 2-18) were asked to complete the 23-item Pediatric Quality of Life InventoryTM (PedsQLTM). PedsQLTM consists of 4 scales (physical, emotional, social, school functioning) which are then averaged into an overall summary score (scale: 0-100 with 0 representing the worst possible Quality of Life overall summary score and 100 representing the best possible Quality of Life overall summary score). The mean difference between the post treatment overall summary score and the baseline overall summary score is reported.</description>

    <description>Eligible patients received a diagnostic imaging dose of Ultratrace™ Iobenguane I 131 (1-5 mCi) within 7 days of study enrollment, followed by three dosimetry scans over 3-6 days. If the imaging dose demonstrated normal biodistribution and tumor uptake, then the patient received a therapeutic dose within 7-28 days of the diagnostic imaging dose, followed by a single imaging scan on Day 7 post therapy. As per protocol, therapeutic dosing was to begin at 12.0 mCi/kg and escalate to 15.0, 18.0, and 21.0 mCi/kg until the MTD was established or the 21.0 mCi/kg dose level was reached. Actual doses administered ranged from 8.8 to 18.6 mCi/kg. Based on actual doses administered, patients were grouped into 3 mean dose groups: 11.2, 15.5, and 18.2 mCi/kg.
The dosimetry dose was administered over a period of 1-3 minutes by injection; the therapeutic dose was diluted in up to 25 mL normal saline and infused intravenously over 30 to 60 minutes.</description>

          <description>Eligible patients received a diagnostic imaging dose of Ultratrace™ Iobenguane I 131 (1-5 mCi) within 7 days of study enrollment, followed by three dosimetry scans over 3-6 days. If the imaging dose demonstrated normal biodistribution and tumor uptake, then the patient received a therapeutic dose within 7-28 days of the diagnostic imaging dose, followed by a single imaging scan on Day 7 post therapy. Therapeutic dosing began at 12.0 mCi/kg and escalated to 15.0, 18.0, and 21.0 mCi/kg until the MTD was established or the 21.0 mCi/kg dose level was reached. The dosimetry dose was administered over a period of 1-3 minutes by injection; the therapeutic dose was diluted in up to 25 mL normal saline and infused intravenously over 30 to 60 minutes.</description>

        <title>Maximum Tolerated Dose</title>
        <description>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the dose immediately below the level at which dose escalation would be stopped due to dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). Once the MTD was reached, an additional 3 patients were to be treated at that dose level, for a total of 6 patients at that planned dose level. DLTs were defined as any of the events that are possibly, probably or definitely attributable to UltratraceTM iobenguane I 131. The MTD was supposed to be the highest dose tested at which fewer than 1/3 of pts experience a DLT when 6 patients have been treated at the MTD but the dosimetry results indicated that the maximal dosage allowed to normal organs would be exceeded if the highest planned dose (21.0 mCi/kg) was administered, so the highest dose administered in the study was 18.6 mCi/kg .</description>

Based on the actual doses administered, patients were grouped into 3 dose groups of 6, 3, and 6 patients, according to the mean doses of the groups, which were 11.2, 15.5, and 18.2 mCi/kg, respectively.</description>

        <title>Dosimetric Estimation of Radiation Absorbed Doses to Measurable Lesions</title>
        <description>The dosimetric endpoint was to estimate radiation absorbed doses to measurable lesions and to a standard set of normal organs following an imaging dose of 0.1 mCi/kg Ultratrace™ Iobenguane I 131. Biodistribution was assessed by determination of total body residence (TBR) time and by visual examination of whole body camera images. 3 timepoints were used, the 1st image was taken within 1hr after the imaging dose, the 2nd image was taken at ~24hr after imaging dose, the 3rd image was taken 2-5d after imaging dose. Whole body radiation absorbed dose estimates &amp; kidney, liver, and lung were calculated using the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) schema.TBR time is derived from time integration of curve-fitted injected activity across all 3 timepoints when the isotope is emitting radiation.Three points are sampled to estimate a singular value for each organ and tissue according to the commonly used methods of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging Committee on MIRD.</description>

If the imaging dose demonstrated normal biodistribution and tumor uptake, then the patient received a therapeutic dose within 7-28 days of the diagnostic imaging dose, followed by a single imaging scan on Day 7 post therapy. Mean therapeutic dosing groups were 11.2 mCi/kg, 15.5 nCi/kg and 18.2 mCi/kg. The dosimetry dose was administered over a period of 1-3 minutes by injection; the therapeutic dose was diluted in up to 25 mL normal saline and infused intravenously over 30 to 60 minutes.</description>
