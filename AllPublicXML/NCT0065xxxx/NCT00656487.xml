  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out more about cognitive functioning in people who are
      cannabis dependent, relative to people who do not use cannabis, and how their brains process
      information after one month of not using cannabis. An additional goal is to characterize the
      severity of cannabis dependence using precipitated and naturalistic withdrawal with a double
      blind, placebo controlled, single administration of rimonabant. Research assessments occur
      bi-weekly throughout this 28 day study.

    <measure>Withdrawal Symptom Severity on the Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist (MWC) at 28 Days Following Single Dose Administration of Rimonabant or Placebo, or Commencement of Monitoring, During the Double-Blind Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The MWC is a 28-item instrument that is used to assess the severity of frequently reported cannabis withdrawal symptoms. Each item on the measure is recorded as a severity rating between 0-3 where a zero indicates not present and a three indicates severe. The severity rating of each item was summed to obtain a single marijuana withdrawal severity score ranging between 0- 84. A lower score indicates less severe withdrawal.</description>

    <measure>Change From Day 0 in Performance on the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Batteries Spatial Working Memory (CANTAB SWM) Strategy Score at Day 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 and Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The CANTAB SWM task is a validated computer-based testing instrument assessing the memory component of executive function. Strategy Score is an estimate of use of the most efficient strategy to complete the task. Scores range from 8-56; higher scores equate to poor use of the most efficient strategy. Change = (Day 28 Score - Day 0 Score). A more negative result indicates greater improvement.</description>

    <description>The CANTAB SWM task is a validated computer-based testing instrument assessing the memory component of executive function. Total Errors are a measure of performance and are unbounded. Change = (Day 28 Score - Day 0 Score). A more negative result indicates greater improvement.</description>

        <description>The CANTAB SWM task is a validated computer-based testing instrument assessing the memory component of executive function. Strategy Score is an estimate of use of the most efficient strategy to complete the task. Scores range from 8-56; higher scores equate to poor use of the most efficient strategy. Change = (Day 28 Score - Day 0 Score). A more negative result indicates greater improvement.</description>
