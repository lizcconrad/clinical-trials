    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of Alogliptin, once daily (QD), taken by
      itself and with pioglitazone on postprandial lipid measures in type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SYR-322 (alogliptin) is a selective, orally available inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase IV
      being developed as a treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV is the
      primary enzyme involved in the in vivo degradation of at least 2 peptide hormones released in
      response to nutrient ingestion, namely glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent
      insulinotropic peptide.

      Pioglitazone HCl (ACTOS®) is a thiazolidinedione developed by Takeda Chemical Industries,
      Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Pioglitazone HCl depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of
      action.

      This study will assess the effects of alogliptin and alogliptin coadministered with
      pioglitazone HCl on postprandial lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in participants with type 2
      diabetes. Individuals who participate in this study will be required to commit to a screening
      visit and up to 6 additional visits at the study center. Study participation is anticipated
      to be about 20 weeks (or approximately 5 months). Multiple procedures will occur at each
      visit which may include fasting, blood collection, urine collection, physical examinations
      and electrocardiograms. At 3 of the visits a meal will be served that must be eaten within 10
      minutes.
