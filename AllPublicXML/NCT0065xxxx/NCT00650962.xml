      1. Pre-shock cardiopulmonary resuscitation might benefit the survival of out-of-hospital
           cardiac patients with ventricular fibrillation / ventricular tachycardia in a post-hoc
           analysis of a prehospital trial conducted in Europe (L.Wik,2002). However, it's
           effectiveness in the Asian countries, where most firstly recorded rhythm in
           out-of-hospital cardiac arrests patients were asystole/pulseless electric activity
           rather than ventricular fibrillation / ventricular tachycardia, were not explored yet.

        2. This trial was designed to exam if pre-shock cardiopulmonary resuscitation by emergency
           medical technicians improves the outcome of all out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients
           in an Asian metropolitan city.

      1. Different from data from the Western countries, non-shockable rhythm (Asystole/pulseless
           electric activity) was responsible for most out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
           patients(80%~90%) in metropolitan Taipei.

        2. Response time in Taipei emergency medical service was longer than 5 minutes.

        3. Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation rate were relatively low in Taipei.

        4. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is the only known method to save out-of-hospital cardiac
           arrest patients with asystole/pulseless electric activity. For those suffered from
           ventricular fibrillation/ ventricular tachycardia,previous studies revealed pre-shock
           cardiopulmonary resuscitation may have the potential to improve the outcome.

        5. Study hypothesis: Compared with current standard resuscitative sequence (basic life
           support protocol in Guideline 2005), longer pre-shock cardiopulmonary resuscitation
           provided to all out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients in Taipei may improve the
           outcome of them.
