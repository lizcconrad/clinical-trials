             procedures

          -  Subjects must complete all screening procedures within 28 days prior to the
             administration of the study medication

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Breast feeding female subjects

          -  Clinically significant anormalities found during medical screening

          -  Any clinically significant gastrointestinal pathology or unresolved gastrointestinal
             symptoms susceptible of interfering with the absorption of drugs

          -  Clinically significant illnesses within 4 weeks of the administration of study
             medication

          -  Abnormal laboratory tests judged clinically significant

          -  ECG abnormalities or vital sign abnormalities at screening

          -  Subjects with BMI greater than or equal to 30.0

          -  History of allergic reactions to cabergoline or ergot derivatives

          -  Any food allergies, intolerances, restrictions, or special diet which in the opinion
             of the medical subinvestigator, contraindicates the subject's participation in the
             study

          -  Positive urine drug screen at screening

          -  Positive testing for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV at screening

          -  Positive urine pregnancy test at screening (performed on all females)

          -  Use of investigational drug or participation in an investigational study, within 30
             days prior to administration of the study medication

          -  Donation of plasma (500 mL) within 7 days or donation or significant loss of whole
             blood (450 mL) within 56 days prior to the administration of the study medication

          -  History of significant alcohol abuse within six months of the screening visit or any
             indication of the regular use of more than two units of alcohol per day

          -  History of drug abuse or use of illegal drugs: use of soft drugs (marijuana, pot)
             within 3 months of the screening visit or hard drugs (cocaine, PCP, crack)within 1
             year of the screening visit

          -  Subjects who have taken prescription medication within 14 days prior to administration
             of study medication or over-the-counter products within 7 days prior to administration
             of study medication, except for topical products without systemic absorption

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential who have had unprotected sexual intercourse
             with any non-sterile male partner (i.e. male who has not been sterilized by vasectomy
             for at last 6 months) within 14 days prior to the study drug administration. The
             acceptable methods of contraception are condom + spermicide (at least 14 days prior to
             study drug administration), diaphragm + spermicide (at least 14 days prior to study
             drug administration)or intrauterine contraceptive device (placed at least 4 weeks
             prior to study drug administration

          -  Subjects who have taken any drugs known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism
             within 30 days prior to administration of the study medication

          -  Subjects who have undergone clinically significant surgery within 4 weeks prior to the
             administration of the study medication

          -  Any reason which, in the opinion of the medical subinvestigator, would prevent the
             subject from participating in the study
