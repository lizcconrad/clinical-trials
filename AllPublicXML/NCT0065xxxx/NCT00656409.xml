  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal recessive inherited condition caused by mutations
      in the ATM gene1. Patients suffer from neuro-degenerative problems, usually commencing in the
      second year of life, and affecting predominantly the cerebellum. They also develop the
      characteristic superficial telangiectases. Between 60 and 80% of affected children are
      immunodeficient. This is associated with deficiency of immunoglobulin A (IgA ) 2, of IgG23
      and of antibody responses to pneumococcal polysaccharides4. Patients suffer recurrent
      sino-pulmonary infections but a recent study suggests poor correlation between immune status
      and immunological parameters5. If uncontrolled, recurrent pulmonary infections can contribute
      to the development of chronic lung disease and bronchiectasis. Preventative management
      includes continuous prophylactic antibiotic treatment in some with the need for replacement
      immunoglobulin therapy in only a small proportion of cases. Antibiotics have been reasonably
      effective in this situation but the emergence of resistance amongst community acquired
      pneumococcal isolates is a cause for concern. Appropriate immunisation strategies may also
      have a role.

      This study is designed to look at antibody responses in a one versus two dose regimen in a
      cohort of AT patients recruited through the AT Society a national charitable organisation
      involved in providing support to families with this condition and in fostering education and
      research in the field.
