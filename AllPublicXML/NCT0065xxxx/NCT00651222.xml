    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to review cause of death in patients undergoing prostate
      brachytherapy at a single institution. Furthermore, we are analyzing patients undergoing
      androgen deprivation therapy and whether or not this contributed to cardiovascular deaths,
      specifically myocardial infarction.
