    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo controlled study in cancer patients reporting fatigue
      persisting for at least two months following completion of chemotherapy. Subjects will
      receive 6 weeks of either acupuncture or placebo treatment as a means of evaluating whether
      acupuncture reduces chronic fatigue after chemotherapy.

    <description>Subjects will receive acupuncture weekly for six weeks. Subjects will complete a Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) questionnaire, a Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment scale (FACT-G), and a Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale(HADS) at week 7. The BFI and FACT-G will be repeated at week 8. At the end of the study, subjects will be asked to state whether they thought they were on true or placebo acupuncture and why.</description>

    <intervention_name>Placebo Acupuncture</intervention_name>
    <description>Subjects will receive placebo acupuncture weekly for six weeks. During the placebo phase, placebo acupuncture needles will be applied a few mm away from the required points. The placebo acupuncture needle is a blunt tipped needle that moves up inside its handle. When it is pressed against the skin, the subject feels a slight prick and sees the handle of the needle moving towards the skin as if the needle has been inserted.
Subjects will complete a BFI, a FACT-G, and a HADS at week 7. The BFI and FACT-G will be repeated at week 8. At the end of the study, subjects will be asked to state whether they thought they were on true or placebo acupuncture and why. Subjects in the placebo group will be given the option to receive true acupuncture.</description>

             completion of the first baseline questionnaire.

          -  Mean baseline fatigue as measured by the Brief Fatigue Inventory must be four or
             above.

        Exclusion Criteria:
