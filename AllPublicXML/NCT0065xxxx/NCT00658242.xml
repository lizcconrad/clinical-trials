      Craniofacial reconstruction procedures are undertaken in young children to improve
      appearance, prevent functional disturbances, and enhance psychosocial development. These
      procedures involve wide scalp dissections and multiple osteotomies and have been associated
      with significant morbidity. The most commonly seen perioperative complications are associated
      with the rate and extent of blood loss. This prospective observational registry will be a
      research tool which will provide a means to evaluate perioperative management of these
      children at CHOP.

    <textblock>
      Craniofacial reconstructive surgery involves a surgical approach to the craniofacial region
      to repair cranial vault and facial deformities. These procedures are undertaken in young
      children to improve appearance, prevent functional disturbances, and enhance psychosocial
      development. The surgery is extensive, often requiring wide scalp dissections and multiple
      osteotomies and has been associated with significant morbidity. Reported complications
      include intra-operative cardiac arrest, massive blood loss, intraoperative tracheal
      extubation, venous air embolism, hypotension, coagulopathy, bradycardia, postoperative
      seizures, surgical site infections, facial swelling, and unplanned postoperative mechanical
      ventilation. The most severe and commonly seen problems are associated with the rate and
      extent of blood loss. Studies report estimated blood loss to average between 60% and 100% of
      the patient's estimated blood volume, with a range of 20-500%.(Hildebrandt et al 2007) The
      accurate and timely estimation of blood loss is very difficult and results in imprecise
      quantitative and qualitative replacement. Clinically important hypotension, metabolic
      acidosis, anemia, polycythemia, dilutional coagulopathy, cardiac arrest, and death are all
      related to blood loss. The creation of this prospective observational registry will provide a
      means to describe the incidence of these and other clinically important perioperative
      problems.
