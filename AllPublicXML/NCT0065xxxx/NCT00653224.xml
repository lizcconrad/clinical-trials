    <description>The RQLQ is a validated instrument composed of 28 questions covering 7 dimensions of health. Each question is scored on a scale of 0 to 6 (in which 0 = not troubled and 6 = extremely troubled), and the mean value for each health dimension is calculated. Overall health-related quality of life is expressed as the mean of the seven dimension scores and ranges from 0 to 6. Endpoint is defined as the last available postbaseline measurement during the two week treatment period.</description>

        <description>The RQLQ is a validated instrument composed of 28 questions covering 7 dimensions of health. Each question is scored on a scale of 0 to 6 (in which 0 = not troubled and 6 = extremely troubled), and the mean value for each health dimension is calculated. Overall health-related quality of life is expressed as the mean of the seven dimension scores and ranges from 0 to 6. Endpoint is defined as the last available postbaseline measurement during the two week treatment period.</description>

        <description>The RQLQ is a validated instrument composed of 28 questions covering 7 dimensions of health. Each question is scored on a scale of 0 to 6 (in which 0 = not troubled and 6 = extremely troubled), and the mean value for each health dimension is calculated. Endpoint is defined as the last available postbaseline measurement during the two week treatment period.</description>

        <description>The RQLQ is a validated instrument composed of 28 questions covering 7 dimensions of health. Each question is scored on a scale of 0 to 6 (in which 0 = not troubled and 6 = extremely troubled), and the mean value for each health dimension is calculated. Endpoint is defined as the last available postbaseline measurement during the two week treatment period.</description>

          <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-Allergy Specific (WPAI-AS) has been validated to measure generic and allergy-specific performance impairment of work and classroom productivity and of regular daily activity. Higher scores (0% to 100%) indicate greater impairment and a negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

Subjects are asked to rate the chances of dozing off or falling asleep in eight situations encountered in daily life on a scale of 0 to 3, with scores ranging from 0 to 24. A score &gt;= 8 indicates sleepiness.</description>
