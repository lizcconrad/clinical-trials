      This is a Phase 1 study during which patients with advanced HER2+ solid malignancies or HER2+
      metastatic breast cancer will receive investigational study drug ARRY-380.

      This study has 2 parts. In the first part, patients with advanced HER2+ solid malignancies,
      who have already received at least one previous standard therapy, will receive increasing
      doses of study drug in order to achieve the highest dose of study drug possible that will not
      cause unacceptable side effects. Approximately 30 patients from the US will be enrolled in
      Part 1 (Completed).

      In the second part of this study, patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer, who have
      already received at least one previous standard therapy, will receive the best dose of study
      drug determined from the first part of the study and will be followed to see what side
      effects and effectiveness the study drug has, if any, in treating the cancer. Approximately
      20 patients from the US will be enrolled in Part 2 (Active, not recruiting).

        Key Inclusion Criteria (Part 1 and Part 2):

          -  Histological or cytological evidence of HER2+ cancer (Part 1) or HER2+ metastatic
             breast cancer (Part 2).

          -  Patients should have received at least one previous therapeutic regimen and either no
             longer are candidates for standard therapy, have no standard therapy available, or
             choose not to pursue standard therapy (patients with HER2+ breast cancer and with
             clinical indication for trastuzumab or lapatinib should have received prior therapy
             with trastuzumab and lapatinib, if available).

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) between 0 and 2.

          -  Additional criteria exist.

        Key Exclusion Criteria (Part 1 and Part 2):

          -  Uncontrolled or symptomatic brain metastases (patients may be considered adequately
             controlled if on a stable steroid dose for at least 30 days).

          -  Treatment with an investigational medicinal product or device within 30 days prior to
             first dose of study drug.

          -  Radiotherapy within 28 days prior to first dose of study drug (not including
             palliative radiotherapy at focal sites).

          -  Chemotherapy within 21 days prior to first dose of study drug.

          -  Major surgery within 30 days prior to first dose of study drug.

          -  Known positive serology for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and/or
             active hepatitis C.

          -  Additional criteria exist.
