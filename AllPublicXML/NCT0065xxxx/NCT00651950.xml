  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that nurses and doctors can use a transcutaneously powered ultrasonic
      flow sensor to make repeatable and accurate hydrocephalic shunt flow measurements.

      The study participants will align the flowmeter probe with a flow sensor hidden under a thick
      saline pad that simulates skin. A hidden pump will provide a known flow through the flow
      sensor as the participants make their measurements. Each participant will repeat these
      measurements over a period of weeks, and the data will tell whether operator skill influences
      flow measurement accuracy.

      The study hypothesis is that a transcutaneously powered ultrasonic flow sensor for
      hydrocephalic shunts can be repeatedly and accurately read by medical personnel ranging from
      nurses to senior neurosurgeons.

      The test will involve a prototype implantable hydrocephalic shunt flow sensor and readout
      electronics. The readout electronics use a pickup coil to transcutaneously operate the sensor
      once the coil is aligned with sensor's inductive coupling coils.

      During the test, the shunt flow sensor will be hidden under a thick saline gel pad whose
      thickness approximates the skin thickness of an older pediatric patient. A syringe pump will
      provide a known flow rate through tubing connected to the sensor, but the study participants
      will not know the pump flow setting.

      Three neurosurgeons and six floor nurses will perform this study. Each will use the Transonic
      flowmeter readout to align the pickup coils of the flowmeter with the hidden sensor to make
      flow measurements.

      Each participant will repeat this measurement multiple times over non-consecutive days.

      The recorded data will quantify measurement accuracy and repeatability between different
      operators, and will determine whether operator skill influences flow measurement accuracy.
