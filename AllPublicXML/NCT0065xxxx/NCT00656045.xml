      The purpose of this investigation is to conduct an 8-week pilot study to examine the effects
      of two different leisure-time activity prescriptions on dietary intake, leisure-time
      activities, and weight loss in 26 adults receiving a standard 8-week behavioral weight loss
      intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In adult observational studies, TV viewing has been positively related to overweight and
      obesity. It is theorized that TV watching influences eating and activity behaviors, such that
      with greater TV watching less physical activity and greater consumption of energy occurs,
      producing a positive energy balance state. While no experimental research has been conducted
      with adults examining the influence of reducing TV watching on weight status, experimental
      research conducted with children does indicate that lower levels of TV watching can produce
      reduced energy intake and greater levels of physical activity. Most importantly,
      family-based, behavioral childhood obesity interventions that have targeted reducing
      sedentary behaviors (which includes TV watching) have found that as compared to targeting
      increasing physical activity during treatment, similar increases in activity and fitness
      occur, but that greater weight loss and greater increases in liking for physical activity
      occur when sedentary behaviors, as compared to physical activity, are targeted in
      family-based behavioral childhood weight control programs.

      Thus, this investigation will involve an 8-week pilot study to examine the effects of two
      different leisure-time activity prescriptions. All participants in the investigation will
      receive a standard 8-week behavioral obesity intervention. The intervention will include a
      reduced caloric prescription (1200-1500 kcal/day) and fat gram prescription (30% or less
      kcals from fat). One condition will receive an activity goal (200 minutes/week of
      moderate-intense physical activity [Physical Activity]), while the other condition will
      receive a TV watching goal (10 hours/week [ TV Watching]). Participants will be assessed at 0
      and 9 weeks (pre- and post-intervention) on measures of dietary intake, physical activity, TV
      watching, liking of physical activity and TV watching, and weight.
