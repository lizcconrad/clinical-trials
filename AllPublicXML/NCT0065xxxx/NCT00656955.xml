      Background:

      In Central Europe, mortality rates for kidney cancers are higher and survival rates are lower
      than in the United States and Western Europe overall.

      The Central and Eastern European Renal Cancer Case-Control Study (CEERCC), completed in 2002,
      offers an opportunity to identify determinants that predict 5-year survival among kidney
      cancer patients.

      Objectives:

      To assess disease recurrence and progression among former participants in the CEERCC.

      To investigate the effect of genetics, lifestyle factors, medical conditions, occupation and
      diet on the outcome of kidney cancer patients in Europe.

      Eligibility:

      Former participants or next-of-kin of former participants in the CEERCC study.

      Design:

      Participants or their next-of-kin are interviewed for 60 minutes and are requested permission
      to collect relevant information from their or their family member s hospital and cancer
      registry records....

      Previously we proposed to conduct a follow-up study of kidney cancer in the high risk region
      of Central and Eastern Europe. This study was conducted through the follow-up of a group of
      patients with kidney cancer, that were previously enrolled in the study entitled, Occupation,
      Genetic Susceptibility Kidney Cancer: Central European Case-Controls Study, PI Dr. Wong-Ho
      Chow, OEEB, DCEG, NCI, protocol No 01-C-NO63, a study for which field work and data analyses
      of the case control study were completed. We had originally planned to conduct the follow-up
      study in seven centers in four countries, including Romania, Poland, Russia, and the Czech
      Republic. In each center, cancer-related information was to be extracted from vital
      statistics, cancer registry, and/or medical records. For deceased patients, next-of-kin were
      to be interviewed using a brief questionnaire.

      A pilot study was conducted to determine the feasibility of collecting survival information
      including 5-year survival status, date of death, cause of death, and date of last follow-up
      if alive from 220 cases across the seven collaborating centers. The feasibility of extracting
      additional data including surgical and medical treatment procedures used to treat primary
      disease, the recurrence and progression of primary disease was also determined. However,
      based on results obtained from the pilot study, we determined that it is feasible to collect
      follow-up data from kidney cancer cases from four centers in the Czech Republic and one
      center in both Poland and Russia.

      Medical records/archives for Romanian cases were located in hospitals that were completely
      destroyed during reconstruction therefore, it was impossible to collect any information from
      this subset of patients. Exclusion of these records will not affect study power since most of
      the cases were from the Czech Republic. The objective of our proposed study remains the
      same:( 1) to assess the 5-year survival status of kidney cancer patients in the Central and
      Easter European Renal Cell Carcinoma Study; (2) to examine prevalence of recurrent disease
      and progression; (3) to investigate additional patient-tumor-and genetic determinant of
      5-year survival in cases.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        To be eligible for this study, patients needed to have participated as a histologically
        confirmed renal cancer case in the previous case-control study entitled Central European
        Renal Cancer Case-Control (CEERCC) Study which was completed in 2002.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Children less than 18 are not eligible to participate in this study because there were no
        kidney cancer cases observed in the CEERCC Study that were less than 18 years of age.

        American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, and
        Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.
