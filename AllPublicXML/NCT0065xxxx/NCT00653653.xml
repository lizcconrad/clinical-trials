  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a prospective study design of two three month periods (before and after genotyping) in
      which the patients will self-monitor their health status and possible medical events it is
      hypothesized that it will be shown that patients having their medication altered to fit their
      genetic status and/or having their medication altered because of inherent interaction
      potential will have less recordable events after genotyping and medical analysis than before.

      It is well known that ADRs (recordable adverse events to medication) are responsible for a
      large number of deaths and hospitalizations. Furthermore it is well recorded that genotyping
      of individual cytochrome P450 enzymes (2D6, 2C9, 2C19, among others) is directly related to a
      metabolic phenotype - fast metabolisers, slow metabolisers, intermediate and normal
      metabolisers. These differing phenotypes have altered metabolism of many medications and in a
      number of retrospective clinical trails it has been shown that ADRs and effect can be
      reduced/bettered through genotyping and alteration of medication.
