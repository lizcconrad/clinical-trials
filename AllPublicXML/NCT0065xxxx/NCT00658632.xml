      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of Rabeprazole (RAB)
      Extended-Release (ER) 50 mg versus Esomeprazole (ESO) 40 mg in subjects with erosive
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (eGERD).

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study. Subjects
      who meet all the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment
      groups, Rabeprazole Extended-Release (RAB ER) 50 mg or Esomeprazole (ESO) 40 mg for the
      treatment of mild to moderate erosive Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Erosive Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (eGERD) Who Achieved Endoscopically-confirmed Healing by 8 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Healing at Week 4 or 8 were based on improvement of eGERD of the Los Angeles (LA) classification of esophagitis Grade A or B from Baseline. Classifications include:
Not Present: No breaks (erosions) in the esophageal mucosa (however, edema, erythema, or friability may be present).
Grade A: One or more mucosal breaks not more than 5mm in maximum length. Grade B: One or more mucosal breaks more than 5mm in maximum length, but not continuous between the tops of 2 mucosal folds.
Grade C: Mucosal breaks continuous between the tops of 2 or more mucosal folds, but involving less than 75% of the esophageal circumference.
Gread D: Mucosal breaks involving at least 75% of the esophageal circumference.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Diary-recorded Sustained Resolution of Heartburn by Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>During the first 4 weeks of the Double-blind Phase, participants were to record heartburn in a daily diary. Participant daily symptoms for the assessment of heartburn was based on a commonly used 4-point Likert scale of none, mild, moderate and severe. A participant was considered achieving sustained resolution of heartburn if the participant had maintained at least 7 consecutive heartburn-free days.</description>

        <description>During the first 4 weeks of the Double-blind Phase, participants were to record heartburn in a daily diary. Participant daily symptoms for the assessment of heartburn was based on a commonly used 4-point Likert scale of none, mild, moderate and severe. A participant was considered achieving sustained resolution of heartburn if the participant had maintained at least 7 consecutive heartburn-free days.</description>
