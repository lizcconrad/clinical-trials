      This is a consolidation therapy trial evaluating GI-4000 in subjects with NSCLC treated with
      curative intent who are disease free at their first post-treatment restaging assessment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NSCLC is the deadliest form of human cancer, killing approximately 150,000 people a year in
      the United States. The best treatment for NSCLC is surgical resection. For patients with
      inoperable or unresectable NSCLC chemotherapy and radiation is used as first line therapy.
      This is a consolidation therapy trial evaluating GI-4000 in subjects with NSCLC treated with
      curative intent who are disease free at their first post-treatment restaging assessment.
      These subjects must also have a ras mutation.
