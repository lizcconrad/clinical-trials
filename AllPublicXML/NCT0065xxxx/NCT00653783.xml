  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of PROBE is to evaluate the feasibility and potential utility of three
      markers (alpha-synuclein, transcriptomic profiles and olfactory function) to determine the
      risk or prognosis of PD.

      PROBE will test three biomarkers in PD subjects and controls to determine their feasibility
      and potential utility as markers of risk and prognosis for PD. This is a case control study,
      in which PD subjects will be compared to neurologically healthy controls and disease controls
      (MSA and PSP). The blood biomarker samples will be drawn once to evaluate blood
      alpha-synuclein levels as well as collection of lymphocyte mass for array analysis. Olfaction
      will be measured using the UPSIT for all subjects. The UPSIT will be conducted as part of
      PostCEPT for PD subjects and will only be repeated in this study for PD subjects in not done
      within 6 months. Control subjects may also choose to submit a blood specimen for processing
      and storage at the Coriell Institute for Medical Research, a research resource supported by
      the NINDS Human Genetics Resource Center.

      Follow-up of the PD population over a 3-year period will allow us to evaluate the prognosis
      for important motor aspects of PD that will occur frequently in this cohort. These
      complications of PD include motor complications, postural instability, and non-motor
      impairment such as cognitive decline.

      Healthy and disease control subjects may give permission at the Baseline visit to be
      contacted and followed in the previously established PSG FOUND study using mail and telephone
      contact to assess clinical status. Participation in the FOUND study provides another
      mechanism to maintain contact with subjects and collect supplemental data beyond that
      collected at the PROBE Baseline visit.
