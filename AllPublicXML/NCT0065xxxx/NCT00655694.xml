    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disease characterized by
      progressive airflow obstruction, chronic cough and dyspnoea in advanced stages.

      Techniques such as genomics, proteomics and metabonomics, Technologies that aim to identify
      and quantify the dynamic set of all small molecules and metabolites present in an organism or
      a biological sample, offer the prospect of efficiently distinguishing individuals with
      particular diseases. The advantages of proteomics and metabonomics is that it can be carried
      out on a standard preparation of serum, plasma or urine, circumventing the need for
      specialist preparation of cellular mRNA required for genomics This methodology is based on
      mass spectrometry (MS), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and nuclear magnetic
      resonance (NMR) to analyze metabolites. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) may
      also be applied. Several peak alignment algorithms have been developed to match the
      chromatograms before applying pattern recognition. Based on the pattern recognition, several
      potential biomarkers may be found and further identified by MS.. Finally, a number of
      potential biomarkers will be identified for distinguishing asthma and COPD.

      We hope to develop a better understanding of lung disease. Information from these studies
      will only be used for research purposes, to help develop safer and more effective treatments
      for asthma and COPD.
