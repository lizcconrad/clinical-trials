          -  Presence or history of significant gastrointestinal, liver or kidney disease, or any
             conditions known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or
             excretion of drugs or known to potentiate or predispose to undesired effects.

          -  Presence or history of significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, neurologic,
             psychiatric, endocrine, immunologic or dermatologic disease.

          -  Participation in another clinical trial in the previous 28 days before day 1 of this
             study.

          -  Donation of 500 mL of blood (Canadian Blood Services, Hema-Quebec, clinical studies,
             etc.) in the previous 56 days before day 1 of this study.

          -  Positive urine screening of drugs of abuse (drug names are presented in section
             6.1.1.4).
