  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospital stays after total joint replacement surgery have been getting shorter over the past
      10 years. This is mostly due to new ways to manage pain and early rehabilitation. To be able
      to go home safely soon after surgery, patients need to:

        -  1) have adequate pain control

        -  2) be able to move through activities of daily living on their own (using aids)

      Femoral nerve block, in combination with pain medications, is one of the new treatment
      strategies that are currently being used at other hospitals in Canada, the United States and
      the United Kingdom. Nerve blocks involve a needle filled with local anesthetic into the nerve
      that allows the feeling of pain around the knee. With good pain management, patients will be
      able to more quickly bend their knee and regain the ability to walk with aids and move from
      sitting and lying positions to standing and walking. Once they can do these activities with
      adequate pain control, they can be discharged from hospital to continue recovery at home. The
      purpose of this study is to examine a new way of managing postoperative pain and encourage
      early knee flexion and mobility, while maintaining pain control for patients after total knee
      replacement. We believe that patients who receive the nerve block in addition to the regular
      pain medication will have more knee flexion at discharge and experience less pain than
      patients who only receive usual pain medications.
