      PURPOSE OF THE STUDY

      This study will explore the use of multi-site NIRS monitoring during tilt table testing,
      combining somatic and cerebral saturations data with hemodynamic data to establish the
      non-invasive assessment of global cardiac output distribution trends.

      HYPOTHESIS / SPECIFIC AIMS

      Study Aims: To evaluate the utility of multi-site NIRS monitoring in the cardiovascular
      hemodynamic assessment of children and adolescents during tilt table testing by establishing
      a non-invasive method to predict cardiac output maldistribution with the use of two-site NIRS
      monitoring in children and adolescents with syncope.
