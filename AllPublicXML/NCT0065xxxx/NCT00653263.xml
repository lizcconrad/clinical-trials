  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine use has escalated in recent years. Methamphetamine use has also spread
      throughout the country. Although much information has been gathered on the treatment of
      cocaine abuse, very little information has been obtained on the treatment of methamphetamine
      abuse. One of the first steps in developing appropriate treatment is to examine the effects
      of stopping a particular substance's use on individuals abusing that substance. To date this
      has not been well studied for people abusing methamphetamine. The purpose of this study is to
      better understand and develop accurate ways of measuring symptoms associated with stopping
      the use of methamphetamine in people that are abusing methamphetamine. If the withdrawal
      symptoms are able to be effectively measured, this will help to develop treatments targeted
      at alleviating these symptoms. These symptoms are often associated with relapse to use of
      that substance.

      The primary aim of this 4 week observational study is to examine and characterize the
      withdrawal symptoms experienced by methamphetamine abusers who are recently abstinent from
      methamphetamine. The period of drug or substance withdrawal is often cited as the time during
      which risk of relapse use of that substance is very high. Therefore it is highly important to
      characterize specifically the withdrawal syndrome associated with cessation of
      methamphetamine use. This study will demonstrate our ability to recruit and work with this
      methamphetamine dependent population. In addition it will allow for the collection of pilot
      data to assist in selecting appropriate assessment tools in a submission of an RO1 grant for
      well-controlled studies characterizing methamphetamine withdrawal.
