  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated that strict control of perioperative blood glucose following hepatic
      resection by using an artificial pancreas would improve postoperative surgical site
      infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study recruited 70 patients undergoing elective hepatic resection for liver diseases.
      Perioperative blood glucose concentration was continuously monitored using an artificial
      pancreas system. We prospectively divided patients into two groups: one for whom glucose
      levels were controlled using a manual injection of insulin according to the commonly used
      sliding scale and another that received programmed infusions of insulin determined by the
      control algorithm of the artificial pancreas.
