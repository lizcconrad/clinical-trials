      The purpose of this study is to compare Supervised Exercises with another non-operative
      frequently used treatment, Radial Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy (rESWT), for patients with
      subacromial impingement syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is, in succession to back, neck, and knee, the fourth most frequently localized
      musculoskeletal pain reported by patients to general practitioners and physical therapists. A
      majority of shoulder complaints lasts for more than three months and become chronic. Few of
      the different interventions for rehabilitation of chronic shoulder pain, have documented
      effect. Patients with shoulder pain are associated with significant disability and loss of
      quality of life which interfere with activities related to daily living.

      Supervised exercises, a treatment method which has been compared to surgery and placebo
      laser, is one that has documented effect for both short (6 months) and long time (2½ years).
      The purpose of this study was to compare Supervised Exercises with another non-operative
      common used treatment method for these patients, radial Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy
      (rESWT).

      The study is designed as a randomised, single blind clinical controlled study.
