    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and effectiveness of the SafeFlo filter for permanent protection
      against pulmonary emboli. All patients will be selected to receive the filter according to
      the stated inclusion / exclusion criteria after consultation between the attending physician
      and interventional radiologist. Patients with a permanent implantation will be followed for
      up to 6 months. Clinical success will be defined as no occurrences of any of the following
      events: recurrent pulmonary embolism, IVC occlusion or filter embolization. The proportion of
      permanent filter patients considered to be a clinical success will be the primary efficacy
      parameter.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Traditional indications for vena cava filter in patients with established DVT or PE,
             including (40):

               -  Patients with proven Pulmonary Embolus (PE) or Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and one
                  or more of the following:

                    1. Contraindication to anticoagulation

                    2. Complication of anticoagulation

                    3. Failure of anticoagulation

                         -  Recurrent PE despite adequate anticoagulation therapy

                         -  Inability to achieve adequate anticoagulation

                    4. Poor compliance with anticoagulation medications

          -  Extended indications for vena cava filter placement in patients with established DVT
             or PE, including the following (31, 40):

               -  Large free-floating thrombus in the iliac vein or IVC;

               -  Following massive PE in which recurrent emboli may prove fatal;

               -  During/after surgical or transcatheter embolectomy;

               -  Filter placement in high-risk trauma and orthopedic patients:

          -  High risk trauma or orthopedic patients who cannot receive anticoagulation because of
             increased bleeding risk, and have one or more of the following injury patterns (31,
             40):

               1. Severe closed head injury (GCS &lt; 8);

               2. Incomplete spinal cord injury with para or quadriplegia;

               3. Complex pelvic fractures with associated long-bone fractures;

               4. Multiple long bone fractures.

          -  Patients undergoing long-term immobilization (e.g., ICU or Surgical oncology)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients under 18 years of age.

          -  All patients undergoing emergency procedures.

          -  All patients with abnormal IVC anatomy or pathology of the IVC such as thrombosis or
             tumor which prevent safe filter implantation.

          -  All patients with an IVC diameter which precludes oversizing of the filter platform.

          -  All patients with active infection / bacteremia.

          -  All patients with sensitivity to contrast media.

          -  Uncorrectable severe coagulopathy (e.g., patients with liver or multisystem failure).
