      The goal of this study is to evaluate autologous MSCs as an alternative for antibody
      induction therapy in renal transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal transplantation is the most common and successful type of organ transplantation.
      Induction therapy with antibody plus the maintenance immunosuppressive agents have greatly
      improved graft survival in renal transplantation. Since mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs)have been
      used successfully to treat graft versus host disease and show immune modulation function both
      in vitro and in vivo and may help in repairing damaged tissue(s), we evaluate autologous MSCs
      as an alternative for antibody induction therapy. Moreover, we examine if MSCs could improve
      the recovery of early function in transplanted kidney.

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients in Group A will receive MSCs instead of anti-interleukin 2 receptor antibody for induction therapy. The first MSCs infusion intravenously will be right at releasing renal artery clamp to establish allograft blood flow and the second infusion of MSCs will be performed two weeks after transplantation. Patients will receive standard regular immunosuppressive agents including calcineurin inhibitor, glucocorticoid, and MMF.</description>

    <description>Patients in Group B will receive MSCs instead of anti-interleukin 2 receptor antibody for induction therapy. The first MSCs infusion intravenously will be right at releasing renal artery clamp to establish allograft blood flow and the second infusion of MSCs will be performed two weeks after transplantation. Patients will receive 80% less of calcineurin inhibitor than in Group A. Other immunosuppressive agents such as glucocorticoid and MMF remained the same doses as in Group A.</description>

        trial, but must be willing to reside in the area, or within a four hour drive, for the
        first three months of the protocol so that we can monitor them closely in the early post
