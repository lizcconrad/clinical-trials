  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We evaluate two new developed airway devices, which provide patent airway during general
      anesthesia. In 60 patients undergoing elective general anesthesia, we will simulate a
      difficult airway by using an extrication device collar). We then place consecutively both
      airway devices in the mouth and check for ease of insertion and time used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The LMA Supreme™ and the I-gel™ are both new developed supraglottic airway devices to provide
      patent airways during general anesthesia. So far, prospective randomized controlled trials
      comparing their performance are not yet published. Both devices can be used in difficult
      airway situations, pre-hospital and in the hospital. In this prospective, randomized,
      controlled cross-over trial, we are going to evaluate the performance of both devices in a
      simulated difficult airway scenario using an extrication collar to limit both mouth opening
      and neck movement. In a maximum total of 60 patients undergoing elective surgery, we will
      place both airway devices consecutively and ventilate the patients. First attempt success
      rate and time to success will be recorded. Secondary outcomes include oropharyngeal pressure
      leak, ease of gastric catheter insertion, adverse events and side effects. Our hypothesis is
      that no difference exists between the two devices. Our 0-hypothesis is that there is a
      difference
