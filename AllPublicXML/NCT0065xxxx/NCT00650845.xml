    <textblock>
      Although there is a well documented risk of acute renal failure with the iodinated contrast
      agents, the implication of intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agents in nephrotoxicity
      remains controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety profile of gadoterate
      meglumine (Dotarem®) in patients with chronic renal insufficiency by evaluating the rate of
      patients experiencing contrast-induced nephrotoxicity following the injection of gadoterate
      meglumine.

      Patients with renal insufficiency not requiring hemodialysis and scheduled to undergo a
      contrast enhanced MRI or unenhanced MRI examination to specify a diagnosis, were selected for
      inclusion. Two groups of patients were defined on the basis of the planned imaging procedure
      selected to obtain a diagnosis: those undergoing a Dotarem®-enhanced MRI and those undergoing
      an unenhanced MRI.

      A clinically significant increase in serum creatinine levels after the contrast-enhanced MRI
      exam was used as an indication of contrast induced nephrotoxicity. A blood test was performed
      24h before the MRI in order to evaluate baseline creatinine values. 72h after the exam, a
      second blood test was performed. An increase in creatinemia above 25% from baseline levels
      was defined as a contrast-induced nephrotoxic reaction. The primary endpoint of the study
      assessed the percentage of patients presenting a contrast-induced nephrotoxic reaction in
      order to show a non inferiority of enhanced as compared to non-enhanced MRI exams.

A total of 142 patients were screened between 29 January 2008 and 05 May 2011, 135 of whom were included in 15 European centers, eight centers in France, three in Belgium, two in Spain and two in Italy.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>10 patients were screened but did not undergo the planned procedure: 7 were screen failures and 3 were included but dropped out prior to undergoing the planned procedure.

          <population>Per protocol population. This population is comprised of the full analysis set population (i.e. all included patients with a pre and post-procedure blood sample for creatinine measurement) deprived of patients with protocol deviations/violations.</population>
