  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether S-1 is effective as 2nd line therapy in
      slowing tumor activity in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who have previously
      received 1st line treatment with a gemcitabine regimen. The study is also looking at the
      safety of S-1.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic pancreatic cancer is relatively unresponsive to chemotherapy. This is true for the
      nucleoside analogue gemcitabine, with a response rate of approximately 10%, as well as for
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Even when gemcitabine is combined with other chemotherapeutic drugs or
      biological agents, the overall tumor response rate remains basically unchanged. S-1 is a new
      generation oral fluoropyrimidine that combines Tegafur
      (5-fluoro-1-(tetrahydro-2-furanyl)-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione [FT]), an oral prodrug of 5-FU,
      with two modulators, Gimeracil (5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine [CDHP]), which inhibits 5-FU
      degradation by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) inhibition, and Oteracil potassium
      (Oxo), which inhibits 5-FU phosphorylation in the digestive tract. This combination of 3
      compounds is designed to achieve enhanced antitumor activity while decreasing
      gastrointestinal toxicity.

               2. Radiation therapy to a target lesion unless there was evidence of PD after
                  radiotherapy (and this target lesion must not be the only site of measurable
                  disease).

               3. Any radiotherapy within the previous 3 weeks.

               4. Any investigational agent received either concurrently or within the last 30

                  III or IV), angina pectoris, arrhythmias, or hypertension.

               2. Active infection.

               3. Known (at time of entry) gastrointestinal disorder, including malabsorption,
                  chronic nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, present to the extent that it might
                  interfere with oral intake and absorption of study medication.

                  abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
                  study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study
                  results, and in the judgment of the Investigator would make the patient
                  inappropriate for entry into this study.

                  8. Is receiving a concomitant treatment with drugs interacting with S-1. The
                  following drugs are prohibited because there may be an interaction with S-1:

               1. Sorivudine, uracil, cimetidine, folinic acid, and dipyridamole (may enhance S-1
                  activity).

               2. Allopurinol (may diminish S-1 activity).

               3. Phenytoin (S-1 may enhance phenytoin activity).

               4. Flucytosine, a fluorinated pyrimidine antifungal agent (may enhance S-1 and
                  flucytosine activity).

                  9. Is a pregnant or lactating female. 10. Has known sensitivity to 5-FU. 11. Is a
                  patient with reproductive potential who refuses to use an adequate means of
