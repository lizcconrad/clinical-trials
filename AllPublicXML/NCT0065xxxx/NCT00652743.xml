  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, the leading contender for the next influenza pandemic is H5N1, a strain of avian virus
      found primarily in domestic and wild birds. Experts warn that the next influenza pandemic is
      imminent and could be severe. Prevention and control will depend on the rapid production and
      worldwide distribution of specific pandemic vaccines. Candidate 'pandemic-like' vaccines must
      be developed and tested in clinical trials to determine the best formulation and vaccination
      schedule.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the immune response of a candidate pandemic vaccine.
      The protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the secondary phase of this
      study. The objectives and outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate
      protocol posting (NCT number = 00449670).
