      A multi-center, single-arm, open-label, non-comparative study to describe the clinical
      efficacy of CUBICIN therapy in patients with superficial and deep post-surgical Gram-positive
      wound infections. Adjunctive treatment with aztreonam and/or metronidazole could be given for
      Gram-negative and/or anaerobic organisms. Patients are to be treated for a period of 7-14
      days as specified in the package insert. An evaluation is to be performed on the day CUBICIN
      treatment is completed (assessment for outcome of cure, improved, failure or unable to
      evaluate). A follow-up is required for patients with an Investigator response of 'Improved'
      at the end of treatment.
