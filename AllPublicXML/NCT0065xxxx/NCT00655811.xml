  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study how people respond differently to capsaicin in
      different racial groups and the effect it has on your pain levels. Capsaicin is a natural
      product made from hot chili peppers that is useful for treating the itch symptoms of skin
      disease.

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is to test the burning pain effect of topical capsaicin by using an continuous visual analog scale (CoVAS) intensity scale as an outcome measure. Participants will rate burning pain intensity after topical capsaicin application. The burning or pain sensation intensity was recorded continuously on a 100-mm COVAS (0, no sensation to 100, maximum, strongest imaginable pain sensation). The subjects were also asked to indicate whether they experienced any nonpainful sensation.</description>

    <measure>Ethnic Differences on the Effects of Topical Capsaicin on Thermal Sensory Thermal Thresholds</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary endpoint is to see if topical capsaicin has an effect on warm and heat pain thresholds. Quantitative thermosensory testing was carried out using the Medoc TSA 2001 (Medoc Ltd). The probe baseline temperature was 32 °C and the contact area was 12 cm2. The probe warmed the skin surface at a linear rate of 0·4 °C per second, up to a cut-off of 50 °C. Thermal thresholds were measured in the following order: warmth sensation threshold was measured followed by heat pain detection threshold; each of them was determined four times by the ascending method of limits.</description>

    <description>This secondary outcome is to see if subjects rated burning/pain differently between the topical capsaicin or placebo application. Participants will rate burning/pain intensity after topical capsaicin and placebo application. The burning/pain sensation intensity was recorded continuously on a 100-mm COVAS (0, no sensation to 100, maximum, strongest imaginable burning/pain sensation). The subjects were also asked to indicate whether they experienced any non-burning/-painful sensation.</description>

A volume of 0·3 mL cream was applied in a thin layer of virtually equal thickness, on a 4 × 4 cm area, around midline. The creams were applied at a 40-min interval in a random order to minimize an order effect. The creams were randomized for right and left arm application.</description>

          <title>Ethnic Differences in Burning Pain Induced by Topical Capsaicin</title>
          <description>The primary endpoint is to test the burning pain effect of topical capsaicin by using an continuous visual analog scale (CoVAS) intensity scale as an outcome measure. Participants will rate burning pain intensity after topical capsaicin application. The burning or pain sensation intensity was recorded continuously on a 100-mm COVAS (0, no sensation to 100, maximum, strongest imaginable pain sensation). The subjects were also asked to indicate whether they experienced any nonpainful sensation.</description>

        <title>Ethnic Differences on the Effects of Topical Capsaicin on Thermal Sensory Thermal Thresholds</title>
        <description>A secondary endpoint is to see if topical capsaicin has an effect on warm and heat pain thresholds. Quantitative thermosensory testing was carried out using the Medoc TSA 2001 (Medoc Ltd). The probe baseline temperature was 32 °C and the contact area was 12 cm2. The probe warmed the skin surface at a linear rate of 0·4 °C per second, up to a cut-off of 50 °C. Thermal thresholds were measured in the following order: warmth sensation threshold was measured followed by heat pain detection threshold; each of them was determined four times by the ascending method of limits.</description>
