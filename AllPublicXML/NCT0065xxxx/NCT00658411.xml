  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research study is to determine the safety and feasibility of chelation
      therapy with deferoxamine for patients with iron overload who are receiving a stem cell
      transplant. Patients who have iron overload prior to stem cell transplantation may have more
      toxicity from the transplantation procedure, and thus may benefit from an attempt at iron
      chelation pre- and peri-transplantation. In this study we are examining the use of
      deferoxamine starting 2 weeks to 3 months prior to transplantation and continuing through the
      preparative regimen.

    <description>All patients meeting the criteria for Severe iron overload as defined by BOTH:
ferritin ≥ 1000 ng/ml and liver iron content(LIC) ≥ 5 mg/gdw were enrolled and received chelation therapy with Deferoxamine. All patients who received chelation therapy were monitored for grade 3 or above toxicity Attributable to Deferoxamine(grades defined by the CTCAE Version 3). The number of participants with grade 3 or higher toxicities were measured and used to determine the safety of chelation therapy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Histologically confirmed acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or
             myelodysplastic syndrome

             of donor availability) and Liver iron content estimated greater than or equal to 5mg/g
             dry weight by MRI (at the time of donor availability)

          -  Patients with a history of prior autologous transplantation will be eligible for this
             study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pre-existing clinically apparent retinal neuropathy. If patients have clinically
             apparent visual loss at the time of screening, they will be excluded if either they
             have known retinal neuropathy or if this cannot be excluded by further testing

          -  Pre-existing clinically apparent sensorineural hearing loss. If patients have auditory
             loss at the time of screening, they will be excluded if either they have known
             sensorineural hearing loss, or if this cannot be excluded by further testing

          -  Pregnancy or inability or unwillingness to use contraception during the time of the
             study

          -  Lactating patients
