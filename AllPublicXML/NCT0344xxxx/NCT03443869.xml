  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of letermovir (LET) versus
      valganciclovir (VGCV) in preventing CMV disease in adult kidney transplant recipients. The
      primary hypotheses are that LET is non-inferior to VGCV; and if non-inferiority is
      demonstrated, that LET is superior to VGCV, in preventing CMV disease through 52 weeks
      post-transplant.
