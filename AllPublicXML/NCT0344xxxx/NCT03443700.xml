  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recent introduction of robotics for locomotor training in paraplegic patients, and in
      particular the use of anthropomorphic exoskeletons, has opened new frontiers in
      rehabilitation. Existing literature, though encouraging, is still scarce and studies
      demonstrating efficacy are highly heterogeneous and have a small sample size. Evidence is
      also needed about cortical plasticity after SCI, in conjunction with the use of innovative
      rehabilitation devices, through indicators like neurophysiological and neuroradiological
      markers, as the knowledge of such mechanisms is crucial to improve clinical outcomes.
      Cortical circuits controlling prosthetic devices are different from those controlling normal
      parts of the body and remodeling mechanisms following prosthetic use have been documented,
      but in conditions other than SCI.

      The aims of this randomized controlled trial, with a 2-arm parallel-group design, are:

        1. to evaluate and quantify the efficacy of locomotor rehabilitation with a robotic
           anthropomorphic exoskeleton (EKSO-GT) in terms of clinical and functional outcomes, and
           the persistence of such efficacy;

        2. to investigate the presence and persistence of brain neuronal plasticity and cortical
           remodeling mechanisms underlying the robotic rehabilitation approach.

      Forty patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to 2 treatment arms. Both groups will
      follow a program of standard locomotor rehabilitation for 8 weeks. One group will also
      undergo an overground locomotor training with the EKSO-GT during the first 4 weeks.

      The increasing incidence of incomplete Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) has raised new rehabilitation
      challenges. Recovery of walking is one of the top priorities in SCI persons and growing
      efforts have been pursued aimed at identifying effective alternative techniques for improving
      gait performance.

      Standard rehabilitation approach has been so far the most widely used, but the recent
      introduction of anthropomorphic exoskeletons may open new frontiers in the field.
      Anthropomorphic exoskeletons have been developed to assist SCI patients with mobility, but
      there is also a certain optimism that they may have potentialities to improve walking
      patterns of incomplete SCI persons after a rehabilitation period with such devices is
      terminated. So far, however, while different systematic reviews and meta-analyses have
      reported on the safety of the training with such exoskeletons, there are no significant
      studies on its efficacy. Along with this, central mechanisms underlying the anatomical and
      functional changes induced by these approaches have never been investigated in SCI.

      This longitudinal randomized controlled trial, with a 2-arm parallel group design, aims at
      evaluating the efficacy of the training with an anthropomorphic, robotized exoskeleton
      (EKSO-GT, by Ekso Bionics), as &quot;add-on&quot; to the standard locomotor rehabilitation, in
      improving walking performance, when compared to the standard locomotor rehabilitation alone,
      in a population of patients with non-acute motor incomplete SCI. Along with this and other
      clinical outcomes, neurophysiological and structural markers of Central Nervous System (CNS)
      plasticity will be explored, aimed at capturing mechanisms underlying how anthropomorphic
      exoskeletons affect CNS plasticity.

      Forty patients will be recruited in a rehabilitation hospital setting and assigned to 2
      groups, with an allocation ratio of 1:1, through a block randomization approach. One group
      will perform a 4-week standard locomotor training (sLT) alone, while the other will perform a
      4-week period sLT plus a training with the EKSO-GT (sLT + EX-T). Afterwards, both groups will
      undergo a further 4-week sLT alone.

      Patients will be evaluated at several time points (always when the exoskeleton is not worn):
      clinical outcomes will be assessed by means of clinical examinations, standardized tests and
      validated scales; neurophysiological modulations will be evaluated by means of paired Motor
      and Sensory Evoked Potentials and a study of Electroencephalographic (EEG) slow waves
      oscillations during sleep; anatomical and structural cortical modifications will be studied
      with brain functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).

      It is expected that the overground locomotor training with a new-generation exoskeleton, as
      &quot;add-on&quot; to standard locomotor training, can further improve clinical outcomes (especially
      walking performance) in the studied population, and that such clinical improvements are
      underlined by mechanisms modulating synaptic plasticity occurring also at the CNS level.
