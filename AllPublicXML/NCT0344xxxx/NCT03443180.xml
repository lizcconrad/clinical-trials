  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Siblings of those with type 1 diabetes are at an increased risk of developing the disease
      themselves. Through prior research, the investigators have found that siblings as well as
      those with type 1 diabetes have a general level of inflammation in the body. The
      investigators are examining the role that diet plays in this level of inflammation by asking
      siblings of children with type 1 diabetes to go on a gluten and Amylase Trypsin Inhibitors
      (ATI)-free diet for 4 weeks. Blood and stool samples will be measured before the diet, after
      the diet is completed and again 4 weeks after participants resume their normal diet.

    <intervention_model_description>All subjects will receive a dietary intervention. They will be instructed and asked to follow a diet free of gluten and the protein amylase trypsin inhibitors (ATI), which is frequently found in gluten-containing foods, for four weeks. They will then be asked to resume their normal diet.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in the plasma-induced transcriptional assay</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years (study duration)</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will measure the participants overall immune inflammation and regulation by a plasma-induced transcriptional bioassay. The change in this bioassay will be determined for each subject and the entire group both before and after the dietary intervention. This bioassay informs the investigators of which genes may be positively or negatively impacted by this dietary change and whether the removal of gluten and amylase trypsin inhibitors (ATI) affects a participant's immune state.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stool microbial composition</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years (study duration)</time_frame>
    <description>Stool samples will be collected both before and after the dietary intervention to determine if the removal of gluten and amylase trypsin inhibitors (ATI) from the diet affects the composition and density of the stool microbiota</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma microbial antigen detection</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years (study duration)</time_frame>
    <description>Microbial antigen levels in the plasma of participants will be assayed both before and after the dietary intervention. Systemic microbial antigens are a marker of intestinal permeability so this measure will tell the investigators if the removal of gluten and amylase trypsin inhibitors (ATI) affects the degree of intestinal permeability/leakiness.</description>
