    <textblock>
      As one of the essential micronutrients, selenium has important biological functions. However,
      an effective and convenient method for evaluation of selenium nutritional status has not yet
      been established. Previous literature has disclosed effect of selenium deficiency on
      inactivating glutathion peroxidase and deiodinase, which may cause decreased conversion from
      thyroxine ( T4) to triiodothyronine (T3). A case-control study is designed to demonstrate the
      association between selenium deficiency and abnormally elevated T4 or T4/T3, which may
      provide more clues for establishing effective selenium assesment methods.
