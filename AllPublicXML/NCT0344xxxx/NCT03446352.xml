  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of present study is to analyze and compare the effect of two exercise programs -
      psychomotor exercise program vs exercise combined program (psychomotor + whole body
      vibration) - on risk factors for falls and falls occurrence of community-dwelling older
      adults who are fallers or are &quot;at high risk of falling&quot;.

      This experimental study is a randomized controlled trial. The program will run for 16 weeks
      (3 sessions / week of 75 minutes), followed by 8 weeks of follow-up without intervention.
      Participants will be assessed 1) at baseline, 2) at the end of the program, and 3) after the
      follow-up. Participants will be randomly allocated to three groups: experimental group 1
      (psychomotor program); experimental group 2 (combined program) and control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aging is associated with a decline in executive functions, negatively influencing the motor,
      social and emotional capacities of older adults. (1) These losses will contribute to increase
      the risk of falling, so much that most falls occur during the performance of a dual-task (DT)
      (2).

      The lack of balance, strength and poor body composition are seen as causes of falls, and
      should therefore be considered in the prevention programs of these events in older adults.
      (3-5) A psychomotor exercise program uses the body and movement as mediators, relying on the
      prevention of cognitive, sensory, perceptive, emotional and affective deterioration,
      exploring the neuroplasticity. (6,7) Therefore, this sensorimotor and neurocognitive program
      may prevent falls, but it is important to analyze its real impact in reducing either falls or
      the risk factors for falls in the older adults. No studies focusing on this subject were
      found.

      The intervention through the whole body vibration (WBV) is referred in the literature as
      promoting the improvement of balance, mobility and agility, and preventing falls in the older
      adults.(8,9) WBV will have long-term therapeutic effects promoting the increase of muscle
      strength and increased bone mineral density. (10) Being two intervention methods with
      potential good results on falls prevention, it is not known whether there will be additional
      benefits in an intervention that combines both methods.

    <description>Each session includes: beginning ritual (5 min), warm-up (15 min), main section comprising the multimodal exercises (40 min), cool-down (10 min), and finishing ritual (5 min).
At the initial stage, the activation of different muscle groups will be performed, providing an elevation of the neurophysiological parameters. The main section (multimodal exercises) will be focused on the specific objectives through sensorimotor and neurocognitive activities. This section includes periods ranging 10-15 min of exercises mainly focused on motor stimulation- physical performance (cardiovascular, strength, balance, flexibility, agility and movement accuracy)- alternating with exercises mainly focused on cognitive stimulation- executive functions (planning ability, information processing speed, attention and dual-task performance).
At the cool-down the participants will normalize their physiological parameters. Finally, at the finishing ritual the participants share their sensations experienced.</description>
