  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a collaborative care intervention in reducing depression, fatigue and
      pain symptoms and improving health related quality of life in hemodialysis patients. Half of
      participants will receive the collaborative care intervention, while the other half will
      receive technology delivered health education information.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      End-stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis experience substantial symptom burden with
      fatigue, pain and depression among the most debilitating and existing as symptom clusters.
      These symptom clusters can exacerbate one another, and are independent and strong predictors
      of poor health-related quality of life in hemodialysis patients. This study will look at the
      effect of a 12 week stepped care intervention on changes in depression, pain or fatigue and
      health related quality of life.
