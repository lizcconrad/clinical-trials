  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether or not certain risk factors and patient
      characteristics are linked with and possibly can predict the development of chronic pain
      after lumbar spine surgery.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical pain severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). The BPI scores are a numerical rating scale and range from 0 to 10. A score of 0 is equal to no pain and a score of 10 is equal to pain as bad as you can imagine.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS measures to be included are Depression, Anxiety, Physical Functioning, Fatigue, Sleep Impairment, Emotional Support, and Social Participation. Each questionnaire usually has 4-16 response options ranging in value from one to five. The total raw score for a short form with all questions answered is the sum of the values of the response to each question. The total range of potential raw scores depends on the number of questions being asked, for example, a 6 item form would have a range from is 6 to 30. After the raw score is calculated, a T-score metric is used to convert the raw score to a T-score. On the T-score metric, a score of 50 is the mean of a relevant reference population and 10 is the standard deviation of that mean. For PROMIS measures, higher scores equals &quot;more of the concept being measured&quot;, this could be a desirable or undesirable outcome, depending on the concept being measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index will be used to assess low back pain. There are 10 sections on the index. Each section has a possible score of 5. The total possible range of scores is 0 to 50. A score of 0 indicates no pain. A score of 50 indicates the person is bed-bound or exaggerating their symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>2011 Fibromyalgia Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>A measure of symptom severity in fibromyalgia. There is a total range of scores from 0 to 31. The higher the score the more severe a person's symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Magnetic Resonance Imaging - Brain Regions and Pain Processing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A subgroup of patients enrolled will also undergo four different neuroimaging procedures (all in one visit) to identify brain regions and associated neurotransmitters operative in pain processing and modulation.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) - Pressure pain sensitivity by Algometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure pain sensitivity is measured by Algometry (measured at the trapezius and lumbar spine). It yields a pressure pain threshold value measured in kPA.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) - Pressure pain sensitivity by Multimodal Automated Sensory Testing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure pain sensitivity is measured by the Multimodal Automated Sensory Testing (MAST) System (measured at the thumbnail). It yields a pressure pain threshold value measured in kg/cm2.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) - Cuff Algometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Cuff Algometry as measured by a rapid cuff inflator (measured at the gastrocnemius muscle). It yields a deep pressure pain threshold as measured in mmHg.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) - Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Post-stimulus test at Baseline visit to Pre-stimlus test at Baseline visit</time_frame>
    <description>Conditioned Pain Modulation as measured at the thumbnail using the MAST. It yields a numerical pain rating difference on a 0-100 numerical scale that can either be positive or negative called CPM magnitude. CPM magnitude will be calculated as the difference (post-pre) in the mean of the three pain ratings given to the test stimulus prior to the conditioning stimuli and the three pain ratings of the test stimulus given during the conditioning stimuli. A reduction in test stimulus rating by conditioning stimulation implies functional (inhibitory) CPM, and the degree of reduction expresses the efficiency of CPM.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Wind Up Ratio (WUR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Temporal Summation as measured at the forearm and the lumbar spine using a PinPrick Algometer. It yields a numerical pain rating score from 0-100 numerical scale that will then be used to calculate the Wind Up Ratio (WUR) which is the mean pain rating of three stimulus trains divided by the mean pain rating of a single stimuli. A WUR &gt;1 indicates temporal summation.</description>
