  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
      on patients with clinically stable bronchiectasis by a multi-center, randomized,
      double-blind, controlled trial: one, TCM treatments based on syndrome differentiation; the
      other, a placebo of TCM treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is a common and frequently occurring respiratory disease, with more
      hospitalization rate and mortality, poor quality of life and heavy financial burden. The main
      clinical manifestations are persistent or recurrent cough, expectoration, sometimes
      accompanied by hemoptysis, which can cause respiratory dysfunction and chronic pulmonary
      heart disease. There are some randomized controlled trials of TCM for bronchiectasis, and
      have the effect in the treatment of bronchiectasis, reducing the number of acute aggravation
      and alleviating dyspnea. However, some TCM interventions lack comprehensive syndrome
      differentiation and the placebo control.

      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to compare the efficacy to
      evaluate the effectiveness of TCM on patients with clinically stable bronchiectasis. 216
      subjects will be randomly assigned to one therapies (TCM treatments based on syndrome
      differentiation) and the other therapy (placebo of TCM treatment) for 24 weeks. After the
      treatment period, the subjects will be followed up for 24 weeks. The primary outcomes include
      the frequency of bronchiectasis exacerbation, and the secondary outcomes include quality of
      life (SGRQ, LCQ, QOL-B), pulmonary function, safety observation index.

    <description>Patients in this group will receive two types of TCM treatment, which are Bufei Huatan granule, Yifei Qinghua granule. The herbal extract twice daily for 24 weeks for lower dosage. The two granules are corresponding to the two traditional Chinese syndromes in sequence, which are syndrome of qi deficiency of lung and phlegm-turbidity obstructing the lung, Qi and Yin deficiency of the lung and the phlegm-heat obstructing the lung.</description>
