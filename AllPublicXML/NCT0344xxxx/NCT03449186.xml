  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate salivary and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) levels
      of IL-17A, IL-17E, IL-6 AND IL-23 during 2/3 trimester of pregnancy and after delivery.

    <textblock>
      IL-17 have a synergytic effect with IL-6 and IL-23. IL-17A levels elevated with periodontal
      diseases. Many systemical chronic conditions such as atherosclerosis and cardiovascular
      disease, pregnancy may contribute increasing of IL-17 family cytokine.
