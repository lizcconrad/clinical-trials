    <textblock>
      Introduction COPD and Asthma affect more than 10% of the population. Most patients use their
      inhaler incorrectly, mainly the elderly, thereby becoming more susceptible to poor clinical
      control and exacerbations. Placebo device training is regarded as one of the best teaching
      methods, but there is scarce evidence to support it as the most effective one to improve
      major clinical outcomes. Our objective is to perform a single-blinded RCT to assess the
      impact of this education tool in these patients.

      Methods and Analysis A multicentre single-blinded RCT will be set, comparing a placebo-device
      training programme versus usual care, with a one-year follow-up, in elderly patients with
      Asthma or COPD. Intervention will be provided at baseline, and after 3 and 6 months, with
      interim analysis at an intermediate time point. Exacerbation rates were set as primary
      outcomes, and quality of life, adherence rates, clinical control and respiratory function
      were chosen as secondary outcomes. A sample size of 146 participants (73 in each arm) was
      estimated as adequate to detect a 50% reduction in event rates. Two-sample proportions
      Chi-squared test will be used to study primary outcome and subgroup analysis will be carried
      out according to major baseline characteristics.

      Discussion The investigators expect to confirm that inhaler performance education will
      significantly reduce exacerbation rate and improve clinical and functional control.

      Ethics and dissemination:

      Every participant will sign a consent form. A Data Safety Monitoring Board will be set up to
      evaluate data throughout the study and to monitor stop earlier criteria. Identity of all
      participants will be protected. Results will be presented in scientific meeting and published
      in peer-reviewed journals.

    <description>This outcome will be quantifyed as &quot;time to event&quot;
For Asthma, an event will be defined as increased respiratory clinical symptoms leading the patient to search for medical care, and resulting in any of the following:
Need for increased inhaled corticosteroid dose of at least 4x the regular dose
Need for increase of short-acting β2 agonists on a daily basis
Need for oral corticosteroids
Need for oral antibiotics
Hospitalization or Emergency Room (ER) visit with increased respiratory clinical symptoms.
For COPD, an event will be defined as increased respiratory clinical symptoms inducing the patient to search for medical care, and resulting in any of the following:
Need for increase of long-acting β2 agonists on a daily basis
Need for oral corticosteroids
Need for oral antibiotics
Hospitalization or ER visit with increased respiratory clinical symptoms. Respiratory-related mortality and all-cause mortality will also be considered an adverse event.</description>

    <description>This group will receive a structured and regular follow-up plan, with education on inhaler technique. Patients will be trained by a Family Doctor (the primary investigator) in terms of the inhaler technique using placebo devices similar to their own devices. A teach-to-goal approach will be used, repeating all correct steps as many times as needed in order for patients to perform them correctly at each evaluation. There will be visits at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 months to assess outcomes. In each visit, and prior to the main intervention with the primary investigator, assessment of the inhaler technique and application of all questionnaires (clinical control, treatment adhesion and quality of life) will be performed by a secondary blinded investigator.</description>

    <description>This group will receive usual care from their own Family doctors, with no specific intervention. Each doctor will perform the necessary consultations according to his real life judgment. Besides this, this group will perform visits at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 months to assess secondary outcomes. At each visit, assessment of the inhaler technique and application of all questionnaires (clinical control, treatment adhesion and quality of life) will be performed by a secondary blinded investigator. At any appointment, if the patient asks for or if the clinician decides to teach inhaler technique, that will be recorded.
If any adjustments are made in drug classes or device types in every participants, this information will be recorded.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of COPD or Asthma, medicated with any kind of inhaler device
             (pressurized Metered Dose Inhaler (pMDI) with or without Spacer, Dry Powder Inhaler
             (DPI) or Soft Mist), aged ≥65 years and being a regular user of primary health care
             services (defined as having at least one consultation performed in the last two years
             with his/her own Family Doctor). In order to minimize diagnostic inaccuracy, Asthma
             and COPD diagnosis will be reviewed in every participant at baseline prior to
             enrolment and according to GINA and GOLD strategies.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe or acute illness (such as unstable cardiovascular status, unstable angina,
             recent myocardial infarction (within one month) or pulmonary embolism, haemoptysis of
             unknown origin, recent pneumothorax (within one month), recent thoracic, abdominal or
             eye surgery (within one month), acute nausea or vomiting, severe respiratory distress,
             dementia). Patients with intermittent asthma, as well as COPD patients with mild
             obstruction (GOLD class I) will be excluded, since these patients do not need to take
             inhaler medication on a daily basis, and tend to have a low frequency of disease
             exacerbations.
