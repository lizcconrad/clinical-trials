      To investigate the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab with panitumumab in subjects with
      unresectable, refractory, KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type, microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic
      colorectal cancer.

      The investigators will conduct a single-arm, open-label Phase II clinical trial investigating
      the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab with panitumumab in subjects with unresectable,
      refractory, KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type, microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal
      cancer (mCRC). There will be an initial safety lead-in cohort to ensure the combination is
      well-tolerated. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the overall response rate
      in these subjects at 12 weeks . Secondary objectives include the following: estimating the
      overall response rate in these subjects at 12 weeks by immune-related RECIST criteria
      (irRECIST), estimating the best response rate by both RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST criteria,
      estimating progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response using both RECIST 1.1 and
      irRECIST criteria, estimating overall survival (OS), and characterizing the safety issues
      associated with this regimen. Exploratory objectives involve investigating various biomarkers
      and peripheral blood and tumor assays.

         11. Any major surgery, extensive radiotherapy, chemotherapy with clinically significant
             delayed toxicity, biologic therapy, or immunotherapy within 21 days prior to
             randomization and/or daily or weekly chemotherapy without the potential for delayed
             toxicity within 14 days prior to randomization.

         12. Known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs
             chemically related to study drug.

         14. Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment in the past 3 months (for
             example with disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs).
             Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement
             therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of
             systemic treatment. Subjects with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be
             an exception to this rule. Subjects that require intermittent use of bronchodilators,
             local steroid injections, or inhaled or topical steroids would not be excluded from
             the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjogren's
             syndrome will not be excluded from the study.

         15. Active infection requiring intravenous systemic therapy.
