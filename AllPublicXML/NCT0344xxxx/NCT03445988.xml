  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will fill several critical gaps in evidence that are preventing patients
      and physicians from making informed decisions about their pain care. This project will
      provide patients taking opioids and physicians with the specific evidence they need to choose
      the most effective route to pain control, reduced pain interference, opioid reduction, and
      improved role function, thereby improving patient care.

      The aims of this study are to (1) reduce or contain prescription opioid use while maintaining
      pain control and (2) compare the effectiveness of the Chronic Pain Self-Management Program
      (CPSMP), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for chronic pain (pain-CBT), and no behavioral
      treatment within the context of patient-centered collaborative opioid tapering (Taper Only).

    <description>A trained psychologist delivers pain-CBT to individual patients or groups of patients with chronic pain. Group treatment is delivered across 8 weekly sessions that last for 2 hours each. Pain-CBT incorporates interactive discussion, practice of relaxation training, action planning, and home exercises into each session. Pain-CBT is effective for reducing pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, depression and social impacts.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The CPSMP is similar to pain-CBT in format and content but is peer-led, and is effective across pain conditions (e.g., back pain, arthritis) for improving pain and pain self-efficacy. The CPSMP consists of six weekly 2-hour group sessions in which two peer co-leaders provide patient education about pain, effective self-management, pain impacts, and other symptoms from a highly structured manual. Peers are people with chronic pain who live in the communities in which they teach. For this project, at least one peer facilitator per workshop will have had experience with prescription opioid use. Intervention fidelity is determined by having a trained observer with a checklist attend random workshop sessions. Similar to pain-CBT, CPSMP incorporates interactive discussion, practice of relaxation training, action planning, and home exercises into each session.</description>
