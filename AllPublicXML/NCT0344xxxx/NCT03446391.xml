  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate postoperative knee function after total knee
      arthroplasty performed according to the anatomical alignment and compare these results to
      those of a matched historical cohort of patients operated with mechanical alignment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 25 patients, of the Kinematic group, are prospectively enrolled. While, the data of
      patients of the Mechanical group, are retrospectively collected from an historical
      collection.

    <measure>Compare clinical outcomes of mechanical vs kinematic with new Knee Society Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The new KSS (from the publication of 2011, Giles R. Scuderi MD &quot;The New Knee Society Knee Scoring System&quot; Clin Orthop Relat Res (2012) 470:3-19) includes a part filled by the surgeon and one by the patient. The first outcome is focused on the &quot;Functional Activities&quot; subscore, excluding the &quot;Discretionary knee activities&quot;. The maximum is 85 points while the minimum is -10 points. The &quot;Functional Activities&quot; score includes 3 subscores: WALKING AND STANDING (min -10, max 30), STANDARD ACTIVITIES (min 0, max 30) and ADVANCED ACTIVITIES (min 0, max 25)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient functional improvement, satisfaction and symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>1-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The functional improvement, satisfaction and symptoms is the sum of the following subscores of the new KSS: &quot;Functional Activities&quot;, &quot;Patient Satisfaction&quot; and &quot;Symptoms&quot;</description>

    <description>The principle for kinematically aligning the femoral component is to remove the correct amount of bone and cartilage from the distal and posterior femur after accounting for wear and saw blade kerf, so that the total thickness of the missing and removed tissue matches the thickness of the femoral component.</description>
