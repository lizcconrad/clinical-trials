    <textblock>
      Apixaban is a direct anticoagulant, which inhibits the factor Xa. Its clinical efficiency in
      prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF (non/valvular atrial
      fibrillation) was demonstrated as well as has shown better safety profile compared with
      warfarin. A Drug Utilization study will evaluate whether this drug has been used in
      accordance with the approved indication and recommendations described in the summary of
      product characteristics (SmPC) and estimate possible misuse or overuse apixaban.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary research question is to evaluate the apixaban utilization according to the
      approved SPAF indication and recommendations by EMA.

      In addition a comparison with a cohort of NVAF patients treated with VKA, dabigatran and
      rivaroxaban for the SPAF indication will also be performed.

      Objective 1: To characterize patients using apixaban according to demographics, comorbidity,
      risk of thromboembolic events (CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-Vasc scores), risk of bleeding events
      (HAS-BLED score), comedications and compare it with the profile of patients treated with VKA,
      dabigatran and rivaroxaban.

      Objective 2: Describe the level of appropriate usage according to the posology recommended in
      the apixaban SmPC.

      Objective 3: Describe the potential interactions with other drugs prescribed concomintatly
      according with the SmPC recommendations.

      Objective 4: Estimate the level of apixaban adherence by the medication possession ratio
      (MPR) and discontinuation rates and compare it with VKA, dabigatran and rivaroxaban cohort.

      Objective 5: To analyze INR (International Normalized Ratio) values during the last 12 months
      and to obtain TTR (Time in Therapeutic Range) values in patients previously treated with VKA,
      and during the whole study period for those in the cohort treated with VKA.

    <time_frame>Up to 12 months prior to enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Risk of bleeding events was assessed by using HAS-BLED score. HAS-BLED was a scoring system that was developed to assess 1 year risk of occurrence of major hemorrhage. HAS-BLED score was assessed by combining score of 9 risk factors: hypertension history, renal disease, liver disease, stroke history, prior major bleeding or predisposition to bleeding, labile international normalized ratio (INR), age &gt;65 years, medication usage predisposing to bleeding and alcohol or drug usage history.</description>

    <description>Thromboembolic events were defined as an embolic stroke that occurred when a blood clot that formed elsewhere in the body breaks loose and travels to the brain via bloodstream. Risk of thromboembolic events was calculated using CHADS2 score. CHADS2 score was assessed by combining score of 5 risk factors (congestive heart failure history, hypertension history, age &gt;=75 years, diabetes mellitus history and stroke/transient ischemic attack symptoms previously).</description>
