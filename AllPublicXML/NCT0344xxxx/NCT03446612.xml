  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Daprodustat has demonstrated an ability to effectively raise hemoglobin concentrations with
      lower EPO levels than those observed after administration of rhEPOs. Therefore, daprodustat
      has the potential to treat anemia of CKD with a lower CV risk than is observed with the
      rhEPOs. While the effect of rhEPOs on endothelial function has been assessed, to date the
      effect of daprodustat or other prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (PHI) compounds on endothelial
      function has not. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare the effect of
      daprodustat to darbepoetin alfa on endothelial function by assessing FBF in subjects with
      anemia of CKD by using venous occlusion plethysmography as a means to estimate the potential
      for daprodustat to have a lower risk of CV events as compared to rhEPO.

      This study will use a randomized, repeat dose, open label, parallel group design, in adult,
      not on-dialysis, male and female subjects with anemia of CKD that are currently not treated
      with rhEPOs.

      The study will comprise of three study periods: a screening period starting up to 30 days
      prior to Day 1, a 42 day (6 week) treatment period, and a follow-up visit up to 14 days
      later. The total duration of subject involvement is up to 14 weeks. Approximately, 50
      subjects will be randomized to either daprodustat or darbepoetin alfa.

    <measure>Change in Augmentation index (AIx) from Day 1 to 42</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>Pulse wave analysis (PWA) is a reproducible, noninvasive method for assessing AIx (a measure of the contribution that wave reflection makes to the arterial pressure waveform). The amplitude and timing of the reflected wave ultimately depends on the stiffness of the small (pre-resistance) vessels and large arteries, and thus, AIx provides a measure of systemic arterial stiffness. A high-fidelity micro manometer will be used to obtain accurate readings of the peripheral pressure waveforms by flattening, but not occluding, the radial artery of the dominant arm using gentle pressure. AIx is defined as the augmentation (difference between systolic peaks) expressed as a percentage of the overall pulse pressure.</description>
