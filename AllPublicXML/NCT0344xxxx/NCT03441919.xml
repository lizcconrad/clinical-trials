  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperglycemia is a well-known cardiovascular risk factor. It has also been shown that
      episodes of hyperglycemia increase the risk for cardiovascular diseases despite return to
      normoglycemia, a phenomenon termed 'glycemic or metabolic memory'. The molecular mechanism
      underlying this phenomenon remains unclear.

      Cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke are caused by
      atherosclerosis, which is characterized by low grade inflammation of the vascular wall,
      including accumulation of innate immune cells such as monocytes and macrophages.

      The investigators hypothesize that chronic hyperglycemia shifts intracellular metabolism of
      innate immune cells towards glycolysis and changes the epigenetic state of (progenitors of)
      innate immune cells (monocytes and macrophages), which reprograms these cells towards a more
      aggressive, pro-atherogenic phenotype, thereby accelerating atherosclerosis.

      In this study, the investigators aim to test this hypothesis. This research will reveal
      whether the innate immune cells of patients with chronic hyperglycemia show a durable shift
      in intracellular metabolism and epigenetic changes and whether this associates with vascular
      inflammation.
