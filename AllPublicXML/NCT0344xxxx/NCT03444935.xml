  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This goal of this research is to examine the efficacy and feasibility of starting a phone
      call follow-up program for individuals discharged to the community after presenting to the
      Crisis Response Centre (CRC), a standalone mental health facility in Winnipeg, with suicidal
      ideation or behaviours. Currently there is no worldwide gold standard for how best to
      follow-up with individuals following presentations to health services with suicidal ideation
      or behaviours, despite the period immediately after discharge from mental health services
      being identified as a period of increased risk for death by suicide (Chung et al., 2017;
      Steeg et al., 2012). This risk is higher still for individuals who specifically had suicidal
      ideation or behaviours as a component of their reason for presenting to mental health
      services (Chung et al., 2017). One strategy that has been employed to mitigate this risk is
      brief contact interventions (BCI), which involves following up with people through text,
      phone calls, or written messages. Research has shown that this type of follow-up is
      well-received by individuals and although some studies have found this strategy reduces the
      rates of suicidal behaviours during this high-risk period, the overall literature shows mixed
      results (Miller et al., 2017; Exbrayat et al., 2017; Cebria et al., 2016; Milner et al.,
      2015; Morthorst et al., 2012; Fleischmann et al., 2008; Cedereke et al., 2002).

      Because the research on phone call follow up programs has been mixed, we will be conducting a
      brief trial to study the efficacy and feasibility of a phone call follow-up system in
      Winnipeg to inform whether or not this type of program would be of benefit to the community.
      In order to best study this, we will be conducting a randomized control trial for individuals
      who are discharged to the community after presenting to the CRC with a recent history of
      suicidal thoughts or behaviours. Participants will be randomized into either an intervention
      group or a control group. All participants will receive at least one and no more than five
      phone calls during the five-week period immediately following discharge from the CRC, and the
      content and timing of these phone calls will be different depending on which group a
      participant is randomized to. We will rely on both self-reported data, which will be
      collected in a formalized fashion, and data in the electronic medical records of participants
      to analyze this intervention. Our hypothesis is that the specific protocol we have designed
      to follow up with the intervention group will result in decreased suicidal thoughts and
      behaviours in the period immediately following discharge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed randomized control trial will occur over a three-month period at the Crisis
      Response Centre (CRC) in Winnipeg. The CRC serves as a standalone facility that offers 24/7
      walk in assessment and treatment for adults with mental health crises, as well as referrals
      to mental health services. All individuals who present to the CRC and report any suicidal
      ideation or behaviour within the one week prior to their presentation will be considered
      eligible for the study. Further inclusion and exclusion criteria are outlined in the
      &quot;Eligibility&quot; section. A variety of employees at the CRC will be involved in different roles
      to assist with this research.

      In current practice, all individuals are able to connect with Crisis Clinicians working at
      the CRC both in person and through the use of a telephone call to the Mobile Crisis Unit,
      which provides the capacity for Crisis Clinicians to both talk on the phone to individuals or
      leave the CRC and assess individuals offsite to support them. All individuals who connect
      with Crisis Clinicians in any of these capacities have a Mental Health Assessment (MHA)
      completed by Crisis Clinicians. All Crisis Clinicians are trained specifically in how to
      assess and assist individuals with suicidal thoughts or behaviours, therefore making them
      optimal individuals to assist in this research given their experience to support the safety
      of individuals in crisis.

      Participants who present to the CRC, are deemed appropriate for participation in the study
      based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and who are otherwise ready for discharge back
      into the community will be consented by the same Crisis Clinician who completed their MHA.
      Participants will be informed that they will receive no less than one and no more than five
      phone calls over the five weeks immediately following the date of their discharge from the
      CRC as part of this study, without informing them of the specific differences between the
      intervention and control groups. Individuals will decide prior to discharge whether they
      would like to participate, and those who choose to participate will provide a phone number
      that they can be contacted at and that messages can be left on.

      Individuals who choose to participate will be randomized to either a control or intervention
      group based on a coin flip done by the Attendants (Front Desk Staff at the CRC). The Crisis
      Clinician will not be involved in the randomization process to prevent allocation bias. Once
      participants are randomized, they will be informed by the Attendants of the exact dates on
      which they should expect phone calls without revealing to the participant what group they
      have been randomized to, thereby blinding the participants. This blinding is possible because
      we have concealed the exact number and nature of phone calls that will occur for the two
      groups. Attendants will update a schedule after randomizing each participant with appointment
      times for all phone calls required for the study.

      On each day, Team Leads will be responsible for reviewing the schedule and allocating all
      required phone calls between themselves and the Crisis Clinicians working that day. Crisis
      Clinicians will attempt to call participants a maximum of three times on the assigned day
      between 0800 and 2200. All Crisis Clinicians are provided with scripts to follow for phone
      calls based on which group they are calling and at what time. If Crisis Clinicians are
      unsuccessful at contacting the participant by the third attempt, they will leave a scripted
      voicemail offering support and encouraging the participant to call back. If at any point
      during phone conversations the Crisis Clinician has concerns about a participant's safety or
      suicide risk, this will be approached in the same way the Clinician would approach anyone who
      calls in to the Mobile Crisis Unit with suicidal ideation or behaviours.

      Crisis Clinicians will record the outcome and content of all phone calls into the electronic
      medical record, including phone calls where they do and do not successfully talk with the
      participant. Throughout the study, Dr. Laura Sutherland will be reviewing the participants'
      electronic medical records with particular attention to mental health diagnoses, visit
      history during the study time, and the notes from all phone calls made. This information will
      be used to analyze all of the data in a deidentified fashion. Crisis Clinicians and Team
      Leads will also keep a daily tally of the total number of individuals considered appropriate
      for the study based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and how many of these individuals
      decline participation in the study to further inform the analysis.
