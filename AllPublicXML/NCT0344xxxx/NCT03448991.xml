  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to normal physiology, the longer fasting period allows food particles to pass
      stomach through small intestines to minimize intragastric content. The practice guidelines
      recommend 2-hour fasting period for clear fluid (including water, pulp-free juice and tea or
      coffee without milk), 4- hour fasting period for breast milk and 6-hour fasting period for
      non-human milk and solid food to reduce risks of pulmonary aspiration. As a result of longer
      fasting period, patients tend to experience preoperative dehydrated states and intraoperative
      hypotension. Patients' demographic data will be obtained from charts. Parents will be asked
      for type, volume of fluid/food intake and NPO time.

      This study will be done at BCH's Gastroenterology Procedure Unit (GPU) theaters to measure
      actual intragastric volume and pH at the beginning esopagogastroduodenoscopy procedures. We
      hope to demonstrate the relationship between NPO time and actual intragastric volume which
      provide sufficient data of NPO time to ensure patient's safety.

      This study is a prospective observational cohort study which will be conducted in 2 parts
      including preoperative and intraoperative periods.

        -  Preoperative period, patients' demographic information will be collected along with NPO
           history including times, type ,amount of preoperative fluid/ food intake and patients'
           anxiety score.

        -  Intraoperatively, at the beginning of EGD procedure, total volume of intragastric
           content(ml) and gastric acidity will be measured.

      We plan to offer participation to all patients or parents of patients' ages 0-17 years who
      are scheduled for EGD at GPU, BCH Longwood campus and are fluent in English. A brochure
      describing our study in English will be given to patients or their families on the day of
      surgery. If the patient or family agrees to participate in this study, the study will be
      provided in the GPU theaters.
