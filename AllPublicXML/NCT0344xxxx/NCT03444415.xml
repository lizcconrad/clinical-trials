    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of an early and intensive
      intervention, based on techniques of effective counseling on healthy habits for parents, in
      order to reduce mean BMI at 2 years of age Secondly, the investigators will analyze the
      weighted increase of children's BMI, the eating habits of parents and children, duration of
      breastfeeding, physical activity level of parents and children and the children sleeping
      habits. In order to achieve it, the investigators have developed a randomized trial by
      Primary Care Centers, controlled by two parallel groups of study, open and multicenter study.
      The investigator team will recruit 414 pregnant women bwtween 12 and 16 weeks of gestation
      who will or will not receive an intervention, depending on their Primary Care Centers. The
      investigators will develop an intervention for parents, based on effective counseling
      techniques which are grounded on Motivational Interviewing approach with the objective of
      transmitting habits to reach a healthy lifestyle. The intervention consists in six workshops
      (90 minutes long), two prenatal and four postnatal, directed by professionals of the Field
      Researchers Basic Group (Family Practitioners, Pediatricians, Nurses and Midwives).
