  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate an oil blend with active ingredients for the reduction in
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in people with breast cancer. Half of the
      participants will receive the oil blend with active ingredients and the other half will
      receive a placebo (an oil blend with no active ingredients). One-fourth of the people will
      also take pictures of their life with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a painful, debilitating consequence of
      cancer treatment and is considered the most adverse of non-hematologic events. Current
      pharmacological approaches to reduce CIPN symptoms can be ineffective and cause adverse
      effects.

      Constituents of this oil blend moderate pain signal transmission through non-competing
      inhibition of 5-HT, AchE, and Substance P, along with antagonism of TRPA1 and TRPV1. This
      study will test the hypothesis that an oil blend reduces CIPN symptoms and improves
      quality-of-life (QOL) in breast cancer patients. The Human Response to Illness model is used
      to underpin a convergent-nested-parallel mixed-methods design with intervention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2 (SF-MPQ-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and weekly for 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 22-item self-report pain intensity (over past week) peripheral neuropathy questionnaire. Each item is scored from 0 -10 (0 is no pain and 10 is the worst possible pain), a mean score is obtained, yielding a mean score between 0 and 10.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale - Pain (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and daily for 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 10 cm horizontal line with a 0 (no pain) on the far left and 10 (worst possible pain) on the far right. Participants rate current pain intensity by drawing a mark on the line. Pain intensity is obtained by measuring from the 0 to the participant's mark on the line, yielding a score from 0 to 10. Daily pain scores will be averaged for a weekly mean.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Adult Cancer survivor (QLACS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week four and week seven</time_frame>
    <description>The QLACS consists of 47 questions in two domains (generic and cancer-specific). The questionnaire offers respondents the following choices: 1=never, 2=seldom, 3=sometimes, 4=about as often as not, 5=frequently, 6=very often, and 7=always, yielding a total score of between 0 to 350. A mean score will be used.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life: Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy-20 (QOL:CIPN20)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week four and week seven</time_frame>
    <description>The QOL: CIPN20 consists of 20 questions represented by three scales: autonomic symptoms and functioning, sensory, and motor. Participants are to rate symptoms over the past week as 1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, and 4=very much. Items are scored per scale as a higher score = worse, yielding a total score of between 0 and 100. A mean score will be used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep-related questions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week four and week seven</time_frame>
    <description>The following two questions are exploratory: In the past seven days, how many times have you slept through the night? In the past seven days, how many times did your pain wake you from sleep? If pain woke you from sleep, please describe your experience. If anything other than pain woke you from sleep, please list. Neither QOL questionnaire also address sleep. The answers to these questions will be integrated into QOL data.</description>
