  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current pilot study will examine emergent hypotheses by investigating the role of
      psychological mechanisms in the relationship between food insecurity and obesity. This
      objective will be achieved via a cross-sectional, observational pilot study collecting
      quantitative and qualitative data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will investigate an emergent risk factor for obesity: food insecurity, which
      is defined as the limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods.
      While paradoxically linked, numerous studies have shown a significant association between
      food insecurity and obesity. Moreover, recent narrative works have developed new, untested
      hypotheses linking food insecurity and obesity positing the causal role of psychological
      mechanisms. Given this, this mixed method pilot study will collect new psychological data in
      a sample of food secure and food insecure adults with and without obesity to examine the
      connections between food insecurity, body weight, and psychological constructs. The
      overarching objective of the study is to gather pilot data to identify potentially new
      intervention targets that will be used in future studies to more rigorously investigate the
      relationship between food insecurity and obesity.

    <description>Assessed via the 27-Item Monetary Choice Questionnaire, which measures bias toward smaller, immediate rewards versus larger, delayed rewards. This questionnaire presents participants with a set of 27 choices between smaller, immediate monetary rewards and larger, delayed monetary rewards. An estimate of a participant's discounting rate (k) is calculated from the pattern of choices. Participants who discount the value of the delayed rewards more steeply, have a higher k value, are considered to be more impulsive.</description>
