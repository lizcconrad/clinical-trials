      A Phase II Randomized Study.Primary objective:to investigate the 6-month progression-free
      survival (PFS) rate i patients receiving SLOG or mFLFIRINOX as a first-line treatment for
      locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 130 patients (65patients in each arm) will be calculated, based on the assumption
      of a 6-month PFS rate of 45% with mFOLFIRINOX vs 60% wuth SLOG, to achieve 75% power, with a
      drop-out rate of 10%. Two-sided test was performed with type I error=0.10.
