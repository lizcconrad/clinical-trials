      Dino EGG mother's voice exposure and multisensory processing in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
      infants.

      This is a 2 phase prospective comparative effectiveness trial of our parents' voice
      intervention with 290 hospitalized preterm infants.

      As a part of a previous project, an early technology development award from the Nationwide
      Children's Hospital (NCH) Technology Office allowed us to develop 10 functioning prototypes
      of the DINO EGG speakers, a NICU-safe and developmentally appropriate music player that
      delivers parent's voice to the bedside of NICU infants. The device passed NCH NICU-safe
      products committee and has been used in the clinical setting delivering clinical music
      therapy services (available at bedside to play parents' voice).

      The first phase of the current study is to test an updated prototype version of the device
      that replicates a previously FDA (and NCH NICU-safe products) proved device called Pacifier
      Activated Lullaby (PAL), used and described in IRB15-01035, but being discontinued by the
      company. The discontinuation is not due to safety or health benefits concerns. Therefore, no
      device available on the market currently exists to accomplish NICU parents' voice delivery in
      a consistent and safe manner, the investigators modified a 510K-approved feeding device that
      is no longer available and whose intellectual property rights have expired. The device's air
      displacement sensor, which fits into a standard NICU pacifier, allowed the investigators to
      deliver processed and developmentally appropriate recordings of parent's voice, contingent
      upon the infant producing effort to receive it. Intellectual property rights were filed for
      the modifications and use process through the technology transfer and legal office at NCH.

      Therefore, phase I will test the usability of the device (safety for the NICU was confirmed),
      not the effectiveness of the parents' voice delivery for the infant. Parent and nursing
      questionnaires about the importance of the device availability and its usability will be
      collected from parents and Registered Nurse (RN) staff that choose to provide the feedback.

    <description>We will confirm a larger scale that for preterm infants, standardized exposure to mother's voice with a contingent stimulus of non-nutritive sucking can improve the development of speech sound discrimination in the NICU. Phase I will test the usability of the device (safety for the NICU was confirmed), not the effectiveness of the parents' voice delivery for the infant.
