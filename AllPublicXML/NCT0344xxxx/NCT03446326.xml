  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will seek to determine the effects of different heart rates on both stroke
      volume and cardiac output using non-invasive hemodynamic assessments. In order to safely
      manipulate the HR, the investigators will study patients with permanent pacemakers in whom
      heart rate manipulation can be done in a safe and non-invasive manner.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Permanent pacemakers have sometimes been used to treat patients with recurrent vasovagal
      syncope. This is because patients with vasovagal syncope often experience bradycardia at the
      time of their syncope. Unfortunately, pacemakers are often ineffective in preventing syncope.

      Classical cardiovascular hemodynamics would suggest that increasing the heart rate (HR; via
      pacemaker) should increase the cardiac output (CO). This is because:

      CO = HR x Stroke volume (SV).

      The assumption is that the SV is fixed during manipulation of the HR. However, this might not
      be the case. As the number of beats per minute (HR) increases, the cardiac cycle length (R-R
      interval [RRI]) shortens, as a function of simple math. This means that the time in cardiac
      systole shortens, and the time in cardiac diastole shortens. Since cardiac diastole is when
      the heart fills up with blood, faster HR can be associated with decreased cardiac filling
      times. This, in turn, could compromise the SV. However, there is a paucity of data as to what
      happens to SV and CO at different HR. Further, it is possible that these effects will be
      different when a person is lying down supine versus when a patient is upright (when stroke
      volume will be lower).

      The investigators will seek to determine the effects of different HR on both SV &amp; CO. In
      order to safely manipulate the HR, they will study patients with permanent pacemakers in whom
      HR manipulation can be done in a safe and non-invasive manner.

    <description>Pacing runs will occur at the following rates:
50 beats per minute (bpm)
60 bpm
70 bpm
80 bpm
90 bpm
100 bpm
110 bpm
120 bpm
130 bpm
The finger blood pressure cuff will be calibrated between pacing runs.
Following the final pacing run while supine, the patient will be given 10 minutes to rest prior to the upright portion of the study. They will then be strapped into the table (so they will not fall) and then they will be tilted up to &gt;70 degrees (almost standing up). They will stand for ~10 minutes prior to commencing the next pacing trains.</description>
