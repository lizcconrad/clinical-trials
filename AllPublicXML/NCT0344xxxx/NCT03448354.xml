  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is a lethal malignancy and reported as a fifth leading cause of death in all
      age in the developed country. Most of the ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed at advanced
      stages due to an inadequate screening tool and a lack of clinical symptoms. Optimal
      cytoreductive surgery with no gross residual disease followed platinum-based adjuvant
      chemotherapy has been the most effective therapeutic strategy in the treatment of advanced
      ovarian cancer. However, the optimal surgical procedure is not always possible, especially in
      patients with extensive disease or women with poor performance status. Neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy(NAC) followed interval debulking surgery (IDS) is an alternative therapeutic
      option for these patients. There is growing interest in the use of HIPEC (hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy) for ovarian cancer, and early data on HIPEC as a component of
      front-line therapy of advanced ovarian cancer are encouraging. However, intraperitoneal
      chemotherapy is not actively used in the treatment of ovarian cancer due to the
      catheter-related complications or inconvenience. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness and safety of HIPEC after interval debulking surgery in advanced ovarian cancer
      patients.

  <detailed_description>

      GOG 172 trial showed a dramatic improvement of overall survival in patients with stage III
      disease treated with intraperitoneal cisplatin and paclitaxel compared with those with
      intravenous administration. Currently, prospective cohort study showed a survival benefit of
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy compared with intravenous chemotherapy. Despite this
      improvement, intraperitoneal chemotherapy is not widely used as standard therapy owing to the
      high rate of adverse effects and inconvenience of administering therapy intraperitoneally.
      Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is a multi-modal approach with combined
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy and hyperthermia. It maintains the theoretical benefit of
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy and reduces most of the adverse events from catheter-related
      problems with delivery of the chemotherapeutic agent at the end of surgery. In addition,
      hyperthermia increases the penetration of chemotherapy at the peritoneal surface and
      chemo-sensitivity. In this trial, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HIPEC
      procedures performed after interval debulking surgery in patients with advanced ovarian
      cancer.
