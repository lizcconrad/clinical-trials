  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy of catheter ablation versus the Wolf Mini-Maze surgical
      ablation for rhythm control in patients with persistent afib.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Higher success rates have been achieved after a single surgical ablation when compared to
      catheter ablation, however contiguous and transmural lesions are not always guaranteed.

      Even though, catheter ablation is now being offered for symptomatic persistent AF, recurrence
      after the index procedure in such a persistent AF substrate is not unusual. Redo-catheter
      ablation is routinely offered for such patients; however long term success still remains low.
      Non-pulmonary vein triggers are often targeted in such redo-catheter ablation procedures;
      though this approach remains controversial. More recently, the Wolf Mini-Maze procedure has
      been utilized with promising results.

      This study proposes to randomize a group of persistent AF patients to undergo either catheter
      ablation or the surgical mini-maze procedure with left atrial appendage (LAA) ligation
