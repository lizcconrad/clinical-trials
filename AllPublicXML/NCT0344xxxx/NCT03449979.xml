  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: Investigating the effects of non-invasive transcranial alternating current
      stimulation (tACS) on healthy participants and participants with mood disorders.

      Participants: 30 males and females, ages 18-65, with depressed mood; 30 healthy males and
      females, ages 18-65, free of neurological or psychiatric conditions.

      Procedures: This is a single visit study with two stimulation conditions (tACS and sham
      tACS). The session will begin with clinical assessments (behavioral inhibition and behavioral
      activation scales (BIS/BAS), the structured clinical interview for the DSM-5 (SCID), and the
      hamilton-depression rating scale 17 item (HDRS17)), followed by a 7 minute resting state EEG
      (2 minutes eyes closed, 5 minutes eyes open), followed by the stimulation session (40 minutes
      of tACS or sham tACS), followed by an additional 5 minute resting state EEG. An additional 10
      minutes of EEG will be collected following this 5 minute resting state (2 minutes segments,
      with 30 second breaks). The stimulation will involved 40 minutes of transcranial alternating
      current stimulation, 2mA in amplitude and 10 Hz frequency.

      Participants will report for a study visit and will review and sign a consent form.

      Participants will complete several clinical assessments and also take a urine drug test and
      urine pregnancy test (if applicable). Eligibility will be re-assessed by the investigators
      before the participant moves on to the next phase.

      If the participant still qualifies, the participant will first be fitted with two 5x5cm
      electrodes placed over F3/F4 (10-20 measurement system) and one 5x7cm electrode placed over
      Cz, along with ECG electrodes as well as a respiration belt. In addition, the participant
      will have a 128-channel EEG net placed on their head. Participants will provide a saliva
      sample to assess for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which may affect how the
      participant's brain responds to stimulation. Once the participant is fitted with this
      equipment, the participant will complete a 2-minute resting state EEG with the participant's
      eyes closed, then a 5-minute resting state EEG with the participant's eyes open.

      Following these recordings, participants will provide a saliva sample and respond to
      additional questionnaires. Immediately following this, the participant will receive 40
      minutes of stimulation (tACS or sham tACS) with simultaneous EEG, ECG, and respiration
      recorded. During this stimulation, participants will sit comfortably upright and awake.

      After stimulation has completed, participants will provide an additional saliva sample and
      respond to additional questionnaires. Once completed, participants will then complete an
      additional 15-minute resting state EEG with the participant's eyes open.

      Finally, participants will respond to a blinding questionnaire to assess if the participant
      thought that the participant received stimulation. Once complete, the participant will leave.
      This session is estimated to last about 4 hours.

    <intervention_model_description>This study recruits both patients currently experiencing a depressive episode (regardless of diagnosis) and those with no history of neurological or psychiatric illness. Randomization will occur in a 1:1 ratio for both of these groups, with half of each group receiving transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at 10Hz and the other half receiving placebo (or sham) stimulation.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>This is a double-blind study, meaning that neither the participant nor the experimenter knows what kind of stimulation the participant is receiving. An unblinded monitor (separate from the staff that interacts with the participant) is responsible for creating the stimulation codes that run each session and for ensuring that these codes worked correctly.</masking_description>
