  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to describe the psychometric properties (validity, reliability
      and responsiveness) of the SQOL-6D instrument in the context of routine clinical treatment of
      upper limb spasticity.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study qualifies as interventional not because of the use of an investigational product,
      but because the imposed specific data collection procedures include multiple questionnaire
      assessments and one on-site visit not necessarily part of routine clinical practice.

    <measure>EQ-5D-5L (EuroQoL 5 Dimensions, 5 Levels)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and then 8 weeks +/-2</time_frame>
    <description>A summary index score will be calculated from responses given to the 5 domain items, measuring overall health on a scale 0 to 1 using United Kingdom (UK) value sets.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurological Impairment Scale adapted for ULS (ULS-NIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Records functional impairment on a four-point scale (rated 0-3) across seven domains, including: motor impairment in the affected upper limb, sensation affected in the affected upper limb, communication, cognitive function, cortical function, emotional/behaviour and mobility of joints, as measured by soft tissue shortening (an assessment used for the evaluation of the deterioration in range of movement due to spasticity by percentage loss of range).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and then 8 weeks +/-2</time_frame>
    <description>Six-point scale (with available scores of 0, 1, 1+, 2, 3 and 4) evaluates muscle tone by reporting changes in this during muscle flexion or extension, depending on the (resistance in) joint mobility being assessed (shoulder, elbow, wrist or finger).</description>

    <measure>Gaseous (Goal Attainment Scaling Evaluation of Outcome for Upper-Limb Spasticity)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and then 8 weeks +/-2</time_frame>
    <description>Goal attainment will be recorded on a five point numerical scale (range -2 to +2) and goal scores combined to give an aggregated T score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ArmA (Arm Activity Measure) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and then 8 weeks +/-2</time_frame>
    <description>ArmA is a patient-reported outcomes questionnaire recording the difficulty in caring for, and completing tasks and activities with the affected arm. The ArmA contains a total of 29 items in four subscales. Difficulty for each item is assessed on a five-point scale (range 0 to 4).</description>
