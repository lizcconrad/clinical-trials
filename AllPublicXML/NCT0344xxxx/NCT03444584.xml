      A Phase 2 study Comparing the effects on glucose control of Medi0382 in combination with
      Dapagliflozin and Metformin compared to placebo in combination with Dapagliflozin and
      Metformin in overweight/obese patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Approximately 46
      subjects.

    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of MEDI0382 versus placebo in overweight/obese subjects with T2DM treated
      with metformin and dapagliflozin dual therapy.

      The study will enroll subjects with T2DM treated either with metformin monotherapy or with
      metformin and dapagliflozin, canagliflozin,empagliflozin dual therapy. After the screening
      period, subjects treated with metformin monotherapy only will enter a 4-week run-in period
      where subjects will be administered oral dapagliflozin 10 mg a day, which will be provided by
      the sponsor. Enrolled subjects that are already treated with metformin and dapagliflozin dual
      therapy will continue this dual therapy throughout the study and can be randomized after the
      screening period without entering the run-in period. All subjects (ie, on monotherapy and
      dual therapy) entering the double-blind treatment period will receive dapagliflozin 10 mg a
      day, which will be provided by the sponsor.

      Forty-six subjects are expected to participate in the study for up to 20 weeks including a
      screening period of up to 60 days, a 4-week run-in period (for subjects on metformin
      monotherapy only), a 4-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up posttreatment period.
