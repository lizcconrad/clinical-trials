  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to establish if human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected
      adult participants with current virologic suppression on a ≥3-drug tenofovir alafenamide
      (TAF) based regimen (TBR) remain suppressed upon switching to a two-drug regimen of
      dolutegravir (DTG) 50 milligram (mg) + lamivudine (3TC) 300 mg. This study will also provide
      important information regarding the safety and participant satisfaction with this two-drug
      regimen. The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate the non-inferior antiviral
      activity of switching to DTG + 3TC once daily compared to continuation of TBR over 48 weeks
      in HIV-1 infected, ART-experienced, virologically suppressed participants. This study also
      will characterize the long-term antiviral activity, tolerability and safety of DTG + 3TC
      through Week 100.

      This will be a 100-week, Phase III, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter,
      parallel-group study. The study will include a screening phase (up to 28 days), a randomized
      early switch phase (Day 1 up to Week 52), a randomized late switch phase (Week 52 up to Week
      100), and a continuation phase (post Week 100). Approximately 550 HIV-1 infected adults on
      stable TBR will be randomized 1:1 to switch to DTG + 3TC once daily for up to 100 weeks, or
      to continue their TBR for 52 weeks, at which time and if HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt;50
      copies per milliliter (c/mL) at Week 48, these participants will switch to DTG + 3TC up to
      Week 100.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized study with parallel group assignment where participants will be randomized into one of the two treatment groups. Participants randomized to DTG + 3TC will receive DTG + 3TC up to Week 100. Participants randomized to TBR will continue to take their current regimen up to Week 52, at which time and if HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 c/mL at Week 48, these participants will switch to DTG + 3TC up to Week 100. Randomization will be stratified by Baseline third agent class (protease inhibitor [PI], integrase inhibitor [INI], or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI]).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>This will be an open-label study and therefore no blinding is required. The Sponsor team aims to remain blinded to participant assignment, and will instruct sites to refrain from mentioning assignment when sending in queries (as the sites/participants will not be blinded). No summaries of the study data according to actual randomized treatment groups will be available to sponsor staff prior to the planned Week 24 preliminary analysis.</masking_description>
