  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Compass Course is an 8-session progressive structure that was developed based on
      theoretical and scientific evidence from psychology and occupational therapy. The goal of the
      intervention is to provide participants with information, tools, and support that help them
      move towards reclaiming a sense of self-grounded purpose in daily life. The study will use a
      convenience sample of breast cancer survivors to evaluate the efficacy of the Compass Course
      intervention.

    <intervention_name>Compass Course</intervention_name>
    <description>An 8-session group intervention that integrates education, support, self-reflection, and action-expectation to help people reaffirm or reconstruct self-grounded purpose after significant life events/transitions. The 8 sessions extend over 2-3 months, with 7 weekly sessions and the final session 1 month after Session 7. The intervention, called the Compass Course is structured around the 6 dimensions of flourishing (autonomy, self-acceptance, personal growth, relationships, purpose in life, external mastery), the goal of which is to help people enact behaviors that move them forward in reframing a sense of self and reaffirming or reconstructing a sense of purpose in their daily lives.</description>
