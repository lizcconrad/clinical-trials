  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, single-dose, 3-period crossover, Williams' design,
      food-interaction (fasted and fed arms) study conducted in healthy subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This food-interaction study will be conducted in healthy subjects. Each subject will have a
      screening visit (within the 21 days prior to the first study drug administration to confirm
      eligibility), 3 single-dose treatment periods separated by a 7- to 14- day washout between
      doses, and an outpatient end-of-study follow-up visit 14 +/- 2 days after the last dose of
      study medication. During each treatment period, subjects will receive a single 350-mg
      relacorilant dose. Based on randomization to 1 of 6 sequences, each subject will receive the
      relacorilant dose once after a 10.5 hour fast; once 30 minutes after the start of a high-fat
      meal; and once 30 minutes after the start of a moderate meal.

      During the first treatment period only, regardless of randomized sequence, subjects will
      report to the clinical research unit on the morning of Day -1 for baseline laboratory
      assessments and to collect samples for assay of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression
      of glucocorticoid-modulated genes to explore the normal range over the day in healthy
      subjects. For the subsequent 2 treatment periods, subjects will report to the CRU on the
      evening of Day -1.

      Blood samples for assay of plasma concentration of relacorilant and its main metabolites will
      be collected pre-dose and at 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72,
      and 96 hours post-dose. Subjects and will remain in the clinic until after the 24-hour blood
      samples are collected and then be discharged and scheduled to return for the later samples.

      Additional samples will be collected for possible future pharmacogenomic analysis.
