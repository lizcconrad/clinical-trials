  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High myopia retinopathy has become the first cause of irreversible blindness and severe
      visual impairment in Chinese adults, in order to avoid the blind and visual impairment caused
      by high myopia retinopathy, it is very necessary to research the mechanism of early visual
      impairment to prevent and control damages. Our recent research found that the decreasing of
      macular retina vascular density and subfoveal choroidal thickness, the increasing of Beta
      Zone area in optic atrophy and the rising of glycosylated hemoglobin in high myopia patients
      were significantly related to visual impairment, which suggested that the source of visual
      impairment was the abnormal structure changes surrounding optic and fovea, but so far there
      is no related study. We will conduct a 5 years prospective cohort study in the population of
      2420 high myopia and controls which have established in college student population, working
      population and aged more than 50 years old population, using the latest OCT-A and SS-OCT to
      measure macular retina vascular density, subfoveal choroidal thickness, Beta Zone area in
      optic atrophy, combined with the semiparametric mixed effects model, we will analysis the
      prediction index between fundus structure parameters, blood biochemical index and individual
      characteristics prediction to explore the public health management mode of early prevention
      and treatment during high myopia population.
