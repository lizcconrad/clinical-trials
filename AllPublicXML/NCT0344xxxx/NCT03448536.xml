      The purpose of this study is to compare the maximum single dose of AleveÂ® (two tablets,
      equivalent to 440 mg of naproxen sodium) to the maximum single dose of Tylenol Extra Strength
      (two tablets, equivalent to 1000 mg of acetaminophen) in the treatment of menstrual pain
      associated with primary dysmenorrhea.
