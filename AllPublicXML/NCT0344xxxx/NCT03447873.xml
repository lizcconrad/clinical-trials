  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The persistence of an aberrant state of immune activation and inflammation (pIA) may
      contribute to the emergence of serious non-AIDS events which carry a higher morbimortality in
      HIV-infected patients. Although combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) reduces both
      cellular and soluble activation markers, it fails to completely control pIA despite
      consistent plasma viral load suppression. One of the mechanisms involved in pIA is may be an
      incomplete suppression of viral replication not reflected by plasma viral load, which only
      reflects a balance between viral replication and clearance of HIV-RNA. In addition, low-level
      viremia detected in most HIV-1-infected patients despite years on cART. Unintegrated 2-LTR
      HIV-DNA, and cellular associated HIV-RNAs, as products of active integrated DNA
      transcription, support this issue.

      Furthermore, the key rationales behind simplifying cART are a reduction of toxicities, lower
      risk of resistance mutations in case of virological failure and saving costs. One of these
      simplification strategies is a dual therapy which, based on the data up to date and in our
      clinical experience, has similar virological efficacy than cART. However, it is unknown if
      this strategy could increase the persistent HIV-1 replication and, therefore, pIA. The
      CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio as a marker of immune recovery, the changes in T cell immune
      activation, senescence, exhaustion and apoptosis, and the cellular associated HIV-DNA and
      -RNA would answer the question if simplification to dual therapy would provide less control
      of residual HIV replication and, therefore, a detriment on pIA compared to triple therapy
      and, therefore, would worsen the patients' long-term prognosis.

      Primary Outcome Measures: to evaluate the changes in the CD4/CD8 ratio, immune activation and
      other immunologic parameters at 48 weeks after switching to dual therapy based on
      dolutegravir plus emtricitabine o darunavir/cobicistat plus emtricitabine versus to continue
      on triple therapy based on integrase inhibitor plus 2 analogs Secondary Outcome Measures: to
      evaluate the changes in the CD4/CD8 ratio, immune activation and other immunologic parameters
      at 96 weeks after switching to dual therapy based on dolutegravir plus emtricitabine o
      darunavir/cobicistat plus emtricitabine versus to continue on triple therapy based on
      integrase inhibitor plus 2 analogs

      Method: randomized clinical trial in which adult HIV-infected patients with an undetectable
      plasma HIV-RNA for at least one year on a triple therapy based on integrase inhibitors plus
      two nucleos(t)ide analogs will be randomized in 3 groups (1:1:1) with 4 strata according to
      the previous time with undetectable viral load to:

        1. Continue the previous ART based on Elvitegravircobicistat 150150 mg + tenofovir
           alafenamide 10 mg + emtricitabine 200 mg (Genvoya™) o Dolutegravir 50 mg + abacavir 600
           mg + lamivudine 300 mg (Triumeq™) once daily.

           Or to switch to:

        2. Darunavir/cobicistat (800150 mg) + 3TC (300 mg) once daily or

        3. Dolutegravir (50 mg) + 3TC (300 mg) once daily.
