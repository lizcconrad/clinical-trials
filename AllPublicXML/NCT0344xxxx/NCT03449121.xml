  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Slow breathing may reduce stress. Adults with congestive heart failure have higher stress
      than the general population. This study will examine if using slow breathing is feasible
      among adults with heart failure.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Magnitude of change in PROMIS Depression scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 week, 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Depression Computer Adaptive Test (CAT). The PROMIS Depression instruments assess self-reported negative mood (sadness, guilt), views of self (selfcriticism, worthlessness), and social cognition (loneliness, interpersonal alienation), as well as decreased positive affect and engagement (loss of interest, meaning, and purpose). With CAT, participant responses guide the system's choice of subsequent items from the full item bank (28 items in total) and a T-Score is generated. T-Score distributions are standardized such that a 50 represents the average (mean) for the US general population, and the standard deviation around that mean is 10 points. A higher score reflects higher levels of depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Magnitude of change in PROMIS Anxiety scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 week, 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety Computer Adaptive Test (CAT). The PROMIS Anxiety instruments measure self-reported fear (fearfulness, panic), anxious misery (worry, dread), hyperarousal (tension, nervousness, restlessness), and somatic symptoms related to arousal (racing heart, dizziness). With CAT, participant responses guide the system's choice of subsequent items from the full item bank (29 items in total) and a T-Score is generated. T-Score distributions are standardized such that a 50 represents the average (mean) for the US general population, and the standard deviation around that mean is 10 points. A higher score reflects higher levels of anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Magnitude of change in PROMIS Global Health scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 week, 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Health. The PROMIS Global Health measures assess an individual's physical, mental, and social health. Each of the 10 items are totaled into a raw sum score and Raw Sum Scores are then converted into T-Scores. T-Score distributions are standardized such that a 50 represents the average (mean) for the US general population, and the standard deviation around that mean is 10 points. A higher score reflects higher levels of physical, mental, and social health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Magnitude of change in PROMIS Physical Function scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 week, 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function Computer Adaptive Test (CAT). PROMIS Physical Function instruments measure self-reported capability rather than actual performance of physical activities. This includes the functioning of one's upper extremities (dexterity), lower extremities (walking or mobility), and central regions (neck, back), as well as instrumental activities of daily living, such as running errands. With CAT, participant responses guide the system's choice of subsequent items from the full item bank (165 items in total) and a T-Score is generated. T-Score distributions are standardized such that a 50 represents the average (mean) for the US general population, and the standard deviation around that mean is 10 points. A higher score reflects higher levels of physical functioning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Magnitude of change in PROMIS Fatigue scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 week, 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue Computer Adaptive Test (CAT). The PROMIS Fatigue instruments evaluate a range of self-reported symptoms, from mild subjective feelings of tiredness to an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained sense of exhaustion that likely decreases one's ability to execute daily activities and function normally in family or social roles. With CAT, participant responses guide the system's choice of subsequent items from the full item bank (95 items in total) and a T-Score is generated. T-Score distributions are standardized such that a 50 represents the average (mean) for the US general population, and the standard deviation around that mean is 10 points. A higher score reflects higher levels of fatigue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Magnitude of change in PROMIS Dyspnea scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 week, 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Dyspnea Severity Computer Adaptive Test (CAT). The PROMIS Dyspnea instruments evaluate a range of self-reported symptoms related to dyspnea. With CAT, participant responses guide the system's choice of subsequent items from the full item bank (33 items in total) and a T-Score is generated. T-Score distributions are standardized such that a 50 represents the average (mean) for the US general population, and the standard deviation around that mean is 10 points. A higher score reflects higher levels of dyspnea.</description>

    <measure>Autonomic tone</measure>
    <time_frame>Monthly data extraction from ICD: Baseline, week 4, week 8, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will estimate autonomic tone of participants by extracting data from implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Data analyses will consist of heart rate spectral analyses.</description>
