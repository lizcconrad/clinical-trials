  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy of IV acetaminophen when administered
      to neurosurgical patients at the beginning and end of their surgery. If the result is
      improved pain control with less opioid consumption postoperatively, then those patients may
      also experience less opioid related side effects such as nausea/vomiting, pruritus, and
      sedation.
