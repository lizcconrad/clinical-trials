  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will test the effectiveness of the novel delivery of an established
      tobacco cessation treatment among pregnant women in Kentucky. Tobacco use during pregnancy is
      one of the most modifiable risk factors associated with poor birth and maternal outcomes and
      yet smoking prevalence among pregnant women in Kentucky is among the highest in the county
      and estimated to be twice that of the national average, with no meaningful declines observed
      in twenty years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot project is to test effectiveness of a tobacco-treatment cessation
      intervention (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) 5 A's) through use
      of a non-physician healthcare champion from within the clinic's existing infrastructure. This
      Tobacco use in Pregnancy Intervention for Cessation (ToPIC) will involve training the
      identified healthcare provider to become a Certified Tobacco Treatment Specialist (CTTS) and
      to administer the 5 A's to pregnant Medicaid patients receiving prenatal care through two
      high-volume Kentucky obstetrics clinics. This trial will provide evidence to evaluate this
      approach to delivering an established intervention in clinical practice.

      The Investigators propose to test the effectiveness of the clinical intervention by using a
      two-armed cluster randomized controlled design. Eligible participants will be randomized to
      the intervention (ToPIC) or standard of care for smoking cessation in pregnancy. This pilot
      project will gather quantitative and qualitative data for a mixed-method, multi-stakeholder
      process evaluation of intervention training and delivery. Furthermore, the Investigators' use
      of Medicaid claims data to examine healthcare utilization outside of maternal and infant
      well-care visits will enhance understanding of the strengths and limitations of these data
      for future evaluations. This study has the potential to significantly impact the most
      vulnerable in Kentucky, where rates of tobacco use among pregnant women are among the highest
      in the nation.

    <description>Eligible women assigned to the control group will be informed of the risks of tobacco use and benefits of quitting using the ACOG 5A's approach by their healthcare provider.5 This standard takes approximately 5-15 minutes, and is offered at each prenatal and postpartum appointment. The study coordinator will invite participants to complete the tobacco use questionnaires (TUQ),urine cotinine validation, and Expired Air Carbon Monoxide (EACO) analysis to assess ongoing tobacco use at the designated time points.</description>

    <description>Eligible women assigned to the intervention will receive TTAU plus ToPIC administered by the CTTS. At least once monthly, at routinely scheduled prenatal visits or through telephone, the CTTS will provide cessation counseling. The CTTS will invite participants to complete TUQs,urine cotinine validation and EACO analysis to assess ongoing tobacco use at the designated time points.</description>
