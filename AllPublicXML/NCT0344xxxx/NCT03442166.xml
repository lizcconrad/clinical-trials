  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In dentistry, one of the most common surgical procedures is the removal of included third
      molars. This surgery generates great morbidity to patients for causing pain, edema and
      trismus due to surgical trauma. The use of photobiomodulation (PBM) (low-power laser or light
      emitting diode - LED) in the postoperative of these procedures has shown excellent results in
      the control of postoperative sequelae. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of PBM with LED in the control of pain, facial edema, trismus and quality of
      life resulting from the extraction of retained lower third molars. A randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 34 adult patients, who search the
      Discipline of Buccomaxillofacial Surgery and Traumatology (CTBMF) II of FO-UFRGS for the
      removal of included lower third molars will be conducted. Before and after the surgeries, the
      facial and mouth opening measurements of all patients will be done. Immediately after the
      surgeries, the patients will be randomized by means of envelopes in two groups. In the LED
      group the patients will receive daily LED applications (intra oral with 660nm and extra oral
      with 850nm) from the immediate postoperative to 7 days after the surgical procedure. In the
      control group the patients will be treated in the same way as in the LED group, however, the
      person in charge of the application will simulate intraoral and extraoral irradiation with
      the LED kept off. Pain (EVA and NRS-101), postoperative edema, trismus, temperature,
      dysphagia and hematomas, as well as the impact of the surgical procedure on patients' quality
      of life will be evaluated after 1, 2, 5 and 7 days. For the analysis of the oral health
      impact profile (OHIP-14 Questionnaire) and anxiety analysis (Beck anxiety inventory -BAI) the
      questionnaires will be applied preoperatively and 7 days after treatment. Initial descriptive
      analyzes will be performed considering all variables measured in the study, both quantitative
      (mean and standard deviation) and qualitative (frequencies and percentages). Later, the
      appropriate statistical tests will be applied for each specific analysis. In all tests, the
      significance level of 5% probability or the corresponding p-value will be adopted. All
      analyzes will be performed using the statistical software SAS for Windows, version 9.1.3.

    <masking_description>After the suture is completed, the researcher responsible for applying the LED will remove and open the envelope containing the information from the experimental group in which the patient will be inserted and proceed to the experiment. A single examiner will run the daily application of the LED and will not perform any type of evaluation. Surgical procedures will be performed by the same surgeon. The preoperative and postoperative evaluations (1, 2, 5 and 7 days postoperatively) will be done by an examiner who will not be aware of the group in which each patient is allocated. Patients will not be aware of whether or not they received LED irradiation, because the person in charge of the LED application will position the plate in place for intra and extraoral irradiation in all patients and only trigger the light when and where predicted in the specific experimental group. The characteristic sound of the device will be triggered by recording in the sham group.</masking_description>

    <description>The Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) is a simplified form of the original OHIP questionnaire that is used to assess the impact of oral health on subjects' quality of life. The items are distributed among the following subscales: functional limitation, pain, psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychological deficiency, social incapacity and disability. The questionnaire will be applied by the evaluator.</description>

    <description>The patients (n=17) will receive daily intra and extra oral LED applications from the immediate postoperative period up to 7 days after the surgical procedure. The LED irradiation will be performed in two areas, one intra and one extra oral. The LED to be used in the intraoral site will be red, 660+/-20nm wavelength, 5 mW power, 2.7J/cm2 energy density for 7 min, 2J energy per point, knowing that the 6 irradiated spots will have 12J in total. In the extra oral site the infra-red LED will be used, 850+/-20nm wavelength, power of 5mW, 3.8J/cm2 of energy density for 10 min, 3J of energy per point, knowing that 36 will be irradiated, so we will have 108J in total.</description>

    <description>Patients (n=17) will be treated in the same way as the LED group.

So that the patient does not identify the sound of activation of the device (beep), it will be recorded, and connected at the time of application.</description>
