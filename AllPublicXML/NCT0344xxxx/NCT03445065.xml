  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the usefulness of using a long term subcutaneously inserted
      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor in patients with insulin treated Type 1 or Type 2
      Diabetes Mellitus. The study will be conducted in France. Patients will be enrolled into two
      cohorts and randomized into two groups within each cohorts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      324 patients will be included in this study: 159 in cohort 1 and 165 in cohort 2. The cohort
      1 will be focused on participants with Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes with an HbA1c &gt; 8% whereas
      cohort 2 will be focused on participants with Type 1 Diabetes spending more than 1.5 hour
      with sensor glucose &lt; 70 mg/dL per day including excursions below 54 mg/dL as a mean for at
      least 28 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female participants at least 18 years of age

          -  Clinically confirmed diagnosis of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus for ≥1 year and
             using insulin by multiple-daily subcutaneous injections or insulin pump and an HbA1c &gt;
             8% (cohort 1)

          -  Clinically confirmed diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes mellitus for ≥1 year and using
             insulin by multiple-daily subcutaneous injections or insulin pump and spending more
             than more than 1.5 hour with sensor glucose &lt;70 mg/dl per day including excursions
             below 54 mg/dl as a mean for at least 28 days (cohort 2)

          -  Participant is willing to comply with protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female participants of childbearing capacity (defined as not surgically sterile or not
             menopausal for ≥ 1 year) who are lactating or pregnant, intending to become pregnant,
             or not practicing birth control during the course of the study

          -  A condition preventing or complicating the placement, operation or removal of the
             Sensor or wearing of transmitter, including upper extremity deformities or skin
             condition

          -  Symptomatic coronary artery disease; unstable angina; myocardial infarction, transient
             ischemic attack or stroke within 6 months; uncontrolled hypertension (systolic&gt;160
             millimeters of mercury (mm HG) or diastolic &gt;100 mm Hg at time of screening); current
             congestive heart failure; history of cardiac arrhythmia (benign premature atrial
             contractions (PACs) and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) allowed).
             Participants with asymptomatic coronary artery disease (e.g., coronary artery bypass
             graft (CABG), stent placement or angioplasty) may participate if negative stress test
             within 1 year prior to screening and written clearance from Cardiologist documented.

          -  History of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV

          -  Currently receiving (or likely to need during the study period): immunosuppressant
             therapy; chemotherapy; anticoagulant/antithrombotic therapy (excluding aspirin);
             glucocorticoids (excluding ophthalmic or nasal). This exclusion does include the use
             of inhaled glucocorticoids and the use of topical glucocorticoids (over sensor site
             only); antibiotics for chronic infection (e.g. osteomyelitis, endocarditis)

          -  A condition requiring or likely to require magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

          -  Known topical or local anesthetic allergy

          -  Known allergy to glucocorticoids

          -  Any condition that in the investigator's opinion would make the participant unable to
             complete the study or would make it not in the participant's best interest to
             participate in the study. Conditions include, but are not limited to, psychiatric
             conditions, known current or recent alcohol abuse or drug abuse by participant
             history, a condition that may increase the risk of induced hypoglycemia or risk
             related to repeated blood testing. Investigator will supply rationale for exclusion

          -  Participation in another clinical investigation (drug or device) within 2 weeks prior
             to screening or intent to participate during the study period

          -  Legal incompetence or limited legal competence

          -  Dependency on sponsor or Investigator (e.g. co-worker or family member)

          -  The presence of any other active implanted device
