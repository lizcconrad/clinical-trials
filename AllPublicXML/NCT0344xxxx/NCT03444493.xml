  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A gap of knowledge exists on the understanding of the acute effects of stabilization
      exercises on pain, disability and physical performance when applied after radiofrequency
      denervation. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to show the effects of
      stabilization exercises when started in acute period and also reduce the frequency of
      recurrence low back pain of patients with FJS after radiofrequency denervation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar facet joint syndrome has been described as a potential cause of low back pain and
      affects an estimated 4% to 8% of those low back pain patients without neurological deficits
      or radiographic evidence of lumbar spine disease. The levels of physical performance and
      functional disability of the patients with lumbar FJS are affected because of the chronicity
      of the pain.

      Radiofrequency denervation (RFD) is one of the therapautic procedures are used most commonly
      in treatment of facet joint syndrome. Numerous placebo-controlled trials have examined lumbar
      facet pain and demonstrated that RFD yields positive results in lumbar pain in properly
      selected patients. The lumbar stabilization exercise is based on the control of the local
      muscle system (multifidus, transversus abdominis, diaphragm and pelvic floor muscles)
      responsible for ensuring segmental stability of the vertebral colon in recent years.

      In the clinical trials, stabilization exercises have been shown to reduce pain, improves
      physical performance and prevent the recurrent low back pain by strengthing of muscles
      supporting the vertebral colon.

      Therefore, the main objective of this study is to show the effects of stabilization exercises
      when started in acute period and also reduce the frequency of recurrence low back pain of
      patients with FJS after radiofrequency denervation.

    <description>The ODI assesses ten different aspects of disability (pain, personal care, lifting, sitting, standing, sleeping, sex life, social life, walking and travelling). Each parameter is scored from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no functional limitation due to pain and 5 indicating a major functional disability due to low back pain. This questionnaire is scored using a global percentage score. The obtainable maximum score is 50, which corresponds to 100%.</description>

    <measure>Physical Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline physical performance tests after radiofrequency denervation (at 2 week) and after exercise procedure (at 8 week)</time_frame>
    <description>Eight physical performance tests (PPT) of daily activities such as climbing stairs, picking up something from the floor, bending forward, rolling up from supine position, putting on a sock, standing up from a lying position etc. were evaluated. The tests were observed by trained physiotherapist, who judged the patients' individual performance in each test using four grades of movement quality that were recorded on a four-point ordinal scale (0; performs activity without any difficulty, 3; restricted movement: cannot perform activity).</description>

    <description>The exercise group performed specific localized exercises aimed at restoring the stabilizing protective function of the transversus abdominis (TrA). The exercises were designed specifically to activate and train the isometric holding function of the TrA muscle at the affected vertebral segment. Additionally, the exercise group was informed about protecting for biomechanics of lumbar spine.</description>

    <description>Exercises were basically performed in 3 phases in this study. In the first phase; effectively and correctly contraction of TrA and multifidus muscles and how the patients adapted to daily life activities was taught. In the second phase; was aimed that the protection of stabilization by counteracting more muscle activation, in the third phase neutral position along with the activities required high level control.</description>
