  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of Part A of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of RXC004 in
      patients with advanced malignancies. In order to define the doses and schedules for further
      clinical evaluation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A of the study will consist of an ascending monotherapy dose, the doses are pre-defined.

      The decision to escalate will be made upon the assessment of safety and tolerability data in
      the first cycle of treatment.

      Part A - Module 1 will commence with an accelerated dose escalation schedule and enrol one
      (1) patient into a cohort with follow up for adverse events and dose limiting toxicities.

      Once a Minimal Biologically Active Dose (MBAD) has been found to be tolerated, dose
      escalations will continue in a 3+3 design to further characterise the PK profile, Maximum
      Tolerated Dose and Maximum Feasible Dose.

      Part B study design will be adapted based on the emerging data from Part A

    <measure>Part A - Safety and Tolerability of RXC004 by assessment of whether any Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) arise from first dose until the end of 21 days of continuous dosing</measure>
    <time_frame>The DLT period will be assessed from the first dose until the end of 21 days of continuous dosing. AE's will be collected until 30 days after stopping drug</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT is defined as an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value. Haematological toxicity of CTCAE grade 4 for more than 4 consecutive days. Grade 3 neutropenia of any duration accompanied by fever &gt;38.5 degrees Celsius. Grage 3 thrombocytopaenia with bleeding. Any other confirmed haematological toxicity &gt;CTCAE grade 4. Non-haematological toxicity &gt;CTCAE grade 3. Any other toxicity that is judged to be a DLT by the Safety Review Committee. An AE resulting in disrupted dosing &gt;14 days.</description>
