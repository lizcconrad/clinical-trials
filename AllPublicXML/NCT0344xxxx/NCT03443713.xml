  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess the impact of physician-driven insulin setting changes in
      type 1 patients using multiple daily injection insulin therapy with exercise. This is a short
      outpatient study with multiple outpatient and home exercise sessions with an assigned type of
      exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be on study for 28 days. Sensor glucose, exercise, insulin and meal data will
      be collected during this time. Subjects will wear the Dexcom G5 and G6 CGM systems and a
      physical activity monitor. The Subjects will complete 2 exercise visits in-clinic and 4
      exercise visits as an outpatient. Subjects will be randomized to aerobic, anaerobic or high
      intensity interval exercise sessions for 30 minutes each. Physicians will review CGM and
      insulin data every 7 days and make insulin dose recommendations that the subject will adjust
      in the dose calculator.
