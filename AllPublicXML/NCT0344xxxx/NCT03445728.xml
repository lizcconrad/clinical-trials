    <textblock>
      We compared the infarct and edema size in ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction
      (STEMI) patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) treated by
      nicorandil before and after the reperfusion with those standard therapy treated by PCI
