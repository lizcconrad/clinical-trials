  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the effects of diode laser (DL) in addition to non-surgical
      periodontal treatment on periodontal parameters, systemic inflammatory response, and serum
      hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
      and chronic periodontitis.

    <textblock>
      This study was designed as a randomized, controlled, full-mouth, 6-month clinical trial. 37
      patients (20 women and 17 men) with uncontrolled T2DM and chronic periodontitis who were
      selected from among those admitting to Dentistry Faculty of Inonu University and Turgut Ozal
      Medical Center completed this study. The patients were divided into two groups. The
      individuals in the control group underwent placebo laser treatment in addition to scaling and
      root planing (SRP). The individuals in the study group underwent DL (1 W power) in addition
      to SRP. Clinical index measurements were performed before treatment (T0), 3 months after
      treatment (T1), and 6 months after treatment (T2). Plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI),
      bleeding on probing (BOP), clinical attachment level (CAL), and probing depth (PD) were
      measured to determine periodontal status. HbA1c and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also
      analyzed using blood samples.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Having a diagnosis of type-2 DM according to the ADA criteria for at least two years
