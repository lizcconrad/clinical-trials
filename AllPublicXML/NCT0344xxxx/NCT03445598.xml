  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate a novel online tool to deliver computerized Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Participants will be randomized into three groups: experimental,
      active control, and waitlist. Participants in the experimental group will have access to the
      full-featured online tool designed to deliver CBT in an interactive and personalized manner.
      The participants in the active control group will have access to a limited version of the
      online tool designed to deliver basic CBT in plain text format. The waitlisted participants
      will be put on a waitlist for 6 weeks. We hypothesize that the experimental group
      participants will show a significantly higher reduction in depression symptom severity and
      will show increased engagement and adherence to the online tool.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a major psychiatric disorder globally, including in India. One of the most
      effective approaches to treat depression is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), but its reach
      is limited by the dearth of trained psychiatrists, especially in remote areas, and the high
      costs and stigma associated with visits to a psychiatric clinic. Delivering CBT through a
      computer, with limited or no intervention from a psychiatrist, could address these
      limitations. Computerized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CCBT) is thus emerging as a more
      accessible and economical alternative to CBT. Despite some evidence of its efficacy, CCBT use
      is limited because the existing software programs used to deliver the therapy provide a much
      lower level of personalization and engagement than in-person therapy. The objective of this
      study is to assess if the new algorithm makes CCBT more efficacious, acceptable and engaging
      to users. Depression severity as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is
      expected to reduce over the duration of the study, more significantly in the treatment group
      compared to the control group. Participants will be recruited online through a website that
      will check compatibility with inclusion/exclusion criteria and get the informed consent.
