  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown high long-term patency for no-touch saphenous
      vein grafts (NTSVGs), comparable to the internal thoracic artery in on-pump coronary artery
      bypass grafting (CABG). RCTs on patency in NTSVGs in off-pump CABG have not been published
      yet. Orebro University Hospital participated in the CABG Off- or On-pump Revascularization
      study (CORONARY, ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00463294) and included fifty-six patients.
      Accordingly, this is a sub-study and the aim was to assess the midterm patency in NTSVGs in
      clamp-less off-pump versus on-pump CABG at five-year follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were eligible if they:

               1. provided written informed consent;

               2. were &gt;21 years of age;

               3. required isolated CABG with median sternotomy;

               4. had at least one of the following risk factors:

                    1. had peripheral vascular disease (previous peripheral bypass, amputation or
                       anklebranchial index &lt;0.90),

                    2. had cerebrovascular disease (history of stroke, transient ischemic attach or
                       carotid stenosis ≥70%),

                    3. had renal insufficiency (creatinine above upper limit of normal),

                    4. were ≥70 years of age, or

                    5. were between the ages of 60-69 with one of the following: i. had diabetes
                       and taking an oral hypoglycemic agent and/or insulin, ii. required urgent
                       revascularization (i.e., waiting in hospital for revascularization after an
                       acute coronary syndrome), iii. were a recent smoker (within 1 year of
                       randomization), or iv. had left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35%, OR

                    6. were between the ages of 55-59 with two of the following: i. Diabetes and
                       taking an oral hypoglycemic agent and/or insulin, ii. required urgent
                       revascularization (i.e., waiting in hospital for revascularization after an
                       acute coronary syndrome, iii. were a recent smoker (within 1 year of
                       randomization), or iv. had a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35%

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were excluded if they:

               1. required a concomitant cardiac procedure associated with CABG;

               2. had a contraindication to off-pump or on-pump CABG (e.g., calcified aorta,
                  intramuscular left anterior descending artery, calcified coronaries, small target
                  vessels);

               3. had a concomitant life-threatening disease likely to limit life expectancy to
                  less than 2 years;

               4. were previously enrollment in the CORONARY Trial;

               5. required emergency CABG surgery (i.e., immediate revascularization for
                  hemodynamic instability); OR

               6. required a redo CABG.
