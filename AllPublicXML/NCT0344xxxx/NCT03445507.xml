  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention to help people to quit
      smoking throughout an chat bot compared with usual assistance to increase long-term rates of
      nicotine abstinence in smoking outpatients with biochemical validation at 6 months.

      Half of participants(control group) will receive usual care by their usual general
      practitioners and nurses, and the other half (intervention group) will use an evidence-based
      chat bot specifically designed to help people quit smoking.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An array of interventions have been shown to be both cost-effective and efficacious in
      helping patients quit smoking and so are included in usual care given by general
      practitioners and nurses. However, in the primary care setting, this sort of interventions
      are less common than they should be, due to many circunstances, and solutions must be found
      due to the huge dimensions of tobacco use challenge.

      On the other hand,new kinds of information tecnology give a chance to intervene with less
      costs and more specific tools. Actually, there are a lot of mobile apps and other devices
      designed to help people to improve their health in many ways, but without scientific evidence
      of their effects.

      This is a pragmatic, randomised, controled and multicentric clinical trial that tries to
      evaluate in general population the effectiveness of a chat bot that incorporates evidence
      based interventions and interacts by a text application instaled in patients mobile phone
      (intervention group).

      Investigators have decided to compare with usual care delivered by the usual general
      practisioners and nurses of Spanish Public Health Centres, because this interventions have
      shown their effectiveness (control group).

      Efficiency and impact on quality of life will also be compared on both groups.

    <description>EuroQol 5D-5L questionary score descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. Patient is asked to indicate health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each dimension. This results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. Digits can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>

EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. Can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement.</description>
