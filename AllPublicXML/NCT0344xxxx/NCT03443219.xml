  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study compares the LMA Supreme™ versus the Spritztube® tracheal cannula in anesthetized
      adult patients.

      The current randomized study is designed to assess the success placement of blind insertion
      using LMA Supreme™ , in comparison with the Spritztube® tracheal cannula.

      In addition, time, number of attempts, easy insertion and the number of complications at
      insertion and removal will be assessed.

      The investigators hypothesize that the LMA Supreme™ versus the Spritztube® tracheal cannula
      will similarly perform during anesthetized adult patients despite differences in their
      structural design.

    <textblock>
      A new extraglottic airway device, the Spritztube® [tracheal cannula, Med Europe s.r.l], was
      developed combining the ability to perform both EAD ventilation and oro-tracheal fibreoptic
      intubation using the same device. The Spritztube® consists of a silicone cannula with two
      low-pressure cuffs: a proximal cuff, designed to seal the pharynx cranially of the epiglottis
      and a distal cuff, designed to seal the oesophagus. The positioning of this device requires
      the aid of a spindle, that keep the cuffs on the same line and it is rigid enough to allow
      the passage through oropharynx tissue. That can be inserted blindly as extraglottic device or
      through the use of direct laryngoscopy or fibroscopy as tracheal cannula.

      The current randomized study is designed to assess the success placement of blind insertion
      using LMA Supreme™ , in comparison with the Spritztube® tracheal cannula.

      In addition, time, number of attempts, easy insertion and the number of complications at
      insertion and removal will be assessed.
