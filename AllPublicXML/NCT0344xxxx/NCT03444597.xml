      Prospective, uncontrolled multi-center, observational cohort study. The objectives of the
      PMCF study are confirmation of the performance, and to collect additional safety data
      regarding expected adverse events and to detect potential unexpected adverse events
      associated with use of Suprasorb®C under the conditions of routine use.

      the name Suprasorb C (medical device).

      Suprasorb® C is intended to be used as a wound dressing for the support of wound healing or
      wound area reduction.

      Participating Centers: 40 study nurses will participate to the PMCF Study Duration: 24 months
