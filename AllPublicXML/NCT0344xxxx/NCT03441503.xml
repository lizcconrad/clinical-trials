  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to identify effective ways to assess the patient and family
      experience. Specifically, the study will examine automated administration of the Child
      Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) Survey on the day
      of discharge through an electronic interactive patient care system. The will be a multisite
      study that will take place at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) as well as at several other
      hospitals across the United States.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary research conducted by BCH on alternative administration methods of Child HCAHPS
      has proven promising. Specifically, a pilot of administration on the day of discharge using
      tablet computers increased response rates, especially among hard to reach groups.

      To further explore modes of Child HCAHPS day of discharge administration, the Center of
      Excellence for Pediatric Quality Measurement (CEPQM) at BCH is collaborating with
      GetWellNetwork (GetWell), a company that provides interactive education material for patient
      televisions, to enable parents and guardians to complete Child HCAHPS on the day of discharge
      from the inpatient television. For this multisite study, parents of hospitalized children
      from BCH and participating sites will be randomized at the time of discharge to either
      receiving Child HCAHPS on the day of discharge on the inpatient television or standard Child
      HCAHPS administration via mail or email. The study will continue for up to six months at each
      participating site.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a rapid cycle randomized control trial. Participating units will alternate between the intervention arm (day of discharge survey via inpatient television) and control arm (post-discharge mailed survey). Patients will be assigned to the intervention or control arm depending on the status of their discharging unit. Units will alternate arms throughout the study period.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Child HCAHPS: Automated day-of-discharge survey
On the day of discharge at the hospital, parents will be contacted to solicit survey responses using patient televisions (GetWell) as follows:
Day 0 (Day of likely discharge): Respondent will be promoted to complete Child HCAHPS on their television as part of the routine discharge process. Respondent will also be asked for their email address to complete post-discharge items and their appropriate contact information will be collected.
Days 2-42: Standard hospital protocol (i.e., mail, email, or IVR) with the post-discharge questions.</description>
