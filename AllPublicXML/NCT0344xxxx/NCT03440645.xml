  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over a 12-month period, patients admitted with acute coronary disease to the cardiovascular
      care unit at the Jewish General Hospital (JGH), an academic tertiary care referral center in
      Montreal, Quebec, will be approached to refer first-degree relatives and/or household members
      age 18 years or older to an outpatient cardiovascular (CV) risk factor screening and
      treatment program. Relatives and household members will undergo a focused history, physical,
      and CV risk factor assessment and will receive evidence-based guideline-recommended treatment
      as indicated. Participants will be referred to nutritionists, smoking cessation programs, and
      to other allied healthcare professionals as needed. A follow-up visit at 6-months will assess
      treatment adherence and improvement in CV risk factors. All family and/or household members
      including the index patient will be encouraged to attend all healthcare visits together.

      The effectiveness of the screening strategy will be measured by the total number of
      participants identified as intermediate or high modified Framingham 10-year risk of
      cardiovascular disease. The effectiveness of the primary prevention intervention will be
      measured by the change in percentage of the mean modified Framingham 10-year risk score for
      participants between the initial visit and 6-month follow-up. The value of the referral,
      screening, and treatment program, as well as participant engagement and satisfaction will
      also be systematically evaluated.
