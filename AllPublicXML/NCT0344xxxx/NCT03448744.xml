  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label control trial of two arms conducted at 10
      centres in China.The aim was to investigate whether sequential combination therapy with
      Thymosin alpha 1 and entecavir is superior to continuous ETV monotherapy in HBeAg-positive
      chronic hepatitis B patients with previous long-term entecavir therapy (≥ 2 years), and to
      select the optimal patients who may benefit from sequential combination therapy.
