      * single center, prospective study First, evaluate the lesion under the white light endoscopy
      (WLE) → IV fluorescein sodium 0.1mL/kg → evaluate the lesion under probe-based confocal laser
      microendoscopy → target biopsy under the pCLE → random biopsy under WLE

      The purpose of this study is to conduct a study on genetic pathology, obtaining of cancer
      tissues is mandatory. Although the endoscopy with biopsy has been a gold standard for
      diagnosing gastric cancer, percentage of cancer cells in biopsy samples of patients after
      chemotherapy is usually 30% or less. Because cancer cells are often replaced with
      regenerative cells after chemotherapy, even though there are still remnant cancer cells in
      the stomach. Recently, confocal laser endomicroscopy has been introduced for real-time
      histopathologic diagnosis in various cancers. In previous pilot study in our institution,
      pCLE-targeted biopsy provided superior results in terms of the proportion of cancer cells in
      biopsy samples compared to WLE-targeted biopsy, especially for gastric cancers with
      undifferentiated histology. However, there was no previous study about precious biopsy method
      for patients after chemotherapy. Therefore, the investigators aim to evaluate that biopsy
      using probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy for remnant gastric cancer after chemotherapy
      will increase the percentage of cancer cells and expression ratio of tumor marker in biopsy
      samples.
