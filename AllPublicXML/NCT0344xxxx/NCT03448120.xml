      Introduction: Neuromuscular fatigue is defined when the muscle becomes incapable of
      generating muscle power or strength after exercise or long repetitive activities. As well as,
      the inability to maintain optimum performance and generate maximum voluntary contractions
      during a physical exercise. When performing physical activity, the body's metabolic response
      increases proportionally to exercise to satisfy the demands of the human physiological. Part
      of the energy accumulated during exercise is lost to the environment in the form of heat and
      another part is maintained internally through the physiological control for thermoregulation.
      In addition, the muscle generates an electric signal important to determine its status
      regarding power and fatigue.

      Objective: To investigate the reduction of acute peripheral fatigue induced by isometric
      contractions from acupuncture and dry needling techniques, compared to absolute rest.

      Methods: This is a cross-sectional study and experimental study, with descriptive, analytical
      and quantitative approach. It follows the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
      (CONSORT) guidelines. The volunteers will be gathered according to the eligibility criteria,
      and randomly divided in 3 groups: the control group (G1), the volunteers who will remain in
      prolonged rest; the acupuncture group (G2), in which volunteers will receive six needles in
      six acupoints in the non-dominant upper limb and the dry needling group (G3), in which the
      volunteers will receive application of six needles arranged in the non-dominant biceps
      brachialis.
