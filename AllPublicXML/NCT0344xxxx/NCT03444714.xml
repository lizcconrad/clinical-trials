  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, single arm, non-randomized study of RiMO-301 with
      radiation in patients with advanced tumors. A single escalation dose of RiMO-301 is
      intratumorally injected in a 3 + 3 study design to identify the recommended dose and dosing
      volumes.

      Condition or Disease:

      Patient with advanced tumor which is clinically accessible for intratumoral injection

      Intervention/Treatment:

      Drug - RiMO-301

      Radiation - Radiotherapy

      Phase:

      Phase 1

  <detailed_description>

      Primary Objectives:

      • The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RiMO-301 as
      determined by toxicity observed in patients treated with palliative radiation doses

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine clinical response after RiMO-301 and radiotherapy as assessed by clinical
           response rate using clinical evaluation, imaging and/or symptom relief

        -  To characterize adverse events of RiMO-301 in patients with advanced cancers

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of RiMO-301 with radiation

      The target population is patients with clinically accessible lesions for intratumoral
      injection. Up to 3 dose levels (5%, 10%, and 15% of the total baseline tumor volume,
      respectively) will be tested in a 3 + 3 dose escalation study design. MTD will be defined as
      the dose associated with a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in less than or equal to 33% of
      patients at the dose level tested. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as one of the
      following events occurring from the intratumor injection of RiMO-301 to 30 days after the
      completion of radiation treatment:

        -  Grade 4 or greater treatment related hematologic or dermatologic toxicity

        -  Any Grade 3 or greater treatment related non-hematologic, non-dermatologic toxicity
           (excluding nausea, vomiting or diarrhea without maximal medical intervention)
