  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, single-arm, multi-center, evaluation will collect clinical data in a
      post-market setting. The three types of procedures studied will be colectomy, gynecological,
      and thoracic. Investigators will perform each procedure using the device in compliance with
      their standard surgical approach and the ENSEAL X1 instructions for use.

      The primary objective of this study is to prospectively generate device specific clinical
      data related to hemostasis in a post-market setting using the ENSEAL X1 per its instructions
      for use. There will be no blinding or planned interim analysis in this study.
