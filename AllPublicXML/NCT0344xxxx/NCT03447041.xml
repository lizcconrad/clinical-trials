      This study is to inquiry the contrast sensitivity function in the 50 eyes of keratoplasty
      patients with quick contrast sensitivity function (quick CSF), as well the relationship
      between visual quality.

      Keratoplasty, also known as corneal transplantation, is a surgical procedure in which a
      damaged or diseased cornea is replaced entirely (penetrating keratoplasty) or partially
      (lamellar keratoplasty) by a donated corneal graft. The postoperative refractive error,
      post-keratoplasty astigmatism particularly is one of the most important factors that
      contribute to poor visual outcome following successful keratoplasty. This study is to inquiry
      the contrast sensitivity function in the keratoplasty patients with quick contrast
      sensitivity function (quick CSF), as well the relationship between visual quality.

      50 eyes of 50 keratopathy patients with corneal transplantation more than 1 year were
      included in this study. All participants underwent an ophthalmic examination that included
      slit-lamp biomicroscopy, visual acuity, quick CSF under full optical correction, 9-SF life
      quality questionnaire and fundus examination. Then the normal group would be covered by the
      positive spherical lens of 1.0D to 6.0D to repress the BCVA to 0.1 to 0.9 respectively to
      compare the visual functions with the keratoplasty patients on the same visual acuity.

    <description>Mark the center of the host cornea with a Sinskey hook. Use calipers to measure the corneal diameter to determine the appropriate size for donor trephine.
Trephine the donor tissue, typically aiming for 0.25 or 0.5 mm larger than the planned host trephination.
Trephinate the host cornea to approximately 90% depth.
Create a paracentesis in the trephination groove or the corneal periphery, and inject Healon into the anterior chamber to preserve anterior chamber depth and stability.
After using a blade to enter the eye through the trephination groove, resect the host cornea tissue using curved corneal scissors.
Secure the donor graft to the host corneal tissue using interrupted and/or running 10-0 nylon sutures.</description>
