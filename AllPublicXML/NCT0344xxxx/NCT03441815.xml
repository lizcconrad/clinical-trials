    <textblock>
      A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase I clinical study of the safety and
      tolerability of increasing doses of XC8 after single and repeated oral administration in
      healthy volunteers. The volunteers received the study drug once, and then continued daily
      intake for 14 days after a 6-day break.

      The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability profile for
      XC8 after single and multiple administration based on the frequency and severity of adverse
      events and changes in vital signs, laboratory results, electrocardiography and results of the
      physical examination.

      The secondary objective of the study was to assess pharmacokinetics of XC8.

    <textblock>
      One Russian center was approved for participation in this study. One center was initiated.
      Healthy volunteers were enrolled in 1 center. The study consisted of 4 periods: screening,
      single administration, multiple administration and follow-up.

      All eligible subjects were randomized into the study in appropriate cohort groups
      sequentially.

      Cohort 1 - XC8 or Placebo 2 mg once and then daily 14 days after a 6-day break; Cohort 2 -
      XC8 or Placebo 10 mg once and then daily during 14 days after a 6-day break; Cohort 3 - XC8
      or Placebo 50 mg once and then daily during 14 days after a 6-day break; Cohort 4 - XC8 or
      Placebo 200 mg once and then daily during 14 days after a 6-day break.

      The decision regarding increasing of the study drug dose for a subsequent cohort was made by
      the Data Safety Monitoring Committee on the basis of preliminary safety results assessment.

      A total of 20 volunteers received XC8 (2 mg, 10 mg, 50 mg or 200 mg) and a total of 8
      volunteers received the placebo during the study participation. The follow-up period lasted
      for 4 weeks.

    <intervention_model_description>The dose cohorts were included into the study subsequently based on preliminary safety results evaluation performed by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee. 4 doses of XC8/placebo (2 mg, 10 mg, 50 mg and 200 mg) were used in the study.The duration of exposure to the study drug was 15 days in each cohort: Day 1, once, at the step of single administration, and then in 6 days, daily, 1 time a day for 14 days at the step of multiple administration.</intervention_model_description>
