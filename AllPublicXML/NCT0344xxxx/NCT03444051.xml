  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study compared quality of histological sampling of pancreatic EUS-FNB with
      the 20-gauge Procore® and 22-gauge Acquire® needles. In total, 68 patients were recruited.
      Histological diagnosis was achieved and a histological core biopsy was obtained in 82% of
      patients (28/34) in the 20-gauge Procore® group and 97% of patients (33/34) in the 22-gauge
      Acquire® group (P=0.1). Core biopsy specimens obtained were significantly longer with the
      22-gauge Acquire® needle with a mean cumulative length of tissue core biopsies per needle
      pass of 4,33±3,46mm vs. 7,9±4,35mm for the 20-gauge Procore® (P&lt;0,01). Reproducibility of
      this simple histological criterion was validated in intra and inter-observer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between March and December 2017, 68 EUS-FNB were consecutively performed in our unit for a
      pancreatic or peripancreatic mass. The choice of the needle depended upon the availability at
      the time of admission: 34 punctures were performed with a 20-gauge Procore®, and 34 with a
      22-gauge Acquire®. Histological material was studied in a blinded manner with respect to the
      needle, and cumulative length of tissue core biopsies per needle pass was determined. Intra
      and inter-observer variability of this criterion was then evaluated.

        All consecutive patients ≥18 who were referred for EUS-FNB for solid pancreatic or
        peripancreatic mass were included. The use of EUS-FNB needle was determined during EUS if
        the examination confirmed the presence of a pancreatic or peri-pancreatic
        non-hyper-vascular mass (on Doppler examination).

        According to the period of admission, the 20-gauge Procore® (Wilson Cook Medical,
        Winston-Salem, NC) and 22-gauge Acquire® needles (Boston Scientific Natick, MA) were
        alternatively available depending on the order (made in batches of 5 units). So, patients
        were included either in the 20-gauge Procore® group or the 22-gauge Acquire® group.

        Patients could be switched via a crossover procedure to a second EUS-FNB with the
        competitive needle if the first one failed to give histologic mass characterization:
        failure was recorded to the first needle group, and the second EUS-FNB performed with the
        alternate needle was recorded in the other group.
