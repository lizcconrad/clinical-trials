    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a serious and often fatal complication of connective
      tissue diseases including systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. It has been
      reported primarily from European series that the prevalence of PAH in patients with
      connective tissue diseases particularly systemic sclerosis is as high as 15-20%. However,
      given the paucity of medical literature in the area from Chinese population, the prevalence
      of PAH amongst Chinese patients with these conditions is largely unknown. Even worse, PAH is
      often undiagnosed amongst patients with connective tissue diseases due to the lack of
      awareness and/or access to echocardiography, which is a non-invasive first-line screening
      tool for PAH. As a result, most patients at diagnosis of PAH are at a relatively late stage,
      rendering pharmacological treatment less effective. Here, the investigators propose a
      territory-wide pulmonary hypertension screening for patients with connective tissue disease
      in order to (1) detect pulmonary hypertension amongst patients with connective tissue disease
      through systematic screening, and (2) understand the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in
      Chinese patients with connective tissue diseases.

      Objectives:

        1. To detect pulmonary hypertension amongst patients with connective tissue diseases
           through systematic screening

        2. To understand the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in Chinese patients with
           connective tissue diseases

      Study design:

      The study is a territory-wide pulmonary hypertension screening project. Patients fulfilling
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria will undergo screen echocardiography as baseline to
      detect subclinical pulmonary hypertension.

      Screening procedure:

      Participants will undergo usual clinical assessment by the rheumatology teams of the parent
      hospitals including standard 12-lead ECG and 6-minute hall walk distance. then they will be
      referred to the Division of Cardiology, the Department of Medicine, the University of Hong
      Kong for (1) Echocardiography and (2) BNP (or pro-NT BNP) assay. The echocardiography will be
      performed based on the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Respiratory Society
      (ERS) Guidelines. The echocardiographic probability of pulmonary hypertension will be
      determined (low, intermediate, and high).

      Statistical analysis and power calculation:

      There are no studies on which to calculate a power equation, because there are no previous
      reports on the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in Chinese rheumatological patients. The
      sample size is based on our local prevalence of the rheumatological diseases.

      Continuous variables will be expressed in mean ± SD. Statistical comparisons were performed
      using Student's t test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. The outcomes would be
      analyzed.
