    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of Droxidopa for the treatment of
      fatigue in patients with Parkinsonism by the Visual Analog Fatigue Scale (VAFS). This is a
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial for 3 months where half the
      subjects will receive placebo and the other half will receive Droxidopa. Following this will
      be a wash-out period of 7 days and then all subjects will receive Droxidopa for 3 months
      during the open-label phase.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinsonism, is a group of symptoms seen in several diseases, including Parkinson's Disease.
      In Parkinsonism, a patient may become stiff, have smaller and slower movements, develop a
      tremor (shaking of the arms or legs), have decreased facial expression, and a softer voice.

      Fatigue is a common symptom that causes suffering and stress in diseases that affect the
      brain. Over 50% of patients with Parkinsonism report fatigue as one of their top three
      symptoms that make their life more difficult. Currently, there are no evidence-based
      guidelines for treating fatigue in Parkinson's Disease, and no effective medications or
      therapeutic modalities exist for fatigue symptoms in patients with Parkinson's Disease.

      Droxidopa (also known by the trade name NORTHERA) is a safe and well tolerated medication
      which has been approved in USA for the treatment of orthostatic dizziness or light headedness
      in patients with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension
      associated with primary autonomic failure (Parkinson's Disease and Multiple System Atrophy),
      Dopamine Beta Hydroxylase Deficiency, or Non Diabetic Autonomic Neuropathy.

      Fatigue may be due to diminished levels of norepinephrine in Parkinson's Disease. The locus
      coeruleus, one of the major sources of norepinephrine, is affected during the preclinical
      phase of Parkinson's Disease during stage 2 of Braak pathology staging. Norepinephrine is the
      final metabolite of dopamine, therefore by adding exogenous norepinephrine, it may be
      possible to control some of the motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinsonism. Norepinephrine
      is the final metabolite of droxidopa, and it is still unclear if it passes the blood-brain
      barrier. This pilot study is to measure the efficacy and safety of droxidopa in Parkinsonism
      patients with fatigue.
