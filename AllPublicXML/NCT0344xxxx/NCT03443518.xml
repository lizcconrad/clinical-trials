  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was introduced in 1990 for the first time as a minimally
      invasive procedure instead of the conventional open surgical repair, with the aim to decrease
      morbidity and mortality . Nowadays EVAR has become an acceptable management for patients with
      infra-renal aortic aneurysms (AAA) . A lot of anesthetic techniques have been used
      successfully for EVAR. EVAR requires sedative analgesic medications to achieve an acceptable
      level of comfort to the patient and cardiorespiratory stability.

      This is prospective randomized single blinded study of patients presenting with aorto-iliac
      aneurysm who will undergo EVAR. Patient's demographic data will be assessed, as well as
      clinical presentation, intraoperative complications.

      30 patients undergoing elective EVAR will be included and will be divided equally into 2
      groups.

      First group is the psoas compartment block (PCB) (15 patients): 30 ml of bupivacaine 0.25%
      will be infused over 3 minutes at the anatomical landmark.

      Second group is the LA and remifentanil group (LR) (15 patients): lidocaine 5 ml of 2% will
      be injected subcutaneous as local infiltration then remifentanil infusion with rate 0.03-0.1
      μg kg−1 min−1. to achieve visual analog scale (VAS) 3 or less.

      Vital date will be recorded as baseline then every 5 minutes till the end of the procedure.
      VAS will be recorded as baseline then every 5 minutes till the end of the procedure. Also
      stress response which will be measured subjectively as vital data and VAS and objectively as
      cortisol level in the blood which will be measured as base line and immediate after the end
      of the procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anatomical, imaging and clinical studies suggest that psoas compartment block (PCB) which was
      done at L2-L3 level has a high possibility to include L1-L2 roots, and thus can be suitable
      for inguinal surgery. In our study, the investigators introduce a modified PCB which will be
      performed in lateral decubitus by a 120 mm stimulated needle inserted at the junction between
      the lateral third and the medial two-thirds of a line drawn at L2-L3 interspace, between the
      interspinous line and a line passing through the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS),
      parallel to the interspinous line . If twitching of the anterior thigh area is observed, the
      needle is moved slight cranially. When twitching of the inguinal field is observed,
      bupivacaine 0.5% 30 ml, will be injected

    <description>The primary outcome was Visual Analog Scale (VAS) to assess perioperative analgesia and pain management.
Pain was assessed using the 100-mm visual analog scale, ranging from 0 to 100. The lowest score is 0 (no pain/excellent analgesia) and the highest score is 100 (Max pain).</description>
