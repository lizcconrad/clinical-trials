  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To achieve optimal clinical outcomes with imatinib in GIST patients, it is crucial to
      maintain standard imatinib dose. Skin rash is a relatively common and sometimes severe
      adverse event of imatinib in GIST patients and may affect imatinib compliance. Our previous
      retrospective study suggested that severe skin rash induced by imatinib can be managed by
      systemic steroid without imatinib dose interruption or reduction. This phase II study was
      conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of systemic steroid in GIST patients with
      imatinib-associated severe skin rash.
