  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general purpose of the study is to determine whether yoga is an effective method for
      treating Generalized Anxiety (GAD), and its relative efficacy compared to a standard
      psychosocial intervention. This five-year multi-site study will examine the comparative
      efficacy of yoga, CBT, and stress education, a previously employed control condition, for
      patients with GAD. Across 2 enrolling centers (BU and MGH) 230 patients will be randomized
      with GAD to one of three 12 session weekly study treatments: 12-weekly yoga (n=95), CBT
      (n=95), or stress education (SE: n=40). Independent clinical assessments will occur before
      the 12-session intervention phase, at mid-treatment, after the intervention, and at 6-month
      follow-up. All clinician-rated outcomes will be assessed by trained Independent Evaluators
      (IEs) blind to treatment assignment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators hypothesize that Yoga and Cognitive Beahvioral Therapy (CBT) will each be
      superior to Stress Education (SE) at post-treatment follow up, and Yoga and CBT will not
      differ based on equivalency analyses. Treatment changes during yoga are mediated via changes
      in mindfulness and changes in vagal tone, whereas changes in CBT are mediated via changes in
      maladaptive cognitions.
