  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      15 patients who have completed the Baylor Martha Foster Lung Center Pulmonary Rehabilitation
      Program at least six months ago will be selected to participate in a 12 week training program
      with six months of follow up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be consented and evaluated prior to beginning the Harmonica Training. Subjects
      will undergo spirometry testing, six minute walk testing and inspiratory capacity,
      inspiratory and expiratory respiratory muscle strength will be measured. A music therapist
      will evaluate their ability to assess the participant's ability to play the harmonica and
      offer assistance during the training. Subjects will complete a self-reported depression,
      shortness of breath, and quality of life questionnaire. All evaluations and questionnaires
      will be completed before and after the 12 week program and six months after the training
      program.

      They will be trained to play the Harmonica and practice as a group during a twelve week
      program, for one hour a day, one day a week with the Instructors, one is a Registered
      Respiratory Therapist and the other is a music therapist, who will evaluate their ability and
      offer assistance. The music therapist will meet individually with each study participant at
      the beginning of the study to assess participants' harmonica playing ability.

      They are required to practice at home (individually) in between classes for 30 minutes five
      days a week outside the formal training hour with the group. They may use oxygen as
      prescribed by their physician during the training. The training booklet includes information
      to help the subject with COPD understand how this program is designed to help them. They will
      also be given instructions on how to clean the harmonica and infection control measures to
      use during the program to prevent infections that could occur using the harmonica.
