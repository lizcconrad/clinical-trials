  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children's education students are able to identify a possible emergency and in their case act
      appropriately.

      The authors think that the propsed training will improve the knowledge, change the attitude
      and improve their practical skills, and also retain the information over time.

    <textblock>
      Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) formation in children and teachers is a current and high
      impact topic in public health: with an appropriate training anyone can save life (Böttiger,
      2015). Primary school students are willing to learn CPR and they are also Carriers of
      knowledge among their surroundings like family or friends (Martínez, 2015).

      The authors propose a clinical trial to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and skills in
      primary education students of various schools, before and after a CPR formation.

      The schools will be previously randomized in intervention group and control group. Once the
      intervention has been completed and the results obtained, training equal to the intervention
      will be offered to the control schools. In the bibliographic search no validated
      questionnaires in CPR learning among primary education students has been found.

    <description>The intervention will consist in carrying out an initial theoretical training on how to act in case of attending an emergency, with graphic support of slides (power-point) during 5 minutes, followed by a practical part with the projection of the video of a song and with a &quot;role play&quot; activity for 15 minutes, to remember the helpline number for emergencies (112) and relate it to the mnemonic mouth-nose-eyes. At the beginning and at the end of the theoretical-practical activity, the evaluation questionnaires will be administered to each one of the students.</description>

    <description>The sham intervention for the control group will consist in providing a generic formation on the cardiopulmonary arrest, with graphic support of slides (power-point) during 10 minutes, without specifying the telephone number of assistance for emergencies or the mnemonics mouth-nose-eyes. At the beginning and at the end of the theoretical activity, the evaluation questionnaires will be administered to each one of the students.</description>
