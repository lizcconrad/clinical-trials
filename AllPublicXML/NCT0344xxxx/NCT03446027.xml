  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intermittent claudication (IC) is caused by a blockage in the artery of the leg, causing
      muscle pain. Although some evidence of the efficacy of neuromuscular electrical stimulation
      (NMES) in the management of patients with IC exists, further high quality research is
      required. This proposed study is vital to identify the contribution of clinical change using
      NMES, compared to the current gold standard recommended practice of supervised exercise
      therapy (SET) and, actual standard of care offered in the majority of the UK and Ireland,
      including best medical therapy (BMT). The device is expected to increase the walking distance
      in patients with intermittent claudication (IC), and therefore have a benefit on the same
      when provided in addition to supervised exercise programmes. It is also expected to cause a
      reduction in pain symptoms and reduced likelihood of major intervention in late stage
      peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The principal research objective is to assess the clinical
      efficacy of a neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) device as an adjunct to the local
      standard care that is available at the study randomisation sites, in order to improve walking
      distance in patients with intermittent claudication (IC).

    <measure>Haemodynamic assessment - Duplex ultrasonography</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 month, 6 month and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Using an arterial ultrasound probe and pre-set volume flow algorithms on a duplex ultrasound machine, flow within the common femoral artery (CFA), of the most affected limb, will be measured, approximately 5cm below the mid-inguinal point at the groin. Measures include volume flow (VF, cc/min) and time-averaged mean volume (TAMV, cm/s) to assess whether using the device increases these measurements.</description>

    <description>The single fibre laser optical probe of the LDF machine will be positioned on the dorsal aspect of the foot using single use adhesive pads. Skin surface temperature, as a measure of superficial skin blood flow will be measured to assess whether using the device increases this measurement.</description>

    <description>The brachial blood pressure from the right arm using a manual blood pressure monitor cuff and Doppler will be recorded after 5 minutes of resting supine on a couch. The systolic blood pressure of the anterior tibial artery and posterior tibial artery at the ankle will also be recorded using the cuff and Dopplermethod. The ratio of the systolic brachial and ankle pressures will form the ABPI measurement.</description>

The analyses will be based on a (i) patient level in-trial cost-effectiveness analysis, (ii) a decision model and (iii) budget impact assessment.
