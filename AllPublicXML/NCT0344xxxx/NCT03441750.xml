    <textblock>
      The increasing prevalence of prediabetes had been documented in the recent national
      surveillance in China. Prediabetes is an important risk factor for developing overt Diabetes
      and macro/micro vascular diseases. Pharmaceutical medications such as metformin had been
      proved effective in preventing Diabetes. Local studies are in need to guide the clinicians in
      their daily practice to prevent Diabetes in China. Therefore, China DPP is designed and
      conducted to compare the efficacy of metformin combined with lifestyle intervention versus
      lifestyle intervention alone in preventing Diabetes.
