  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate sociodemographic background of youth drug abuse, as well as
      psychiatric comorbidities with the help of self-report questionnaires and structured
      diagnostic interviews. The study simultaneously intends to evaluate long term cortisol levels
      in a single hair sample. Furthermore, three intravenous blood samples will be obtained from
      each participant in the course of the treatment in order to investigate substance related
      changes in immune and stress Systems, as well as methylation based changes associated with
      vulnerability and dependency.

      As the efficacy of currently available treatment options for addiction disorders is still
      unacceptably low, our study also aims to adapt, apply and evaluate new methods of treatment,
      such as a an adapted short term Matrix therapy for adolescents suffering from addiction
      disorders and their parents. Therapy outcomes, parental stress levels and learned skills will
      be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As numbers of youth drug abuse have grown rapidly within the last couple of years, research
      on youth drug abuse and dependency has taken a new and vital role within the public
      healthcare system. For this reason, it is crucial to find new ways to effectively integrate
      adolescent patients into the health care system, as well as assign them to treatment options
      tailor made for the specific challenges and needs of this population. This study aims to
      investigate (a) sociodemographic background and psychiatric comorbidities in connection with
      youth drug abuse and dependency to enhance understanding of epidemiologic risk factors for
      developing drug dependency in adolescence, as well as benefit future treatment options. It
      further aims to investigate (b) molecular and epigenetic mechanisms of addiction disorders in
      adolescents by analyzing methylation pattern, as well as proteome analysis of peripheral
      immune markers. The investigator's aim is a better understanding of the multimodal biological
      underpinnings of risk/resilience for addiction in youth on the molecular, cellular and
      circuit levels with a special focus on the changes within the stress and immune system in
      patients with addiction disorders and their family members.

      Another research interest of this study concerns (c) adapting and evaluating new treatment
      options, tailor made for the adolescent population. For this reason the investigators aim to
      adapt, implement and evaluate a therapeutic program according to the Matrix model for the
      treatment of substance abuse, which consists of two group therapies for patients, as well as
      their parents (Evaluation time points: T0, T1, T2 and T3). Last, this study aims to (d)
      evaluate parental stress levels, parental communication skills and knowledge in connection
      with youth drug abuse.
