    <intervention_model_description>This is a Phase 1 study of E7130 in participants with advanced solid tumors. This study will be conducted in 2 parts (Part 1 and Part 2). Part 1 will be the dose escalation portion of this study, conducted to assess dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in participants with solid tumors. The dosage and the duration of the treatment cycle in Part 2 will be determined based on the data from Part 1. Part 2 will be comprised of cohort expansions to further characterize the safety and tolerability of E7130.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Part 1 (Cycle 1; 28 days): The first cohort of 3 participants will receive 25 micrograms per meters squared (μg/m^2) of E7130, on Day 1 and Day 15 as an intravenous infusion. If a drug-related Grade 2 or higher toxicity is not observed in the initial cohort, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be evaluated in successive dose levels with single participants until such a toxicity is observed. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is observed, participants will be administered E7130 at the determined dose level on Days 1 and 15 of every 28-day cycle until they meet any of the criteria for discontinuation. Part 2: Participants with Her2-negative breast cancer and other solid tumors will be evaluated at the dose level determined in Part 1 in a 2-week regimen based on the evaluations in Part 1.</description>

If a drug-related Grade 2 or higher toxicity is not observed in the initial cohort, DLTs will be evaluated in successive dose levels with single participants until such a toxicity is observed. Once the MTD is observed, participants will be administered E7130 at the determined dose level on Day 1 of every 3-week cycle until they meet any of the criteria for discontinuation.
