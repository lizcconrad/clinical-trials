  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, surgical treatment of patients with chronic otitis media is one of the most
      important treatment methods. However, the current results show that some patients with
      eustachian tube dysfunction can't reconstruct the gas-containing structure of the middle ear
      after operation.

      This is a randomized controlled trial that aims to evaluate the therapeutic effect of balloon
      eustachian tuboplasty (BET) for the treatment in chronic otitis media (COM) with eustachian
      tube dysfunction (ETD). This future study will aim to address the question: Does BET gain
      better recovery of auditory function and lower recurrence rate in chronic otitis media with
      eustachian tube dysfunction?
