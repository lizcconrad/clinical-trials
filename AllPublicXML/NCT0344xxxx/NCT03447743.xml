  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this R34 proposal is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and
      short-term outcomes associated with an innovative service delivery model to increase
      adherence to extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) during the transition from jail to the
      community for rural women with opioid use disorder (OUD). The significance of this study is
      grounded in the public health emergency associated with the opioid epidemic in rural
      Appalachia, the increased vulnerability of rural women with OUD, and the dearth of available
      and accessible evidence-based treatment in the region. This study has potential to make a
      significant contribution to the OUD treatment field by advancing knowledge on innovative
      service delivery models to increase access to evidence-based treatment to reduce the
      prevalence of opioid use disorders and related health disparities among hard-to-reach,
      high-risk, underserved populations.

      The overall aim of this R34 proposal is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and
      short-term outcomes associated with an innovative service delivery model to increase
      adherence to extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) during the transition from jail to the
      community for rural women with opioid use disorder (OUD). The significance of this study is
      grounded in the public health emergency associated with the opioid epidemic in rural
      Appalachia, the increased vulnerability of rural women with OUD, and the dearth of available
      and accessible evidence-based treatment in the region. This R34 has potential to make a
      significant contribution to the OUD treatment field by advancing knowledge on innovative
      service delivery models to increase access to evidence-based treatment to reduce high-risk
      opioid use and related health disparities among hard-to-reach, high-risk, underserved
      populations. The study will be accomplished through two specific aims: (1) Adapt XR-NTX
      services for use in community supervision (P&amp;P) offices to increase adherence during re-entry
      from jail for rural women with OUD. (2) Examine feasibility, acceptability, and short-term
      outcomes of XR-NTX adherence and relapse to opioid use through a small pilot trial with 60
      rural women with OUD. The pilot trial will include OUD screening, medical evaluation, XR-NTX
      initiation prior to jail release, and random assignment to one of two community re-entry
      treatment models to receive on-going XR-NTX injections in the community after release in
      either: (1) A local rural P&amp;P office (n=30), or (2) Services as Usual (n=30), referral to a
      community clinic). If this study establishes feasibility of this innovative community-based
      treatment model for XR-NTX in a rural, underserved area, findings will be used to develop an
      R01 application to test the approach in a larger RCT during community re-entry from jail
      among high-risk rural women with OUD in Appalachia. The long-term goal of this research is to
      increase access to evidence-based treatment for OUD among high-risk, underserved populations.
