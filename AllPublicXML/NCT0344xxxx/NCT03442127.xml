  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Internet-based program CaringGuidance™ After Breast Cancer Diagnosis and its new
      electronic Summary Report (CGSR) tool are hypothesized to empower patients to raise their
      emotional and social concerns during oncology consultations and assist medical oncology
      clinicians in identifying patient needs. The purpose of this study is to assess satisfaction
      and feasibility of clinical use of the new patient guided, Internet-based CGSR to support
      patient-clinician communication in the outpatient breast oncology clinic. The study will
      enroll 30 women who are receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer. They will all have access
      to the CaringGuidance™ program for at home use on computer or mobile device for approximately
      one month (or up to 6 months depending on when they return to their primary medical
      oncologist for evaluation). Following this, these women will meet with the researcher or
      research assistant prior to a medical oncology appointment and create a CGSR on an iPad while
      they talk through the process with the researcher. Women will complete demographic data and
      assessment of coping prior to receiving access to the program and at this appointment. These
      assessments will help characterize the emotional state at the time of working with the
      program and the CGSR, these measures are not to assess the efficacy of the program.
      Clinicians will complete a brief, one-time demographics survey prior to enrollment of
      patients to the study. Women will take the CGSR into their oncology appointment, record the
      appointment if she and the physician have consented to this, and use the CGSR as much or as
      little as desired. Clinicians will complete a brief satisfaction survey following the
      appointment and patients will debrief (recorded) about whether they used the CGSR and their
      impressions following the appointment. Data will be analyzed primarily qualitatively to
      determine women's appraisal of the functionality, content satisfaction and usability of the
      CGSR and the communication patterns, topics discussed during the appointment and
      patient/clinician satisfaction with communication during the appointment when the CGSR was
      available for use. Data will be used for future modification of the CGSR to assure that it
      meets patients' needs prior to initiating a larger scale trial.

    <description>quantitative measure of usability of the form by the System Usability Scale a 10 item scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree) developed by John Brookes 1986 at Digital Equipment Corporation and used in multiple studies.The participant's scores for each question are converted to a new number, added together and then multiplied by 2.5 to convert the original scores of 0-40 to 0-100. Though the scores are 0-100, these are not percentages and should be considered only in terms of their percentile ranking.
Based on research, a System Usability Scale score above a 68 would be considered above average and anything below 68 is below average, however the best way to interpret your results involves &quot;normalizing&quot; the scores to produce a percentile ranking.</description>
