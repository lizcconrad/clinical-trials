      The study is designated to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of escalating multiple oral doses of AEF0117 in healthy adult male and
      female subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this protocol is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of escalating multiple oral doses of AEF0117. This will be a
      single center study in healthy male and female subjects. The study design will be a
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single period, parallel group, multiple dose
      escalation with AEF0117.

      Three dose levels are planned for the study with 8 subjects (6 active and 2 placebo) per dose
      level:

      Dose Level I - 0.6 mg multiple oral dose of AEF0117 given on the morning of Day 1 to Day 7
      Dose Level II - 2 mg multiple oral dose of AEF0117 given on the morning of Day 1 to Day 7
      Dose Level III - 6 mg multiple oral dose of AEF0117 given on the morning of Day 1 to Day 7

      The planned dose escalation schema may be amended based on the emerging PK and safety data,
      and an additional cohort may be added. Smaller dose escalation increments can also be
      implemented based on safety and PK results of previous dose levels. Each subject will
      participate in only one dose group.

      Administration of AEF0117 to each dose cohort should not occur before participants in the
      previous dose cohort have been treated and data i.e. safety results and PK from those
      participants are reviewed in accordance with the protocol. Eligible subjects will be admitted
      to the research clinic at midday prior to dosing (Day -1) and remain in house until Day 14.
      Subsequently subjects will return to the research facility on an outpatient basis to have PK
      and safety assessments at 216 and 264 hours (Day 16 and Day 18) after the last dose (Day 7).
      PK samples and safety assessments will be done pre-dose and at different times post-dose.

      Randomized subjects will receive a single oral dose per day on Days 1 through 7. Serial PK
      and PD blood samples and urine PK collections will be performed for 24 hours after the first
      dose administration (Day 1). Pre-dose PK and PD blood samples will then be obtained on Days
      3, 4, 5 and 6 prior to the daily dose administration. Serial PK and PD blood samples and
      urine collections will be also performed for 48 hours after the last dose (Day 7), and blood
      samples will be obtained at 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 216 and 264 hours after the last dose (Day
      7).

      Safety monitoring (physical examinations, vital sign measurement, 12 lead ECGs, clinical
      safety laboratory tests, and adverse event monitoring) will be performed throughout the
      study. Psychometrics tests (Bond &amp; Lader VAS, ARCI, POMS) will be performed on D1 and D7 at
      pre-dose, tmax and 24 hours post-dose. CSSRS test will be performed at pre-dose of D1 and at
      D8. tmax will be determine according to PK results obtained in the AEF0117-101 clinical
      study. Subjects will have a final follow up/Study termination safety evaluation on Day 18.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be a healthy, non-smoking or smoking (&lt;10 cigarettes per day) male of any race, at
             least 18 years old and no more than 55 years old, inclusive. As the effect of the
             study drug on sperm is still unknown, male subjects should refrain from donating sperm
             or plan a pregnancy with their partner throughout the study and after 90 days, and
             must report immediately to the study doctor if its partner becomes pregnant during the
             study and after 90 days. The male subject will have to use double-barrier
             contraceptive methods: male condoms and spermicide.

          2. Be a healthy, non-smoking or smoking (&lt;10 cigarettes per day) female of
             non-child-bearing potential between 18 years of age and 55 years of age, inclusive.
             Females may be accepted if they are documented to be surgically sterile (e.g.,
             hysterectomy, tubal ligation) or post-menopausal [amenorrhea &gt;1 year and FSH
             &gt;25.8mlU/mL, cut off from Labcorp] with a negative pregnancy test. At least 30% of

             investigator. The Non Clinical Significant nature of the deviation will result from
             the integration of a full clinical examination with physical examination and lab tests
             in that contest by a certified physician.

             within a period of 30 days prior to receiving study medication (for investigational
             drugs with an elimination half-life greater than 10 days, this will be extended to 60
             days).

         13. Use of any prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) drug therapy, including herbal,
             homeopathic, vitamins, minerals and nutritional supplements, bodybuilding supplements

             days). The use of any food supplement or body cream containing pregnenolone or any
             other steroid including phytosteroids.

             and antipsychotics), or medication that alters the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal
             (HPA) Axis functioning and any medications that alter heart rate or skin conductance
             monitoring

         16. Unable to follow the restrictions outlined in the protocol.
