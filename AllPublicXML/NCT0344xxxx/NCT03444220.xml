  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a progressive multi-organ disorder with high disease burden. Life
      expectancy in SSc is reduced by 25-40 years, mainly due to cardiopulmonary and
      gastro-intestinal (GI) disease involvement; and a very poor response to available treatment.
      Aiming to improve treatment for SSc, the ReSScue project will determine the therapeutic
      potential of standardized, cultivated gut microbiome transplantation (GMT), and assess the
      mechanisms by which this novel intervention strategy works. This approach is rationalized by
      studies indicating that skewed gut microbiomes could act as major, environmental risk factors
      in SSc; and thereby be rational targets for therapeutic manipulation. ReSScue is set up as a
      4 months randomized double blind trial involving the University Hospital in Oslo. Trial
      participants will be recruited from the population-based, nationwide SSc cohort. Intervention
      will be by GMT or placebo. Primary end point is reduction in SSc disease activity, while
      secondary outcomes include safety, explorative clinical parameters, changes in oral, skin and
      gut microbiomes, and in immune cell phenotypes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind clinical trial testing intervention by standardized GMT.
      The study cohort will include 10 SSc patients with GI symptoms. Evaluation of end points is
      at 16 weeks. The trial is set up with six study visits. Patient recruitment, eligibility
      screening and retrieval of informed consent will be performed at OUS before inclusion. At
      visit 1, and 6 patients will undergo clinical examination, PFTs, at all visits clinical
      examination and sampling of biological material.
