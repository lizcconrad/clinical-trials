  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that dietary weight loss (WL) through
      alternate day fasting (ADF) will enhance appetite control, health markers and wellbeing
      following WL compared to standard daily calorie restriction (CR).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof of concept randomized controlled trial in which overweight/obese females will
      be randomised to a dietary weight loss intervention (ADF or CR) to achieve ≥5% WL.
      Behavioural measures of appetite control including ad libitum intake after a fixed meal, body
      composition, resting metabolic rate, measured physical activity and daily energy expenditure,
      sleep quality, energy balance regulating hormones, hedonic food reward and eating behaviour
      traits will be assessed before, during and after the WL intervention in those who reach the
      target weight loss within 12 weeks. After weight loss phase, participants will be given
      standard healthy eating and physical activity advice for weight maintenance and body weight
      will be followed up after weight loss at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months.
