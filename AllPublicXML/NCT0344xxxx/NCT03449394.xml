  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychological studies have shown that individuals tend to attribute causes of positive and
      negative events differently. Specifically, individuals hold an internalising or externalising
      bias of attribution which, in the case of particular patient groups, was found to polarize to
      the extreme. Such extreme attributional styles have found to have a direct impact on
      emotions, leading to a waning course of psychiatric disorders. This project aims to further
      examine the theoretical links between attributions and emotions using a transdiagnostic
      approach, and the effect of a 4-session process-based intervention on attributional biases.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>IPSAQ consists of hypothetical scenarios. Participants are required to think of a single, most likely causal explanation to each of the hypothesized situations, and then to categorize this cause as being internal, external-personal or external-situational.</description>

    <measure>Psychotic symptomatology as measured by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>

    <measure>Depressive symptomatology as measured by Beck Depression Inventory - II (BDI-II) and Calgary Depression Scale (CDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Beck Depression Inventory - II (BDI-II) is a 21-item self-report inventory that assesses symptoms of depression. Scores can range from 0 to 63, with higher scores reflecting greater symptom severity.

    <measure>Belief flexibility as measured by Maudsley Assessment of Delusions Schedule (MADS) and the BADE task</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Maudsley Assessment of Delusions Schedule (MADS) is a standardised interview assessment that records whether participants could consider possibility of being mistaken (PM) about their delusional experience, any possible alternative explanations for the experience (EoE), and their reaction to hypothetical contradiction (RTHC). BADE task is an experimental design for measuring participants' bias against disconfirmatory evidence.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>State-trait personality as measured by the State-Trait Personality Inventory (STPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>State-Trait Personality Inventory (STPI) consists of 8 self-report scales, each containing 10 items covering state and trait anger, anxiety, curiosity and depression.</description>
