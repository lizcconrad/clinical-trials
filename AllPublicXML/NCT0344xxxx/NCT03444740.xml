  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis that the prevalence of AD in uro-gynecologic patients with LUTS who are
      seeking medical help for their condition is higher than that of the general population
      (indicated by high scores at the ADNM-20; score above 48). Taking into consideration that
      affective disorders, anxiety and depression among patients with LUTS present with a
      prevalence of 17-23% [20] as well as through long personal experience, we hypothesize that
      the prevalence of AD in this group is 20%.
