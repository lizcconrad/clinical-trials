  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MM is a morbid disease associated with a poor outcome and while current therapies with new
      drugs have improved survival, MM still remains incurable in most patients. The only potential
      curative treatment remains allogeneic HSCT, as shown by our cohort of 92 NDMM patients who
      received a sibling tandem auto-allo Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) with an
      estimated 10-year progression free survival (PFS) of 43%. However, the high incidences of
      toxicities including chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) (up to 79%) and disease
      progression (up to 49%) impair improvement in cure rate. Using umbilical cord blood (CB) as
      an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) could be superior biologically
      because of their increased proliferative capacity, greater number of progeny with longer
      telomeres and better anti-tumor efficacy in presence of positive residual disease. Moreover,
      using CB has been shown to decrease incidence of chronic GVHD. However, CBs have the
      disadvantage of having a limited HSC dose leading to prolonged cytopenia and higher risk of
      infections.

      In a first in-human trial using CB expanded with the ECT-001 (UM171) molecule
      (clinicaltrial.gov # NCT02668315), the median net expansion of HSC was 36 fold, which allows
      for the selection of better HLA matched CB regardless of their lower HSC dose. Moreover, the
      ECT-001 expanded CBs have a different cell composition than regular CBs, with more than 25%
      of dendritic cell precursors. This, combined to better HLA matched CBs, may reduce chronic
      GVHD incidence and improve immune reconstitution. To date, 22 patients received an ECT-001
      expanded CB and the procedure proved to be safe and feasible.

      In this new trial, the goal is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ECT-001 expanded CB
      transplant in high risk MM patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution, prospective, phase I/II open-label study in a maximum of 20
      patients evaluating a novel treatment strategy in NDMM patients with high-risk disease who do
      not have a 6/6 compatible sibling donor. Participating patients will be from Hôpital
      Maisonneuve-Rosemont (HMR) or referred to HMR for this protocol. Newly diagnosed multiple
      myeloma patients will be evaluated for eligibility before or during the autologous stem cell
      transplant (ASCT) period. After a Bortezomib-based induction treatment (VTD, CyBorD, RVD or
      PAD [in patients with plasma cell leukemia]) for a minimum of 4 cycles, followed by Melphalan
      ≥ 140 mg/m2 and ASCT, eligible patients who accept to participate will undergo screening
      evaluation to receive a non myeloablative (NMA) allogeneic HSCT with ECT-001 expanded CB. It
      is estimated that 18 months will be necessary to enroll the targeted sample size.

      Once eligibility has been confirmed, study treatment will begin. After an ASCT, eligible
      patients will receive a conditioning regimen before receiving an outpatient NMA allogeneic
      HSCT with an ECT-001 expanded CB on day 0. Patients will be followed at least every week for
      the first 3 months, then every month, in the absence of GVHD, for disease evaluation and
      adverse events. Occurrence and severity of acute GVHD will be evaluated using the modified
      Glucksberg176 and IBMTR177 criteria, while chronic GVHD will be evaluated using the NIH178
      criteria.

      The trial will be terminated when all patients have been followed for 5 years after
      allogeneic HSCT.

Time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment will be correlated to the CD34+ and the CD34+CD45RA- dose (which includes all human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs): long term and short term repopulating cells) contained in the expanded graft. Expansion and cultures might change the characteristics and behaviour of CD34+ cells, hence the need to look at the correlation between primitive CD34+CD45RA- subpopulation and engraftment.</description>
