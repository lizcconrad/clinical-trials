  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of using an autologous mesenchymal
      stromal cell (MSC) coated fistula plug in people with fistulizing Crohn's disease. Autologous
      means these cells to coat the plug come from the patient.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to study the safety of autologous mesenchymal stromal cell transfer
      using a biomatrix (the Gore Bio-A Fistula Plug) in a Phase I study using a single dose of 20
      million cells. 5 patients (age 12 to 17 years) with Crohn's perianal fistulas will be
      enrolled.

      Subjects will undergo standard adjuvant therapy including drainage of infection and placement
      of a draining seton. Six weeks post placement of the draining seton, the seton will be
      replaced with the MSC loaded Gore fistula plug as per current clinical practice. The subjects
      will be subsequently followed for fistula response and closure for 24 months. This is an
      autologous product derived from the patient and used only for the same patient.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Males and females 12-17 years of age.

          2. Residents of the United States.

          3. Crohn's disease with single or multiple draining complex perianal fistulae (definition
             as below) for at least three months despite standard therapy (definition below).

          4. Concurrent therapies with corticosteroids, 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) drugs,
             thiopurines, methotrexate (MTX), antibiotics, and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
             therapy are permitted.

          5. All patients should have undergone a colonoscopy in last 12 months to rule out
             malignant or premalignant condition

          6. Have no contraindications to MR evaluations: e.g. pacemaker or magnetically active
             metal fragments, claustrophobia

             of MSCs: e.g. sepsis, pneumonia active serious infection or other conditions that
             would, in the opinion of the investigators, compromise the safety of the patient.

          3. Specific exclusions;

             a. Evidence of hepatitis B, C, or HIV

             previous example of fat-directed autoimmunity

          9. Previous allergic reaction to a perianal fistula plug.
