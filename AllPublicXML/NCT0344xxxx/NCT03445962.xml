  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is frequently reported in subjects with trisomy
      21. The consequences of this syndrome are expressed in various disorders such as cognitive
      and cardiovascular alterations. It is also reported a premature exhaustion with the
      achievement of various professional or recreational activities, as well as an increase in the
      frequency of daytime sleepiness. In trisomy 21, there are factors that are systematically
      associated with obstructive apnea. The identification of these factors would make it possible
      to diagnose OSAS earlier, under-diagnosed in the population with trisomy 21 even though these
      OSAS are associated with increased cardiovascular risks.

      The aim of this study is to identify the predictive factors associated with sleep apnea in
      the trisomy population in order to propose early detection.

      OSAS treatment in a young adult with Down syndrome could reduce physical fatigue apparition
      during various activities, reduce daytime sleepiness, and have a positive impact on physical
      fitness, and therefore more broadly on health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The predictive factors for OSA that will be studied are: physical activity level, dentofacial
      disharmonies, blood parameters, motor disabilities, heart rate variability parameters
      measured during sleep and during autonomic nervous stimulation by orthostatic test.

      All these factors will be linked to the data obtained by:

        1. polysomnography

        2. by the joint use of seismocardiography

      OSAS lead to many associated disorders, which identified early can be better supported to
      limit the deleterious effects of this OSAS:

      (i) a sudden and repeated activation of the sympathetic nervous system triggered by sleep
      fragmentation (ii) intermittent hypoxia associated with OSAS may increase insulin resistance
      through the involvement of an inflammatory state and oxidative stress.

      (iii) a significant level of diurnal fatigue limiting activities, thus promoting a sedentary
      lifestyle and increasing cardiovascular risk factors.

      Several secondary objectives will therefore be studied:

        1. Can OSAS be predicted by the existence of autonomic dysfunction?

        2. Can OSAS be predicted by specific biological disturbances?

        3. Can OSAS be predicted by the presence of a specific cranial structure?

        4. Can OSAS be predicted by an insufficient level of physical activity?

      Finally does the use seismocardiography make it possible to identify quickly and early these
      risk factors linked to OSAS?
