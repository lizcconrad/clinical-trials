      MRI will be performed on a 1.5T magnet. Patients will be scanned in an oblique prone position
      similar to how esophageal distention is assessed at barium fluoroscopy. The following
      sequences and rationale will be used for the examination:

      A sagittal 50mm thick multiphase FIESTA and multiphase SSFSE will be performed while the
      patient drinks water. The temporal resolution of the images will be approximately 1 image
      every 1.5-2 seconds. The images will be used to assess the lumen caliber and the wall
      thickness during maximal distension as pseudothickening can occur with decreased luminal
      distension.

      Sagittal SSFSE with fat suppression, sagittal FRFSE T2-weighted images with fat suppression,
      axial DWI and sagittal DWI will be performed to asses for edema and inflammation within the
      esophageal wall.

      axial FS SSFSE or FIESTA will be performed and targeted to the region of stricturing.

      Dynamic sagittal imaging will be performed following IV contrast to assess for mural
      hyperenhancement which can be seen mural inflammation and delayed enhancement which can be
      seen in fibrosis. Sequential acquisitions will be performed beginning at 40 seconds following
      IV contrast injection. Delayed acquisitions will be performed at 5 min and 7 min. Patients
      will be asked to perform swallowing during the image acquisition to reduce the potential for
      pseudoenhancement secondary to under distension.

    <intervention_model_description>Twenty patients with eosinophilic esophagitis will be studied. Ten of these patients will have mild to moderate stricture formation (narrowed segment &lt;8 cm in length and lumen diameter &gt; 12mm) and 10 will have small caliber esophagus (a narrowed segment &gt;8 cm in length with minimum diameter &lt; 10mm). These groups will be delineated by routine barium esophagography performed in all Mayo patients with eosinophilic esophagitis during their initial clinical evaluation. Patients will then undergo an 8 week treatment with 3 mg budesonide twice daily as per routine clinical treatment with clinically indicated follow up endoscopy with esophageal biopsies to assess mucosal response. All patients will complete the EESAI dysphagia score per routine practice at Mayo. MRI of the esophagus will be performed in these patients initially and upon completion of the 8 week course of steroid therapy.</intervention_model_description>
