  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a cross-over study the investigators evaluate the effects of natural (Panmol-B-Complex)
      versus synthetic vitamin B complexes to identify the bioavailability of distinct vitamins as
      well as long-term effects. The primary hypothesis for this study: &quot;Natural Vitamin
      B-complexes are as effective as synthetic Vitamin B-complexes or better.&quot; For this reason 30
      subjects (18 to 65y; BMI &gt;19 to &lt;29) were recruited for this study. The study population was
      divided into 2 groups of each 15 subjects in a cross-over trial. Vitamin supplementation
      consisted of Thiamine (2,77mg), Riboflavin (3,53mg), Niacin (40,32mg), Pantothenic acid
      (15,12mg), Pyridoxine (3,53mg), Biotin (0,13mg), Folic acid (0,50mg) and Cobalamin (6,3µg)
      per day in both groups. Blood samples are taken at baseline - 1.5h after vitamin
      supplementation - 4h - 7h - 6 weeks - wash out phase I (2 weeks); start cross-over: baseline
      - 1.5h after vitamin supplementation - 4h - 7h - 6 weeks - washout phase II (6 weeks). In
      case of main target criteria Thiamin, Riboflavin, Pyridoxine, Folic acid and Cobalamin were
      measured in serum as well as total peroxides (µmol/L), peroxidase-activity (U/L), total
      antioxidant status (mmol/L) and polyphenols (mmol/L).

      Design:

      Monocentric double-blind experiment

      Scientific background:

      Vitamin B-complex is water-soluble and essential for humans. Vitamin B deficiency is
      associated with neurologic diseases, heart insufficiency, diminished hormone production and
      maldigestion. Due to the fact that literature search did not reveal distinct information
      about natural versus synthetic Vitamin B-complexes this study was initiated to investigate
      bioavailability and long-term effects of natural Vitamin B-complexes in comparison to
      synthetic Vitamin B-complexes.

      Vitamin B complex was filled in capsules coated with gelatine (size 0, ivory-coloured). Daily
      dose = 3 capsules in the morning with 250ml water.

      Blinding/Randomization:

      The person in charge for manufacturing and blinding arranged an identical packaging of both
      verum as well as synthetic Vitamin B-complex. Each package consists of 126 capsules per
      subject and period. Each product was tagged with the subject-number and period (period I and
      period II).

      Study-subjects were blinded by the person in charge for randomization through a sealed
      envelope. The allocation was in the relation of 1:1 between group A (verum in period I and
      synthetic Vitamin B-complex in period II) and group B (synthetic Vitamin B-complex in period
      I and verum in period II). The ultimate subject list was forwarded to the person in charge
      for randomization after the run-in phase.

      Method:

      Blood sampling:

      Blood (max. 20ml) was collected in a seated position from an antecubital vein.

      Time schedule:

      Run-in-phase: 3 weeks (no supplementation) Determination of inclusion criteria, nutrition
      advice, randomization.

      Phase I: 6 weeks (supplementation) Group A - natural Vitamin B-complex supplementation every
      day Group B - synthetic Vitamin B-complex supplementation every day

      Blood sampling:

      First day:

      Fasting value (basic) - Vitamin B-complex supplementation - After 1.5 hours After 4 hours
      After 7 hours After 6 weeks

      Wash-out period: 2 weeks (without supplementation)

      Phase II: 6 weeks (supplementation) Group A - synthetic Vitamin B-complex supplementation
      every day Group B - natural Vitamin B-complex supplementation every day

      Blood sampling:

      First day:

      Fasting value (basic) - Vitamin B-complex supplementation - After 1.5 hours After 4 hours
      After 7 hours After 6 weeks

      Wash-out period II: 6 weeks (without supplementation) Final exam - last blood sampling

      Drop-out-criteria:

      Drawback Compliance (&lt;80% of Vitamin B-complexes) Supplementation of Vitamin B-complexes
      during run-in-phase or wash-out periods

      Primary-target parameters:

      Serum concentrations for vitamins B1, B2, B6, B9 and B12

      Secondary-target biomarkers:

      Serum concentrations for Total antioxidants, total peroxides, peroxidase-activity,
      polyphenols and homocystein.

      Biometry:

      Comparison of interventions in a cross-over approach descriptive and exploratory.

      Group comparison: Parametric and non-parametric cross-over comparison Gaussian distribution -
      (Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test with Lilliefors-significances, alpha =10%).

      Effect size: Two-sided 95%-confidence intervals

      Analysis:

      Intent-to-treat-analysis Per-protocol-analysis Full analysis set

      Vitamin B and Homocysteine analysis was done in a routine laboratory. Antioxidants (TAC),
      peroxidase-activity (EPA), peroxides (TOC) and polyphenols (PPm) were measured by the use of
      commercially available microtitre assays at a wavelength of 450 vs. 620 nm. In case of PPm a
      wavelength of 766nm was used.

      Implausible values will be scored as missing values. Missing values are not substituted.

      Presentation of results:

      Minimum-Median-Quartiles-Maximum-Mean-Standard deviation. Box Plots, Bar graph, tables.
