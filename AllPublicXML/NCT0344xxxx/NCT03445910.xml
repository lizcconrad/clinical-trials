  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances in clinical and laboratory techniques of Assisted Reproductive
      Technology (ART), the pregnancy rate remains around 30% per cycle. It has been estimated that
      50% to 75% of lost pregnancies are due to failure of implantation.

      The process of implantation is a locally controlled paracrine/juxtacrine-mediated phenomenon.
      Successful implantation depends on the synchronized &quot;cross-talk&quot; between a functional
      blastocyst and a &quot;receptive&quot; endometrium. This process leads to apposition, attachment and
      invasion of embryos and subsequent normal placentation. So the objective of this study is
      investigate the impact of intrauterine injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) at the
      day of ovum pick-up on implantation and pregnancy rates in patients with recurrent
      implantation failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The endometrium can only support implantation during a discrete period of about 6 to 9 days
      after LH peak; termed the &quot;window of implantation&quot;. During this period endometrial glandular
      epithelium is differentiated into a highly secretory state with the production of various
      cytokines and growth factors that facilitate implantation. In fact, several substances
      secreted from the embryo or the endometrium affect implantation. These include cyclic
      adenosine monophosphate, relaxin, gonadotropin, prostaglandin E2, and glycoprotein hormones.

      Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is the earliest blastocyst-derived signals received by the
      endometrium; it is transcribed as early as the 2-cell embryo stage. It is produced by the
      trophectodermal cells of the preimplantation blastocyst. Recent evidence suggests that hCG is
      also produced by the endometrial epithelial cells during the secretory.

      It has been shown that intrauterine injection of hCG before embryo transfer significantly
      improves pregnancy rates in IVF/ICSI cycles.
