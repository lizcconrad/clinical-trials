  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gait and mobility are among the functions frequently affected in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and
      have a negative impact on quality of life. Strength losses in lower limb muscles, ataxia,
      sensory problems and fatigue are the most important reasons of walking problems in patients
      with MS. In addition to loss of strength and tonus problems, especially biomechanical
      disorders can be seen on foot and this problem affects gatin and balance negatively. The
      stabilizing muscles, defined as the &quot;core&quot; region and enveloping the body like a corset, are
      active in the context of postural preparation prior to lower extremity movements and
      stabilize for the limb movements to be performed. The aim of this study was to investigate
      the effects of spinal stabilization exercises on walking performance, fatigue, plantar
      pressure distribution, balance, muscle strength and quality of life in patients with Multiple
      Sclerosis.
