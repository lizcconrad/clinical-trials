  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor
      activity of the combination of pembrolizumab, decitabine and fixed-dose hypofractionated
      index site radiotherapy in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed, refractory or
      progressive non-primary CNS solid tumors and lymphomas.

      Primary Objectives

        -  To determine the feasibility of administering pembrolizumab in combination with
           decitabine and hypofractionated index lesion radiation

        -  To identify the treatment-related toxicities and tolerability of the combination of
           decitabine and pembrolizumab

        -  To identify the treatment related toxicity and tolerability of the combination of
           decitabine and pembrolizumab with hypofractionated index lesion radiation

      Secondary Objective

      To preliminarily define the anti-tumor efficacy of the combination of pembrolizumab,
      decitabine and hypofractionated index lesion radiation in patients with relapsed, refractory,
      or progressive non-CNS solid tumors and lymphomas using overall response rate (CR + PR) by
      irRECIST after 3 cycles (1 block) of therapy.

      Exploratory Objectives

      To profile the kinetics of the immune response and to correlate with promotor methylation
      changes, nuclear imaging, stool microbiota diversity, and tumor associated antigen immune
      responses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive pembrolizumab and decitabine every 28 days, and a single 3 day course
      of fixed-dose hypofractionated index site radiotherapy.

      One cycle lasts 28 days. One block lasts 84 days (3 cycles per block). Radiation is given in
      block 1 only (cycle 2 only). Blocks may repeat for a total of 9 times (27 cycles) if patient
      meets criteria to continue protocol therapy.

                  if potential index site lesions meet the following: There has been documented
                  progression at that site (by RECIST or for neuroblastoma patients enrolled with
                  evaluable disease, persistent MIBG avidity), and Re-irradiation would not expose
                  the patient to a substantial increase in toxicity (as determined by consultation
                  with co-principal investigator or designee and treating oncologist).

          -  Patients who are currently receiving other anti-cancer agents are not eligible.

          -  Patients with a history of an autoimmune disorder are not eligible. Asymptomatic
             laboratory abnormalities (e.g. ANA, rheumatoid factor) will not render a patient
             ineligible in the absence of a diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder.

          -  Patients with known hepatitis B (HBsAg reactive) or C (HCV RNA -qualitative is
             detected) are excluded.

             infections or significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction).

          -  Patients who have received a live vaccine less than or equal to 30 days prior to
             enrollment are ineligible.

          -  Patients who have received a prior solid organ transplant at any time, or allogeneic
             bone marrow transplantation within the past 5 years (or have signs or symptoms of
             GVHD) are not eligible.

        Patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the safety
        monitoring requirements of the study are not eligible.
