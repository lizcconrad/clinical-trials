  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, mixed methods, multi-center, randomized, comparative, controlled
      study. Providence Health &amp; Services will enroll a total of 296 subjects (18 years or older)
      who are electing to have total knee or hip replacement surgery. Subjects will be randomized
      to either the treatment group (Health Partner alongside standard care) or the control group
      (standard care alone). Health Partner is a combination of an iPhone or iPod Touch Operating
      System mobile application and a health care provider portal. The primary objective is to
      compare care plan adherence (pre- and post-surgery) for Health Partner vs. control subjects.
      Secondary objectives include evaluating all-cause medical resource utilization, communication
      with health care provider, well-being, fear of surgery, confidence in recovery from surgery,
      sleep, and patient satisfaction for 90 days post-surgery. To evaluate the behavioral factors
      associated with care path adherence using a qualitative interview method.To evaluate the
      usability and preferences of patients in their interaction with the intervention using a
      qualitative interview method, for product development.

      The total planned study duration is approximately 1 year and 7 months.

    <description>The Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Patient Adherence is a 5-item questionnaire (ranging from &quot;None of the time&quot; to &quot;All of the time&quot;) guaging subject self-reported ability to follow doctors' suggestions and the frequency of subject adherence. To score general adherence, the responses are averaged together after reversing items 1 and 3.</description>

    <description>The Multi-Cultural Quality of Life Index (MQLI) asks respondents to rank ten different areas of their life [self-care and independent functioning, occupational functioning, social-emotional support, community and service support, interpersonal functioning, global perception of quality of life, physical well-being, personal fulfillment, psychological/emotional well-being, and spiritual fulfillment] on a 10-point Likert scale</description>

    <description>The Public Health Surveillance Well-Being Scale (PHS-WB) comprises 10-items guaging self-reported mental, physical, and social components of well-being. Response options for 6 of the items are on a 5-point Likert-type scale. The responses options range from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree,&quot; &quot;none of the time&quot; to &quot;all of the time,&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; to &quot;excellent.&quot; Three of the items are based on a 10-point Likert-type scale. Response options for the 10-point items range from &quot;very dissatisfied&quot; to &quot;very satisfied.&quot; One item assesses energy/vitality over the past 30 day. The responses for that item ranged from 0 to 30. A score for the PHS-WB scale was created by summing the 10 items for each respondent.</description>

    <description>The MOS Sleep Scale is a 12-item instrument, which measures multiple facets of sleep. The MOS Sleep Scale yields a sleep problems index and six scale scores: sleep disturbance (have trouble falling asleep, how long to fall asleep, sleep was not quiet, awaken during your sleep time, and have trouble falling asleep again), sleep adequacy (get enough sleep to feel rested upon waking in the morning and get amount of sleep needed), daytime somnolence (drowsy during day, have trouble staying awake during the day, and take naps), snoring, awaken short of breath or with headache, and quantity of sleep. Quantity of sleep is scored as the average hours slept per night. The other scales and problems index are scored on a range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating more of the concept being measured.</description>
