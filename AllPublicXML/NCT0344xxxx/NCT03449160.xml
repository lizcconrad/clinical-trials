      Participants with low back pain who are referred for physical therapy will be randomized to
      routine physical therapy or routine physical therapy plus receiving a postural training
      device.

      Physical therapy will be completed 1-2 times per week over 4-6 weeks. If randomized to the
      group that also receives a postural training device, one of the physical therapy sessions
      will instruct the patient on use of the device, which can be used thereafter as tolerated by
      the patient.

      At 6 weeks and 3 months, questionnaires that assess patients pain and function will be
      completed to assess outcomes

             therapy sessions

          -  Primary complaint of lumbar or thoracic pain thought to be at least in part due to
             mechanical/postural etiologies based on clinical presentation

          -  7 day average numeric pain rating score (NPRS) of at least 4 on a 0-10 scale at
             baseline evaluation

             until after the randomization process has been performed. They will only be informed
             of the treatment protocol for the group to which they have been assigned.

               -  Inability to sense UPRIGHT vibration

               -  Active Systemic inflammatory arthritis (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing
                  spondylitis, lupus)

               -  Medical conditions causing significant functional disability (e.g. stroke, spinal
                  cord injury, amputation)

                  cord stimulator, bladder stimulator)

               -  Allergic skin reaction to tapes or adhesives

               -  Worker's compensation claim or legal action related to the thoracic or lumbar
                  pain
