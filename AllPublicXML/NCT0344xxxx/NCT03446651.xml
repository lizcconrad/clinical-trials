      The purpose of this study is to understand the effects of chloride supplementation on
      volume-overloaded acute heart failure patients concomitantly treated with IV diuretics.

    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the
      biology and therapeutic potential of sodium-free chloride supplementation. While sodium
      homeostasis has been the focus of substantial investigation, very little research has been
      devoted to understanding chloride homeostasis. Thus, this proposal is designed to obtain the
      full spectrum of information pertaining to chloride, such as novel areas with great interest
      by the scientific community (i.e. modulation of the WNK-kinase system and the use of
      exosomes), to more practical/basic questions (i.e. what happens to sodium chloride balance
      when a patient is challenged with chloride). The proposed outpatient study has been designed
      to serve as a real world efficacy study. With extensive biobanking and analysis of samples in
      the proposed setting, there is the potential to be able to deliver a great wealth of
      information on the biology and therapeutic potential of manipulating chloride homeostasis in
      heart failure.

      Research confirms that many heart failure therapies demonstrate measurable benefit in highly
      controlled environments, but lack effectiveness when studied in decompensated patients
      receiving standard decongestive therapies. As such, this study seeks to understand the
      effects of chloride supplementation on volume-overloaded patients concomitantly treated with
      IV diuretics.

    <description>Volumex is albumin labeled with the iodine isotope I-131 and is an FDA-approved method used to determine total blood volume. A linear mixed effect model will be used to analyze the trial with class variables of time and treatment group.

    <description>N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NTpro-BNP) is used to screen and diagnosis of acute congestive heart failure (CHF) and can be used to establish prognosis in heart failure. A linear mixed effect model will be used to analyze the trial with class variables of time and treatment group.

    <description>Patients will receive 7 days of therapy using 115 mmol/day of lysine chloride. Patients will be given the option of a taste test of both lysine chloride &amp; the placebo powders mixed with various beverages to ensure it is palatable to them. If the patient feels they will not be able to take the study medication twice a day due to taste, they will be withdrawn from the study at this time.</description>
