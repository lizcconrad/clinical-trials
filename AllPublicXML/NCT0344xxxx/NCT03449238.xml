      Patients with metastatic breast cancer with at least 2 brain metastases will receive
      pembrolizumab every 3 weeks. Patients will undergo stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to one of
      the brain lesions. Pembrolizumab will be infused a day before SRS at the standard dose of
      200mg IV over 30 minutes and repeated every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

             intracranial untreated metastases

          -  A diagnostic contrast enhanced MRI demonstrating at least 2 and no more than 10
             measurable lesions, (&gt;5mm in size), performed within two weeks prior to treatment

          -  Maximum diameter of treated lesions should be &lt;4cm in size

          -  Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1. Lesions situated in a previously
             irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such
             lesions.

          -  Patient needs to be able to understand and demonstrate willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document

          -  Prior SRS is permitted, however the lesions targeted for treatment on trial need to be
             previously untreated by SRS

          -  Enrolled patients should have a two-week washout period from last systemic treatment

          -  Patients who have undergone prior subtotal resection are eligible providing that
             residual disease is &lt;4cm in maximum diameter

          -  Continuing a concurrent use of hormonal therapy or HER2neu-targeted therapy is
             allowed, if the patient exhibits brain metastases progression during these treatments

          -  The participant (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) provides written
             informed consent for the trial.

          -  Contraception duration of 120 days

          -  Adequate bone marrow reserve and liver function

             therapy

          -  Current use of systemic chemotherapy

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti PD L2 agent or with
             an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4,
             OX 40, CD137).

          -  Patients who have undergone complete resection of all known brain metastases

          -  Inability to obtain histologic proof of breast cancer

          -  Target lesion metastasis within 5mm of the optic apparatus so that some portion of the
             optic nerve or chiasm would be included in the SRS field

          -  Prior whole brain irradiation

          -  Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment.
             Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require
             corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted
             for palliative radiation (≤2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,

             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
