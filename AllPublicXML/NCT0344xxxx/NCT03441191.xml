  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and Purpose: The purpose of the study is to test the efficacy of an audio-visual
      stimulation program for sleep promotion in adults with chronic pain. The hypothesis is that
      hyper-arousal plays an important role in insomnia. Brainwave entrainment from 8 to 1 Hz
      reduces arousal, and thereby improves sleep. Improved sleep may change how people perceive
      pain.

      Methods: Using a double-blind, randomized controlled trial design, we plan to enroll 30
      adults (21-65 years old) experiencing both nonmalignant pain and insomnia. Exclusion criteria
      include: seizure disorder, sleep disorder, and night shift workers. After a one-week baseline
      measure, participants will be randomized to intervention or placebo group. Participants in
      both groups will be asked to self-administer the audio-visual stimulation program every night
      at bedtime for one month. Upon completion, post intervention measures will be collected.

      Background: The purpose of this pilot study was to test the efficacy of an open-looped
      Audio-visual Stimulation program (AVS) for sleep promotion in older adults with
      osteoarthritis pain. In this study, the AVS program was tested in a randomized controlled
      design. Specifically, this pilot study examined a 30-minute audio-visual stimulation program
      that gradually ramped from 10 Hz down to 2 Hz, to be used at bedtime for delta brainwave
      induction, in a randomized controlled design. The placebo control AVS program consisted of
      30-minutes of constant dim light that slowly changed in color, and a steady monotone at
      ultra-low (&lt;1 Hz) frequency (outside of the entrainment range).

      Method: A total of 30 older adults (mean age 68 ± 5.1, 90% women) with comorbid insomnia and
      osteoarthritis pain participated in this 2-week study. Participants were randomly assigned to
      either AVS active program or AVS placebo control program. After the baseline assessment
      (which included questionnaires [sleep, pain, depression], and quantitative
      electroencephalogram (QEEG) during AVS induction), participants were asked to self-administer
      their group specific AVS program nightly at bedtime for two weeks. Post-treatment
      questionnaires (sleep, pain, depression) were then collected.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia of Severity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A 7-item questionnaire that is a global measure of perceived insomnia severity. Items use a 5-point scale for total scores of 0-28, with &gt;15 considered moderate severity. The ISI has good internal consistency and is sensitive to changes in sleep of older adults in clinical and research.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Self-rating of overall sleep quality and disturbances using 7 sleep components. A PSQI global score &gt;5 is highly sensitive and specific for distinguishing good and poor sleepers.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) short form</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI is a 9-item questionnaire that assesses severity of pain, impact of pain on daily function, location of pain, pain medications and amount of pain relief in the past 24 hours or the past week.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a 9-item reliable, valid, measure that rates depression symptom severity on a 4-point scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Diary</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline through 2 weeks post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The sleep diary is a two-page sleep log with standard fill in the blank questions about the quantity and quality of the previous night of sleep, including Time to Bed, Sleep Latency, Number of Awakenings, Wake After Sleep Onset time, Total Sleep Time, and Time out of Bed. The diary also includes questions about the causes of sleep difficulties and ratings of daytime fatigue and sleepiness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Actigraphy</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline through 2 weeks post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep and wake pattern (actigraph) will be measured by Philips Respironics Actiwatch-2. Actigraphy is a reliable and objective tool to monitor sleep-wake cycles in ambulatory individuals (including older adults) based on frequency and magnitude of movements.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative Electroencephalogram (QEEG)</measure>
