      Objective: To show metabolic and hormonal responses and effects on abdominal obesity of
      aerobic exercise in different intensity and duration and detraining period in women with
      metabolic syndrome.

      Methods: Fifty-one women with metabolic syndrome were divided into three groups: 12 weekly
      sessions of high intensity supervised treadmill group, respectively, at % 70 of maximum
      oxygen consumption (group I, n=17), low intensity supervised treadmill group, respectively at
      % 50 of maximum oxygen consumption (group II, n=17) and walking at low intensity,
      respectively at % 50 of maximum oxygen consumption with ECEPEDO pedometer (group III, n=17).
      Target heart rate (HR) corresponding to values of 50-70 % VO2max were determined by the
      submaximal treadmill test. Group 1 and 2 were instructed walking at their target HR on a
      treadmill. The number of steps taken in a minute corresponding to target HR was determined by
      a criterion pedometer and group 3 was instructed walking in this step range recorded to ECE
      PEDO giving audible feedback. Participants were evaluated by weight, BMI, waist circumference
      (WC), blood sugar, LDL, HDL and triglyceride; viseral fat, trunk fat and waist circumference
      by bioelectrical impedance device (VIScan); ergospirometric VO2max at baseline, 12-week and
      4-week detraining period.

    <description>BIA device ViScan, designed to estimate visceral adiposity and trunk fat percentage. A wireless 'electrode belt' is placed on the bare midriff of the subject in supine position. The belt then uses dual frequency bio impedance (6.25 and 50 kHz) to measure trunk and visceral fat resistance and transmit the readings via infrared to the base unit.</description>
