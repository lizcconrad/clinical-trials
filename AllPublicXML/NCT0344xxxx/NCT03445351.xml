      Aim: Evaluate the influence of exercise, in different times, on quality of life, sleep and
      clinical parameters in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA). Methods: Intervention study,
      prospective, a cohort with 17 PLHA participants of the exercise program, higher than 18
      years, under antiretroviral therapy with CD4+ ≥ 350/mm3. Research Ethical Committee of the
      institution approved the study and the participants sign the informed consent and informed.
      All subjects underwent an exercise program in conformity to American College of Sports
      Medicine, 3 times per week during 40 minutes. Were evaluated the quality of life (QoL) with
      the Quality of Life - HAT - QoL and the sleep quality (SQ) with the Pittsburg questionnaire.
      The subjects were evaluated before the start of exercise program and in three times:
      short-term (2 to 4 months), medium-term (between 5 and 17 months) and long-term (between 18
      to 25 months).

    <description>A translation adapted and validated for Brazil of the HIV/AIDS Targeted Quality of Life questionnaire (HAT-QoL) developed by Holmes &amp; Shea, was used . The HAT-QoL present 34 questions divided in nine domains: Overall Function (OVEFUN), Life Satisfaction (LISA), Health Worries (HEAWOR), Financial Worries (FINWOR), Medication Concerns (MEDCON), HIV Mastery (HIVMAS), Disclosure Worries (DISWOR), Provider Trust (PROTRU) and Sexual Function (SEXFUN). The score ranges from 0 to 100. The responses have a five-point Likert scale: &quot;all the time&quot;, &quot;most of the time&quot;, &quot;part of the time&quot;, &quot;little time&quot; and &quot;never&quot;. In each domain, zero is the lowest score and 100 the best score possible. The higher the score, the lower the impact of HIV infection on the individuals' quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Quality of sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>24 MONTHS</time_frame>
    <description>For the QoS the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index validated for Brazilian population, was applied. This scale is composed of 19 items that evaluate aspects related to sleep latency, duration, usual efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of hypnotic drugs and daytime dysfunction in the last month. Scores smaller than 5 define good sleep quality; values ranging between 6 to 11 bad sleep quality and values greater than 11 sleep disturbance. To answer the questionnaires, the subjects were oriented to think about the QoL and QoS in the previous four weeks.</description>
