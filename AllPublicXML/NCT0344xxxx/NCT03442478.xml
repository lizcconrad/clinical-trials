  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In March 2009, Health Canada approved Tomosynthesis for use in screening and diagnosis of
      breast cancer. The Tomosynthesis technology is designed as a complementary imaging model that
      is incorporated into the 2D Mammography system. This new imaging system has the capability to
      provide 2D, 3D and combination mode models. It consists of generating thin slice images that
      can be viewed individually as multiple images from the same breast. Tomosynthesis provides
      improved visibility of possible lesions within the breast. The study aims to compare the
      performance of Tomosynthesis to the conventional Digital Mammography in detecting and
      characterizing suspicious findings in subjects who will be having breast biopsies.
