    <textblock>
      This study tests the effectiveness of an intervention treatment algorithm vs. usual care
      control in a practical clinical trial. Control arm providers will receive a standard
      medication alert in the electronic medical record (EMR) when initiating an antipsychotic
      prescription for an eligible patient. Intervention arm prescribers will receive an
      interactive medication alert in the EMR when prescribing for eligible patients and the
      patient and provider will enter the treatment algorithm (provider - medication alert plus
      clinical review by a child psychiatrist; patient - offer of personalized behavioral health
      navigation plus bridging therapy when appropriate). The study aims to recruit 800 eligible
      patients in 4 health systems.

      SUAY is a practical clinical trial designed to test the effectiveness of an intervention
      aiming to improve the targeted and safer use of antipsychotic medications by guiding
      clinician-prescribing behavior of antipsychotics for children aged ≥ 3 and &lt; 18 years and
      encouraging psychosocial therapy for eligible youth. The intervention includes a medication
      best practice alert in Epic, consultation with a child and adolescent psychiatrist, and extra
      support for patients and families to improve behavioral health service access. The trial will
      be conducted in 4 non-academic health systems. Each health system will randomize prescribers
      to one of two study arms, intervention and control. During patient encounters, entering an
      antipsychotic for a potentially eligible patient will cause either the control or
      intervention medication alert to fire in the electronic medical record. The control arm
      medication alert will point prescribing clinicians to relevant Choosing Wisely®
      recommendations. The intervention arm medication alert will inform prescribers that:

        1. Antipsychotics are not recommended 1st line treatment for non-psychotic disorders;

        2. A child and adolescent psychiatrist (CAP) will review antipsychotic usage by youth;

        3. Expedited access to bridging therapy, behavior health navigation, and/or a proactive
           consultation with a CAP may be ordered.

      The intervention medication alert will point prescribing clinicians to both Choosing Wisely®
      recommendations and to SUAY clinical prescribing guidelines. SUAY guidelines were developed
      by a national expert consensus panel in a prior phase of the study.

      Analytic data will be collected from automated data sources at the health systems. The
      primary outcomes are percent of children ordered an antipsychotic medication at 6 months of
      follow up, and total person-months of antipsychotic orders placed for participants during the
      study period.

    <masking_description>Waivers of consent have been obtained for providers and for patients/parents/guardians. None are informed of the study design or study activities by arm. The investigator is blind to study arm assignment of providers and patients. Only automated data collection is utilized for this practical trial. Study arm is masked for the programmer/analyst pulling outcomes data from health system records. Study arm will also be masked for study staff verifying study eligibility prior to the official study enrollment. Arm is not masked for study intervention staff (consulting psychiatrists, behavioral health navigators, bridging therapists) since these staff only interact with intervention arm subjects.</masking_description>

    <description>The intervention alert prompts the prescriber to keep/remove the antipsychotic order, and/or order any study services: behavioral health navigation, expedited psychotherapy access, virtual consult with a child and adolescent psychiatrist (CAP). Passive case review by the study CAP will occur for all intervention arm cases. A virtual consult will be scheduled if the prescriber ordered it or the CAP needs to discuss the case. The CAP will provide the prescriber with a written summary of his/her review.
Following review by the CAP, a navigator reaches out to the eligible intervention arm patient/family to offer extra support. The navigator's role is to (a) provide extra support to facilitate access and engagement in appropriate psychosocial therapies; (b) coordinate short-duration bridging therapy sessions for teens/families not engaged in psychotherapy, when appropriate; and (c) keep the prescriber informed of any clinically relevant updates.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is ≥ 3 and &lt; 18 years of age at the time of the encounter at which the study
             alert fired (index date);

          -  Patient is initiating a new episode of outpatient treatment with an antipsychotic
             medication. (New episodes are defined by no record of an antipsychotic medication
             being ordered within the health system as part of an outpatient care plan in the prior
             180 days);

          -  Study service (BH navigation, bridging therapy, CAP consult) ordered in Epic for the
             patient; (e.g., provider removed antipsychotic order and still ordered study
             services);

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a diagnosed psychotic disorder, mania, autism spectrum disorder, or
             intellectual disability;

          -  Patient was enrolled in the SUAY pilot study;

          -  The antipsychotic entered is prochlorperazine (Comazol®);

          -  An outpatient antipsychotic order is entered by a temporary provider in the health
             system (e.g., &quot;doc of the day&quot;). Orders placed by temporary providers do not count
             towards the 180 day medication free period for defining a new episode of care.

          -  The antipsychotic order was placed within an urgent care, emergency department, or
             inpatient setting (to avoid intervening during a crisis). Orders placed in these
             settings do not count towards the 180 day medication free period for defining a new
             episode of care.

          -  Primary language is not English
