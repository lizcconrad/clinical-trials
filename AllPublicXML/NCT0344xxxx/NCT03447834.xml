    <textblock>
      In acute myocardial infarction, early restoration of epicardial and myocardial blood flow is
      of paramount importance to limit infarction size and create optimum conditions for favourable
      long-term outcome. Currently, restoration of epicardial blood flow is preferably and
      effectively obtained by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). After opening the
      occluded artery, however, the reperfusion process itself causes damage to the myocardium, the
      so called &quot;reperfusion injury&quot;. The phenomenon of reperfusion injury is incompletely
      understood and currently there is no established therapy for preventing it. Contributory
      factors are intramyocardial edema with compression of the microvasculature, oxidative stress,
      calcium overload, mitochondrial transition pore opening, micro embolization, neutrophil
      plugging and hyper contracture. This results in myocardial stunning, reperfusion arrhythmias
      and ongoing myocardial necrosis. There is general agreement that a large part of the cell
      death caused by myocardial reperfusion injury occurs during the first few minutes of
      reperfusion, and that early treatment is required to prevent it.

      Myocardial hypothermia may attenuate the pathological mechanisms mentioned above. However,
      limited data are available on the beneficial effects of hypothermia to protect the myocardium
      from reperfusion damage. In animals, several studies demonstrated a protective effect of
      hypothermia on the infarction area. This effect was only noted when hypothermia was
      established before reperfusion. Hypothermia is therefore thought to attenuate several
      damaging acute reperfusion processes such as oxidative stress, release of cytokines and
      development of interstitial or cellular edema. Furthermore, it has been shown that induced
      hypothermia resulted in increased ATP-preservation in the ischemic myocardium compared to
      normothermia. The intracoronary use of hypothermia by infused cold saline in pigs was
      demonstrated to be safe by Otake et al. In their study, saline of 4°C was used without
      complications (such as vasospasm, hemodynamic instability or bradycardia) and it even
      attenuated ventricular arrhythmia significantly.

      Studies in humans, however, have not been able to confirm this effect, which is believed to
      be mainly due to the fact that the therapeutic temperature could not reached before
      reperfusion in the majority of patients or not achieved at all. Furthermore, in these studies
      it was intended to induce total body hypothermia, which in turn may lead to systemic
      reactions such as shivering and enhanced adrenergic state often requiring sedatives, which
      may necessitate artificial ventilation.

      In fact, up to now any attempt to achieve therapeutic myocardial hypothermia in humans with
      myocardial infarction, is fundamentally limited because of four reasons:

        1. Inability to cool the myocardium timely, i.e. before reperfusion

        2. Inability to cool the diseased myocardium selectively

        3. Inability to achieve an adequate decrease of temperature quick enough

        4. Inability to achieve an adequate decrease of temperature large enough

      Consequently, every attempt to achieve effective hypothermia in ST-segment myocardial
      infarction in humans has been severely hampered and was inadequate. In the last two years,
      the investigators have developed a methodology overcoming all of the limitations mentioned
      above. At first, the investigators have tested that methodology in isolated beating pig
      hearts with coronary artery occlusion and next, the investigators have tested the safety and
      feasibility of this methodology in humans.

      Therefore, the time has come to perform a proof-of-principle study in humans, which is the
      subject of this protocol.

    <description>For the infusion of the saline distal to the occlusion, a specific technique is used as previously described in the SINTAMI trial. A regular guidewire will be advanced beyond the culprit lesion, followed by an over-the-wire balloon that will be inflated immediately at a low pressure (4 atm) at the location of the occlusion to prevent reperfusion. Then the guidewire will be removed from the OTWB and distal coronary cooling is achieved by infusing saline through the inner lumen. Deflating of the balloon happens after 10 min of hypothermia while the cooling continues. The balloon remains in place and (partial) reperfusion by blood occurs, but no stent is placed yet. Hypothermia is continued for 10 minutes with NaCl at 4°C. The goal is now to achieve a distal coronary temperature of 4-8°C below body temperature. After 10 minutes of cooling with an open artery, the cooling is stopped and the procedure is continued as normal (PPCI).</description>
