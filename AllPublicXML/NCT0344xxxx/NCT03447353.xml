  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to assess drug effects (Xanax and Norco) on driving performance.
      Researchers will use the Alertness Memory Profiler (AMP) application to compare results to
      previous related studies.

      This study continues a line of research designed to characterize the effects of common
      recreationally used prescription and illicit drugs with well known stimulant and sedating
      effects and their relationship to results from the Alertness Memory Profiler (AMP) that
      included a set of vigilance and memory tasks.

      This study uses EEG, EKG, computerized assessment, blood sampling, and driving simulation.

      Individuals recruited will be normal, healthy individuals not currently taking the study
      drugs. The study will involve five visits, a screening visit as well as four dosing visits.
      The dosing visits will have a clean (double placebo) and three drugged visits (Xanax and
      Norco placebo, Xanax placebo and Norco, Xanax and Norco). The screening visit will last about
      two hours and will include drug and pregnancy testing as well as screening for
      physical/psychological health. Each of the dosing visits will last approximately five to six
      hours and will include sleep and food intake surveys, being dosed with study drugs or
      placebos, AMP assessments, a simulator drive, and wellness surveys. There will also be 4 mL
      blood sampling before dosing, before driving, and after driving.

             examination, and/or laboratory tests, that might influence driving performance (e.g.,

          -  Currently taking drugs that are contraindicated for use with study drugs

             Total Score &lt; 32.

          -  History of any illness that, in the opinion of the study investigator, might confound

             participation

          -  Prior participation in a driver impairment or distraction-related research study
