  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To clarify the influence of iodine intake in salt on the incidence and treatment of
      hyperthyroidism patients, so as to provide theoretical basis for accurate formulation of
      iodine intake in salt, and provide strategies for effective prevention and control of
      hyperthyroidism.
