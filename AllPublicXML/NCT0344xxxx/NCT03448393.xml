  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      B-cell leukemias and lymphomas are cancers that are often difficult to treat. The primary
      objective of this study is to determine the ability to take a patient's own cells (T
      lymphocytes) and grow them in the laboratory with the CD19/CD22-CAR receptor gene through a
      process called 'lentiviral transduction (also considered gene therapy) and growing them to
      large numbers to use as a treatment for hematologic cancers in children and young adults..
      Researchers want to see if giving modified CD19/CD22-CAR T cells to people with these cancers
      can attack cancer cells. In addition, the safety of giving these gene modified cells to
      humans will be tested at different cell doses. Additional objectives are to determine if this
      therapy can cause regression of B cell cancers and to measure if the gene modified cells
      survive in patients blood.

      Objective:

      To study the safety and effects of giving CD19/CD22-CAR T cells to children and young adults
      with B-cell cancer.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 3 30 with certain cancers that have not been cured by standard therapy. Their
      cancer tissue must express the CD19 protein.

      Design:

      A sample of participants blood or bone marrow will be sent to NIH and tested for leukemia.

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Urine and blood tests (including for HIV)

      Heart and eye tests

      Neurologic assessment and symptom checklist.

      Scans, bone marrow biopsy, and/or spinal tap

      Some participants will have lung tests.

      Participants will repeat these tests throughout the study and follow-up.

      Participants will have leukapheresis. Blood will be drawn from a plastic tube (IV) or needle
      in one arm then go through a machine that removes lymphocytes. The remaining blood will be
      returned to the participant s other arm.

      Participants will stay in the hospital about 2 weeks. There they will get:

      Two chemotherapy drugs by IV

      Their changed cells by IV

      Standard drugs for side effects

      Participants will have frequent follow-up visits for 1 year, then 5 visits for the next 4
      years. Then they will answer questions and have blood tests every year for 15 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) accounts for approximately 25% of childhood cancer.
           Survival rates have improved, but outcomes for some subgroups, including infants and
           young adults remain poor, and survival for patients who relapse is &lt; 50%, despite
           allogeneic stem cell transplant following second remission.

        -  CD19 immune escape has been observed by several groups following CD19-CAR therapy for
           B-ALL. Investigation of this phenomenon reveals a complex biology responsible for loss
           or downregulation of CD19 expression observed in these cases.

        -  Sequential therapy using CD22-CARs to treat CD19 dim/lo escape is associated with rapid
           development of resistance due to CD22 downregulation. This trial will test whether
           simultaneous targeting of CD19 and CD22 using a novel bivalent CD19/22-CAR is safe and
           feasible.

      Objectives:

      -Assess the safety of administering escalating doses of autologous CD19/CD22-CAR engineered T
      cells that meet established release specifications in children and young adults with
      CD19+CD22+ B cell ALL or lymphoma following a cyclophosphamide/fludarabine conditioning
      regimen.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients between 3 years and 30 years of age, with CD19+/CD22+ B cell ALL or lymphoma who
      have relapsed or have refractory disease after at least one standard chemotherapy regimen and
      one salvage regimen, with no alternative curative options who meet standard Phase I
      eligibility criteria.

      Design:

        -  Phase I, 3 + 3 dose escalation design using the following dose levels: -1: 1 x 10^5
           transduced T cells/kg (plus or equal to 20%); 1: 3 x 10^5 transduced T cells/kg (plus or
           equal to 20%); 2: 1 x 10^6 transduced T cells/kg; and 3: 3 x 10^6 transduced T cells/kg
           plus or equal to 20%)

        -  Patients will receive a lymphodepleting preparative regimen of fludarabine (25 mg/m2/d x
           3 on Days -4, -3,-2) and cyclophosphamide (900 mg/m2/d x 1 on Day -2) followed by
           infusion of CD19/CD22-CAR T-cells on D0.

        -  Patients will be evaluated sequentially for toxicity, antitumor effects, CAR expansion
           and persistence, as well as research correlatives.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Diagnosis

               -  Patient must have a B cell ALL (inclusive of CML with ALL transformation) or
                  lymphoma and must have relapsed or refractory disease after at least one standard
                  chemotherapy regimen and one salvage regimen. In view of the PI and the primary
                  oncologist, there must be no available alternative curative therapies and
                  subjects must be either ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT),
                  have refused SCT, recurred after SCT, or have disease activity that prohibits SCT
                  at the time of enrollment. Patients who have undergone autologous SCT will be
                  eligible, and patients that have undergone allogeneic SCT will be eligible if, in
                  addition to meeting other eligibility criteria, they have no evidence of GVHD and
                  have been without immunosuppressive agents for at least 30 days. Patients with
                  Philadelphia chromosome + ALL must have failed prior tyrokine kinase inhibitor.

               -  Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease at the time of enrollment,
                  which may include any evidence of disease including minimal residual disease
                  detected by flow cytometry.

          -  CD22/CD19 Expression

               -  CD19 expression must be detected on greater than 15% of the malignant cells by
                  immunohistochemistry or greater than 90% by flow cytometry. The choice of whether
                  to use flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry will be determined by what is the
                  most easily available

        tissue sample in each patient. In general, immunohistochemistry will be used for lymph node
        biopsies, flow cytometry will be used for peripheral blood and bone marrow samples. CD22+ B
        cell malignancy is required and CD22 expression levels will be documented when available,
        but a specific level of expression is not an eligibility requirement; it may be documented
        as positive or negative.

          -  Age:

             --Greater than or equal to 3 years of age (and at least 15 kg) and less than or equal

             * if these cytopenias are not judged by the investigator to be due to underlying
             disease (i.e. potentially reversible with anti-neoplastic therapy); A subject will not
             be excluded because of pancytopenia greater than or equal to Grade 3 if it is due to
             disease, based on the results of bone marrow studies.

               -  Subjects must have no signs or symptoms of CNS disease or detectable evidence of
                  CNS disease on MRI at the time of screening. Subjects who have been previously
                  treated for CNS disease but have no evidence of disease at screening are

             compromise ability to complete study therapy;

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the study agents have the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with the study agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued.

          -  Prior CAR therapy within 30 days prior to apheresis or prior CAR therapy at any time
             with evidence for persistence of CAR T cells in blood samples (circulating levels of
             genetically modified cells of greater than or equal to 5% in peripheral blood by flow
             cytometry).

          -  Prior monoclonal antibody therapy within 5 half-lives or 7 days prior to apheresis,

          -  HIV/HBV/HCV Infection:

               -  a. Seropositive for HIV antibody. (Patients with HIV are at increased risk of
