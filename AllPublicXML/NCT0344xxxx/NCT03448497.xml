    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the first-line therapy landscape for patients with
      advanced melanoma and to describe clinical outcomes and healthcare resource utilization in a
      subset of treatment-naïve patients who initiated nivolumab + ipilimumab combination therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has medical chart documentation of advanced melanoma.

          -  Patient initiated a first-line therapy for the treatment of advanced melanoma during
             the eligibility period (01 July 2016 to 01 July 2017; index event).

          -  Patient did not receive systemic treatment for their advanced (unresectable or
             metastatic) melanoma prior to index event

          -  Patient initiated first-line therapy at least six months before the date their chart
             abstraction initiated

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient was enrolled in an investigational drug clinical trial or participating in
             medical research judged to directly affect how the patient was being monitored/treated
             while receiving first-line therapy

          -  Patient had another active concurrent malignancy other than advanced melanoma, which
             required systemic treatment at the time of index event

          -  Part or all of the patient's first-line treatment was received at a different site and
             the patient's medical chart pertaining to this care is not accessible

          -  Patient received private treatment for their advanced melanoma

          -  Patient medical chart is missing, empty, or not retrievable

        Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria could apply
