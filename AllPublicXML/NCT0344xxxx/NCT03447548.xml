    <textblock>
      Young people who are at great risk for developing psychosis have cognitive deficits which are
      strongly related to functioning in the community. This study looks to target a specific
      cognitive skill called processing speed to see if improving the ability to process
      information in a timely manner will improve social function in adolescents and young adults
      at risk for developing schizophrenia. Half will receive neurofeedback cognitive training
      targeting processing speed while the other half will receive an active control.

    <textblock>
      Processing speed deficits are characteristic of schizophrenia and related to its functional
      impairment, including in its nascent stages, during a putatively prodromal or clinical high
      risk period. These cognitive deficits have proven relatively refractory to pharmacologic
      strategies, though the deficits can be improved with cognitive remediation programs in
      schizophrenia. The cognitive gains can then generalize to functional improvement,
      particularly early in the course of illness (i.e. first episode psychosis). Although
      processing speed deficits are also prevalent in young people identified as at clinical high
      risk for psychosis (i.e. &quot;psychosis risk syndrome&quot;), and related to their concurrent impaired
      function and predictive of later psychosis (onset of which occurs in 20-25% of clinical high
      risk cohorts), little research has focused on how to remediate these deficits in clinical
      high risk patients. Remediating core cognitive deficits in clinical high risk patients could
      plausibly address present functional impairment in these young people and moderate illness
      progression. The investigators propose to conduct a double-blind randomized trial in 105
      clinical high risk patients to examine a focal processing speed training program versus an
      active control in terms of improvement in processing speed and social function, and reduction
      in prodromal symptom severity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Case identification and ascertainment depends on the fulfillment of the Criteria of
             Prodromal States as evaluated using the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes:
             (1) attenuated positive symptom state which includes the emergence or worsening over
             the past year of non-psychotic disturbances in thought content, thought process or
             perceptual abnormality, (2) brief intermittent positive symptoms, and (3) genetic risk
             and deterioration.

          -  Processing speed at least 0.5 Standard Deviation below the norm, as indexed by
             baseline performance on Digit Symbol Coding of 8 or below

          -  Age range 12-25 (this age range also comprises the main period of risk for psychosis)

          -  Written informed consent by patients &gt;18 years old, and written assent by subjects &lt;18
             years old, with written informed consent by both parents (unless one is deceased or
             unavailable). Participants who turn 18 while in the study will be re-consented as
             adults through written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or past diagnosis of psychotic disorder noted at baseline assessment
             (schizophrenia, schizophreniform, bipolar, schizoaffective, major depression with
             psychotic features, substance-induced psychosis, psychosis due to a medical condition.

          -  Neurological, neuroendocrine or major medical disorders: as putative prodromal
             symptoms could be secondary to these and unrelated to risk for primary psychotic
             disorders (clinical interview), including seizure disorder and history of significant
             traumatic brain injury

          -  Intelligence Quotient &lt; 70: as putative prodromal symptoms could be secondary to these
             and unrelated to risk for primary psychotic disorders

          -  Positive symptoms that occur only in the context of substance abuse or withdrawal
             (i.e. within one month), so as not to include those at risk for substance-induced
             psychotic disorder

          -  Lack of fluency in English: subjects must speak English to complete behavioral
             assessments for which psychometric properties have been established in English,
             complete cognitive training, and in order to comprehend and comply with protocol
             requirements.

          -  Substance abuse or dependence (including alcohol and marijuana) in previous six
             months: for purposes of standardization and interpretation of cognitive data.
