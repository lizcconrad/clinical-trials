    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to atherosclerosis of the arterial vessel wall and to
      thrombosis is the foremost cause of premature mortality and of disability-adjusted life years
      in Europe, and is also increasingly common in developing countries. In the European Union,
      the economic cost of CVD represents annually €192 billion in direct and indirect healthcare
      costs. The main clinical entities are coronary artery disease (CAD), ischaemic stroke, and
      peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The causes of these CVDs are multifactorial. Some of these
      factors relate to lifestyles, such as tobacco smoking, lack of physical activity, and dietary
      habits, and are thus modifiable. Other risk factors are also modifiable, such as elevated
      blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidaemias, or non-modifiable, such as age and male
      gender. LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) is one of the major risk factors for CVD, through its role in
      the development of atherosclerosis. The efficacy of statins has been demonstrated by a
      considerable amount of literature not only in lowering LDL cholesterol levels but also in
      reducing cardiovascular events, both in diabetes and non-diabetes patients. Guidelines for
      the management of dyslipidemia have emerged from different countries. Thereby, in 2016 the
      French Society of Endocrinology (SFE) and the New French Society of Atherosclerosis (NSFA)
      published a consensus statement on the management of dyslipidemias integrating features from
      European recommendations and in 2017 the Haute Autorité de Santé updated the French
      guidelines. However, LDL-C goal attainment has rarely been assessed specifically in diabetes
      population, in which CVD is of particular importance. This study aimed to assess the rate of
      dyslipidaemias in a population of patient hospitalized in Endocrinology-Diabetology-Nutrition
      unit.

      This observational study was carried in the Diabetes-Nutrition unit of the University
      Hospital of Montpellier - France. All consecutive patients admitted to that unit during the
      study period were assessed for eligibility. Data on age, sex, tobacco smoking, body mass
      index, hypertension (treatment of previously diagnosed hypertension or blood values &gt; 140/90
      mmHg), presence and type of CVD (coronary artery disease, stroke and transient ischemic
      attack, peripheral arterial disease), were collected at admission. LDL-C, HDL-C and
      triglycerides levels calculated with the Friedewald formula, and glomerular filtration rate
      calculated according to the CKD-EPI formula were obtained from blood samples taken within 24
      hours of hospitalization admission. Information on the name and daily dose of lipid lowering
      drugs (statins, fibrate, ezetimibe …) at admission was documented. Cardiovascular risk level
      and LDL-C target values were defined according to 2011 and 2016 ESC guidelines and 2017
      French guidelines.
