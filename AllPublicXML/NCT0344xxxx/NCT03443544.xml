      Background:

      Fournier's gangrene it's a necrotizing infection of the genital area, with high morbidity and
      mortality. The site of infection its the origin of the necrotizing fasciitis. There are 4
      well known origins of Fournier's gangrene: Testicular, Intestinal, Urinary and cutaneous, and
      its prognostic value has not been established yet, that's because the lack of case series
      with adequate number of patients. This is a retrospective study in which we evaluate the
      prognostic factors of every patient and its mortality compared with its origin area and
      multiple scores with their survival rates and hospital stay.

      Objective:

      To evaluate origins of Fournier's gangrene as a prognostic value in the morbidity and
      mortality.

      Patients and methods:

      This is a retrospective study where patients from a single hospital from 2007 to 2016 were
      included. They were categorized in 4 groups matching the origin of infection. In every group
      categorizing with the origin of infection and determined severity factors, days of hospital
      stay, Fournier's gangrene severity index and mortality. A statistic analysis will be done
      using lineal multivariable analysis.
