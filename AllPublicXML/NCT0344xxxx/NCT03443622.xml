  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I study will be conducted in an open-label, conventional 3+3 dose escalation
      design manner (for the first 28 days of dosing) followed by an extension period for subjects
      responsive to the study drug to continue dosing up to 52 weeks. This study is intended to
      assess the safety and efficacy of the investigational product (IP), SC-43 Oral Solution, in
      subjects with refractory solid tumors. Subjects who have diseases progressing unresponsive to
      the previous treatments or who have no standard treatments for their current diseases will be
      enrolled in this study once the eligibility is confirmed.

      During the first 28 days, the study will be done in the conventional 3+3 design to determine
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SC-43 Oral Solution. The dose will be increased in a
      step-wise fashion from the initial dose of 100 mg/day to the dose of 200, 400, 600, 900, and
      1200 mg/day. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of SC-43 will also be measured in this period.

      The dose of SC-43 Oral Solution will be escalated to the subsequent cohorts when there is no
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in 3 subjects or only one DLT in 6 subjects of the previous
      cohort, and it is recommended by Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The safety results
      will be reviewed by DSMB after the last subject in the each cohort has finished the Visit 6
      (Day 29), and DSMB will determine if it is safe to proceed to the next dose cohort.

      Subjects who have finished the 28-day dose escalation period and with complete response (CR),
      partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) will be eligible to enter the extension period
      and continue SC-43 Oral Solution therapy up to 52 weeks or until occurrence of unacceptable
      toxicity, withdrawn consent, disease progression, not receiving medical benefit as considered
      by investigators, loss of follow-up, or death, whichever comes first. For ethical and safety
      concerns, the dosage used in this extension period can be adjusted and different from the
      original dosage assignment. The actual dose of SC-43 Oral Solution, which must be confirmed
      safe, administered during this extension period will be at the investigator's discretion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SC-43, has been shown to enhance the activity of Src homology region 2 domain-containing
      phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), leading suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation and tumor growth
      inhibition. SC-43 enhances SHP-1 activity by impairing the association between the N-SH2
      domain and the PTP domain of SHP-1, triggering a conformational change of SHP-1 and relieving
      its autoinhibition. SC-43 treatment leads to cancer cell death in multiple cancer cell lines.
      SC-43 also exhibits anti-cancer activity in a variety of nonclinical xenograft tumor models.

    <description>SC-43 Oral Solution has drug substance of 1-[4-chloro-3(trifluoromethyl)phenyl-3-[3-(4-cyanophenoxy)] urea, or SC-43. SC-43 inhibits tumor growth through the activation of Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) and the repression of p-STAT3 signalings. As a result of STAT3 inhibition by SC-43 treatment, decreased cell viability and enhanced apoptosis have been observed in cancer cells. The anti-tumor activity of SC-43 was also investigated in a variety of xenograft tumor models. Administration of SC-43 provides the tumor-bearing animals survival benefits, including the reduction of tumor volume and prolonged lifespan. SC-43 has been proposed to be evaluated as an anticancer therapeutic in in subjects with refractory solid tumors in the phase I trial.</description>
