  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physically healthy adult smokers may be eligible for this study. Volunteers may participate
      in this study if they are 18 - 65 years old.

      Subjects will participate in two separate 10-hour PET/CT Scan Sessions (each with 2 hours of
      actual PET/CT scanning): one following an overnight abstinence and one following two
      overnights of abstinence. To achieve and confirm two overnights of abstinence, participants
      will present to the inpatient CHPS the day prior to the scheduled scan and stay overnight.

      The 2-[18F]-FA PET/CT brain scans will consist of an injection followed by an 8-hour infusion
      of 2-[18F]-FA. The scan session will begin at approximately 6 hours after the bolus
      injection. The PET/CT scan will be approximately 120 minutes long with a bolus injection of
      IV nicotine that will occur during scanning at approximately 30 minutes into the procedure.
      The pre and post nicotine images will be analyzed to evaluate for differences in receptor
      uptake after the nicotine &quot;challenge&quot;.

      Subjects will have a structural Brain MRI performed within 1 year of study enrollment.
      Subjects who have not had a Brain MRI that is deemed acceptable for use for this study will
      undergo a research Brain MRI.

             months prior to enrollment

          3. Carbon monoxide reading &gt; 10 ppm at the initial screening session

          4. Participants agree to be compliant with all study procedures including smoking

                  medications may result in ineligibility and will therefore be evaluated on a
                  case-by-case basis by the Study Physician.
