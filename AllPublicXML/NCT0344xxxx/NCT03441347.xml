  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of a specific, multidisciplinary and personalized
      rehabilitation program compared to usual care, on motor control and functional disability in
      patients with neuralgic amyotrophy.

      Half of the participants will start with the 17-week specific rehabilitation program while
      the other half will first continue their usual care for 17 weeks, after which they will also
      receive the 17-week specific rehabilitation program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuralgic amyotrophy (NA) is a common (incidence 1:1000) peripheral nervous system disorder
      caused by acute autoimmune inflammation of the brachial plexus, the nerve bundle going to the
      shoulder and arm. Many NA patients develop abnormal motor control of the shoulder region
      (i.e. scapular dyskinesia), which persists even after the peripheral nerve damage has
      recovered. This suggests that persistent scapular dyskinesia in NA may result from
      (mal)adaptive changes in the central motor system.

      Clinical experience shows that the specific, multidisciplinary and personalized
      rehabilitation program, focused on cognitive motor control can restore scapular dyskinesia in
      NA patients. This indicates that impairments in the central motor system likely play a role
      in persistent scapular dyskinesia and that specific rehabilitation may restore any
      alterations in central motor control.

      We hypothesize that the specific rehabilitation program, focused on cognitive motor control
      is more effective in improving functional disability than usual care and that it can reverse
      maladaptive changes in central motor control.

    <description>17-week specific and personalised rehabilitation program. The program starts with a visit to the Plexus out patient clinic in week 1. During this visit, the patient will be examined by a multidisciplinary team, consisting of a rehabilitation physician, neurologist, physical therapist and occupational therapist, which will form a rehabilitation treatment plan. This treatment plan is implemented through 4 weekly sessions in week 2-5, 2 biweekly sessions in week 6-9 and 2 monthly sessions in week 10-17 . Each treatment session involves one hour of physical- and one hour of occupational therapy.</description>
