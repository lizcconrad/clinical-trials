      This study hipotetize that a multicomponent intervention, tailored to college student and
      conducted by a nurse is more effective than brief advise.

      The intervention was a multi-component intervention based on the Theory of Triadic Influence
      and on previous recommendations made in the Surgeon General's report . The strategies of this
      program consisted of a 50-minute motivational interview conducted by a nurse and online
      self-help material. The follow-up included a reinforcing e-mail and group therapy. The
      smoking-related Self-efficacy, Belief and Intention scale was used to assess outcomes.

    <masking_description>Randomization was performed by one member of the research team who generated a blocked random number sequence, using EpiInfo version 7.0.9.7, and prepared the sealed opaque sequentially numbered envelopes (1-255) with the corresponding condition written inside. After each student agreed to participate in the study, the enve- lope was opened, determining the group to which he or she would be assigned. Students were unaware of the group assignments and randomization scheme.</masking_description>

    <description>The intervention group consisted in face-to-face 50-minute meeting [motivational interviewing (MI)]; online self-help material focused on: (1) decisions; (2) moods; (3) social life; (4) smoking health effects; and (5) quitting; e-mail 15 days before the MI, group therapy 2 months after the MI (60 minutes), a second follow-up visit 4 months after the MI (20 minutes).</description>

    <description>The control group received a brief advice (5-10minutes) and a self-help pamphlet called 'Stop smoking'. Before giving brief advice, the nurse assessed smokers' habits and their willingness to quit. As is usually in this type of studies there were no follow-up sessions for this group.</description>
