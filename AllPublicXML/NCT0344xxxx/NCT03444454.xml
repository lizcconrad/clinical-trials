  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Virtual Reality Rehabilitation
      System (VRRS, Khymeia) compared to usual care treatment for patients with MS at home. The
      effects of the intervention on outcome variables will be assessed using a randomized
      controlled trial design with a comparison group receiving usual care training. The
      investigators will assess the effect of VRRS system on the quality of life, motor, and
      cognitive abilities.

    <description>Quality of life will be measured by 54-item Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life (MSQOL-54) questionnaire
There is no single overall score for the MSQOL-54. Two summary scores - physical health and mental health - can be derived from a weighted combination of scale scores. In addition, there are 12 subscales: physical function, role limitations-physical, role limitations-emotional, pain, emotional well-being, energy, health perceptions, social function, cognitive function, health distress, overall quality of life, and sexual function. There are also two single-item measures: satisfaction with sexual function and change in health.

    <description>Fatigue Severity Scale
A questionnaire with 9 items (questions)
Grading of each FSS item ranges from 1 to 7, where 1 indicates strong disagreement and 7 strong agreement, and the final score represents the mean value of the 9 items

    <description>The Regulatory Emotional Self-Efficacy (RESE) scale
The RESE scale assesses self-efficacy in expressing positive emotions and self-efficacy in managing negative emotions.
With this scale, participants rate (ranging from 1 [not well at all] to 5 [very well]) their capability to manage their emotional life. RESE scale consists of 12 items and are calculated 3 scores: 1) self-efficacy in expressing positive emotions (POS) score; 2)self-efficacy in managing negative emotions (NEG) score; 3)self-efficacy in managing despondency/distress (DES) score
Higher values within each score represent a better outcome</description>

    <description>Participants will receive an individualized exercise program set up by the therapist. The intervention applied to the experimental group will consist of 30 sessions of Khymeia VRRS training distributed in five sessions for week, each lasting 45 minutes.
Each session is constructed by alternating physical with cognitive activities. The sessions will initially be tailored to the patient's baseline characteristics. Remotely, the therapist will then adjust the participant's exercise program as appropriate, by changing exercises, level of difficulty or number of repetitions.</description>
