  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around 40% of moderate to severe psoriasis patients are affected by concomitant metabolic
      syndrome, making it one of the clinically most relevant comorbidities. Psoriasis as well as
      the metabolic syndrome are both characterized by a state of low-grade systemic inflammation
      (e.g. in the skin, joints, adipose tissue, liver or vascular endothelium). This shared
      pathophysiology makes systemic inflammation an attractive target for the treatment of both
      diseases. Secukinumab as well as lifestyle intervention are able to reduce systemic
      inflammation.

      This trial is designed to answer the question whether the combination of Secukinumab with
      lifestyle intervention can primarily improve skin symptoms and secondly cardiometabolic
      status more than Secukinumab alone in psoriasis patients with concomitant metabolic syndrome
      by targeting the shared pathophysiology behind both diseases, which is systemic inflammation.

          5. History of hypersensitivity to Secukinumab, trehalose-dihydrate, L-histidine,
             L-histidinhydrochloride-monohydrate, L-methionine, polysorbate 80, water for

          8. Ongoing use of prohibited treatments. Washout periods detailed in the protocol have to
             be adhered to (Table 5-1). Note: Administration of live vaccines 6 weeks prior to
             baseline (visit 2) or during the study period is also prohibited.

          9. Diagnosis of type 1 diabetes.

         10. Patients with diagnosed type 2 diabetes, if they fulfill one or more of the following
             conditions:

             study.

         12. Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 5 half-lives
             of enrollment, or within 30 days until the expected pharmacodynamic effect has
             returned to baseline, whichever is longer; or longer if required by local regulations.

             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hCG laboratory test.

         14. Active ongoing inflammatory diseases other than psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis
             (PsA) that might confound the evaluation of the benefit of Secukinumab therapy.

             therapy.

         16. Significant, progressive or uncontrolled medical problems at baseline which according
             to the opinion of the Investigator render the subject unsuitable for the trial - also
             in regard to participation in the lifestyle intervention - or put the subject at
             increased risk when participating in the trial (e.g. broken leg, congestive heart
             failure NYHA III/IV, uncontrolled hypertension with systolic ≥ 160 mmHg and/or
             diastolic ≥ 95 mmHg, severe uncontrolled asthma)

         17. Medical history of myocardial infarction or angina pectoris

         18. Any medical or psychiatric condition which, in the Investigator's opinion, would
             preclude the participant from adhering to the protocol or completing the study per
             protocol.

         19. Serum creatinine level exceeding 2.0 mg/dl (176.8 μmol/L) at screening

         21. Active systemic infections during the last two weeks (exception: common cold) prior to
             baseline (visit 2) or any infection that reoccurs on a regular basis.

         22. History of an ongoing, chronic or recurrent infectious disease, or evidence of
             tuberculosis infection as defined by a positive QuantiFERON TB-Gold test (QFT) at
             screening. Subjects with a positive or indeterminate QFT test may participate in the
             study if full tuberculosis work up (according to local practice/guidelines) was
             completed within 12 weeks prior to visit 2 and establishes conclusively that the
             subject has no evidence of active tuberculosis. If presence of latent tuberculosis is
             established, then appropriate treatment must have been initiated at least 4 weeks
             prior to baseline (visit 2) and maintained according to local guidelines.

         23. Past medical history record or current infection with HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C
             prior to baseline (visit 2).

         24. History of lymphoproliferative disease or any known malignancy or history of
             malignancy of any organ system treated or untreated within the past 5 years,
             regardless of whether there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases (except for
             Bowen's disease, or basal cell carcinoma or actinic keratoses that have been treated
             with no evidence of recurrence in the past 12 weeks prior to baseline (visit 2);
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix or non-invasive malignant colon polyps that have been
             removed).

         25. Inability or unwillingness to undergo repeated venipuncture (e.g., because of poor
             tolerability or lack of access to veins).

         26. History or evidence of ongoing alcohol or drug abuse, within the last six months
             before baseline (visit 2).

         27. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using basic methods of contraception during dosing
             of investigational drug for at least 20 weeks after the end of Secukinumab treatment.
             Basic contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks before
                  taking investigational drug. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
                  reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level
                  assessment

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 m prior to screening). For female subjects on the
                  study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject

               -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps).

               -  Use of oral, (estrogen and progesterone), injected or implanted hormonal methods
                  of contraception or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable
                  efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal
                  hormone contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or
                  intrauterine system (IUS)

               -  In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking investigational drug.

               -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have
                  had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total
                  hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of
                  oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been
                  confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child
                  bearing potential.
