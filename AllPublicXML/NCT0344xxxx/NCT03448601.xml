  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This mixed-methods, multi-state study will develop and evaluate culturally tailored
      recruitment materials and test their effectiveness for a) engaging American Indian and Alaska
      Native participants in a culturally tailored recruitment and engagement module focused on
      Alzheimer's Disease and Precision Medicine (AD-PM); b) enhancing enrollment in AD-PM clinical
      trials; and c) improving knowledge and attitudes about AD and PM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a mixed methods approach. The Investigators will focus on the American
      Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) population seen at the University of Arizona/Banner Health
      facilities in the Phoenix and Tucson areas. First, the recruitment strategies for enrolling
      AI/ANs will be examined in an implementation evaluation of an existing research program (All
      of Us) designed to assemble an observational cohort for the Precision Medicine Initiative.
      &quot;All of Us&quot; includes the procurement and storage of biological samples for health research
      integral to precision medicine. AI/ANs are underrepresented in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and
      genetic research and this study will offer stakeholders valuable information on AI/AN
      perspectives on AD and preferred methods of communicating about AD, as well as developing a
      cohort of AI/AN people who are interested in AD and Precision Medicine (PM) research. To
      fulfill these goals, the Investigators will develop culturally tailored materials on AD and
      PM using qualitative methods, namely key informant interviews. In the final step, a
      randomized controlled trial will be conducted to compare the effectiveness of culturally
      tailored versus standard materials for enrolling AI/ANs into the AD-PM Module, and ultimately
      into a cohort that will be available for studies of AD and PM. Potential participants will be
      identified through the electronic health record or in person during outpatient clinical
      visits, emergency department visits, or inpatient hospitalizations. Enrollees in the All of
      Us Research Program will be asked whether they wish to participate in a 30 minute optional
      study on attitudes, knowledge, and willingness to participate in research, ethnic identity
      and cognition on AD and PM. The investigators estimate that 3,000 AI/ANs will agree and be
      randomized to receive a 3-4 minute presentation on AD and PM in a standard format (control),
      or to receive the same information presented in the culturally tailored format
      (intervention).

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomized in equal proportions either to receive a standard, non-tailored educational brochure on Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the value of precision medicine (PM), and the importance of research (control); or to receive a culturally tailored brochure with graphics and identical information and to view a digital story featuring personal narratives of AI/ANs (intervention).</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>AD-PM Module Completion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Completion of the AD-PM Module will be assessed by binary (yes, no) indicators of 1) providing consent for the Module; and 2) answering a question about enrolling in the AD-PM cohort and by a variable summarizing the total number of missing responses for the AD-PM module questions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cohort Enrollment Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Enrollment in the AD-PM Cohort will be assessed by binary (yes, no) indicators of agreeing to 1) join the Cohort, and 2) be contacted for participation in future studies.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Willingness to Participate in Research Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Willingness to participate will be rated using a 4-point Likert scale (1=definitely would not, 2=probably would not; 3=probably would; 4=definitely would) after viewing 4 vignettes portraying hypothetical future projects related to Alzheimer's Disease, dementia, and Precision Medicine. Ranges for each vignette are 1 to 4 with higher scores indicating greater willingness to participate in research.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Knowledge Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>30 true/false items on risk factors, assessment, diagnosis, symptoms, life impact, caregiving, treatment, and management. Range is 0 - 30 with higher scores indicating greater AD knowledge.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attitudes about Precision Medicine self-report survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will adapt a 44-item survey created by the National Institutes of Health to measure attitudes about the &quot;All of Us&quot; Alzheimer's Disease/Precision Medicine (AD/PM) Research Program to approximately 20 items specifically related to attitudes about PM rather than on All of Us more broadly. Items will be multiple choice (Definitely yes, Probably yes, Probably no, Definitely no) and binary (agree, disagree; yes, no). Ranges are not yet established as the survey is under development. Higher scores will indicate more positive attitudes about PM.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Administered Gerocognitive Exam (SAGE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>To measure baseline cognitive function, scores from SAGE ranging from normal to mild cognitive impairment. Test scores range from 22 (normal) to 15 (mild cognitive impairment), with a score &lt; 14 indicative of dementia and a score of ≥ 17 considered normal.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Orthogonal Cultural Identification Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Cultural identity will be assessed from ratings of the degree to which participants identify with Native and White ways of life in family and community interactions. Items range from 1=not at all, 2=not much, 3=some, to 4=a lot with higher scores indicating higher cultural identification with the culture described.</description>
