      The primary objective of the trial is to investigate if nivolumab plus ipilimumab given as
      adjuvant treatment improve disease free survival (DFS) in patients with stage Ib-IVa gastric
      and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma and high risk of recurrence (defined by ypN1-3
      and/or R1 status) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and resection.

      Other study objectives:

        -  To investigate the safety and effect of adjuvant immunotherapy on long term oncologic
           outcomes and quality of life of patients in the study

        -  To correlate nutritional status assessment on outcomes and quality of life of patients

             Lewis or McKeown oesophagectomy with two field lymphadenectomy should have been
             performed for junctional Siewert type I cancers. For Siewert type II cancers either
             total gastrectomy with D2-lymphadenectomy or oesophagectomy with two field
             lymphadenectomy should have been completed. Open, minimal invasive or hybrid surgical
             approaches are acceptable as long as the requirements above are fulfilled.

             resected and examined.

             of an ypN0 status patients must meet the inclusion criterion of R1 resection.

          -  R0 or R1 resection according to current (8th) version of TNM classification system. In
             case of R0 resection, patients must meet the inclusion criterion of ypN1-3

             drug.

          -  Availability of tumor tissue from the resected site of disease must be provided for
             biobanking

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP*) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
