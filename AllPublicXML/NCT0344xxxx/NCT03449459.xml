  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The colonization of potential pathogenic bacteria in lower respiratory tract is thought to be
      accountable for acute exacerbation in subjects with moderate to severe COPD. However, there
      is no accepted therapy for patients with COPD to remove the colonized bacteria in lower
      respiratory tract. Therefore, we plan to perform a multi-center, randomized, controlled trial
      to study the efficacy and safety of oral probiotics, aerosol inhaled amikacin or combined
      vaccination to decolonize bacteria in lower respiratory tract and prevent acute exacerbation
      of COPD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory disease characterized
      by incomplete reversible airflow limitation, small airway obstruction and alveolar structural
      damage. About 3 million patients die from COPD every year around the world. The prevalence of
      COPD in Chinese people over the age of 40 is as high as 12 % and has risen by 50 % in the
      past nine years.

      Acute exacerbation is the leading cause of death in patients with COPD , and accounts for a
      majority of expenditure of COPD management. The colonization of potential pathogenic bacteria
      in the lower respiratory tract is an important cause of the acute exacerbation especially in
      patients with moderate and severe COPD.

      Some clinical studies show that aerosol inhaled antibiotics is promising in reducing acute
      exacerbation, but these exploratory studies have some defects so that they can't back up for
      the clinical application of aerosol inhaled antibiotics. Amikacin, a kind of aminoglycosides,
      is sensitive to the common pathogens of acute exacerbation of COPD in China. Therefore it is
      necessary to carry out a clinical trial to verify its efficacy and safety in pathogen
      decolonization and prevention of acute exacerbation.

      In addition, owing to bacterial resistance and insufficient antibiotics concentration in
      lower respiratory tract, developing new antibacterial materials is necessary. Oral probiotics
      is an another way to regulate the bacterial load and inflammatory response in lower
      respiratory tract, which has been proven to effectively prevent acute exacerbation in cystic
      fibrosis and childhood asthma. Likewise, airway bacterial burden and inflammation are two
      main mechanisms of acute exacerbation in COPD. Hence, considering its convenience and safety
      of oral probiotics, we perform a trial to make clinical evaluation for it.

      What's more, influenza and streptococcus pneumoniae vaccines are separately recommended for
      patients with COPD in the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease(GOLD),
      but there have been no studies on the effects of combined vaccination on bacterial
      decolonization in lower respiratory tract or on the prevention of acute exacerbation.

      Effects of these above methods on the decolonization of potential pathogenic bacteria in
      lower respiratory tract and the inflammatory reaction are not clear. Therefore, we plan to
      perform a multi-center, randomized, controlled trial to study the efficacy and safety of oral
      probiotics, aerosol inhaled amikacin or combined vaccination to decolonize bacteria in lower
      respiratory tract and prevent acute exacerbation of COPD.

    <measure>Colonization of potential pathogenic bacteria in induced sputum</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Induced sputum represents the specimen from lower respiratory tract and should be processed within six hours after collection. Sputum plugs were separated from contaminating saliva by macroscopic examination using sterile forceps. Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa which are the top four bacteria involved in acute exacerbation of COPD are defined as potential pathogenic bacteria. Using the plate count method, when the colony number of above four bacteria is over 100 cfu/ml，we define this bacteria as colonized bacteria in lower respiratory tract.</description>

    <measure>Microbiome in induced sputum</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Induced sputum represents the specimen from lower respiratory tract and should be processed within six hours after collection. Sputum plugs were separated from contaminating saliva by macroscopic examination using sterile forceps and weighed. Bacterial genomic DNA was isolated from sputum plugs of the same weight using the specific kits. The 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA genes were Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-amplified with the appropriate controls against reagent contamination. Amplified DNA fragments were sequenced using the specific sequencing platform. Sequencing reads were processed and analyzed by the specific algorithm and software. The composition and diversity of microbiome are represented by major taxonomic groups at both phylum and genus levels. If necessary, Quantitative PCR for 16S rRNA gene will be performed to validate the results of sequencing. By using these methos, we can detect the microbiome's composition and its shift.</description>
