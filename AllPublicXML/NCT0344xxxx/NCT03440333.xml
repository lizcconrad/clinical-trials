  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The traditional concept believes that the etiology of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome
      (RDS) is immature development of lung,especially the surfactant synthesis system,and RDS is
      still one of the major causes of mortality and morbidity in newborns, especially premature
      infants[1].In recent years, using pulmonary surfactant replacement therapy (PS treatment) in
      the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a major breakthrough in neonatal
      medicine [2].Combined with clinical practice and experience,and through Meta analysis of
      related randomized controlled trials (RCTs),it confirms that natural surfactant treatment can
      reduce mortality,the incidence of pulmonary air leaks (pneumothorax and interstitial lung
      emphysema),and the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or 28-day-old mortality.For
      RDS in preterm infants whose gestation is &lt;35 weeks ,surfactant replacement therapy is also
      more effective than in nearly term and full term infants.Therefore, in the analysis of cases
      of different gestational age groups,the investigators should focus on the study of premature
      infants cases.Due to less relevant research for using PS treatment to cure newborn RDS in
      high altitude area,this retrospective study conducts statistics and analysis of recently
      three-year cases in some hospital of high altitude area,to explore the treatment effect of
      the high altitude region and the impact of altitude on the treatment.

      in order to explore feasibility and efficacy for PS treatment of newborn RDS in high-altitude
      area ,and its efficacy at different altitudes, the investigators conduct a multi-center
      retrospective study of RDS cases in Qinghai and Tibet these two high-altitude area,and use
      RDS cases under the unique conditions to do statistics and analysis.
