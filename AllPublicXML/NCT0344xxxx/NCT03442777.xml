  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if silicone adhesive multilayer foam dressings
      applied to the sacrum, heels and greater trochanter in addition to standard prevention reduce
      pressure ulcer incidence category II, III, IV, Unstageable and Deep Tissue Injury (DTI)
      compared to standard pressure ulcer prevention alone, in at risk hospitalised patients. In
      particular, this trial extends previous trial results obtained in ICU setting. Therefore,
      only a maximum of 25% of patients will be recruited from ICU settings.

      The hypothesis is: 'The use of silicone adhesive multilayer foam dressings as adjuvant
      prophylactic therapy for pressure ulcer prevention is more effective in reducing pressure
      ulcer category II, III, IV, Unstageable, and Deep Tissue Injury (DTI) incidence rate on
      sacrum, heels and greater trochanter, compared to standard pressure ulcer prevention alone.'
      The null hypothesis is: 'The use of silicone adhesive multilayer foam dressings as adjuvant
      prophylactic therapy for pressure ulcer prevention is not more effective in reducing pressure
      ulcer category II, III, IV, Unstageable, and Deep Tissue Injury (DTI) incidence rate on
      sacrum, heels and greater trochanter, compared to standard pressure ulcer prevention alone.

      A multicentre randomised controlled open label parallel group medical device trial in
      approximately 8 hospitals in Belgium.

      Patients will be randomly allocated to three study arms based on a 1:1:1 allocation:

      Study arm 1 (on top of standard of care):

        -  Patients at risk for pressure ulcer category II, III, IV, Unstageable, and Deep Tissue
           Injury (DTI) development will receive standard pressure ulcer prevention strategies (as
           described in the hospital protocol) which include ongoing risk assessment, regular
           repositioning and skin care.

        -  Skin sites (restricted to sacrum, heel right/left and greater trochanter right/left)
           will be treated with silicone adhesive multilayer foam dressings by Smith &amp; Nephew
           (Allevyn® brand).

      Study arm 2 (on top of standard of care):

        -  Patients at risk for pressure ulcer category II, III, IV, Unstageable, and Deep Tissue
           Injury (DTI) development will receive standard pressure ulcer prevention strategies (as
           described in the hospital protocol) which include ongoing risk assessment, regular
           repositioning and skin care.

        -  Skin sites (restricted to sacrum, heel right/left and greater trochanter right/left)
           will be treated with silicone adhesive multilayer foam dressings by Mölnlycke Health
           care (Mepilex® brand).

      Study arm 3 (standard of care):

        -  Patients at risk for pressure ulcer category II, III, IV, Unstageable, and Deep Tissue
           Injury (DTI) development will receive standard pressure ulcer prevention strategies (as
           described in the hospital protocol) which include ongoing risk assessment, regular
           repositioning and skin care.

        -  No silicone adhesive multilayer foam dressings will be applied on the skin sites of
           interest for this trial (sacrum, heel right/left, greater trochanter right/left).

      Skin sites (restricted to sacrum, heel right/left, greater trochanter right/left) of patients
      at risk for pressure ulcer category II, III, IV, Unstageable, and Deep Tissue Injury (DTI)
      development will be assessed daily for a maximum period of 14 days.

             - There is already a pressure ulcer category II or worse at that skin site.

          5. Written informed consent by the patient or his/her legal representative.

          3. Both heels amputated

          4. Previously known/documented allergy for substances used in the devices under study.

          6. Participation in another interventional clinical trial.

          7. Patients who exceptionally receive or are planned to receive a dressing for the
             prevention of pressure ulcers at sacrum, heels and trochanters based on best medical
