  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The National Institutes of Health has encouraged research examining effects of BPA, yet
      evidence in humans evaluating the effects of BPA on insulin and glucose concentrations
      remains exclusively associative in nature. Thus, the primary purpose of this study is to
      determine whether an acute oral ingestion of BPA impacts insulin and glucose concentrations,
      and other endocrine factors (Pro-insulin, C-Peptide, Estrogen, triglycerides). Findings from
      this pilot study will inform public health recommendations for food packaging and provide
      much needed experimental evidence as to whether BPA poses any public health risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of diabetes is well established affecting &gt;29 million Americans with 90-95% of
      these individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The etiology of type 2 diabetes is not
      fully understood, but clearly diet, physical activity, and genetics play roles. Emerging data
      suggests a novel hypothesis that synthetic non-persistent endocrine disruptors used in a
      variety of common consumer goods, including the industry-produced chemical bisphenol A (BPA)
      play a pivotal role in type 2 diabetes and obesity rates. In support of this hypothesis,
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII),
      and other cross-sectional data have shown associations between urinary BPA concentrations and
      type-2 diabetes, pre-diabetes, insulin resistance, and hemoglobin A1c. The National
      Institutes of Health has encouraged research examining effects of BPA, yet evidence in humans
      evaluating the effects of BPA on insulin and glucose concentrations remains exclusively
      associative in nature. Thus, the primary purpose of this study is to determine whether an
      acute oral ingestion of BPA impacts insulin and glucose concentrations, and other endocrine
      factors (Pro-insulin, C-Peptide, Estrogen, triglycerides) in the pathogenesis of Type 2
      diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Findings from this pilot study will inform public health
      recommendations for food packaging and provide much needed experimental evidence as to
      whether BPA poses any public health risk.
