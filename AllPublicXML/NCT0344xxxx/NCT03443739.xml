  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to find out the effects a specific religious fast (i.e. Bahá'í fast)
      has on certain metabolic parameters, hydration, psyche and circadian clock

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Followers of the Bahá'í Faith worldwide follow a yearly fasting tradition, where they fast
      intermittently for nineteen days. The intermittent fast is defined as abstinence from any
      food, drink and smoking from sunrise until sunset. These nineteen days are always in March
      and so do not coincide with climatic extremes in any country worldwide. This makes this kind
      of fasting a good model to study the psychological and medical effects of intermittent
      fasting in humans.
