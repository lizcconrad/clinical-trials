  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The following study will be a comparison of balance and quality of life in Tai Chi training
      programs and Shotokan-Karate training programs in individuals with Parkinson's Disease. The
      following study will be a 12-week program which will assess whether or not Shotokan-Karate
      betters balance and quality of life even more than Tai Chi. Both Tai Chi and Karate will be
      taught by a professional instruction at the Sun Life Financial Movement Disorders and
      Rehabilitation Centre located in Waterloo, Ontario.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system which affects
      movement. Some signs and symptoms of PD include; tremors, rigidity, gait impairments, and
      balance disruption. Individuals with PD experience substantially impaired balance ultimately
      affecting their functional abilities. With this, individuals with PD may also experience
      lower quality of life due to these diminished determinants. Currently, there are medications
      which have proven to mask the symptoms of Parkinson's such as levodopa. There are also
      exercise programs which have proven to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease such as
      resistance based exercises and Tai Chi.based on the proven benefits of balance and overall
      quality of life through Shotokan-karate training, the purpose of this study will be to
      compare Shotokan-karate training versus Tai Chi on balance and quality of life in individuals
      with Parkinson's disease. Based on the literature available on the benefits of
      shotokan-karate on balance and quality of life in the elderly, it is hypothesized that
      shotokan-karate will improve balance and quality of life due to its high intensity, increased
      engagement and similarities to everyday movements. If the following hypothesis is supported,
      the present study will allow for individuals with Parkinson's disease to engage in an
      exercise program that shows vast improvements in their postural stability and overall quality
      of life. In addition, participants will be able to engage in an exercise program which will
      provide them with long term benefits and they will be able to implement this in their
      everyday lifestyle.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will complete the experimental procedures of the present study during a 12-week training period. All participants will be asked to participate in a Shotokan-karate or Tai Chi training group. The Shotokan-karate training will involve one hour training sessions broken down into 3 components; warm-up exercises, Katas, and cool-down exercises. The protocol for Tai Chi will involve a one-hour training session which will be conducted by an instructor at the Sun Life Financial Movement Disorders and Rehabilitation Centre. All exercises will be administered by trained instructors throughout the 12-week training period. The 30-minute UPDRS assessment will be administered by Dr. Quincy Almeida,a movement disorder specialist.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Participants will be asked to complete the motor section of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-II) which will be assessed by the supervisor (Quincy J. Almeida). UPDRS-II will be assessed during the pre-testing period and the post-testing period which will be after the 12 week training program. UPDRS-II will be reassessed once again after a one month wash out period after the completion of the study. It will assess the progression of Parkinson's over the course of the exercise program and will look into how the disease has changed over time.</description>

    <description>PDQ-39 (Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire) is a self-reported questionnaire, which assesses a given individuals quality of life while living with Parkinson's Disease. The assessment is usually done within the ending of the designated training program. PDQ-39 assesses the experiences the participant has experienced in the training program (positive or negative), and its impact on the eight quality of life dimensions on specific areas of wellbeing in Parkinson's.</description>

    <description>The first condiition in which balance will be measured on individuals with Parkinson's disease will be through the use of the &quot;Timed-up-and-Go&quot; (TUG) Test. The (TUG) Test is performed on a 4.27m long and 1.22m wide ProtoKinetics Movement Analysis Software^TM electronic walkway carpet (Zeno Walkway- Protokinetics, Haverton, PA, USA) that will capture spatiotemporal aspects of the participant's gait. The participants will begin the task by sitting on a chair placed on the Zeno Walkway. Participants will then be asked to stand up and walk to a pylon 3 meters away, then turn around at the pylon and walk back to the chair to sit down. A stopwatch will be used to record time in which it takes the participants to perform the task. The Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) Test will measure balance, ability to walk, and the risk of falls in older adults.</description>
