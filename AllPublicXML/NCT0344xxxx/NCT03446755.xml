    <textblock>
      Patients suffering of subfertility as a consequence of intra uterine adhesions could be
      treated with adhesiolysis by hysteroscopy. Post-operative recurrent adhesions could be
      developed. To prevent these recurrent adhesions, an intra uterine balloon is inserted as a
      barrier. The investigator wants to test if the intra uterine balloon is a good alternative
      for the current used intra uterine device or gel.

      Patients suffering of subfertility as a consequence of intra uterine adhesions could be
      treated with adhesiolysis by hysteroscopy. Post-operative recurrent adhesions could be
      developped. To prevent these recurrent adhesions, an intra uterine balloon is inserted as a
      barrier. The investigator wants to test if the intra uterine balloon is a good alternative
      for the current used intra uterine device or gel.

      The investigator wants to include 20 patients with intra uterine adhesions and who need a
      adhesiolysis by hysteroscopy. The intra uterine balloon will be placed after the adhesiolysis
      and will be removed after 6 days. During these 6 days an antibiotic cure together with the
      standard hormone therapy will be administered to the patient. During the 6 days the patients
      will need to evaluate their pain, the comfort of the balloon, the impact on their daily
      functioning and their satisfaction.

      After 6 days, the balloon will be removed and again a pain score together with a score for
      the ease of removing the balloon will be collected .

      After 8 weeks a second look hysteroscopy will be planned to check the degree of adhesion and
      if there are any other complications.
