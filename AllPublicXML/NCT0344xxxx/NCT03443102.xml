  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV has caused severe epidemic respiratory disease in human populations. By July 2003, a
      total of 8,096 probable cases of SARS had been reported including 774 deaths in 27 countries,
      around one-third of which were health care workers (HCWs). Previous studies have been
      reported about long-term impacts of SARS infection, including lung function deficiency,
      steroid-induced osteonecrosis, reduced exercise capacity, and impairment in health-related
      quality of life (HRQoL). HCWs, especially nurses, have been reported to experience greater
      psychological distress, particularly increased levels of posttraumatic stress symptomatology
      (PTSS). But the very complex impacts of this fatal infection on HCWs have not been fully
      elucidated. It is thus important to follow these occupational patients to detect and manage
      multi-organ sequelae and functional impairment.
