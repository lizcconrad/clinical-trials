    <textblock>
      assessment of inflammatory bowel disease patients in activity and remission by abdominal
      ultrasound examine non-invasive and in physiological condition by measuring the colon wall
      thickness in diagnosis and follow up the patient also including extra intestinal features
      such as the splanchnic vessels,mesentery and lymph nodes . Doppler u.s can evaluate bowel
      wall vascularity In activity and remission . peripheral hemogram in relationship to activity
      inflammatory bowel disease asses anemia ,increase monocyte and decrease mean platelet volume(
      MPV) . also,the investigator will evaluate the outcome of different lines of treatment
      traditional and biologic therapy (response to treatment,times of activity and complications)

      the participants will follow up the patient for 1 year in the first visit

      All patients in this study will be subjected to:

        1. Detailed history.

        2. Careful physical examination

        3. laboratory investigation

             1. complete blood picture.

             2. liver function

             3. kidney function

             4. Iron profile(serum iron ,serum ferritin

             5. ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate )

           g-CRP (C reactive protein) f-LDH (lactate dehydrogenase)

        4. Abdominal us(the colon wall thickness,lymph nodes,mass,other organs)

        5. Doppler us (mesenteric vessels)

        6. colonoscopy after 1 year of treatment follow up every 3 months by abdominal US and
           peripheral hemogram and last visit after 1 year colonoscopy and biopsy for assessment
           response to treatment
