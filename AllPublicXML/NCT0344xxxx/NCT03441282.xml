  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concept of precision medicine - taking individual variability into account when planning
      preventions and interventions - is not new but is quickly gaining attention in this age of
      powerful methodology of patient characterization and development of tools to analyze large
      sets of data. Oncology is the most obvious field in which this information has been readily
      applied. Increasing focus, nationally and internationally, on developing broad databases of
      patient genetic information and research efforts evaluating those data will, hopefully, lead
      to the development and application of evidence-based data enhancing the practice of all
      fields of medicine. It has yet to become obvious how this information can best be applied to
      the field of anesthesiology. Most genomics work in anesthesia has been focused in the area of
      pain medicine. There is a known genetic influence on the potency of opioid-induced analgesia,
      however; a genetic component of opioid-induced respiratory depression has yet to be
      thoroughly evaluated. Respiratory depression plays a role in clinical care - from procedures
      requiring sedation with monitored anesthesia care to treating post-opertative pain and
      chronic pain - but perhaps its largest current role in the public arena is the unfortunate
      deaths caused by side effects due to drug overdose.

      Personalized medicine remains on the horizon for the field of anesthesia, but, as genetic
      testing becomes more affordable and mainstream in clinical practice, the potential
      applications are broad. Most readily would be its incorporation into development of patient
      specific pain regimens. Respiratory depression is a potentially lethal side effect of opioid
      therapy. In light of the opioid epidemic and CDC-scrutiny of opioid use, determining genetic
      profiles susceptible to respiratory depression could prove useful in further tailoring the
      treatment of pain both in the perioperative setting and in the chronic pain management
      setting.

      This would be a prospective study for which patients not prescribed chronic pain medication
      (defined as not using narcotic medications in 3 months prior to surgery) and presenting for
      surgery would be recruited. Preop administration of sedating medications (i.e. midazolam)
      would be avoided. On the day of surgery, once in OR and standard ASA monitors placed, a
      standardized dose of 2mcg/kg ideal body weight IV fentanyl is administered. The patient is
      then monitored for respiratory depression for 5 minutes prior to administration of additional
      induction agents. [would include respiratory rate, with RR &lt; 10, or O2 Sat &lt; 90%]. Would not
      provide supplemental oxygen during this time unless patient was already on supplemental
      oxygen. Patient would then be preoxygenated and general anesthesia induced. Once general
      anesthesia is induced, a blood sample is collected and stored. [sample could also be
      collected in preop upon IV placement]. Blood will be tested for Single Nucleotide
      Polymorphisms of genes related to opioid-induced analgesia. [Potential target genes listed in
      7.0-1] This genomic data will be evaluated for any correlations of the presence of
      opioid-related SNPs and concomitant opioid-induced respiratory depression.
