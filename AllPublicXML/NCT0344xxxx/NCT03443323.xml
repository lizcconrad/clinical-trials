  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Organizational Skills Training Program - School
      based version (OST-S) in a cluster randomized trial. Participating schools will be randomly
      assigned to one of two groups: 1) an OST-S intervention group and 2) a treatment as usual
      control group. Participating students (3rd through 5th grade) will be from 20 schools in
      Pennsylvania and New Jersey and include both urban and suburban schools serving a diverse
      population. OST-S is a small-group, skills training intervention for children, which includes
      parent and teacher consultation to support student use of new skills. The program is
      delivered by school staff who receive training and consultation from intervention experts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Context: Although multiple factors influence school functioning, executive function (EF)
      deficits have been found to be a key predictor of academic achievement. EF is a higher order
      cognitive ability associated with persistent goal-directed behavior. Organization, time
      management, and planning (OTMP) skills are aspects of EF that are particularly associated
      with children's academic performance. Organizational demands increase over the course of
      early schooling and are relatively high by 3rd through 5th grade. Poor OTMP skills during
      this period adversely impact academic functioning. In the late elementary school grades, as
      students are expected to become more organized, some students have difficulty learning these
      skills in spite of classroom supports provided by teachers, placing them at increased risk
      for academic failure.

      Objectives: The purpose of this Goal 3 efficacy study is to conduct an evaluation of the
      Organizational Skills Training Program - School version (OST-S), a fully developed
      intervention for students in general education. The proposed study builds upon research
      demonstrating the efficacy of a clinic-based version of the OST intervention (OST-C) in
      remediating OTMP skills deficits and improving academic functioning for 3rd, 4th and 5th
      graders with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and a recent pilot research
      demonstrating the feasibility and potential effectiveness of OST-S provided by end users
      (&quot;school partners&quot;) for 3rd through 5th graders. It also builds upon research training school
      staff to implement evidence-based interventions with high fidelity.

      Study Design: This is a cluster-randomized trial with a treatment as usual (TAU) control
      group.

      Setting/Participants: Schools are located in Pennsylvania and New Jersey and include 20 urban
      and suburban schools serving a diverse population. Students (3rd to 5th grade) who are
      struggling the most with OTMP deficits and whose academic performance is negatively impacted
      by their OTMP deficits will be referred to the study team by their general education
      teachers.

      Study Interventions and Measures: OST-S is a small group skills training intervention, with
      parents and teachers supporting children's use of new skills. The program manual includes
      strategies for training and coaching school staff, referred to as school partners, to
      effectively implement OST-S and guidelines to modify the program for implementation in
      diverse schools with diverse students. Each student session includes: (a) homework review to
      assess completion of between-session skills implementation; (b) skill-building activities,
      which include the use of modeling, shaping, guided practice, and reinforcement for organized
      behavior; and (c) activities to promote generalization of skills. Sessions address four
      organizational challenges: (a) tracking assignments, (b) managing materials, (c) managing
      time, and (d) planning for long term assignments.

      Investigators will measure the following: intervention fidelity, stakeholder engagement,
      student OTMP skills, student academic self-efficacy, student academic outcomes, student
      characteristics, feasibility, usability, and acceptability of OST-S. In addition,
      Investigators will track the interventions that are offered as treatment-as-usual in TAU
      schools. A cost analysis related to the implementation of OST-S will also be completed.

    <description>The Children's Organizational Skills Scales (COSS) will be used to assess changes in OTMP functioning at home and school over several time points. COSS total scores have good discriminant validity and are sensitive to treatment effects. Each COSS version uses a 4-point rating scale (1=Hardly ever or never to 4=Just about all of the time). Although the COSS yields three subscale scores, only the total score will be used to reduce the number of measures in the analyses.</description>

    <measure>Students' Organization of Academic Materials</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10-weeks (post-treatment), 5-months and 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Checklists will be used to assess changes in how students organize their academic materials and record their assignments in their planner. These checklists have been developed for middle and high school students with ADHD, and we have adapted them for use with elementary students. The criteria on the checklists are behaviorally defined. Scores for &quot;Organization&quot; and &quot;Planner&quot; are calculated by determining the percentage of criteria met. Research assistants will be trained to complete these checklists.</description>

    <measure>Completion of classwork/homework samples</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10-weeks (post-treatment), 5-months and 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Teachers will submit copies of students' classwork and homework for a 2-week period coinciding with each assessment period (noted below in &quot;time frame&quot;). In addition, teachers will submit a list of classwork and homework assigned during each assessment period, so that it can be determined whether assignments were completed. The study team member will randomly select three classwork and homework assignments to score. The accuracy of work completed as a function of work assigned will be computed for each sample. Accuracy in completing assignments has been demonstrated to be moderately correlated (p&lt;.01) with teacher ratings of inattention and teacher ratings of homework responsibility.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Any student enrolled in grades 3 thru 5 in one of the participating schools who meets the
        following criteria.

          1. First, students will be recommended by their general education teacher if the
             following are true: (a) students who are struggling the most with OTMP skills, (b)
             whose academic performance is negatively impacted by their OTMP deficits, and (c) who
             have at least one parent who speaks English.

          2. Second, students must have or be at risk for developing OTMP deficits.

          3. Third, the teacher must rate the student's OTMP skills deficits as having a negative
             impact on academic performance.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Students will be excluded if they are in a pull-out special education classroom for
             more than 50% of the day as the organizational demands for these students may differ
             from those students placed mostly in general education.

          2. Students with a one-to-one aide will be excluded because the presence of an aide
             substantially alters how an organizational intervention is implemented.

          3. Students from families in which both caregivers do not speak English will be excluded
             because the program has not yet been developed for non-English speakers.

          4. Only one student per family will be included in the study.
