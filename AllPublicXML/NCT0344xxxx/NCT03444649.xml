      This trial assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to characterize dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs) of epacadostat when added to the anthracycline/cytarabine combination as
      first-line induction treatment in AML patients fit for intensive treatment

      Background and Rationale:

      Epacadostat (INCB024360) is an Inhibitor of Indoleamine 2,3- dioxygenase 1 (IDO1).
      Indoleamine 2,3- dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a 403 amino acid cytosolic haem enzyme encoded by
      the INDO gene on human chromosome 8p22. IDO1 is responsible for the catabolism of the
      essential amino acid tryptophan (trp) to kynurenine (kyn) within immune cells and a subset of
      tumor cells resulting in inhibition of antitumor cell-mediated immune responses. Increased
      IDO activity correlates with lower CR rates and shorter OS in AML.

      Objective:

      The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to characterize
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of epacadostat when added to the anthracycline/cytarabine
      combination as first-line induction treatment in AML patients fit for intensive Treatment.

      Study Duration:

      Phase I part will last from 3 to 18 months (permitting the enrolment of minimum of 3 and a
      maximum of 18 patients).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  AML (according to the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification definition
             of ≥ 20% blasts; Arber et al, 2016) suitable for intensive treatment (including stem
             cell transplantation) with a curative intent.

          -  Patients must be aged &gt; 18 years, and must have given voluntary written informed
             consent.

          -  Women of childbearing potential having a negative serum pregnancy test at screening or

             leukocyte control which should be discontinued by the first day of induction
