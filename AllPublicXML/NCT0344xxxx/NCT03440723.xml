  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trial to compare the interexaminer agreement between two cervical dilation examinations
      conducted by Labor and Delivery physicians when using standard methods versus DilaCheck
      device.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial seeks to compare the DilaCheck device with standard digital cervical dilation
      examinations. 50 laboring female participants will be enrolled with 25 randomly assigned to
      the control arm and 25 to the treatment (DilaCheck) arm. Each participant will receive two
      cervical dilation examinations from two separate physicians. The main outcome measure is
      agreement between the two cervical dilation measurements. Secondary outcomes include ease of
      use of the device and pain levels.

    <description>Agreement between 2 cervical dilation measurements taken by 2 different physicians. The measurements are reported in full centimeters.

    <description>Subjective experience of pain during dilation examinations as measured by a survey given to patient participants following the cervical dilation examinations. The pain measurement is a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being no pain and 10 being extreme pain. The participant enters a number from 1 to 10 on the survey.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The research population is pregnant women in the first stage of labor. Subjects
             eligible for inclusion in the study must be: pregnant women who are admitted to a
             Labor and Delivery unit for management or induction of labor in the first stage of
             labor, are able to give informed consent, are 18 years of age or greater, speak
             English, and have a gestational age greater than or equal to 37 weeks (i.e. term
             pregnancy). Patients are only consented if they have adequate pain control, either
             because they are not yet in labor (i.e. are admitted for an induction of labor) or
             have a functioning epidural.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria include progression to the second stage of labor (i.e. known
             dilation of ten centimeters), known rupture of membranes, any condition that renders
             labor unsafe for the patient (e.g. cardiac conditions, pulmonary hypertension) and any
             other condition that necessitates an emergent or urgent cesarean section (e.g.
             non-reassuring fetal status, placental abruption, hemorrhage, cord prolapse). All
             participants are necessarily female due to the subject matter. Given the vulnerability
             of pregnant patients under the age of 18, this study will exclude children. There are
             no restrictions on eligibility based on race or ethnicity.
