  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trend of diabetes prevalence was increased by comparing these two national surveys in
      2009 and 2014. However, the studies only focused on the prevalence and risk of diabetes and
      non-communicable diseases in Myanmar. The study focused on the common complications of
      Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) is rare. The studies in other countries showed high
      prevalence rate and under-diagnosis of DPN. Most of the patients with DPN did not complain
      about their symptoms because of without prominent symptoms. DPN is the major complication of
      diabetes. According to the international studies, DPN has the hidden epidemic and is the
      common causes which can lead to disability and decreased the quality of life in diabetes.
      Therefore, the study focused on the prevalence of DPN and its impact on the ADLs is
      obligatory as the descriptive study to explore the actual situation.

      Nursing care is not only for the patients in the hospital but also for the people in the
      community. Moreover, the nurses have to focus on all levels of prevention. Diabetes is the
      lifelong diseases and accessibility of health care for everyone with diabetes is a very
      important issue in the era with increased prevalence of diabetes. Therefore, we all have to
      focus not only on the primary prevention but also on the secondary and tertiary prevention of
      diabetes. The secondary and tertiary prevention in the diabetic patients also means the
      primary prevention of other diseases and disabilities (the complications of diabetes). For
      diabetic neuropathic patients, maintaining normal daily living is very important liked
      everyone. After getting information about the prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy,
      the future research can be focused on the prevention of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and
      its complications. Furthermore, the intervention to decreases the development of DPN and
      impact of DPN on the ADLs will be supported to study.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of DPN and DPNP in type 2 diabetic
      patients and impact on the activities of daily living. The descriptive, cross-sectional study
      design will be used in this study. The inclusion criteria are the person aged over 25 years
      of age who had already diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus, taking any anti-glycemic
      treatment. The persons who are suffering from neuropathy and neuropathic pain other than
      diabetes, severe illness of diabetic patients, mental illness and alcoholism will be excluded
      from this study.

      The patients who are coming to the diabetic clinic at the outpatient department of Yangon
      General Hospital (YGH), North-Okkalapa General Hospital (NOGH), East Yangon General Hospital
      (EYGH), West Yangon General Hospital (WYGH) in Myanmar will be collected as the sample.
      Convenience sampling method will be used in this study. The patients who meet the inclusion
      criteria and come to outpatient diabetic clinics at YGH, NOGH, EYGH, and WYGH will be chosen
      as a sample after obtaining informed consent. Sample size will be calculated by using formula
      described by Keysel et al. 975 participants will be used as the sample to cover the dropout
      rate 20%.

      Data collection will be done at this outpatients diabetic clinic of these four hospitals.
      After getting informed consent, the medical history of diabetic adults who meet the including
      criteria will be collected from medical records. Data collection will be done by using the
      standardized measurement tools [Patient Neurotoxicity Questionnaire (PNQ), short-form McGill
      Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ), and visual analog scale (0-100)] in Myanmar languages. All of
      the instruments had been tested the reliability of back to back translation by two translator
      independently. Demographic data and health history will also be collected at the start of the
      interview.

      Physical assessments will be done by using standardized instruments which used to test hand
      and leg functioning. The strength of hand grip and pinch force will be assessed in both
      hands. 10-g Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament (SWM) test will be measured in index and ring
      finger of both hands and four areas of the foot. Moreover, time up and go (TUG) will be used
      to collect data about walking time and gait in DPN patients.

      This study has already obtained ethical clearance from Nursing Science Ethical Review
      Committee, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Okayama University, Japan with the review
      number D1605. It will be carrying out after obtaining approval from Department of Medical
      Research, Myanmar. At the outset, informed consent will be obtained with detailed information
      about the purpose of research, the part they need to participate, possible benefits and their
      rights to withdraw.
