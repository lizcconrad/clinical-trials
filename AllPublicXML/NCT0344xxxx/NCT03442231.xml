  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective/prospective, open-label single cohort, multicenter study to collect
      relevant clinical data from 147 subjects with unicompartmental degeneration of the knee in
      whom the Journey UNI UKS was previously implanted.

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of the current investigation is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the
      JOURNEY UNI Unicompartmental Knee System (UKS) in patients with non-inflammatory degenerative
      joint disease (NIDJD) of the knee who previously had the Journey UNI UKS implanted. This
      clinical study will prospectively evaluate the 36 and 60-month safety and performance of the
      JOURNEY UNI UKS in patients with NIDJD of the knee who required lateral or medial knee
      compartment replacement.

        Investigators will pre-screen all subjects that have previously undergone UKA using the
        Journey UNI UKS system between 12 and 48 months previously using only the existing
        information in the medical records.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Between 12 and 48 months previously, subject had unicompartmental knee replacement
             implanted for unicompartmental, NIDJD including OA, traumatic arthritis, avascular
             necrosis, for correction of functional deformity, or to repair a fracture that was
             unmanageable using other techniques.

          2. Subject received a Journey UKS implant (consisting of a femoral component, tibial
             baseplate, and a tibial insert).

          3. Subject was considered skeletally mature at the time of surgery and was at least 18
             years of age.

          4. Subject is willing to have retrospective data collected and to participate in required
             prospective follow-up visit(s) at the investigational site and to complete study
             procedures and questionnaires.

          5. Subject has consented to participate in the study by signing the Institutional Review
             Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC)-approved informed consent form (ICF).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 40 within 1 month of surgery. 2. Subjects who have
             received the Journey UNI UKS as part of a revision surgery.

             3. Subject has a condition that may interfere with the unicompartmental knee
             arthroplasty (UKA) survival or outcome (e.g. Paget's or Charcot's disease, vascular
             insufficiency, muscular atrophy, uncontrolled diabetes, moderate to severe renal
             insufficiency or neuromuscular disease).

             4. Subject has a known allergy to study device or one or more of its components.

             5. Subject, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator (PI), has an emotional or
             neurological condition that would preempt his/her ability or willingness to
             participate in the study including mental illness, mental retardation, drug or alcohol
             abuse.

             6. Subject is entered in another investigational drug, biologic, or device study or
             has been treated with an investigational product in the past 30 days.

             7. Subject is known to be at risk for loss to follow-up, or failure to return for
