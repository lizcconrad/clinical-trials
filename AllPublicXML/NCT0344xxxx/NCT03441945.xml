      The research continuously enrolled 100 patients undergone MCCG between May to December 2017
      as the intervention group with magnetic steering of capsule in the pylorus and duodenum, and
      randomly selected 100 patients before May 2017 from the database as the control group with
      passive movement of the capsule. The difference of the pyloric transit time (PTT) and
      duodenal papilla detection rate (DPDR) between the two groups were compared, and related
      factors were also investigated.

      Background and Aims: Capsule endoscopy is a valuable tool in the diagnosis of small bowel
      disease. However, the incompletion of small bowel examination may reduce the diagnostic
      accuracy, which mainly caused by delayed capsule gastric emptying. Thus the aim of this study
      was to validate the effect of magnetic steering on enhancing gastric emptying and mucosal
      visualization within duodenum during magnetically controlled capsule gastroscopy (MCCG)
      examination.

      Methods: As a historical prospective cohort study, the research continuously enrolled 100
      patients undergone MCCG between May to December 2017 as the intervention group with magnetic
      steering of capsule in the pylorus and duodenum, and randomly selected 100 patients before
      May 2017 from the database as the control group with passive movement of the capsule. The
      difference of the pyloric transit time (PTT) and duodenal papilla detection rate (DPDR)
      between the two groups were compared, and related factors were also investigated.

    <description>The patients swallowed the capsule with water in the lying position.After finishing the stomach examination, the operation of the capsule is adjusted to &quot;small bowel mode&quot; without magnetic control. Capsule entered the duodenum under physiological peristalsis. The position of the capsule was established using a real-time viewer. If the capsule failed to enter the duodenum after one hour, domperidone (10 mg) was orally administered.</description>

    <description>After finishing the stomach examination as the control protocol, the capsule was lifted with the magnetic control, then rotating the capsule until the camera end oriented toward the pylorus . Next, the endoscopist could drag the capsule close to the pylorus with the guidance magnet robot, waiting for the open of pylorus. Once the pylorus opened, the capsule could enter the duodenum with gastric peristalsis. After reaching the duodenal bulb, capsule was held to the maximum position of &quot;Z&quot;, then the capsule would scan the duodenal bulb automatically with the mode &quot;360Â° automatic scanning&quot;.</description>
