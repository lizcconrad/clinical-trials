  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biofeedback is an autonomic response observed during the exposure period to CEMBE. After
      prospectively evaluating 20 healthy individuals or 40 patients with advanced breast cancer or
      hepatocarcinoma, it was possible to determine subtle hemodynamic changes consistent with the
      biofeedback effect associated with exposure to a cancer-specific set of modulated
      frequencies.

      Once CEMBE is administered through an intra-oral administration device, the human body
      absorbs the energy applied at the level of 0.2-1 mW / kg, with a peak absorption in 10 g of
      tissue between 55 and 132 mW / kg. Initially, the discriminatory study analyzing 9
      hemodynamic parameters recorded beat heart beat in 18 individuals demonstrated a hemodynamic
      pattern specific for hepatocarcinoma and breast cancer, with sensitivity of 94.1% and 95%,
      respectively, and specificity of 75% and 95%, respectively. These findings were validated in
      blind analysis in the remaining 56 patients, confirming the high rate of discriminatory
      success.

      A specific pattern of response associated with exposure of a cancer-specific frequency group
      was also observed in patients diagnosed with neoplasia, since the control group of healthy
      individuals did not present these response patterns.

      This specific signature of response to CEMBE-modulated exposure to cancer-specific
      frequencies was significantly altered only in patients with hepatocarcinoma after tumor
      withdrawal (Costa et al, 2015a).

      This is an exploratory, national, unicentric, open study, to be conducted at the Instituto de
      Ensino e Pesquisa do Hospital Sírio Libanês, aiming to determine a method of prospective
      measurement of autonomic responses resulting from exposure to LEEF modulated at specific
      frequencies and with sequential exposure (frequency to frequency) in healthy individuals and
      patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma , followed by new exposure with a new set of
      specific frequencies determined by mathematical method.

      This study aims to create a method for non-invasive diagnosis of biofeedback effect exposure
      to LEEF modulated to specific frequencies in individuals exposed to hepatocellular carcinoma
      -specific frequencies in increasing sequential manner, frequency to frequency in patients
      with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and healthy individuals.

      Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma will be exposed to specific LEEF-modulated
      frequencies (3 to 10 Hz difference) to identify the optimal frequency associated with greater
      response to the biofeedback effect in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma will be exposed to modulated LEEF at a new
      set of specific frequencies determined by mathematical method to identify biofeedback effect
      in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

      This study does not propose to study a therapeutic procedure. For this reason, no
      evolutionary clinical data will be analyzed during and after study intervention.

      This study will be conducted in an outpatient setting and is expected to last 24 months.
