  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of learning support and chat on
      treatment outcome in internet-administrated cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) for
      adolescents with anxiety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is set up as a factorial design with two independent variables: 1: Learning support
      and 2: chat-sessions in real time. The intervention tested is based on cognitive behavior
      therapy delivered over the internet via a secure treatment platform. Participants in the
      study are recruited from the general public via social media. The intervention is in Swedish.

    <time_frame>Two weeks pre treatment, two weeks post treatment, six months post treatment and 12 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Measures clinical anxiety. Change from baseline in symptoms two weeks post treatment and at 12 months post treatment.</description>

    <measure>Penn State Worry Questionnaire for Children (PSWQ - C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Two weeks pre treatment, two weeks post treatment, six months post treatment and 12 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Measures the tendency of youth to engage in excessive, generalized and uncontrollable worry. Respondents rates each item on a 4-point Likert scale consisting of never (0), sometimes (1), often (2) and always (3). The scores from each item are summed together to yield a total score that ranges from 0-42, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of worry.

    <time_frame>First week of treatment and then once a week during the treatment-period, two weeks post treatment, six months post treatment and 12 months post treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Measures severity of generalised anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Mini-Social Phobia Inventory (MINI-SPIN)</measure>
    <time_frame>Two weeks pre treatment, two weeks post treatment, six months post treatment and 12 months post treatment</time_frame>

    <measure>Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire (ACQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Two weeks pre treatment, two weeks post treatment, six months post treatment and 12 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Measures fearful cognitions associated with panic attacks and agoraphobia. The ACQ consists of 14 items which will be scored as a total scale in this study. worry. Respondents rates each item on a 5-point Likert scale consisting of never (1), Thought never occurs (2), Thought rarely occurs (3) Thought occurs during half of the times when I am nervous (4) Thought usually occurs (5) Thought always occurs when I am nervous. ACQ can be divided into two subscales: Loss of Control and Physical Concerns. Each of the subscales consists of 7 items.The total scores (or the subscales) are calculated by averaging the responses to the individual items composing that score. Higher scores indicates higher levels of fearful cognitions. Change from baseline in symptoms two weeks post treatment and at 12 months post treatment.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Two weeks pre treatment, two weeks post treatment, six months post treatment and 12 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Measures global cognitive judgements of one's life satisfacation as a whole, on a 5-item scale. Respondants rates how much they agree or disagree on a 7-pont scale ranging from (7) strongly agree to (1) strongly disagree, where higher scores indicates higher levels of life satisfaction.
