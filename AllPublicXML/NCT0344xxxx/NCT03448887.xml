  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Theranova is a novel medium cut-off (MCO) dialyzer. Previous studies identified that
      theranova dialyzer had superior performance on middle molecule removal to conventional
      hemodialysis (HD) and hemodiafiltration (HDF). The present study addresses to compare
      clinical outcomes including cardiovascular endpoint between HD with theranova dialyzer and
      HDF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While conventional hemodialysis (HD) modality effectively removes small-sized molecules,
      performance with middle-sized and protein-bound molecules is not well established. With
      increasing perception on importance of middle molecule removal, on-line hemodiafiltration
      (HDF) is getting more attention from healthcare professionals. However, HDF has not been
      widely used in Korea due to its technical burden and limited public funding issue.

      Novel medium cut-off (MCO) dialyzer, Theranova, is available in Korea, which showed superior
      performance on middle molecule removal to conventional HD and HDF from the previous study.
      This new dialyzer can be a good alternative option replacing conventional HD or even HDF with
      its benefits. However, current data available on the MCP dialyzer has certain limitations
      such as small sample size, no Asian subject included, limited types of biomarkers, and no
      clinical outcomes (particularly cardiovascular diseases) included.

      With this respect, performance comparison of MCO dialyzer with HDF in terms of clinical
      outcomes, including cardiovascular endpoint would fill the exiting data gap, which is
      absolutely important to make a clinical decision on dialysis modality.
