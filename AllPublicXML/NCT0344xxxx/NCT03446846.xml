    <textblock>
      MIN-117C03 is a 6-week, 3-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      investigate the safety and efficacy of MIN-117 in male and female patients with Major
      Depressive Disorder, aged 18 to 65 years. Approximately 324 patients will be randomly
      assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms, including placebo, 5.0 mg MIN-117, or 2.5 mg MIN-117 in a
      2:1:1 ratio.

    <measure>Change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a validated, physician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity and detect changes due to antidepressant treatment. The test consists of 10 items, each scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a total score of 60. Higher scores represent a more severe conditions. MADRS evaluates apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, interest level, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts. The test exhibits high inter-rater reliability and its capacity to differentiate between responders and nonresponders to antidepressant treatment has been shown to be comparable to the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression.</description>

    <measure>Change in Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) measures the severity of a participant's anxiety, based on 14 parameters, including anxious mood, tension, fears, insomnia, somatic complaints and behavior at the interview. The participant is asked to rate the gravity of each item using a 5-level scale, from 0 to 4, with 4 being the most severe, and afterwards the results are collated and tabulated to determine the severity of anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression of Severity Scale (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the participant's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with participants who have the same diagnosis: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the participant at this time?&quot; which is rated on the following scale: 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; 7 = among the most extremely ill participants. The CGI-S will provide an overall clinician-determined summary measure that takes into account all available information including knowledge of the participant's history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the participant's ability to function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression of Improvement Scale (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression of Improvement Scale (CGI-I) will provide an overall clinician-determined summary measure that takes into account all available information including knowledge of the participant's history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the participant's ability to function. The CGI-I consists of a 7-point scale that evaluates the change from initiation of treatment similar to the Clinical Global Impression of Severity Scale (CGI-S).</description>
