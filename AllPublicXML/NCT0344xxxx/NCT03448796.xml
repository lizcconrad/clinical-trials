  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomised controlled trial where clinical and radiological outcome of high
      tibial opening wedge osteotomy with physiotherapy is compared to physiotherapy alone while
      treating symptomatic medial knee osteoarthrosis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      90 Symptomatic patients with mild to moderate medial knee osteoarthrosis are randomized to
      two groups:

      Group 1 (HTO-group) receive an diagnostic arthroscopy with high tibial opening wedge
      osteotomy (Tomofix-plate). Postoperatively a supervised physiotherapeutic rehabilitation
      program is started.

      Group 2 (FT-group) receive the same supervised physiotherapeutic rehabilitation program
      without the HTO or arthroscopy.

      Primary outcome measure is composite score of Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score
      (KOOS5).

      Secondary outcome measures are pain (VAS), KOOS subscales, objective physical performance
      measurements, progression of osteoarthrosis (X-ray, MRI), change of mechanical axis,
      complications, treatment costs, rate of reoperation, revision to total knee arthroplasty
      (TKA), biological markers of arthrosis progression, 15D (quality of life assessment), QALY
      (Quality-Adjusted Life-Year), Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire, Work
      Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire, sum of governmental benefits received.

      Outcomes will be measured at 24, 60 and 120 months after the intervention.
