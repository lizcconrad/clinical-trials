    <textblock>
      Phase Ia - The main objective of the dose-escalation part of the trial is to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD), based on the frequency of patients experiencing dose limiting
      toxicities (DLT) during the first treatment cycle, and the recommended dose for expansion
      (RDE) of BI 907828 monotherapy, and to evaluate its safety and tolerability, by monitoring
      the occurrence and severity of adverse events (AEs), in two different schedules (Arm A with
      one single dose every 21 days, Arm B with one single dose on Days 1 and 8, every 28 days).

      The secondary objectives are the determination of the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of BI
      907828 monotherapy, and the preliminary assessment of anti-tumor activity in patients with
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      Phase Ib - In the expansion cohorts of the trial, the main objectives are to assess efficacy,
      and to further assess the safety, and PK profiles at the RDE, and determine the recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D).

          -  Availability and willingness to provide a fresh tumor tissue sample obtained after
             relapse or progression during or after prior therapy. In case a fresh biopsy cannot be
             obtained (e.g. inaccessible lesions or patient safety concern), an archived specimen,
             collected before screening, may be submitted.

             for women and men, after trial completion (i.e. after the last administration of trial
             medication). A list of contraception methods meeting these criteria is provided in the
             patient information.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             or at screening irrespective of MDM2 amplification status. For dose escalation part
             only, patients who have tumors with unknown TP53 and/or MDM2 status at the time of

             progression by imaging (using the identical imaging modality for each assessment,
             either MRI or computed tomography (CT) scan), for at least four weeks prior to the
             first dose of trial treatment, and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline;
             have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases. Patients on corticosteroids
             must have a stable dose for at least 5 days prior to baseline MRI.

          -  Current use of warfarin, factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors. Note:
             Low molecular weight heparin and prophylactic low dose warfarin are permitted; PT/PTT
             must meet the inclusion criteria; patients taking low dose warfarin must have their
             INR followed according to institutional guidelines.

             (e.g. hip replacement).

          -  Any other documented active or suspected malignancy or history of malignancy within 3
             years prior to screening, except appropriately treated basal cell carcinoma of the

             local treatment.

          -  Patients who must or wish to continue the intake of restricted medications or any drug
             considered likely to interfere with the safe conduct of the trial.

          -  Currently enrolled in another investigational device or drug trial, or less than 30
             days since receiving other investigational treatments. Patients who are in followup/
             observation for another clinical trial are eligible.

          -  Patients who have been treated with any other anticancer drug within 4 weeks or within
             5 half-life periods (whichever come earlier) prior to first administration of BI
             907828.

          -  Persistent toxicity from previous treatments that has not resolved to ≤ CTCAE Grade 1
             (except for alopecia and CTCAE Grade 2 neuropathy, or asthenia/fatigue).

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, acute or chronic viral hepatitis.
             Patients with a history of hepatitis B virus infection, irrespective of their

             mandatory and left at the discretion of investigator.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to the trial drug or its excipients.

          -  Serious concomitant disease or medical condition affecting compliance with trial
             requirements or which are considered relevant for the evaluation of the efficacy or
             safety of the trial drug, such as neurologic, psychiatric, infectious disease or
             active ulcers (gastro-intestinal tract, skin) or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with trial participation or trial drug administration,
             and in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for
             entry into the trial.

          -  Chronic alcohol or drug abuse or any condition that, in the Investigator's opinion,
             makes them an unreliable trial patient or unlikely to complete the trial.

             female patients who do not agree to the interruption of breast feeding from the start

               -  Any clinically important abnormalities (as assessed by the investigator) in
                  rhythm, conduction, or morphology of resting ECGs, e.g., complete left bundle
                  branch block, third degree heart block

               -  Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic
                  events such as heart failure, hypokalaemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family
                  history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years-of-age, or
                  any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval

               -  Ejection fraction &lt;50% or the lower limit of normal of the institutional
                  standard.
