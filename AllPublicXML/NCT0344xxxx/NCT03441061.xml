  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn how well low-dose inotuzumab ozogamicin
      may help to control acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). The safety of the study drug will also
      be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Inotuzumab ozogamicin is FDA approved and commercially
      available for the treatment of ALL.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 28 (+/- 7) days.

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will receive
      inotuzumab ozogamicin by vein over about 1 hour on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1 and Days 1
      and 8 of Cycles 2-6.

      Participant may be given standard drugs to help prevent side effects. If participant's doctor
      thinks it is needed, participant may also receive standard drugs by a spinal tap
      (intrathecally) to help lower the risk of the disease coming back in the fluid surrounding
      participant's brain. Participant's doctor will tell participant about these drugs, how they
      will be given, and the possible risks.

      Length of Treatment:

      Participant may receive the study drug for up to 6 cycles. However, if participant's doctor
      thinks it is in participant's best interest to receive a stem cell transplant from a donor,
      participant will only receive 2-3 cycles.

      Participant may be taken off study after Cycle 2 if the disease has had no response. However,
      if the treating doctor and study doctor decide it is in participant's best interest,
      participant may be able to receive up to 2 more cycles after that.

      If there is no sign of cancer for 3 months but then small numbers of cancer cells come back,
      participant may be eligible for retreatment again on the same schedule of study drug doses.
      The study doctor will discuss this with participant.

      Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow study directions.

      Participation on the study will be over after the Cycle 6 visit.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-6:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      At Weeks 2, 3, and 4 of Cycles 1-6, blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine
      tests.

      On Day 21 of Cycle 1 and then at the end of Cycles 2-6, participant will have a bone marrow
      biopsy and/or aspiration to check the status of the disease.
