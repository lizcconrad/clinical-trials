    <textblock>
      The proposed research will use a double-blind randomized controlled design to pilot test a
      model for how stories shared by a panel of HCT survivors impact the psychosocial well-being
      of the digital stories (DS) intervention condition of 55 patients who recently underwent HCT
      and their respective caregivers compared with 55 people in an information control (IC)
      condition and their caregivers (total 220 participants; N=110 per condition). Participants,
      recruited from the Mayo Clinic Arizona Cancer Center, will be randomly assigned to one of two
      conditions: the DS intervention or the IC video condition. Participants will questionnaires
      at baseline (T1), after the 4-week intervention (T2), and 3 months (100 days) later (T3).
