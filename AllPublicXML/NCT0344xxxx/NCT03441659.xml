  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is intended to include all patients who will undergo surgical reconstruction of the
      anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The patients will be monitored and evaluated preoperatively
      and also at 6 months and 1, 2 and 5 years after the intervention through a clinical visit or
      telephone interview. Such assessments will include the administration of questionnaires to
      determine the patient's functional symptoms and the objective examination of the knee during
      a medical examination to quantify its stability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The literature presents a number of studies on the reconstruction of the anterior cruciate
      ligament, as well as numerous registers, but the identification of factors and parameters
      determining the clinical outcomes remains largely debated. The study aims to offer new
      elements to analyze this treatment and potentially identify the factors responsible for the
      outcomes and the factors useful to optimize the clinical outcome in the future. In fact, in
      addition to collect patient data in terms of features and clinical-functional status,
      objective data will be documented and correlated. In particular the quantification of knee
      laxity will be performed using an innovative device based on the use of inertial sensors (a
      methodology recently developed and already validated at the Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli). The
      study is intended to include all patients who will undergo surgical reconstruction of the
      anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). These patients will be followed and evaluated
      preoperatively, at 6 months and at 1, 2 and 5 years after surgery during a clinical visit or
      a telephone interview. Such evaluations will include the submission of questionnaires to
      determine the patient's functional symptoms and also knee joint assessment during a medical
      examination to quantify the knee joint stability.

      Moreover, the following clinical scores will be adopted: IKDC-subjective, IKDC-objective,
      SF12, Marxs, Koos, Tegner, VAS for pain assessment, EQ-VAS for overall health status
      assessment. Also it will be recorded the lapse of time for returning to work and sports, the
      degree of patient satisfaction,the adverse events, the failures and any new treatments on the
      same site.
