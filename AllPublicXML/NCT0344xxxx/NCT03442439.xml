  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this current study is to investigate the efficacy of a group model of Family
      Nurture Intervention in ameliorating behavioral problems in preschool-aged children. The
      behavioral, neurobiological and clinical insights gained from this project may eventually
      lead to better treatment of emotional, behavioral, and developmental disorders. The
      investigator hypothesizes that the children who are treated with Family Nurture Intervention
      (FNI), which incorporates interactive touch with vocal soothing, and family practice in
      comforting, will show increased emotional connection and mother child co-regulation with
      better results in the outcome measures in the short term and long term.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are several early intervention programs that are available for children with emotional,
      behavioral and developmental disorders, ranging from behavioral treatment and sensory
      exposure therapy to pharmaceutical treatments. Although improvements in behavior have
      resulted from these interventions, they are limited in numerous ways. They are usually
      time-consuming, both for the child and the teacher or clinician providing the intervention.
      In order to see an effect of the intervention, most children must engage in the intervention
      procedure for several years. Moreover, the effects of most current intervention procedures
      are minimal to moderate. Pharmaceutical prescriptions are often accompanied by undesirable
      side effects that may modulate behavior, emotion, and physiological functions. The
      behavioral, neurobiological, and clinical insights gained from this project may eventually
      lead to better treatment of emotional, behavioral and developmental disorders.

    <description>Children will be asked to sit on their mother's lap for five minutes. This interaction will be video taped, and will be behaviorally coded using the Welch Emotional Connection Scale (WECS) and using a paradigm evaluated in Noldus coding software.
The Welch Emotional Connection Scale (WECS) construct is emotional connection between mother and child, which we hypothesize predicts optimal development. There are four items on the WECS: Mutual Attraction, Mutual Vocal Exchange, Mutual Facial Engagement, and Mutual Sensitivity/Reciprocity. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 to 3 in 0.25 increments with a score of 3 considered optimal. At or below 2.25 on any individual item, or a total score below 9 means that the mother-child pair is not emotionally connected. There is also a binary question to the rater asking if the pair is emotionally connected - yes or no. The mother and child are scored as a pair, not individually.</description>

    <description>The mother-child pair will be asked to talk and play with each other as they customarily do. If the child becomes restless and dysregulated the mother will be coached by the Nurture Specialist to bring the child back into a calm state though sustained physical contact; comfort touch, soothing words, and eye contact.</description>
