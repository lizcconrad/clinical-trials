  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to compare the efficacy of 2 analgesic strategies,
      based on percutaneous cryotherapy plus medical supportive care versus medical supportive care
      alone in the treatment of cancer patients with painful musculoskeletal metastasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a substantial body of evidences that support the rationale for percutaneous
      cryotherapy in the treatment of painful musculoskeletal metastasis. Since the available
      results are based exclusively on retrospective and single-arm prospective studies, all
      authors agree that preliminary data deserves further investigation to provide high level
      evidences.

      Current knowledge, along with the need for relieving patients' pain, already leads
      interventional radiologists to introduce analgesic cryotherapy in their routine practice. Our
      team usually notes a clinically significant pain relief that is immediate, continuous and
      prolonged in these patients. However, facing the lack of comparative studies, this technique
      is still proposed to patients with poor life-expectancy.

      Percutaneous cryotherapy is an innovative strategy in the treatment of patients with
      uncontrolled painful metastases. It could provide a significant and durable pain relief and a
      better quality of life, earlier in the patient's care pathway.

      The study group hypotheses that an early procedure of percutaneous cryotherapy is able to
      provide painful patients with better and prolonged analgesia and quality of life.

      A prospective controlled study is proposed with two analgesic strategies (percutaneous
      cryotherapy plus medical supportive care versus medical supportive care alone) in patients
      with a painful metastasis not controlled by conventional analgesia strategy.
