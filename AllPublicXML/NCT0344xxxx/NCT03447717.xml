    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of the implantable drop foot stimulator
      &quot;ActiGait&quot; (Ottobock Health Care, Duderstadt, Germany) on gait in hemiparetic patients. While
      several studies investigated the effects of implanted systems on walking speed and gait
      endurance, only a few studies have focused on the system's impact on kinematics and long-term
      outcomes. Therefore, our aim was to further investigate the effects of the implanted system
      ActiGait on gait kinematics and spatiotemporal parameters with a 1-year follow-up period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a neurologic condition leading to drop foot during swing phase in gait are
      treated by the implentation of the AcitGait system (which has a CE-certificate in Europe).

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the device on gait with a follow-up
      period of one year. Patients are assessed before implantation and at one-year follow up. At
      baseline, they are asked to walk without any assistive device, as well as with surface
      electrical stimulation of the peroneal nerve. At follow-up, they are asked to walk with the
      ActiGait system switched off and switched on.

      Outcome assessments include a 10m-walking test and gait analysis with a VICON 3D-camera
      system. This allows to extract spatio-temporal parameters (as steps per minute, step
      length,...) as well as kinematic data (e.g. joint ankles during the gait cycle). All outcome
      data is analyzed using statistical tests.
