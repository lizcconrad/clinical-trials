    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 multicenter, open label, non-randomized, interventional study enrolling 53
      patients.The objectives and purposes of the clinical study described herein are to determine
      if concomitant Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and ECT treatments are safe and able to improve local
      and systemic response rates.ECT will be performed with the CLINIPORATOR and a single IV dose
      of Bleomycin

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ECT induces immunogenic cell death of cancer cells with a more efficient antigen presentation
      of tumor-derived antigens by APCs to T-cells, particularly CD8+ antigen-specific T cells.
      Anti-PD-1 mAb reverts T-cell exhaustion induced by PD-1/PD-L1 and PD-L2 engagement on CD8+ T
      cells. Moreover, it may also be beneficial in the priming phase of the antitumor immune
      responses, inducing long-lived tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell effectors.

      The main hypothesis is to establish if concomitant treatment of Pembrolizumab and ECT is able
      to lead to a 20% increase of the ORR using as a reference the proportion of success available
      in the literature for Pembrolizumab.

      The investigators will perform a proteomic analysis of sera of treated patients, collected
      before and after treatments, with particular emphasis on cytokines and chemokines, to
      evaluate possible markers associated with a better clinical outcome.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a histologically confirmed advanced melanoma stages III b/c or IV, with at least
             the following superficial lesions: 5 lesions if diameter &lt; 1 cm or 3 lesions if
             diameter &gt; 1 cm.

          2. Could have received previous therapy included CT, antiCTLA4 or antiBRAF/antiMEK
             treatment or be treatment naïve.

          3. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.

          4. Be &gt;= 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          5. Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1.

          6. Be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a
             tumor lesion. Newly-obtained is defined as a specimen obtained up to 6 weeks (42 days)
             prior to initiation of treatment on Day 1. Subjects for whom newly-obtained samples
             cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject safety concern) may submit an
             archived specimen only upon agreement from the Sponsor.

          7. Have a performance status ≤ 2 on the ECOG Performance Scale. (Ambulatory and capable
             of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities. Up and about more than
             50% of waking hours.)

          8. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in

          9. Have a baseline total body CT scan (brain MRI if brain metastasis are suspected)

               1. Patients with brain metastasis are allowed to participate if previously treated
                  and brain lesion stability or inactivity is demonstrated. Patients with a history
                  of brain metastasis are required to have a pre-baseline brain MRI at least 60
                  days (2 months) before the Screening/Baseline visit (Visit 1) for comparison to
                  the Screening (Visit 1) MRI. Patients for whom MRI is contraindicated will
                  undergo head CT. Stable/inactive disease is determined by comparing the pre-
                  baseline and screening/baseline MRI/CT results.

               2. Patients presenting with brain metastasis at Screening/Baseline who had no known
                  previous brain involvement and who had no brain MRI/CT tests at least 60 days (2
                  months) before Screening/Baseline are considered screening failures and will be
                  excluded from study enrollment.

         10. Have cutaneous or subcutaneous metastases from melanoma that are accessible for the
             application of electric pulses using the single use, sterile CLINIPORATOR™ electrodes
             (5 lesions if diameter &lt;1 cm or 3 lesions if diameter &gt;1 cm). For patients presenting
             with more than 7 lesions, the lesions with the largest diameters that fall within the
             &lt;10 to 30 mm size requirements will be considered &quot;target&quot; lesions for RECIST criteria
             and study purposes. The others will be recorded and monitored but will not considered
             as Target.

         11. Have lesions clearly requiring palliative treatment [e.g., symptomatic (bleeding,
             draining, painful), disfiguring or causing distress to the patient].

         12. A treatment-free period of three (3) weeks before enrolling in the study. NOTE:
             Patients receiving concomitant treatments for unrelated existing pathologies are
             eligible for enrollment.

         13. Life expectancy &gt; 3 months.

         14. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
             will be required.

         15. Female subjects of childbearing potential (Section 5.7.2) must be willing to use an
             adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section 5.7.2 - Contraception, for the
             course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Note:
             Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception
             for the subject.

         16. Male subjects of childbearing potential (Section 5.7.1) must agree to use an adequate
             method of contraception as outlined in Section 5.7.1- Contraception, starting with the
             first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.
             Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred
             contraception for the subject.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study

          9. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 14 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not
             include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.

         10. Has epilepsy.

         11. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         15. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         16. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         17. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.
