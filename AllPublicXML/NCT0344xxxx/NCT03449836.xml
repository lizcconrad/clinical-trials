  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis is a pathology of the nasal and conjunctival mucosa induced by
      Immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated inflammation following allergic exposure. This condition
      represents a global health problem that affects 5 to 20% of the population. As with all
      allergic diseases, its prevalence in pediatric age has increased over the last 30 years, as
      shown by the results of the international epidemiological study International Study of Asthma
      and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) which shows that the overall prevalence is 8.5 % in
      children aged 6-7 and 14.6% in children aged 13-14. In Italy, on average, the prevalence
      stands at 17.6% in the 6-7 year age range and 31.3% in the 13-14 age range, demonstrating a
      growing trend. The allergic rhinoconjunctivitis undiagnosed and / or not treated properly can
      negatively affect the school activities and in general the quality of life of children and
      their parents, as well as having important socio-economic repercussions in terms of medical
      expenses, school absences and days of work lost by parents. Furthermore, the lack of
      therapeutic intervention can lead to an increased risk of complications in the medium and
      long term. Recent advances in the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the inflammation
      of the airways have led to an improvement of the therapeutic strategies for the management of
      allergic rhinoconjunctivitis: the four cornerstones of the approach to this pathology
      promoted by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) include allergen
      removal, patient education, pharmacotherapy and specific immunotherapy. However, there is
      discordant evidence to support their efficacy in reducing the symptomatology of allergic
      rhinoconjunctivitis, with the need to resort to the invasive surgical approach in several
      cases. Therefore, the use of probiotics, defined as &quot;live micro-organisms which, when
      administered in adequate quantities, confer an advantage for the organism&quot; can be useful. The
      mechanisms by which probiotics or their components, for example DNA, proteins and peptides,
      exert such beneficial effects concern the regulation of the immune system, the antagonist
      action against potentially pathogenic microorganisms and the quantitative and qualitative
      modulation of the intestinal microbiota. In fact, recent clinical studies have demonstrated
      the protective effect of infections of the high respiratory tract in adults and recurrent
      average otitis in pediatric age of the Streptococcus salivarius 24SMBc and Streptococcus
      oralis 89a strains administered through nasal spray. These well-characterized probiotics were
      safe, tolerated and able to positively modulate the composition of the respiratory epithelial
      microbiota and the function of the immune system.

    <description>Symptoms evaluation was made by the Total 5 Symptoms Score (T5SS), which includes the symptoms of nasal discharge (rhinorrhea), nasal congestion, itchy nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes. All symptoms were graded from 0 (absent) to 3 (very troublesome),with total scores ranging from 0-15.</description>

    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a 1-month time interval. Consisting of 19 items, the PSQI measures several different aspects of sleep, offering seven component scores and one composite score. The component scores consist of subjective sleep quality, sleep latency (i.e., how long it takes to fall asleep), sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency (i.e., the percentage of time in bed that one is asleep), sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction.
Each item is weighted on a 0-3 interval scale. The global PSQI score is then calculated by totaling the 7 component scores, providing an overall score ranging from 0 to 21, where lower scores denote a healthier sleep quality.Traditionally, the items from the PSQI have been summed to create a total score to measure overall sleep quality.</description>
