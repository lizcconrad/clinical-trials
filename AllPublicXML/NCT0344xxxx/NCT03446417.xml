  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter, sequential dose-escalation study to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of ZN-e4 administered orally
      in subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR) mutations who have progressed following treatment with an EGFR
      inhibitor.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or advanced inoperable diagnosis
             of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

          -  Radiographic documentation of disease progression while on previous continuous
             treatment with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor
             (TKI)

          -  All subjects must fulfill one of the following:

               1. Confirmation that the tumor harbors an EGFR mutation known to be associated with
                  EGFR TKI sensitivity OR

               2. Must have experienced clinical benefit from EGFR TKI, according to the Jackman
                  criteria followed by systemic objective progression while on continuous treatment
                  with EGFR TKI

          -  Dose Expansion cohort(s): subjects in the dose expansion cohorts must also have
             confirmation of tumor T790M mutation status (confirmed positive) by cobas® EGFR
             Mutation Test v2 from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue (FFPET) or
             circulating-free tumor DNA (cfDNA) plasma sample taken after disease progression on
             the most recent treatment regimen (EGFR TKI or chemotherapy or other therapy).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with an EGFR TKI within 10 days or 5 half-lives of the first dose of study
             treatment, whichever is longer

          -  Dose Expansion cohorts: Prior treatment with osimertinib (Tagrisso®). Prior treatment
             with osimertinib (Tagrisso®) is allowed for subjects participating in the dose
             escalation portion of the study

          -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational agents, or any anticancer therapy for the
             treatment of advanced NSCLC (other than EGFR TKI) within 21 days of the first dose of
             study treatment

          -  Prior treatment with immunotherapy (e.g. ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab,
             atezolizumab) within 6 months of cycle 1 day 1

          -  Known intermediate or strong CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 inhibitors or inducers within 14 days
             prior to first dose of study treatment
