      Purpose: To determine the efficacy of 1400 mg gamma tocopherol-enriched supplement for
      mitigating inhaled wood smoke particle-induced airway inflammation in healthy adults
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Particulate matter (PM) is a leading cause of respiratory tract and cardiovascular disease in
      the United States and world-wide. Wood smoke particles (WSP) derived from wildland and other
      fires account for a significant fraction of ambient air PM. Health effects associated with
      WSP include acute bronchitis, asthma exacerbation, pneumonia, cough and systemic
      inflammation. While these effects are seen in both healthy and asthmatic individuals, many
      studies indicate that asthmatics have increased susceptibility to the effects of WSP. The
      investigators have developed a 500 μg/m3 WSP exposure protocol (levels similar to those
      encountered by firefighters and residents in close proximity to wildland burn sites) that
      induces airway and systemic inflammation in healthy volunteers. As with other pollutants,
      these inflammatory responses modulate non-specific bronchial reactivity (NSBR), inflammatory
      cell recruitment to the airways (primarily neutrophils), and potentially cardiovascular
      function.

      The investigators have focused on gamma tocopherol as a nutritional intervention to prevent
      inflammatory responses to air pollutants such as WSP. Building on animal and in vitro
      preclinical studies, the investigators have established that 1400 mg/day of oral γT-enriched
      supplement for 7 and 14 days in healthy volunteers and mild asthmatics, respectively,
      inhibited neutrophil influx into the airways, reduced production of sputum mucins, and
      improved mucociliary clearance following challenge with inhaled endotoxin, another common
      component of PM. The findings occurred in the context of significantly increased plasma
      concentrations of γT and its active metabolite
      2,7,8-trimethyl-2-(β-Carboxy-Ethyl)-6-Hydroxychroman (γ-CEHC). Given the findings in these
      early phase clinical trials, γT supplementation is an attractive approach to prevent
      WSP-induced adverse health effects. The investigators propose to use γT supplementation in a
      human model of WSP inhalation to mitigate key features of airway inflammation: inflammatory
      cell recruitment, production of inflammatory cytokines and mucous, and changes in airway
      physiology.

      Gamma tocopherol will be administered in softgel form, with each softgel containing 700 mg of
      tocopherols, 89.5% of which is d-gamma tocopherol. Subjects will consume two softgels by
      mouth every 12 hours for a total of four doses, with the last dose being taken the morning of
      WSP exposure. This dosing regimen was chosen based on the results of two phase I studies
      conducted by the investigators. The first was a dosing study of γT in which healthy adult
      volunteers consumed 1 or 2 gel capsules once daily of a γT-enriched mixed tocopherol
      supplement containing 830 mg of tocopherols per capsule for eight days. Plasma γT
      concentrations significantly increased in both groups, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMCs) isolated from the 2 gel capsules/day group demonstrated reduced inflammatory cytokine
      production in response to ex vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge and reduced generation
      of reactive oxygen species. This regimen was carried forward to a randomized, placebo
      controlled crossover trial of γT supplementation in healthy volunteers undergoing inhaled LPS
      challenge in vivo. The regimen of 2 gel capsules of γT-enriched mixed tocopherol supplement
      daily for one week was associated with reduction in LPS-induced sputum neutrophilia. The
      second phase I study of γT involved use of an abbreviated dosing protocol and a more enriched
      γT supplement (approximately 90% γT), with healthy adults consuming 1400 mg every 12 hours
      for three doses. This regimen demonstrated a significant increase in plasma γT and γ-CEHC
      concentrations at 24 and 30 hours, similar to those seen with the one week dosing regimen.
      Additionally, PBMCs challenged with LPS ex vivo demonstrated reduced production of
      inflammatory cytokines interleukin - 1beta (IL-1b) and IL-6. These findings suggested that
      this shorter course of γT supplementation results in significantly increased plasma
      concentrations of γT and its active metabolite γ-CEHC and has potential to reduce the
      inflammatory response to LPS.
