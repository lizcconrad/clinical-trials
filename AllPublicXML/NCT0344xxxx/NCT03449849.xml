  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine how daily consumption of kale changes the
      activity of human xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes. Secondary objectives are to measure
      absorption and metabolism of kale phytonutrients, and to determine how kale consumption
      affects gene expression related to metabolism and lipid measures associated with
      cardiovascular health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consumption of Brassica vegetables (which include broccoli, cabbage, and kale) is inversely
      associated with the incidence of several cancers, including cancers of the lung, stomach,
      liver, colon, rectum, breast, endometrium, and ovaries. Brassica vegetables are a good source
      of many nutrients, but the unique characteristic of Brassicas is their rich content of
      glucosinolates. Glucosinolates are sulfur-containing compounds that are converted to
      bioactive metabolites by a plant enzyme called myrosinase, which is released when the
      vesicles containing myrosinase are ruptured by chewing or cutting. These bioactive compounds
      are considered to be the active agent for cancer prevention. Their ability to reduce risk of
      cancer may derive in part from their ability to modulate foreign-substance metabolizing
      enzymes, which include enzymes called Phase I cytochrome P450s and Phase II enzymes.

      The primary aim of this study is to investigate how daily consumption of kale influences
      foreign-substance metabolizing enzymes, which in turn may reduce cancer risk. Secondary aims
      of this study include measuring metabolism of kale nutrients, effect of kale consumption on
      fecal microbiota, and how kale consumption influences risk factors for cardiovascular
      disease.
