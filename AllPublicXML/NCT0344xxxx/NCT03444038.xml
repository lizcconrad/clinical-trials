    <measure>Severity of tic symptoms assessed by Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS)</measure>

    <description>The YGTSS is designed to rate the overall severity of motor and phonic tic symptoms across a range of dimensions: number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference. The scale also includes an impairment assessment. The YGTSS total tic score (TTS) will be the primary measure for this study and represents the sum of the 5 subcategories (number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference) for both motor and phonic tics, each scored from 0 to 5, with higher values representing a worsening assessment.</description>

          4. Be in good general health

          5. Adolescent subjects (12 to 18 years of age) must have a negative urine drug screen for

          3. Have a known history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome

          4. Have a cancer diagnosis within 3 years prior to screening (some exceptions allowed)

          5. Have an allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to vesicular monoamine transporter 2
             (VMAT2) inhibitors

          6. Have a blood loss â‰¥250 mL or donated blood within 56 days prior to screening

          7. Have a known history of substance (drug) dependence, or substance or alcohol abuse

          8. Have a significant risk of suicidal or violent behavior

          9. Have received an investigational drug within 30 days before screening or plan to use
