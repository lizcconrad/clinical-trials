    <textblock>
      Sleep-disordered breathing at night is a common medical problem. It leads to daytime fatigue,
      impairment in concentration and daily activities, and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease
      and life-threatening events. A particularly common form is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and
      it is usually treatable with a high rate of patient satisfaction and improved quality of life
      using a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device.

      Treatment of this condition improves nighttime low-oxygen levels by ensuring patency of the
      upper airways. Research shows that in cancer, sleep disordered breathing is frequent. Low
      oxygen levels overnight may cause tumors to grow: tumors deprived of oxygen grow more blood
      vessels to try to get more oxygen, and growing more blood vessels makes the tumor grow. This
      study aims to examine how treating sleep-disordered breathing may lessen blood-flow to lung
      tumors, and thus serve to ultimately block tumor growth.

      Participants of this study will undergo sleep study and receive CPAP therapy as a part of
      routine care.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of lung cancer in one of 2 sub-types:

               1. newly diagnosed early-stage tumor

               2. advanced-stage lung tumor undergoing serial contrast-CT imaging according to
                  standard of care

          -  Diagnosis of a metastatic carcinomatous mass in the lung

          -  Positive study for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) with intermittent hypoxia (IH) and
             clinical recommendation for CPAP

          -  Ability and willingness to undergo baseline and repeat perfusion-CT imaging following
             3- to 4 weeks of CPAP therapy for SDB (regardless of CPAP compliance).

        Note: Participants will undergo sleep study and receive CPAP therapy as a part of routine
        care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Lung cancer with a negative sleep study (i.e., no SDB)

          -  History of radio-contrast allergy

          -  At excessive risk for contrast nephropathy (following standard radiology renal-risk
             criteria)

          -  Pregnancy
