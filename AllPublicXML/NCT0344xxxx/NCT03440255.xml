    <textblock>
      This non-randomized, open-label study has the objective to study the effects and feasibility
      of Transauricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (TaVNS) for patients suffering from Generalized
      Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Chronic Pain (CP) and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) in a private
      healthcare centre.

    <textblock>
      The effects of TaVNS on GAD, CP and IBS. Participants were investigated during a 4-week
      period and a 2-month follow-up. Groups (GAD, CP, IBS) were assessed using questionnaires:
      Anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder GAD-7); CP (Brief Pain Inventory Short Form
      Questionnaire) and IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome Severity Scoring System). TaVNS was
      performed using a standard transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device and ear
      clip electrodes plugged into the concha area of the left ear. All participants received a
      bi-weekly 30 minutes stimulation (8 sessions). We defined three different TaVNS parameters
      for each group in hertz (Hz) and microsecond (µs), (GAD: 20Hz-80µs), (CP: 5Hz-200 µs), (IBS:
      3Hz-250µs).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline generalized anxiety disorder severity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4-week and 2-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the response effect of the TaVNS on the severity of anxiety disorders measured by the 21 items self-administered Generalized Anxiety Disorder GAD-7 questionnaire, where scoring scores of 5, 10 and 15 represent cut-off points for mild, moderate and severe anxiety. A response will be considered as a reduced cut-off point from baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline pain severity and pain interference</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4-week and 2-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the response effect of the TaVNS on the severity of pain and the impact of this pain on daily functioning (Interference) measured by the 9 items self-administered Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form) questionnaire; from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain), ratings from 1 to 4 corresponded to mild pain, 5 to 6 to moderate pain, and 7 to 10 to severe pain with cut-off points being 4 and 6. Scoring pain severity is the mean of the total pain score out of 10. Interference from 0 (no interference) to 10 (completely interferes), rating mild (&lt;=5), moderate (6-7), and severe (&gt;= 8) with cut-off points being 5 and 7. Scoring the interference severity is the mean of the total Interference score out of 10. A response will be considered as a reduced cut-off point from baseline.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline irritable bowels syndrome severity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4-week and 2-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the response effect of the TaVNS on the severity of irritable bowel syndrome measured by the self-administered Irritable Bowel Syndrome Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS), where the maximum achievable score is 500. Mild, moderate and severe categories were indicated by scores of 75 to 175, 175 to 300 and &gt; 300 respectively, with cut-off points being 175 and 300. A response will be considered as a reduced cut-off point from baseline.</description>

    <description>TaVNS will be applied by the TENS 7000 device. The stimulation was set according the group of treatment: (GAD: 20Hz-80µs), (CP: 5Hz-200 µs), (IBS: 3Hz-250µs).
The current intensity was individually established under the pain threshold .The stimulus generates an continous asymmetric biphasic waveform. Ear clip electrodes were plugged in the concha area of the left ear. The stimulation will last 30 min per session (total=8)</description>
