  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fronto lobe dementia constitutes 10-20 % of dementia conditions within younger persons (&gt;65).
      People with neuronal degeneration in frontal and temporal lobes demonstrate a decline in
      social conduct, apathy, loss of insight that is gradual and progressive. Family members often
      experience guilt and shame because of the patients' behavior before institutionalization, and
      different behavioral disorders will cause great challenges to family caregivers and to staff
      after institutionalization. Preservation of dignity, both in regards to the person being
      affected, and their relatives, therefore seem highly relevant both before and after
      institutionalization.

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a combined intervention of physical
      activity and music therapy could reduce restlessness, irritability, and aggression among
      institutionalized people with severe dementia. An exploratory design was used to evaluate a
      combined intervention of physical activity, music therapy, and in- or outdoors walking daily,
      systematically implemented for eight weeks for persons with severe dementia in institutional
      care.
