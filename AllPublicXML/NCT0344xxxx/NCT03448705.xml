  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safe usability of the study drugs, i.e.
      4Fluart ID 1 µg haemagglutinin (HA)/0.1 ml QIV and 4Fluart ID 2 µg haemagglutinin (HA)/0.1 ml
      QIV in terms of safety concerns emerged.

      The secondary objective of the study is to further assess safety in terms of safety
      parameters, as well as to assess the immunogenicity of 4Fluart ID 1 µg haemagglutinin
      (HA)/0.1 ml QIV and 4Fluart ID 2 µg haemagglutinin (HA)/0.1 ml QIV in terms of immunogenicity
      parameters.

      Healthy volunteers (male and female) aged 18-59 years will be enrolled into the study by
      signing subject information leaflet and informed consent form. After screening them, subjects
      complying with inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included in the study, randomised and
      vaccinated with one of the investigational medicinal products assigned by the randomisation
      list.

      Subjects will be observed for thirty (30) minutes after vaccination for any immediate
      reactions. All adverse events (AEs) will be collected from the enrolment to Day 21-28. Safety
      data between Day 0 and Day 7-9 will be documented on a Diary card by each subject. Safety
      assessment will be performed based on Day 7-9 and Day 21-28 safety data compared to the
      baseline on Day 0.

      Blood samples for immunogenicity assays will be collected immediately before vaccination on
      Day 0 (pre-vaccination blood samples) and on Day 21-28 (post-vaccination blood samples) in
      all subjects included in the study and complying with the study procedures. Immunogenicity
      will be evaluated by hemagglutinin inhibition test in order to assess immune response 3-4
      weeks after vaccination.

      The assessment of safety and immunogenicity of 4Fluart ID 1 µg/0.1 ml QIV and 4Fluart ID 2
      µg/0.1 ml QIV will be performed in comparison to the authorised 3Fluart, i.e. 3Fluart
      intramuscular (IM) 6 µg/0.5 ml TIV.
