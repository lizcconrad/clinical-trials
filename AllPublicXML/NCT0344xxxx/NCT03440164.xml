  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-four healthy volunteers of both genders, aged 18 to 44 years old and body mass indexes
      between 18 to 27 kg/m2,were selected to participate in a two-way, balanced, prospective,
      blind, single-dose crossover study with a one-week wash-out period. It was assessed that
      volunteers were free from significant cardiac, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, neurological,
      gastrointestinal and hematological diseases. The volunteers clinical evaluation were
      determined by clinical examination, ECG, and the following laboratory tests: blood glucose,
      urea, creatinine, AST, ALT, GGT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin and fractions, uric
      acid, total cholesterol, triglycerides, albumin and total protein, and routine urinalysis.
      All subjects were negative for HIV, HBV, and HCV.
