  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research project is to find out whether a personalized definition of the
      lower blood pressure threshold based on the individual blood pressure profile by means of
      preoperative 24-hour blood pressure measurement can reduce organ damage (brain, kidney,
      heart) through reduced blood flow during surgery.

To achieve the blood pressure target, fluid or vasoactive substances will be used.</description>
