      The study purpose is to establish the safety and tolerability of IMA202 product in patients
      with certain solid tumors.

      SCREENING: Patient eligibility will be determined by HLA (human leukocyte antigen) screening
      and the Main biomarkers screening. If the patient is eligible, white blood cells will be
      taken during leukapheresis for the manufacture of the IMA202 product.

      MANUFACTURING: IMA202 product will be made from the patient's white blood cells.

      TREATMENT: Lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine will occur in the days
      before the IMA202 product infusion to improve the duration of time that IMA202 product stays
      in the body. The patient will be admitted to the hospital during the treatment.

      After the IMA202 product infusion, a low dose of IL-2 will be given twice daily for a period
      of time.

      Since this study involves gene therapy, patients will be monitored throughout the study and
      for up to a total of 15 years.
