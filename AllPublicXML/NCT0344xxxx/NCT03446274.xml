    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, non-randomized, single dose study in a single cohort of
      6 healthy male subjects, including up to 2 cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 poor metabolizer
      subjects. Each subject will receive a single oral administration of 14C-NW-3509 capsule in
      the fasted state.The screening period and study admission to completion is estimated to be up
      to 43 days. The following data will be analyzed urine and feces data for total radioactivity,
      plasma and whole blood data for total radioactivity and plasma concentration data for
      NW-3509.

         19. Subjects who are taking, or have taken, any prescribed or over-the-counter drug (other
             than 4 g per day paracetamol) or herbal remedies in the 14 days before IMP
