      To determine the safety profile, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLT)
      and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in patients who receive FF-10832 (Gemcitabine Liposome
      Injection) for treatment of advanced solid tumors.

      Dose-escalation Phase Eligible patients will receive FF-10832. In the first cohort, FF-10832
      1.2 mg/mPP2PP will be administered intravenously (IV) on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle,
      until progression of disease, observation of unacceptable adverse events, intercurrent
      illness, or changes in the patient's condition that prevents further study participation
      after discussion between the Investigator and the Medical Monitor. A number of cohorts will
      be enrolled sufficient to determine the MTD and to identify the RP2D.
