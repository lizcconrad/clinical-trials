      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a wristband that detects your pulse can
      detect your heart rate and rhythm similar to electrocardiograms (ECG). These wristbands
      detect your pulse based on a technique called &quot;photoplethysmography,&quot; (PPG). PPG is a common
      method in which an individual's pulse is detected based on a light signature interpreted by
      the wristband. Most commercially available heart rate monitors use PPG to determine your
      heart rate, but the accuracy is variable.

    <description>Subjects will be asked to wear a wrist band with capabilities to detect their heart rate or rhythm on the basis of PPG on either wrist around the time of their cardioversion procedure. Data will be acquired from the wrist band at the same time as the electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor to which subjects are hooked up for the purposes of the cardioversion.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be sent home after the cardioversion with a 30 day heart monitor called the BodyGuardian. This device continuously monitors their heart rate and rhythm and they will wear this on the chest. Subjects will also wear the wrist monitor over the same 30 day period.</description>
