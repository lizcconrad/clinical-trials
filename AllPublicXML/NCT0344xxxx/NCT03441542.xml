  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to implement and evaluate a data-driven case navigation system for hepatitis
      C virus (HCV) treatment among persons who are either actively injecting drugs or who are
      receiving opioid substitution therapy (OST). The study will use data from a previously
      developed patient registry system to identify patients for study recruitment, and use monthly
      updates of registry data to organize and direct patient navigation services for those
      individuals assigned to the treatment group. Patients assigned to the control group will also
      be eligible to receive HCV treatment, but will otherwise receive usual care.

      This study has a parallel, randomized unblinded, case/control design in which eligible
      patients are assigned at baseline to either a registry-directed patient navigation system
      (case) or to usual care (control), characterized in terms of demographic and sub-population
      variables, and then compared after 12 months on two categories of outcomes; (1) attainment of
      care cascade milestones; and (2) treatment initiation, adherence, and virologic response. The
      study is designed and powered to answer two primary hypotheses (H1 &amp; H2):

        -  H1: As compared to those randomized to usual care (control), those randomized to the
           registry directed patient navigation arm (case) will be more likely to complete all
           pretreatment HCV care milestones as defined by a higher proportion completing all four
           pre-treatment care cascade outcomes.

        -  H2: As compared to the control group, a significantly higher proportion of those
           randomized to the case group will achieve a sustained viral response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EZ-C's purpose is to determine the effectiveness of patient navigation services during
      treatment of hepatitis C compared to usual care among opioid substitution therapy (OST) and
      active injecting drug use (IDU) individuals.

      To recruit OST and active IDU patients, customized queries will be created to identify
      pharmaceutical (methadone, buprenorphine, buprenorphine/naltrexone, naloxone) and diagnostic
      (ICD-10 codes for heroin poisoning, history of heroin abuse, long term current use of opiate
      analgesic, opioid dependence, and potentially others) indicators of OST or active injecting
      drug use. These codes will be implemented into the Grady HCV registry to flag and identify
      OST or possible active injecting drug use individuals that are HCV positive at Grady Health
      Systems.

      Recruitment will consist of an initial letter describing the study and informing patients of
      their possible eligibility as well as informed consent documentation. This letter will be
      followed by up to three phone calls per patient from the patient navigator until a full
      sample of OST and active injecting drug users have been recruited. Once enrolled, patients
      will be randomly assigned into either the control or intervention group. Although there is no
      compensation for participating in the study, all patients that are recruited will receive
      treatment at no cost.

      Once the study begins enrolling, the researchers will create spreadsheet reports of patients
      in the intervention group (those who are receiving patient navigation services) containing
      their HCV care information, such as antibody results, viral load test results and
      prescription refill information. Based on this spreadsheet, the researchers will develop a
      monthly task list for the patient navigator with patient by patient care cascade and
      treatment milestones that need to be accomplished per patient in the intervention group. The
      researchers will then deliver the spreadsheet and the task list to the Grady Liver Clinic
      Director who will use it to direct and supervise the activities of the patient navigator. The
      patient navigator will actively engage with those in the intervention group throughout the
      study and send reminders of their next steps in the treatment process/care cascade. The
      patient navigator will not engage with those in the control group as they will receive only
      usual care.

      The intervention will last 12 months for each patient in both the case and control groups.
      After collecting data for the 80 patients at the end of the study, the researchers will
      analyze the data to determine the effectiveness of patient navigation services compared to
      those receiving usual care among IDU and OST individuals.

    <description>Patients are recruited and consented into the study by the patient navigator after which the navigator provides assistance with scheduling, reminders, and transportation. The navigator is also charged with responding to patient questions, and monitoring and documenting if and when patients achieve HCV care milestones. Each month, the project will update the Grady Liver Clinic HCV patient registry, to generate information about the patient's HCV care progress and use this information to develop instructions sheets regarding the expected care milestones to be achieved that month for each patient. During the month, the navigator will participate in project meetings and report on milestone achievement and barriers for patients assigned to the experimental arm of the study.</description>

    <description>Patients are recruited and consented into the study by the patient navigator at which time they will be reminded of their infection, consequences of untreated disease, and the availability of study sponsored antiviral treatment should they seek it. Patients will not be subsequently contacted by the study. Patients who seek treatment without patient navigation services will receive the same study provided HCV pre-treatment care and study provided treatment drugs when indicated. Self-referral to care and antiviral therapy when indicated are known to be effective in curing HCV among some patients, this arm is classified as an active comparator.</description>
