  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An observational prospective will be conducted to determine the detection rate of serrated
      adenoma during screening colonoscopy at our institution. Additionally, the variability of
      serrated adenoma detection among endoscopists will be evaluated and the characteristics of
      serrated adenomas will be described.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy screening is a preventative measure for colorectal carcinoma (CRC), a highly
      malignant and dangerous cancer. Extensive research on the adenoma detection rate has provided
      national standards and quality metrics to help assess competence of endoscopists. Currently,
      there are no standards established for serrated adenomas. The proposed study would be
      conducted at GSH and TriHealth Surgery Center West. This is an observational study and does
      not involve any patient interventions. However, because patient healthcare data will be
      collected for research, informed consent will be obtained shortly before the procedure. The
      main study objective is to determine the detection rate of serrated adenoma during screening
      colonoscopy at our institution. Additionally, the variability of serrated adenoma detection
      among endoscopists will be evaluated and the characteristics of serrated adenomas will be
      described.
