      P- Patient with deeply impacted mandibular molar I- Computer guided surgical cutting stent C-
      Conventional extraction O- Clinical outcome sound radiographic outcomes primary outcome

      - pain : each patient well be asked to rate current and worst pain intensity on visual
      analogue scale (VAS ) of 0-10 with Zero being no pain and Ten corresponds to the worst pain.

      Secondary outcome

        -  evaluation of maximum inter incisal opening: assessment of MMO will be performed by
           measuring the distance in mm between the incisal edges of the upper and lower central
           incisor by using tape graduated method.

        -  evaluation of edema throw use nylon thread.
