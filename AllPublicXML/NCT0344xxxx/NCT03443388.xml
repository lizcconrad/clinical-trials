  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study that aims to determine the reliability and safety of the use of the
      Hövding inflatable helmet in seizures, as evidenced by the deployment of the helmet during
      seizures, and qualitative patient reporting.

      Part 1: 4 healthy volunteers will fall from a standing position onto a padded surface to
      evaluate for consistent helmet deployment from a standing position. Part 2: up to 40 patients
      with drug resistant epilepsy who do not use existing head-protective devices will be enrolled
      and assigned to &quot;helmet&quot; or &quot;no helmet&quot; groups. Patients will be assigned to wear the helmet
      until deployment during a seizure, up to 6 months. Subjects will complete questionnaires
      about their seizures including any injuries sustained, post concussive symptom questionnaire,
      and the circumstances of inflation. Patients will return to site after helmet deployment. We
      will compare circumstances, injuries, and post concussive scales in seizures where the helmet
      deploys to seizures, if present where the helmet did not deploy.

    <intervention_model_description>This is an open-label, non-randomized pilot safety study of the Hövding helmet device in patients with drug resistant epilepsy. Reference therapy is no head-protective device. Part 1 will test helmets on 4 normal controls falling from standing. If the helmet deploys in at least 3 out of 4 falls, we will proceed to Part 2. Part 2 will enroll up to 40 patients with Drug Resistant Epilepsy. 20 helmets will be disturbed to those with the highest seizure frequencies. These subjects will be asked to wear the helmet in their daily life for up to 6 months. The remaining participants will receive no interventions. Using daily seizure calendar, medical records review, the Rivermead Post Concussive Scale and other qualitative questionnaires (self-administered) we will compare circumstances, injuries, and post concussive scales in seizures where the helmet deploys to seizures where the helmet did not deploy.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>After a screening period, 20 subjects with drug resistant epilepsy will be assigned to wear one Hövding inflatable helmet in their daily lives. Subjects will fill out questionnaires about their seizures, injuries, and the circumstances of inflation when it occurs. Participation may last for up to 6 months.</description>

    <description>The Hövding inflatable helmet is designed for cyclists as a collar with a deployable airbag that inflates when a sensor detects rapid changes in acceleration. The inflated helmet wraps the back and sides of the user's head in inflated nylon fabric which then slowly deflates after deploying.</description>
