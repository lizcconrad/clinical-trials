    <measure>The percentage of patients with remission according to Nugent score &lt; 7</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days after the end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Nugent score is determined by a microscopic assessment of a Gram stain of vaginal fluid，calculated by assessing for the presence of large Gram-positive rods (Lactobacillus morphotypes; decrease in Lactobacillus scored as 0 to 4), small Gram-variable rods (Gardnerella vaginalis morphotypes; scored as 0 to 4), and curved Gram-variable rods (Mobiluncus spp. morphotypes; scored as 0 to 2) . Nugent score is is the addition of these three sub scales,and can range from 0 to 10.</description>
