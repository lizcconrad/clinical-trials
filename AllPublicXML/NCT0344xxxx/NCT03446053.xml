    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of N-Rephasin®
      SAL200 following single and multiple ascending doses in healthy male volunteers after
      continuous intravenous infusion over 60 minutes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Forty subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either N-Rephasin® SAL200 injection
           or a placebo administered by a 60-min intravenous infusion. Within each group, 8
           subjects (6 active and 2 placebo) will receive a single dose of 6 mg/kg, followed by
           multiple ascending dose of 3, 6, 9, and 12 mg/kg/day. The clinical trial will be
           performed in sequence from the lowest level, and the progress of the next dose level
           will be determined based on the safety results in the previous dose level.

        -  Examinations by interview, physical examinations, and screening tests such as clinical
           laboratory tests and allergenicity will be conducted in volunteers within 4 weeks
           (-28~-2d) from the previous day ot this clinical trial (-1d) to select subjects who are
           judged eligible for the study.

        -  Eligible subjects will be called in the afternoon (-1d) to examine the allergenicity in
           the clinical center of Seoul National Unviersity Hospital.

        -  Allergen-free subjects will be hospitalized on -1d and assigned with each subject
           number. All subjects are advised to fast from 10:00 p.m. overnight to the next morning,
           except drinking water. In the morning (09:00 a.m.) on 1d, subjects in each group will be
           given N-Rephasin® SAL200 injection or a placebo administered by a 60-min intravenous
           infusion, After that, the clinical trial will be conducted according to the designated
           schedule.

        -  All subjects receiving at least one dose will undergo a post-study visit test after a
           certain period of time. Immunogenicity testing will be performed until approximately 50
           days after treatment.
