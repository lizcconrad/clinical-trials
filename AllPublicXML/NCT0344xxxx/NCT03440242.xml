      This is a non-masked, non-randomized, stratified, 4-arm parallel group, non-interventional
      study where subjects will be enrolled into one of four arms based on their habitual contact
      lenses. Subjects will be wearing their habitual contact lenses throughout the study and will
      be scheduled for morning and afternoon visits totaling 10 visits with a ~4-week washout
      period between visits 6 and 7.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential subjects must satisfy all of the following criteria to be enrolled in the
             study:

               1. The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
                  receive a fully executed copy of the form.

               2. Appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this clinical
                  protocol.

               3. Appear able and willing to adhere to a no lens wear period of at least one month.

               4. Between 18 and 45 (inclusive) years of age at the time of screening.

               5. Subject must be currently wearing one of the two habitual contact lenses in both
                  eyes (1DAM or DACP) for at least three months. Habitual CL wear is defined as
                  having a minimum wearing time of 3 hours per day, minimum of 3 days per week for
                  at least 3 months.

               6. Subject must have visual acuity of at least 20/40 or better in each eye with
                  their habitual lenses

               7. Subjects must meet one of the following criteria in order to be classified as
                  either asymptomatic or symptomatic group:

                    1. Asymptomatic group: CLDEQ-8 score of ≤7, difference between CWT and AWT &lt;1
                       hours/day

                    2. Symptomatic group: CLDEQ-8 score of ≥15, difference between CWT and AWT &gt;3
                       hours/day

               8. Have healthy eyes with no evidence of abnormality or disease (i.e., no active
                  ocular pathological conditions/ infections of any type).

               9. Have a pair of spectacles that provide corrected binocular visual acuity of 20/40
                  or better. If no spectacles, subjects must have un-aided binocular visual acuity
                  of 20/40 or better.

                  Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from
             participating in the study:

               1. Currently pregnant or lactating

               2. Any systemic disease (e.g., Sjögren's Syndrome), allergies, infectious disease
                  (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis), contagious immunosuppressive diseases (e.g.,
                  HIV), autoimmune disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis), or other diseases, by
                  self-report, which are known to interfere with contact lens wear and/or
                  participation in the study.

               3. Unacceptable lens fit with their habitual lenses in either eye based on study
                  investigators judgment.

               4. Any extended wear modality.

               5. Use of systemic medications (e.g., chronic steroid use, immuno-suppressants or
                  anti-infective medications) that are known to interfere with contact lens wear.

               6. Any ocular allergies, infections or other ocular abnormalities that are known to
                  interfere with contact lens wear and/or participation in the study. This may
                  include, but not be limited to entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia,
                  recurrent styes, glaucoma, history of recurrent corneal erosions, aphakia, or
                  corneal distortion.

               7. Any previous, or planned (during the course of the study) intraocular/refractive
                  surgery.

               8. Any Grade 3 or 4 slit lamp findings (e.g., edema, corneal neovascularization,
                  corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, and conjunctival injection) on the FDA
                  scale.

               9. Any previous history or signs of a contact lens-related corneal inflammatory
                  event (e.g., past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any other ocular
                  abnormality that would contraindicate contact lens wear.

              10. Participation in any interventional contact lens, eye drop or lens care product
                  clinical trial within 30 days prior to study enrollment.

              11. Suspicion of or recent history of alcohol or substance abuse, serious mental
                  illness, or seizures.
