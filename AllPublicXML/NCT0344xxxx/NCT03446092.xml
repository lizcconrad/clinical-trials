  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate whether a mindfulness course can help people with incurable cancer
      who are seen by oncologists in a particular National Health Service Hospital Trust in the
      United Kingdom.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It can be hard to come to terms with living with a life limiting condition such as incurable
      cancer and individuals are at risk of experiencing high levels of psychological distress,
      which can often be overlooked when the focus is on managing physical symptoms.

      Mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to be helpful in reducing distress for people
      with cancer generally. This pilot study will use an established mindfulness programme called
      mindfulness for health with people with cancer which is incurable to see if this type of
      intervention is acceptable and useful for this group of people.
