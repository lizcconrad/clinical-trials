      This study expands on a prior pilot study to refine the intervention messaging to focus on
      goal-oriented thinking, include a coach, and extend the intervention to a larger sample of
      young adult cancer survivors (aged 18-39 years) recruited from two National Cancer Institute
      (NCI)-designated cancer centers (Emory's Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta; University of
      Kentucky's Markey Cancer Center in Lexington). Participants will be randomly assigned
      (stratified by age and sex) to one of the 8-week treatment conditions in a 2:1 ratio (2 to
      intervention: 1 to attention control).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Young adulthood is a critical time for negotiating several life transitions and establishing
      and pursuing important life goals. Unfortunately, a cancer diagnosis disrupts this period of
      life for more than 60,000 people annually in the U.S. Compared to those without a history of
      cancer, young adult cancer survivors report poorer mental and physical health; moreover, they
      report significantly greater disruption in their goal pursuits than cancer survivors
      diagnosed at a later age. However, this high-risk group has been underserved and
      understudied, particularly in terms of intervention research to address these sequelae. Hope,
      a positive psychology construct that taps the ways in which people choose and pursue goals,
      is particularly relevant to this population. Additionally, higher hope is related to engaging
      in health promoting behaviors and living healthier lifestyles, which reduces risk of disease
      and adverse late effects and ultimately increase quality of life (QOL). The research team has
      pioneered a app-based behavioral intervention called Achieving Wellness After Kancer in Early
      life (AWAKE), aimed at promoting healthy lifestyles - specifically targeting mental health
      and positive health behaviors - among young adult cancer survivors. The proposed study will
      refine the intervention messaging to focus on goal-oriented thinking, include a coach, and
      extend the prior pilot work to a larger sample of young adult cancer survivors (aged 18-39
      years) recruited from two NCI-designated cancer centers (Emory's Winship Cancer Institute in
      Atlanta; University of Kentucky's Markey Cancer Center in Lexington). In this randomized
      controlled trial, recipients of the AWAKE intervention will be compared to an attention
      control group.

      The specific aims of this study are to:

      Aim 1. Test the feasibility and acceptability of AWAKE among intervention participants. The
      primary feasibility indicators are participation rates and retention rates. The primary
      acceptability indicators are use of and satisfaction with intervention components.

      Aim 2. Estimate effect sizes of AWAKE vs. control at 2 and 6 months to inform sample size
      calculations for the subsequent efficacy trial. The primary outcome is changes in hope, per
      the Trait Hope Scale. The secondary outcome is changes in quality of life, per the 36-Item
      Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General
      (FACT-G).

    <measure>Change in Adult Trait Hope Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 2, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Adult Trait Hope Scale is a 12-item survey where respondents indicate how true a statement is on a scale of 1 (definitely false) to 8 (definitely true). The Hope Scale includes two subscales of four items each plus four distracter items. Higher scores on the Pathways subscale (example question: &quot;I can think of many ways to get out of a jam&quot;) indicate higher levels of pathways thinking. Higher scores on the Agency subscale (example question: &quot;I energetically pursue my goals&quot;) indicate higher levels of agency thinking. The subscales will be summed to obtain a total hope score. Total scores can range from 8 to 64 with higher scores indicating higher levels of hope.</description>

    <measure>Change in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 2, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) asks respondents to rate their health and abilities to do their usual tasks. The SF-36 uses a variety of questions and response options and includes 8 subscales (physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, role limitations due to emotional health, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, social functioning, pain, and general health). Responses are coded on a scale of 0 to 100 where 0 is the worst possible health and 100 is the most favorable health score. The coded responses will be summed and averaged to obtain a mean score for the entire survey.
The SF-36 is standardized to the general population with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Scores above 50 indicate better than average health while scores below 50 are worse than average health scores.</description>

    <measure>Change in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 2, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-G is a 27-item quality of life (QOL) measure specific to cancer patients to provide insight into cancer specific factors in four dimensions (physical, social/family, emotional, functional well-being). Participants respond to a list of statements that tend to impact people with cancer by indicating how much they are impacted on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Scores for negatively worded statements are reversed so that higher scores indicate positive health. Scores from the four dimensions can be summed to create a total score. Total possible scores range from 0 to 108, with higher scores indicating increased well being.</description>

    <intervention_name>App-based behavioral intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>Achieving Wellness After Kancer in Early life (AWAKE) is a behavioral intervention that includes a smartphone app and coaching. AWAKE contains eight modules, and participants will complete the one module every week. App functioning will facilitate weekly homework assignments and include health education messaging, the ability to track progress toward goals over time via self-monitoring and graphical depictions of progress, audio-recordings of guided imagery exercises and relaxation exercises (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation), videos of topic-related inspirational material, and a portal for interacting with the coach. The coach will call each intervention participant weekly. Each coaching session will last roughly 30 minutes and involve four segments that will correspond to the module for the week. The coach will send daily text messages to participants encouraging their goal pursuits and providing other sources of support related to that week's homework.</description>
