      A multicenter double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparative Phase
      II / III clinical study to assess safety, tolerability, efficacy and optimal dose ranging of
      XC8 vs. placebo in patients with uncomplicated influenza or other ARVI during a 5-day
      treatment.

      The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the difference in time before the onset
      of a sustained improvement in clinical symptoms according to the Severity Rating Scale for
      ARVI, and to determine the optimal dose of XC8 in the treatment of influenza and other ARVI.

      Twenty-three Russian centers were approved for participation in this study. Twenty centers
      were initiated. Patients were enrolled in 18 centers. The study consisted of two parts: phase
      II and phase III. Each of the parts included 3 periods: screening, treatment, follow-up.

      In the first part of the study (Phase II), all eligible patients were randomized into 4
      groups (groups A, B, C, and D) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio:

      Group A - XC8 20 mg daily (40 patients); Group B - XC8 100 mg daily (40 patients); Group C -
      XC8 200 mg daily (40 patients); Group D - placebo (40 patients).

      Interim analysis was planned after the end of the first part of the study (Phase II). Based
      on the results of the interim analysis, the most promising XC8 dose group was selected and
      the necessary set was calculated to compare this group with the placebo group by the primary
      endpoint in a pooled set using an adaptive design with type I error control.

      In the second part of the study (Phase III), all eligible patients were randomized into 2
      groups (groups C and D) in a 1:1 ratio:

      Group C - XC8 200 mg daily (80 patients); Group D - placebo (80 Patients).

      During the treatment period (5 days), patients received XC8 / placebo daily on a background
      of standard symptomatic therapy. The follow-up period lasted for 9 days.
