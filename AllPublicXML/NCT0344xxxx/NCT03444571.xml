  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implantation of joint prostheses is currently the second largest diagnosis-related group in
      the Danish health service, and in view of the demographic development and spread of lifestyle
      diseases, this type of intervention is expected to continue to increase.

      Unfortunately, 5% of patients experience significant discomforts and complications. The
      second most frequent and serious complication is infection. While the established laboratory
      analyses (culture of tissue biopsies) are good at diagnosing acute infections, they are not
      satisfactory to diagnose a large group of patients especially with chronic infections. This
      can lead to prolonged diagnosing time and even to wrong diagnosis.

      Several studies have shown that analyses of prosthetic parts and the use of molecular
      biological methods for detecting infecting microorganisms can significantly improve
      diagnostics accuracy.

      The purpose of this project is primarily to demonstrate that analyses of bacterial specific
      DNA (16S rRNA genes) can confirm or rule out infection as fast (or faster) as cultivation
      methods. Rapid clarification can promote targeted treatment and in order to demonstrate this,
      the trial is conducted as a randomized study. .

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  revision of hip platelets (THA) or knee replacement (TKA) on indication of likely
             infection

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  surgery within the last 4 months. The same applies to patients with short history of
             illness, pronounced acute symptoms and systemic response (reducing the likelihood of
             biofilm infection).
