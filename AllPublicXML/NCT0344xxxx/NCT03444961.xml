    <textblock>
      The goal of the current project is to fill the unmet clinical needs around the objective
      assessment of visual function and develop outcome-oriented visual rehabilitation approach
      using the computer assisted rehabilitation environment (CAREN) system for Argus recipients.

    <measure>Effects of CAREN virtual reality system on Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 wks</time_frame>
    <description>ABC scale questionnaire is a validated balance confidence questionnaire about household and community tasks. The Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale is a 16-item questionnaire/survey. Each item is rated from 0% (no confidence) to 100% (complete confidence).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Effects of CAREN virtual reality system on square localization visual function test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 wks</time_frame>
    <description>The square localization test presents a 2.75&quot; square (250 pixels) at a random location on a black background and the patient is instructed to try to touch the square. The test measures the patient's ability to locate an object and results are calculated as a mean error (how far away in pixels from the square the patient touches the screen). A lower mean error (the distance from the square) indicates better patient performance.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Effects of CAREN virtual reality system on direction of motion visual function test.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 wks</time_frame>
    <description>The direction of motion test assesses the patient's ability to determine the direction an object is moving. The patient is presented with a white line (1.4'' wide) that moves across the screen in a random series of directions and angles. Patients are instructed to trace their finger on the monitor in the direction they perceived the line moved. Results are calculated as a mean error (how far off, in degrees, was the patient from the direction of the moving line).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Effects of CAREN virtual reality system on grating visual acuity visual function test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 wks</time_frame>
    <description>The grating visual acuity test measures the patient's visual acuity using the principles of acuity charts modified for ultra-low vision subjects. The patients are presented with black and white bars in one of four orientations (horizontal, vertical, diagonal to the left or diagonal to the right). The bars are present on the screen for 5 seconds during which the patient may scan the screen and then provide a verbal response as to which orientation they perceived the bars. The widths of the bars are varied to evaluate different levels of visual acuity.</description>
