  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial was to evaluate the efficacy of intratumoral PTS injection in alleviating airway
      obstruction and dyspnea by improving the percentage of lumen patency of patients with central
      air way NSCLC tumor severe obstruction.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Local intratumoral injection of para toluenesulfonamide (PTS) via bronchoscopy could
           alleviate airway obstruction for patients with central air way NSCLC tumor severe
           obstruction, which contributed to the shrinkage of target tumor lesions in a short
           period, with an objective response rate of 66% and an improvement rate of luminal tumor
           obstruction of 70% in the end-of-treatment period.

        2. Patient's pulmonary function, atelectasis and quality of life were improved
           significantly after treatment, indicating that PTS treatment cuold relieve the symptoms
           of air way obstruction and provide clinical benefits to the patients.

        3. Adverse events were mainly blood streaked sputum, injection site haemorrhage, cough,
           pyrexia and oropharyngeal pain, without reporting of potential risks. Common study drug
           related adverse events included injection site haemorrhage, cough, and blood streaked
           sputum and oropharyngeal pain. The multi-center clinical study conducted strictly in
           accordance with Standard Operation Procedures for the Use of a Standard Bronchoscope in
           Local Intratumoral PTS Injection showed that PTS had good safety and tolerability and
           that the procedural risks of intratumoral PTS injection via bronchoscopy could be
           controlled.

        4. The advantages of PTS for treatment of airway lung cancer obstruction included
           significant efficacy, good safety, large applicable population; relatively simple
           equipment conditions and operation, thus it could be spread easily. PTS is also expected
           to be used in the treatment of central lung cancer with acute airway obstruction in
           combination with other treatments (such as stent implantation), which provides a new
           drug treatment to patients with airway lung cancer obstruction. PTS can complement with
           other treatments, which is expected to improve the treatment efficacy significantly.

Quality of life (QOL) was evaluated based on the subject's answers in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung Cancer Subscale (FACT-LCS) questionnaire, version 4. Symptoms of lung cancer were evaluated according to the completed Lung Cancer Subscale (LCS). The FACT-LCS, version 4 is a patient completed questionnaire consisting 36 items that assesses health related quality of life (HRQL) in lung cancer patients. The FACT-LCS, version 4 consists of the 27-item FACT-G assessing generic HRQL concerns and 9-item Lung Cancer Subscale assessing disease-specific issues. Instrument scoring yields a range from 0 to 144 with higher scores representing better patient status.</description>

    <description>.The dose of PTS injected into multiple points in a single tumor was about 0.1-1.0 mL, and the appropriate specific doses were kept within the tumor without leakage. An appropriate low dose could be given firstly, and the following doses could be adjusted based on the response of patient and the tumor.
. In general, the daily dose of PTS injected into a single tumor was no more than 5mL, and the daily dose of PTS was no more than 10mL for each patient.
The injection was provided 2-3 times a week, with 2 weeks as a cycle of treatment. No less than 4 times of PTS treatment were recomended for the first cycle of treatment, and for other cycles of treatment, the number of PTS injections could be adjusted appropriately based on the condition of the patient.</description>
