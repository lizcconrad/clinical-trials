  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The introduction of enteral feeds for preterm, growth restricted infants are often delayed
      due to concern that early introduction may not be tolerated and may increase the risk of
      necrotizing enterocolitis. However, prolonged enteral fasting may diminish the functional
      adaptation of the immature gastrointestinal tract and extend the need for parenteral
      nutrition with its attendant infectious and metabolic risks. Early introduction of small
      volumes of milk in the form of Trophic feeding, promote intestinal maturation, may enhance
      feeding tolerance and decrease the time taken to reach full enteral feeding independently of
      parenteral nutrition.

      A Randomized Trial will be carried out over a period of 12 months in Department of
      Neonatology of BSMMU. Sample size will be 50(25 in each group). Infants with gestation below
      35 weeks, birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age, will be randomly
      allocated by web-based randomization to commence enteral feeds &quot;early,&quot; whose feeding will be
      started from 24 to 48 hours of age or &quot;late,&quot; whose feeding will be started from 48 to 72
      hours of age. Gradually feeding will be increased. Rate of advancement of feeding will be
      same for both groups. Primary outcomes will be time to achieve full enteral feeding sustained
      for 72 hours. Statistical analyses will be performed by using Fisher Exact test and by
      Student's t test for categorical data and quantitative data respectively. Logistic regression
      analyses will be performed to determine the role of independent variable.

      Eligible infants who will fulfill the inclusion criteria will be divided into two strata
      &quot;Early feeding group&quot; and &quot; Late feeding group&quot; by computer based randomization after taking
      informed written consent from parents or responsible caregivers. Feeding will be started in
      early feeding group from 24 to 48 hours of age or in late feeding group, from 48 to 72 hours
      of age. Initially 4 hourly feeding will be started with 0.5ml and 1 ml expressed breast milk
      in babies with birth weight &lt;1200 grams and &gt;1200 grams respectively. On the following day 3
      hourly, thereafter 2 hourly feeding will be provided in both groups. Gradually amount of
      feeding will be increased after reaching 2 hourly feeding at the rate of 10 ml/kg/day for
      initial 10 days then 20ml/kg/day in 2 aliquots till full feeding(150ml/kg/day).For babies
      with birth weight &lt;1200 gram, rate of feeding advancement 10 ml/kg/day till full feeds. Any
      baby who will develop shock (due to sepsis, cardiogenic, hypovolemic etc.) will be excluded
      and will be replaced by new one in same category as per protocol analysis. Follow up
      examinations will be done.
