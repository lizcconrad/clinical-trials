  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The frequency of head computed tomography (CT) imaging for mild head trauma patients has
      raised safety and cost concerns. Validated clinical decision rules exist in the published
      literature and on-line sources to guide medical image ordering but are often not used by
      emergency department (ED) clinicians. Using simulation, we explored whether the presentation
      of a clinical decision rule (i.e. Canadian CT Head Rule - CCHR), findings from malpractice
      cases related to clinicians not ordering CT imaging in mild head trauma cases, and estimated
      patient out-of-pocket cost might influence clinician brain CT ordering. Understanding what
      type and how information may influence clinical decision making in the ordering advanced
      medical imaging is important in shaping the optimal design and implementation of related
      clinical decision support systems.

      Multi-center, double-blinded simulation-based randomized controlled trial. Following
      standardized clinical vignette presentation, clinicians made an initial imaging decision for
      the patient. This was followed by additional information on decision support rules,
      malpractice outcome review, and patient cost; each with opportunity to modify their initial
      order. The malpractice and cost information differed by assigned group to test the any
      temporal relationship. The simulation closed with a second vignette and an imaging decision.
