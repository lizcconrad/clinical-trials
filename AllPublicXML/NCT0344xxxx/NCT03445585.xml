      This study is a biobank of specimens and clinical data for use in current and future research
      to better understand the cholestatic liver diseases primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis
      (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).

      This study is a biobank of specimens and clinical data for use in current and future research
      to better understand the cholestatic liver diseases primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis
      (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).

      Blood, urine, and stool samples will be collected periodically during patient visits or via a
      mail-home kit. Bile and bile duct cells will be collected during clinically necessary
      Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures. Anticipated research will
      focus on multi-omics assessments of biospecimens to better define how these diseases start
      and progress in order to develop novel tests for early detection of complication and better
      disease prognostication.

        Patients with PBC, PSC, controls without liver disease, and with other chronic liver

        Inclusion Criteria:

        PSC

          -  Patients diagnosed with PSC and who are between the age of 18 and 85 at time of
             enrollment in the study.

          -  The diagnosis of PSC will be based on standard PSC criteria including clinical and
             biochemical evidence of chronic cholestasis of at least six months duration, positive
             cholangiographic findings, and compatible liver biopsies if available.

          -  Patients with PSC who have undergone orthotopic liver transplantation will be offered
             enrollment except for collection of bile - please see below under Exclusion Criteria.

          -  Women with PSC of childbearing potential and pregnant women will be offered enrollment
             because there is no risk to an unborn child in this investigation.

        PBC

          -  Patients diagnosed with PBC and who are between the age of 18 and 85 at time of
             enrollment in the study.

          -  The diagnosis of PBC will be based on standard PBC criteria including clinical and
             biochemical evidence of chronic cholestasis of at least six month duration, positive
             anti-mitochondrial antibodies in serum and compatible liver biopsies, if available.

          -  Patients with PBC who have undergone orthotopic liver transplantation will be offered
             enrollment except for collection of bile - please see below under Exclusion Criteria.

          -  Women with PBC of childbearing potential and pregnant women will be offered enrollment
             because there is no risk to an unborn child in this investigation.

        Controls

          -  Controls without history of PBC, PSC, or evidence of other chronic liver disease of
             either gender that participate in this study will be between the ages of 18 and 85.

        Liver Disease Controls

          -  Patients without history of PBC or PSC but do have evidence of other chronic liver
             disease of either gender will be offered participation in this study if between the
             ages of 18 and 85.

        Exclusion Criteria (all subjects):

          -  PBC or PSC patients with known and overlapping other chronic liver diseases

          -  Patients unable to provide informed consent

          -  Prisoners and institutionalized individuals

        Exclusion Criteria (for bile collection during ERCP)

          -  PSC patients with biliary stents in place

          -  PSC with orthotopic liver transplantation
