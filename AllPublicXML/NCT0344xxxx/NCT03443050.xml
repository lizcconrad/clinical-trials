  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the effects on balance and postural control
      produced by the implementation of a training program that includes work with unstable
      surfaces in its methods. It also seeks to quantify to what extent the benefits exceed those
      achieved with a training of similar characteristics, but implemented on a stable surface. An
      intensive program is proposed, whose target population is young adults.
