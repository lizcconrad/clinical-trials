  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to identify neural locus critical for dual-task walking (walking and talking)
      in individuals with stroke. To achieve this aim, the investigators apply repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to different parts of the brain and evaluate the
      effects of brain stimulation on dual-task walking speed.

    <textblock>
      This study will enroll 12 individuals with a stroke at least 6 months ago. Participants will
      be tested across 3 sessions and each session will be approximately 1 week apart from each
      other. During testing, participants will be asked to walk under two conditions: single- and
      dual-task conditions. Under the single-task condition, participants walk on a instrumented
      mat such that their gait performance will be captured. Under the dual-task condition,
      participants walk on the mat while performing a counting backward task. The walking
      assessment is followed by a 12 minute non-invasive brain stimulation using high frequency
      rTMS. Another walking assessment will be conducted right after the brain stimulation session.
      High frequency rTMS will be applied to different neural loci, namely primary motor cortex,
      supplementary cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The walking speed under two
      different conditions will be compared before and after brain stimulation to different neural
      loci.
