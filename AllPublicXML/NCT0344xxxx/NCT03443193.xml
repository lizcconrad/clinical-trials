  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research project includes two components that assess exercise physiology parameters,
      cerebrovascular reserve, cognitive functions and cardiac function in coronary heart disease
      patients at rest, during an acute exercise, and after two different periodized training
      programs.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2peak) with gas exchange</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and following 12 weeks exercise training intervention</time_frame>
    <description>VO2peak will be measured during maximal exercise test with a gas exchange device. The highest value reached during the exercise phase of the maximal test (ergocycle) will be considered as the VO2peak. We will measure change of VO2peak before and after exercise training.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cerebral hemodynamics</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and following 12 weeks exercise training intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Cerebral hemodynamics will be measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system during maximal and submaximal exercise tests. We will measure change of cerebral hemodynamics before and after exercise training</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive functions at rest by a by standard pen-paper battery test</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and following 12 weeks exercise training intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive functions will be measured at rest with a pen-paper battery test by a neuropsychologist. We will measure change of score to the cognitive tests before and after exercise training.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiac hemodynamics</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and following 12 weeks exercise training intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiac hemodynamics will be measured continuously during the maximal exercise test on bike using an impedance cardiography device. We will measure change of cardiac hemodynamics before and after exercise training.</description>
