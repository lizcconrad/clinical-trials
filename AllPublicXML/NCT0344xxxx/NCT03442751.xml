  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of epithelium-on corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) in
      preventing the progression of, and/or reducing corneal curvature (Kmax) in eyes with
      progressive keratoconus. Epithelium-on CXL uses a formulation that allows the riboflavin to
      penetrate the cornea without the need to remove the epithelium, the outer most layer of the
      cornea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 275 study eyes with progressive keratoconus will be enrolled. Study eyes will be
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive CXL treatment or sham/control treatment.The primary
      efficacy endpoint is a difference of ≥ 1 diopter between treatment groups in the mean change
      in Kmax from baseline to Month 6.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be between 12 and 55 years of age, male or female, of any race;

          2. Provide written informed consent and sign a HIPAA form.

          3. Ability to read English to complete the NEI-VFQ 25 questionnaire;

          4. Willingness and ability to follow all instructions and comply with schedule for
             follow-up visits;

          5. For females capable of becoming pregnant, agree to have urine pregnancy testing
             performed prior to randomization of each study eye and prior to treatment of a
             cross-over eye; must not be lactating, and must agree to use a medically acceptable
             form of birth control for at least one week prior to the randomization visit, one week
             prior to treatment of a cross-over eye, and continue to use the method for one month
             following the last treatment.

          6. Having topographic and clinical evidence of keratoconus

          7. Having a diagnosis of progressive keratoconus, defined as one or more of the following
             changes over a period of 1 year or less:

               1. An increase of ≥ 1.00 D in Kmax or simK

               2. An increase of ≥ 1.00 D in regular astigmatism on subjective manifest refraction

               3. A myopic shift (towards greater negative sphere) of 0.50 D or more on subjective
                  manifest refraction or as evaluated by comparing eyeglass or contact lens
                  prescriptions to current subjective manifest refraction [NOTE: subjects with a
                  clear history of progression but without prior documentation may be screened and
                  followed for a period of time to confirm and document progression]

          8. BSCVA of ≥ 1 letter and ≤ 85 letters on ETDRS chart

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Contraindications, sensitivity or known allergy to the use of the test article(s) or
             their components;

          2. If female, be pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnancy or have a positive urine
             pregnancy test prior to the randomization or treatment of either eye or during the
             course of the study;

          3. Eyes classified as either normal, atypical normal, or keratoconus suspect on the
             severity grading scheme;

          4. A history of previous corneal surgery, limbal relaxing incision procedure, or
             insertion of Intacs in the eye(s) to be treated;

          5. Corneal pachymetry that is &lt; 325 microns at the thinnest point measured by Pentacam in
             the eye to be treated;

             lens implanted;

          7. Previous ocular condition (other than refractive error) in the eye to be treated that
             may predispose the eye for future complications. For example:

               -  History of corneal disease (e.g., herpes simplex, herpes zoster keratitis,
                  corneal melt, corneal dystrophy, etc.);

               -  Clinically significant corneal scarring in the cross-linking treatment zone that
                  is not related to keratoconus or, in the Investigator's opinion, will interfere
                  with the cross-linking procedure;

          8. A history of delayed epithelial healing in the eye to be treated or a current
             condition that may interfere with or prolong epithelial healing;

          9. Subjects with nystagmus or any other condition that would prevent a steady gaze during
             the treatment or other diagnostic tests;

         10. A history of previous corneal cross-linking treatment in the eye to be treated;

         11. Have used an investigational drug or device within 30 days of screening or be
             concurrently enrolled in another investigational drug or device trial within 30 days
