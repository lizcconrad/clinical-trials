  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patient undergoes arthroscopic surgery to treat rotator cuff injury. At the end of the
      surgery, the patient will be randomized into group A (brace) or group B (normal sling).

      Both groups will be also treated according to standard of care with physiotherapy and
      progressive introduction of movements.

      The patient undergoes arthroscopic surgery to treat rotator cuff injury. At the end of the
      surgery, the patient will be randomized into group A (brace) or group B (normal sling).

      Both groups will then perform only passive movements according to pain for the first 6 weeks
      supported by the physiotherapy, according to standard therapy. The following six weeks
      passive movements will be associated with active movements . No brace nor normal sling will
      be used anymore.

      Patients are in study for 6 months. During this period quality of life and pain
      questionnaires are submitted to the patients and a MRI will be done at the end of the study.
