  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aimed at investigating the effects of two different resistance training
      protocols — nonperiodized (NP) and daily undulating periodization (DUP) — on hemodynamic,
      morphofunctional and cognitive parameters of robust older women. Methods: Forty-two older
      women were randomized allocated into one of the three experimental groups: NP, DUP, and
      control group (CG). Evaluations of the hemodynamic, morphofunctional and cognitive parameters
      occurred before, during and after six months. The exercise groups performed the program of
      exercise twice a week over 22 weeks. In NP, the two weekly sessions were based on 3 sets of
      8-10 repetitions at a difficult intensity. However, in DUP, a power exercise session based on
      3 sets of 8-10 repetitions at a moderate intensity was added in the first session of the
      week.
