    <textblock>
      The combination lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone (Rd) is an active treatment for
      Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients, both at diagnosis and at relapse.

      Pomalidomide, is an immunomodulatory molecule (IMID), derivative of thalidomide, developed to
      improve the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of the parent molecule. Pomalidomide and
      dexamethasone (pom-dex) proved to be an effective and safe treatment in MM patients
      refractory to lenalidomide and refractory/intolerant to bortezomib.

      The addition of chemotherapy to novel drugs has been evaluated both at diagnosis and at
      relapse. The combination of pomalidomide-cyclophosphamide-prednisone proved to be safe and
      effective in relapsed/refractory MM patients. The combination
      pomalidomide-cyclophosphamide-dexamethasone (pom-cyclo-dex) was tested in a phase II study in
      patients with relapsed and refractory MM, demonstrating a good tolerability using
      pomalidomide at the dose of 4 mg. Pom-cyclo-dex resulted in a superior response rate and PFS
      compared to pom-dex. The increased hematologic toxicities, as a result of the addition of
      oral cyclophosphamide, were manageable. With an overall response rate of 65% the combination
      demonstrated a promising efficacy.The first aim of our trial, is to compare the combination
      of pom-cyclo-dex vs pom-dex.

      Relapsed myeloma is defined as previously treated myeloma that progresses and requires the
      initiation of salvage therapy.

      According to IMWG recommendation, biochemical relapse is defined as an increase of ≥ 25% of
      tumor burden from lowest value, without any CRAB feature (CRAB is defined as the onset of
      clinical symptoms: hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia and bone lesions) and detected in 2
      consecutive determinations.

      Clinical relapse requires one or more direct indicators of progressive disease and end organ
      dysfunction (CRAB features).

      Treatment at relapse should start in case of clinical relapse or a significant paraprotein
      increase (doubling of M-component in 2 months).

      In case of biochemical relapse the standard is observation only, as in case of asymptomatic
      MM at diagnosis.

      However, a recently published trial, showed improved PFS and OS for newly diagnosed
      asymptomatic patients treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in comparison with
      observation only. Our hypothesis is that similarly, in the relapse setting, patients may
      benefit from an early intervention, meaning a treatment at biochemical relapse and not only
      in case of clinical relapse or rapid increase of M-component.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a neoplastic disease of older adults, with a higher incidence in
      elderly patients: 26% are aged 65-74 years, and 37% are older than 75 years. The annual
      prevalence of MM is approximately 31 cases per 100,000 people in patients aged 65-74 years,
      and it increases to 46 cases per 100,000 people in patients aged ≥75 years. The prevalence of
      myeloma is likely to increase due to the extended survival and the growing life expectancy of
      the general population.

      Recently, the introduction of novel agents such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide
      and bortezomib, has changed the treatment paradigm of MM and extended survival.

      The prognosis of patients who are refractory to novel agents is especially poor. A
      retrospective study has recently demonstrated that patients with relapsed MM, who were
      refractory to bortezomib and were relapsed following, refractory to or ineligible to receive
      treatment with an IMiD, had a median overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) of 9
      and 5 months, respectively.

      STUDY DESIGN When patients experience biochemical relapse during lenalidomide maintenance,
      they will stop lenalidomide, as established in the related experimental protocol. Afterwards,
      patients can be considered for the enrollment in the present study if all inclusion and
      exclusion criteria are met.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, open label phase III study designed to assess the safety
      and the efficacy of two different pomalidomide combinations as salvage treatment in multiple
      myeloma (MM) patients.

      Patients will be evaluated at scheduled visits in up to 3 study periods: pre-treatment,
      treatment and long-term follow-up (LTFU).

      The pre-treatment period includes screening visits, performed at study entry. After providing
      written informed consent to participate in the study, patients will be evaluated for study
      eligibility. The screening period includes the availability of inclusion criteria described
      above.

      The treatment period includes administration of pomalidomide and dexamethasone in arm A and
      pomalidomide combined with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone in arm B. The response will be
      assessed after each cycle. Patients will be randomized to receive treatment at biochemical
      relapse (ARM I) or at clinical relapse (ARM II).

      The LTFU periods will start after development of confirmed progression disease (PD), all
      patients are to be followed for survival during the LTFU period every 3 months via telephone
      or office visit.
