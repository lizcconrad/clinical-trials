  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators asses whether there is any difference in short term recovery and long term
      prognosis according to the anesthetic method in patients who undergoing pancreatic cancer and
      bile duct cancer and undergoing surgery for PPPD or distal pancreatectomy.

    <masking_description>The investigator who research the QoR-40 questionnaire before and after the surgery will not know which group the patient is assigned to.
Because of the difference in anesthesia method, it is impossible to apply blindness to an anesthesiologist practicing anesthesia. Thus, the anesthesiologist will maintain anesthesia with the same target in both groups. (anesthesia depth, hemodynamic status and pain control)
Blind is released to investigator and outcomes assessor after completion of QoR-40 questionnaire.</masking_description>

    <description>The QoR-40 consists of a total of 40 questionnaires divided into five categories, it is considered to be the most appropriate index to measure the patient's integrated post operation recovery. Our primary outcome is the score of QoR-40 on the third day after surgery</description>

Anesthesia is induced and maintained with 2-6 mcg / ml propofol and 2-6 ng / ml remifentanil, which are converted to the effect site concentration.
