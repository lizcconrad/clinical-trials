  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although hysteroscopy (HS) and transvaginal ultrasonography (TVSG) are methods in the
      diagnosis of AUB, there is some suspicion about their efficacy. The aim of this study was to
      determine the efficacy and safety of HS and TVSG on diagnosing abnormal uterine bleeding(AUB)
      .216 women admitted to the investigators clinic (Sisli Ethal Training and Research Hospital,
      Obstetrics and Gynecology Department Obstetrics Service ) between 21-51 years of age. These
      patients were divided into two groups; menopause (71women) and pre-menopause (145 women). HS
      and endometrial sampling were performed both groups after TVSG.The success of these methods
      was assessed by kappa analysis
