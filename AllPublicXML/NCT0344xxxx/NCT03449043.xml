  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of consultations in the emergency services has continued to increase with 19.7
      million passages in 2014, an increase of 4% compared to 2013. Among these admissions, many
      patients come spontaneously to the emergency department and others are sent by the general
      practitioner who remains the first resort in the care of the patient.

      Faced with this massive influx to emergency services, the investigator will see what is the
      future of these. Are they more likely to be hospitalized than patients presenting to
      emergencies on their own?
