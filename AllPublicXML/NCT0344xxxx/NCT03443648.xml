    <textblock>
      Assessment of accuracy of correction of genu varum more than 20 degrees using external
      fixator assisted plating. Intraoperatively, the operative time needed for completion of
      accurate correction, torniquet use, blood loss will be assessed. Postoperative complications
      either early ones like infection, thromboembolic complications, peroneal nerve palsy or late
      post operative complications like implant failure, delayed union, non union and bone healing
      time will be assessed..

    <textblock>
      Malalignment prevents proper transmission of forces across the knee leading to advance or
      even start the progression of osteoarthritis.Preoperative planning is necessary to identify
      the level and magnitude of the deformity. Corrections can be performed acutely or gradually.
      Acute correction can be achieved by opening wedge, closing wedge or dome osteotomies followed
      by internal fixation. On the other hand, gradual correction can be achieved by osteotomy with
      external fixation.

      Although osteotomy with internal fixation is more convenient to the patient than external
      fixator, it has many drawbacks. These include the need for large surgical exposure, soft
      tissue stripping and difficulty executing precise deformity correction. Meticulous
      preoperative planning is important when internal fixation is planed. It also needs to be
      executed precisely till fixation is completed. Under-correction or over-correction is
      possible while executing the procedure. Furthermore, iatrogenic deformity in other planes may
      also develop. If such a deformity is significant, it may adversely affect the function or may
      lead to excessive loading on adjacent joints. In some cases, revision of surgery for further
      correction may be required to correct this residual or iatrogenic deformity.

      External fixation can be used for gradual correction of genu varum. In spite of the
      disadvantages of external fixation like being uncomfortable for the patient, tethering soft
      tissue, associated pin site infection and irritation , it is re-adjustable postoperatively.
      This allows controlled accurate correction of the mechanical axis of the lower limb.

      Our study is implicated on correction of high degree genu varum which is more than 20 degrees
      .To correct such deformity, it is difficult to calculate the amount of wedge opening
      intraoperative. The described trigonometric calculation of the size of the base is described
      for deformity less than 20 degrees .In this study we are going to use a hybrid technique of
      both external and internal fixation, so we can make use of the benefits of both internal and
      external fixation techniques External fixation by limb reconstruction system (LRS) or Taylor
      Spatial frame(TSF) is used to control and stabilize fragments while performing the desired
      correction. A locked T plate is then applied to stabilize the fully corrected osteotomy. This
      allows intraoperative removal of the external fixator without loss of correction. Then we
      compare the planned correction with the achieved correction.

    <description>assessment of mechanical axis deviation in degrees, mechanical tibiofemral angle in degrees, medial proximal tibial angle in degrees and the position of mechanical axis ratio. They are all measured in the immediate post operative long film and the long film after one year. The normal angles are known documented angles so, we will compare the preoperative and postoperative angles with the normal ones.Immediate postoperative long film on the lower limbs to compare pre and postoperative angles with the normal angles. Another long film is done after one year to follow up the achieved correction</description>

    <description>The plate length is marked on the skin. Limb reconstruction system (LRS) with one swivel clamp or Taylor Spatial frame (TSF) is used in all cases. The fixator is put in a plane parallel to that of the deformity. Two tapered pins are placed on either side of the planned osteotomy site and passed at a distance from the osteotomy so that they will not impede the subsequent internal fixation. Swivel clamps or the struts of the TSF are aligned in such a way that full correction is achieved. After osteotomy, swivel clamp is loosened and angular correction is achieved. Translation is carried out according to preoperative planning. If readjustment is required the swivel clamps or TSF struts are loosened and further correction is carried out. Once desired correction is achieved, the clamps or struts are tightened. Definitive internal fixation is carried out while external fixation holds the fragments. For internal fixation, locked T plate will be used.</description>
