      Comparison between four analgesic methods during trans rectal prostatic biopsy.

      OBJECTIVE: To define the best analgesic method between the peri-prostatic block, the
      analgesic suppository, the oral analgesic, the final anesthetic gel, during the trans rectal
      prostate biopsy determined at the end of the procedure with a visual analogue scale for pain
      (VAS pain) in a Interview 15 to 30 minutes at the end of the procedure.

      METHODS: experimental, retrospective, longitudinal, comparative, during May to July 2017, 350
      trans rectal prostate biopsies were performed, all cases were randomly assigned to one of the
      four study groups. The data analysis will be performed by calculating measures of central
      tendency and dispersion for quantitative variables and ANOVA test, for qualitative variables
      Chi square to determine statistical differences between the three moments of pain in the
      parameters of introduction of the ultrasound transducer, sampling of Prostate of the minimum
      12 biopsies and discomfort in general of the procedure

    <description>Evaluation of the discomfort or pain in the introduction of the trans rectal ultrasound transducer determined at the end of the procedure with Visual Analog Scale for Pain, which is a psychometric measuring instrument designed to assess the pain intensity experienced by each patient individually. Was employ for first time in 1921 and referred as a &quot;graphical rating method&quot;, which has the characteristic of being able to achieve a rapid classification (statistically measurable and reproducible) of the severity of pain experience.
The analogous visual scale used for this study measures from 0-10 the intensity of the pain with a series of &quot;faces&quot; that show the intensity in the pain experimentation with categories like &quot;No pain&quot; approximately 0-1, mild, annoying in number 2, nagging in number 4, distressing in number 6, intense in number 8 and worst possible in number 10.</description>

        The patients from the consultation were taken from the first time they were derived from
        the peripheral clinics or from the ones derived from our same medicine, with suspicion of
        prostate cancer and that the criteria for carrying out the trans rectal prostate biopsy
        were met.
