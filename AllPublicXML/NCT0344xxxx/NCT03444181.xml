  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Music has powerful effects on memory in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. However,
      although there is anecdotal evidence for beneficial effects of active music interventions in
      patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is lack of high-quality research investigating
      this issue, and the cognitive, emotional, and social factors that contribute to potentially
      beneficial effects of music making in AD patients are largely unknown. In a randomised
      controlled intervention trial, a cohort of AD patients will undergo twelve months of music
      lessons specifically tailored for AD patients. Structural and functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) will be used to determine changes in brain age (as compared to two control
      groups), and voxel-based morphometry will be computed to determine contributions of different
      factors of the music intervention (cognitive, emotional, and social) to plastic changes of
      brain morphology, and a potential deceleration of brain atrophy. In addition, quality of life
      of patients. In cooperation with the Bergen municipality, and a strong network of national
      and international partners, the neurocognitive music therapy will be implemented, involving
      training of music therapists, and communication of results to patients, patient groups, and
      therapists.

    <description>Also described as neurocognitive music therapy. Singing lessons will be provided once a week for a period of 12 months by a person with a qualification in music therapy, or by a person with a different relevant qualification (e.g. psychology and music teaching) under the supervision of a music therapist. Additionally, participants will have the opportunity to meet regularly (1-2 times per month) as a choir to sing the song they have learned together in a group.</description>

    <description>Cognitive training that is comparable in scope and extent to the music lessons, but not using music. Group training sessions will be provided once a week for a period of 12 months by a person with a qualification in physiotherapy or occupational therapy. Group activities may include group tours such as mountain hikes and the like (about 2 times per month) and will follow an established program for the elderly.</description>
