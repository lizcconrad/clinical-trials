      Study to investigate response to sunitinib in patients with thymic epithelial tumours who had
      progressive disease after at least one previous regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will be conducted to assess the activity of Sunitinib in patients affected by
      advanced or recurrent B3 thymoma or thymic carcinoma progressing after at least one line of
      chemotherapy (including one platinum based regimen).

      Taking into account the different biology and historically discrepant responses and survival
      of thymoma and thymic carcinoma, patients will be enrolled with these tumour types in two
      separate cohorts.

      Sunitinib will be self orally administered at 50 mg once daily, is 50 mg taken orally once
      daily, for 4 consecutive weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period (schedule 4/2) to comprise a
      complete cycle of 6 weeks until tumour progression, unacceptable toxicity or other criteria
      for discontinuation is met.

      Sunitinib dose reductions are permitted as per the approved product label for safety reasons.

      Dose reductions should occur in 12.5 mg decrements. No more than 2 dose reductions are
      allowed. If more than 2 dose reductions are necessary (ie, reduction to less than 25 mg
      daily), the subject must be permanently discontinued (Section 7.2.2)

      Possible dose reductions:

        -  Sunitinib at dose of 37,5 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks
           rest-period in cycles of 6 weeks.

        -  Sunitinib at dose of 25 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks rest-period
           in cycles of 6 weeks
