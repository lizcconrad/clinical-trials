      Definition of low birth weight:

      Low birth weight infants are those born weighing less than 2500 g. These are further
      subdivided into:

        -  Very Low Birth Weight : Birth weight &lt;1,500 g

        -  Extremely Low Birth Weight : Birth weight &lt;1,000 g Their survival is directly related to
           birth weight, with approximately 20% of those between 500 and 600 g and&gt;90% of those
           between 1,250 and 1,500 g surviving. Perinatalcare has improved the rate of survival of
           low birth weight infants.

      Causes of low birth weight:

        -  Premature birth

        -  Intrauterine growth restriction, which are most often Due to different placental
           problems and health problems of the mother or new-born

      RISK FACTORS:

        -  Age: Teen mothers have a much higher risk of having VLBW infant.

        -  Multiple birth babies are at increased risk of being VLBW because they often are
           premature. More than 50% of twins and other multiple gestations are VLBW if &lt;15 years

        -  Maternal health: Women exposed to drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes during pregnancy are
           more likely to have low birth weight babies. Mothers of lower socioeconomic

        -  Race: African-American babies are twice as likely as Caucasian to be very low birth
           weight
