  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical trial about beneficial effects of natural ingredient containing chlorogenic acid and
      luteolin on liver health and conditions related to liver (such as metabolic syndrome) for
      general body health.

    <textblock>
      This is one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The purpose of the present
      study is to evaluate and/or elucidate the role of the natural supplement, containing
      chlorogenic acid (10-12%) and luteinyl-7-glucoside (2-4%), on cardio-metabolic risk factors.

      The research hypothesis is to evaluate whether natural supplement containing chlorogenic acid
      and luteolin (Puraltilix, BIONAP SRL, Catania, Italy) may improve several cardio-metabolic
      parameters in subjects with the metabolic syndrome.

      All subjects will be evaluated at baseline and after 6 months of treatment (with natural
      supplement or placebo).
