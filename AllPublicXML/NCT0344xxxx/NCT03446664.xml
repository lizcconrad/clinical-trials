    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical diagnosis of medically refractory epilepsy with primary generalized
             tonic-clonic seizures (limited to 20 subjects) or partial onset seizures including
             complex partial seizures with or without secondary generalization (limited to 20
             subjects).

          2. Must be on adjunctive antiepileptic medications.

          3. Willing and capable to undergo multiple evaluations with functional magnetic resonance
             imaging (fMRI), electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG).

        4(A) For subjects with partial onset seizures: An average of ≥ 3 countable seizures per
        month based on seizure diary during the 3 month baseline period and no seizure-free
        interval greater than 30 days during those 3 months.

        4(B) For subjects with PGTCs: Have at least ≥ 3 countable seizures during the 3 month
        baseline period. Note: Each seizure within a cluster may be counted as separate seizures.

        5. 12 years of age or older.

        6. Subject is a male or non-pregnant female adequately protected from conception. Females
        of childbearing potential must use an acceptable method of birth control.

        7. Provide written informed consent-assent/Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
        Act (HIPAA) authorization and self-reported measures with minimal assistance as determined
        by the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently using, or are expected to use, short-wave diathermy, microwave diathermy, or
             therapeutic ultrasound diathermy.

          2. A VNS Therapy System implant would (in the investigator's judgment) pose an
             unacceptable surgical or medical risk for the subject.

          3. A planned procedure that is contraindicated for VNS therapy.

          4. History of implantation of the VNS Therapy System.

          5. Currently receiving treatment from an active implantable medical device.

          6. Presence of contraindications to MRI per the MRI subject screening record.

          7. Known clinically meaningful cardiovascular arrhythmias currently being managed by
             devices or treatments that interfere with normal intrinsic heart rate responses (e.g.,
             pacemaker dependency, implantable defibrillator, beta adrenergic blocker medications).

          8. History of chronotropic incompetence (commonly seen in subjects with sustained
             bradycardia [heart rate &lt; 50 bpm]).

          9. Cognitive or psychiatric deficit that in the investigator's judgment would interfere
             with the subject's ability to accurately complete study assessments.

         10. History of status epilepticus within 1 year of study enrollment.

         11. Dependent on alcohol or narcotic drugs as defined by DSM IV-TR within the past 2
             years, based on history. Tests for drug or alcohol use will not be administered.

         12. Currently being treated with prescribed medication that contains cannabis or cannabis
             related substance.

         13. Any history of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures.

         14. Currently participating in another clinical study without LivaNova written approval.
