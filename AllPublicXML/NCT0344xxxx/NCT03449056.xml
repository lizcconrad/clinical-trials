  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-flow nasal cannula is an oxygenation technique increasingly used for patients admitted
      for acute respiratory failure. Literature essentially concerns &quot;de novo&quot; acute hypoxemic
      failure and the interest of high-flow during take care of chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease patients is few studied. Physiological studies reported potential benefits of
      high-flow nasal cannula oxygenation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients
      including dead space clearance and decrease of respiratory, which lead to decrease work of
      breathing. As inhaled bronchodilators are part of treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease exacerbation, nebulization could be also provided through high-flow nasal cannula
      oxygen therapy. The aim of our study is to determine whether a beta-2 agonist nebulization
      administered through High-flow nasal cannula is efficient to improve spirometry of patients
      for admitted hronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
