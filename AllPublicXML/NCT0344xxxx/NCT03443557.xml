      outcome between malnourished patients who were prescribed oral nutrition supplement along
      with hospital diet and those without oral nutrition supplement.

      Prevalence of malnutrition in hospitalized patients varies from 30-70% depend on category of
      patients recruited. Adverse effects of malnutrition include increase of infection
      complication, increase hospital length of stay, and increase mortality. Prescription of oral
      nutrition supplement (ONS) have been proved to provide patients more calorie and protein
      intake and can improve patients' outcome.

      Despite the proved benefits of oral nutrition supplement(ONS), prescription of it in Thai
      hospitalized patients are far less than it should. The main reason of this under-practice is
      the limitation of health policies which considered ONS as an optional from main meals.
      Additional cost for ONS has to be paid by patients themselves, therefore the patients who
      have no willing to pay usually refuse to receive ONS. Unawareness of physician regarding its
      benefits is also a problem. In order to convince Thai authorities to allow for reimbursement
      of ONS and encourage prescription of ONS among physicians, an evidence based benefits of ONS
      in large Thai population is needed.

      The nD study was a single-day, population-based, standardized, multinational, cross-sectional
      audit and was performed worldwide, includes Thailand, in hospitals, nursing homes and
      intensive care units performing since 2006 to present. Every year, registered hospitals
      survey their patients regarding nutritional status, nutritional support. A follow-up for
      clinical outcome are perform at 30 days after the first survey, include mortality,
      readmission. This study will based on data of Thai patients collected from nD study during
      2006-2016.
