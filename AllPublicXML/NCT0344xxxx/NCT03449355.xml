  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy and delivery usually affect the general women's quality of life. Some studies have
      reported that sexual health may be affected by the mode of delivery. More than 70% of
      pregnant women prefer C-section due to several reasons point out the fear of pain and
      complications of vaginal delivery as the most common reasons.

      Aim of the work: To explore the relationship between quality of life and the possible sexual
      dysfunction after normal vaginal in comparison to cesarean section deliveries.
