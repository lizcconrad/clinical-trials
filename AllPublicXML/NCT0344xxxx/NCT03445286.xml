    <textblock>
      Gingivitis in the geriatric population is one of the growing global public health concerns,
      thus finding the most effective and non-invasive approach to prevent and treat gingivitis in
      the geriatric population is essential to prevent tooth loss and maintain oral health and
      function. Silver Diamine Fluoride (SDF) is Class II medical device. It was cleared for use in
      US August 2014 and became commercially available in April 2015. It is a chemical agent which
      has bifunctional properties. The silver itself kills caries causing bacteria directly. Silver
      and fluoride together interact to form fluorapatite in addition assist in hardening the teeth
      and preventing further demineralization.

      Even though, SDF has been approved in dental caries prevention and treatment, there are no
      published studies or evidence that evaluated the direct effect of SDF on gingivitis. If SDF
      improves or prevents gingivitis is unknown. The main goal of this clinical study is to
      investigate the effect of SDF on gingival status in geriatric patients with gingivitis. There
      is an urgent need to solve this common oral disease in the geriatric population. The logic
      for this research in a geriatric population is to find the most effective approach to treat
      gingivitis to prevent tooth loss and maintain oral health and function.

      To find an effective approach to treat gingivitis in the geriatric group, we will investigate
      the effectiveness of SDF application on gingival tissues in this group. The patients with
      gingivitis will be randomly allocated to two groups: group1(case group) will receive SDF
      application and group 2 (control group) will receive chlorhexidine (CHX) application. The
      gingiva will be evaluated for both groups at baseline before the application. Then 2 weeks
      and 4 weeks after the last application of the intervention. In addition, a sample of plaque
      will be taken from the teeth selected in this study by swab using dental kit (Ubiome) before
      and after both applications to quantify the presence of bacterial pathogen at baseline and
      follow up visits. The feasibility of this proposed therapy is supported by published
      literature that has shown that SDF was effective on dental and root caries prevention and
      treatment in geriatric patients.

      The Aims

        -  Aim 1 To investigate the effect of SDF application on gingival status in elder patients
           with gingivitis. To accomplish this aim, the subjects with gingivitis will be randomly
           allocated to two groups: group 1(case group) will receive SDF application and group 2
           (control group) will receive chlorhexidine (CHX). The SDF and chlorhexidine (CHX) will
           apply on the selected teeth with gingivitis once a week during three-week period. The
           gingival status will be evaluated at baseline before the application of either SDF or
           chlorhexidine (CHX). Then at 2 weeks, 4 weeks after the final application. The
           measurable outcomes will be Plaque Index (PI) and the Gingival Index (GI). In addition,
           record of existing brushing and flossing habits. If SDF application shows an improvement
           in the gingival condition (reduction in the plaque and gingival indices) in treatment
           group comparing to the control group it indicates that its effectiveness not only on
           dental caries as published, but it is also may extended to include gingivitis.

        -  Aim 2 To quantify the presence of bacterial pathogen in the dental biofilm. To
           accomplish this aim, a sample of dental plaque will be taken from the teeth selected in
           this study by swab using dental kit (Ubiome) before and after the SDF or CHX application
           to quantify the presence of bacterial pathogen at baseline before the application, 2
           weeks and 4 weeks after the application.

      Summary:

      The proposed therapeutic intervention of Silver Diamine Fluoride (SDF) in treating geriatric
      patients with gingivitis will establish a new adjunctive and inexpensive protocol for
      treatment of gingivitis. Gingivitis is inflammation of gingival tissues caused by dental
      biofilm bacterial infection. Left untreated, gingivitis will cause tooth loss. The
      preliminary results will provide new recommendations for treating geriatric patients in a
      safe, effective, and low-cost manner. This study will also address the gap in scientific
      knowledge regarding the use of SDF to treat gingivitis in elderly patients.

      Research Hypothesis: The application of SDF varnish is expected to improve the gingival
      condition and can be an effective approach in the treatment of gingivitis in geriatric
      patients.

      Null Hypothesis: The application of SDF varnish does not improve the gingival condition and
      cannot be an effective approach in the treatment of gingivitis in geriatric patients.

      Research Question: Does the application of silver Diamine Fluoride on teeth with gingivitis
      will improve the gingival condition in geriatric patients with gingivitis
