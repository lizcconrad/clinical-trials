  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to identify a titration regimen of ABX-1431 in adults with neuropathic
      pain with satisfactory tolerability to central nervous system (CNS) adverse events (AEs).
      During the course of this study, each participant will take a daily dose of ABX-1431 or a
      matching placebo for 28 days.

    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, optimized titration study of ABX-1431 HCl. The
      study will explore whether patients experiencing ABX-1431-related CNS AE accommodate or
      become tolerant to them with continued dosing. The efficacy of ABX-1431 in treating
      neuropathic pain will be assessed by the change from baseline in pain intensity scores using
      numerical rating scale (NRS-11).

      All patients will undergo a screening visit for enrollment criteria. Eligible patients will
      be treated with daily medication for 28 days which will include some treatment with placebo
      and some treatment with ABX-1431 HCl. Patients will record their daily average pain using a
      paper numerical rating scale (NRS-11).

      This study will enroll up to 32 patients with peripheral neuropathic pain due to one of the
      four following diagnostic groups: post-herpetic neuralgia, diabetic peripheral neuropathy,
      small fiber neuropathy or post-traumatic neuropathic pain.
