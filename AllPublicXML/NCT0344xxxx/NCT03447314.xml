    <textblock>
      GSK1795091 is being developed for administration in combination with other immune system
      modulators for the treatment of cancers. The combination of GSK1795091 and GSK3174998 will be
      evaluated for the first time in this clinical study.

             Although a fresh biopsy obtained during screening is preferred, archival tumor
             specimen is acceptable if it is not feasible to obtain a fresh biopsy. Subjects
             enrolled in a PK/Pharmacodynamic Cohort must provide a fresh biopsy of a tumor lesion
             not previously irradiated during the screening period and must agree to provide at
             least one additional on-treatment biopsy.
