  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and mechanisms of action of the trimodality treatment
      (radiotherapy, immunotherapy and surgery) in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. Half of
      the patients will receive stereotactic ablative radiotherapy followed by 2 cycles of
      immunotherapy (pembrolizumab); the other half will not receive the immunotherapy treatment.
      After treatment, both groups will continue treatment according to guidelines and will undergo
      surgery (lobectomy).

      An open label randomized exploratory study of the safety and mechanisms of action of combined
      treatment with SBRT and immunotherapy (pembrolizumab, anti-PD1) for early stage NSCLC.

      Intervention:

      Patients will be randomized between SBRT with or without 2 cycles of pembrolizumab treatment
      (starting on the first day of radiotherapy). The patients will undergo a lobectomy with hilar
      and mediastinal lymph node dissection after SBRT +/- pembrolizumab treatment. Translational
      research to explore the immune mechanism of action will include biological imaging with
      immuno-PET (positron emission tomography). Expression rates and activation states of immune
      effector subsets will be assessed in tumor core biopsy specimens, peripheral blood and tumor
      draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) by means of fine needle aspirates of TDLNs.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      To assess the safety of combined SBRT and pembrolizumab treatment in early stage NSCLC and to
      identify the immunological mechanism of action.

             or anti-Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including
             ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation
             or checkpoint pathways).
