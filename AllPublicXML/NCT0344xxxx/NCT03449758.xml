      Primary Objective:

      To assess the effect of sarilumab in combination with conventional synthetic
      Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug (csDMARD) and/or monotherapy on patient-reported impact
      of disease, using the rheumatoid arthritis impact of disease (RAID) questionnaire, in
      patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inadequate response or intolerance to
      current csDMARD or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the change of the RAID score in patients treated with sarilumab in combination
           with csDMARD and/or monotherapy.

        -  To assess the effect of sarilumab in combination with csDMARD and/or monotherapy on
           other patient-reported outcomes (global assessment of disease activity, disability,
           morning stiffness, fatigue, anxiety/ depression, mood disorders, and physical
           activities).

        -  To assess the efficacy of sarilumab in combination with csDMARD and/or monotherapy using
           DAS28-ESR and clinical disease activity index (CDAI).

        -  To assess the safety of sarilumab in combination with csDMARD and/or monotherapy.
