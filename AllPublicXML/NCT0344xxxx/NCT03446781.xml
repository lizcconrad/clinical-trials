    <textblock>
      Subjects will be screened for study eligibility within 14 days prior to enrolling in this
      study. Subjects with 2 treatment areas (bilateral buttocks) with moderate or severe levels of
      cellulite as independently assessed by the subject using the Patient Reported Photonumeric
      Cellulite Severity Scale (PR-PCSS) and by the Investigator using the Clinician Reported
      Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR-PCSS) will be eligible. The eligibility of the
      buttocks will be confirmed on Day 1. Once the eligibility of the buttocks is confirmed,
      subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment group (EN3835 0.84 mg per buttock or
      placebo) in a 1:1 ratio within an investigational site. Each subject will receive a treatment
      course which consists of up to 3 treatment visits (sessions), separated by 21 days (ie, Days
      1, 22, and 43). Each treatment visit will consist of 12 injections (0.3 mL per injection of
      EN3835 0.07 mg/injection or placebo; 0.84 mg in 3.6 mL per buttock) in each of the two
      buttocks for a total volume of 7.2 mL (1.68 mg). Selection of dimples to be treated in the
      buttocks will be at the discretion of the Investigator. End of study will occur at study day
      71.
