  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the most lethal malignancy of human being. Surgery is the only potential
      cure of pancreatic cancer. The invasion of major abdominal arteries is one of the most
      important factor restricting surgical intervention. For artery-involved pancreatic cancer
      (ai-PC) patients, pre-operative adjuvant therapies, especially the neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
      has brought exciting postoperative survival. Yet due to the potential screening effect of
      this treatment strategy, nearly half of ai-PC patients failed to benefit from surgery because
      of disease progression, adverse reactions of adjuvant treatment and other reasons. Artery
      divestment for the treatment of ai-PC firstly reported by our center, can significantly
      increase resection rate and produce overall survival benefit in some patients. This study is
      to explore whether up-front surgery with artery divestment combined curative pancreatectomy
      or the chemotherapy-first strategy would be more beneficial for ai-PC patients' survival.

      Subjects will be randomized to treatment group either receiving up-front artery divestment
      combined pancreatectomy (Surgery Group) or adjuvant chemotherapies (Chemo Group). In Surgery
      Group, an artery divestment combined pancreatectomy will be performed if no pre-operative
      contra-indication or intra-operative metastasis were revealed. Post-operative adjuvant
      chemotherapies were prescribed according to performance status. In Chemo Group, adjuvant
      chemotherapy of gemcitabine or gemcitabine + cisplatin will be utilized according to
      performance status. After 2 circles of adjuvant chemotherapies, patients will be reevaluated
      and curative operation would be attempted if without disease progression.

      Overall mortality at one year after randomization will be the primary endpoint. Other
      parameters as overall survival after 2 and 3 years, median survival, disease-free survival,
      margin status of subjects receiving curative surgery, etc. will also be observed.

    <description>Tunica adventitia was pick up by forceps and opened by electrocoagulation at 1 cm distal from tumor-artery contact. Space between tunica adventitia and external elastic lamina (EEL) were blunt lifting tumor-invaded adventitia by angled clamp. Adventitia was then sectioned to show EEL. Loose dissect space could be achieve along long the plane between EEL and adventitia as long as tumor invasion outside EEL. Tumor and invaded adventitia were further cut open by electrocoagulation proximally. Circumferentially, separation could be done by blunt dissection around EEL. Nourishing blood vessels of the artery would be secured by electrocoagulation or ultrasonic scalpel while major branch would be ligated or transfixed.</description>
