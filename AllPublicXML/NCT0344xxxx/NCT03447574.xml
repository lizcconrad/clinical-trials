  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to answer the question of if several non-invasive methods are
      comparable to the invasive clinical gold standard of radiolabeled albumin in terms of
      detecting changes in fluid volume.

      It is broken into two studies: Aim 1 Study A is designed as a pilot phase to develop the
      non-techniques, and Aim 2 Study B is comparing these techniques to the gold standard.

    <description>The ethanol dilution is, in essence, a non-invasive dilution method. It is of interest because of how ethanol readily dissolves itself exclusively into the water space of the body[4], is non-toxic in reasonable concentrations, is metabolized in a 0th order reaction above concentrations of 0.015 g/dL[4], and there are non-invasive methods for determining blood alcohol concentration[5, 6]. Thus, by drinking a known amount of ethanol, total body water can be calculated after a few hours of periodic breathalyzer analyses. Ethanol has been validated against deuterium oxide, the invasive gold standard for determining total body water[4]. The ethanol dose will be 0.5g/kg body weight.</description>

    <description>30mL/kg body weight of saline will be rapidly infused after the baseline measurements completed in Aim 1. Non-invasive methods for fluid volume determination (CO-pulse-oximetry, ethanol breathalyzer, BIS) will be conducted and change from baseline calculated. To determine if non-invasive fluid volume techniques can accurately determine fluid changes in healthy participants.Non-invasive methods for fluid volume determination (CO-pulse-oximetry, ethanol breathalyzer, BIS) will be conducted and change from baseline calculated.</description>
