  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of acute huperzine A ingestion prior to exercise on
      cognitive function and perceived effort in exercise-trained individuals. Huperzine A has
      shown the ability to improve cognitive function in dementia patients, and is currently
      marketed as a cognitive enhancing supplement. Study participants will receive either
      huperzine A or placebo during the first experimental session, and will receive the other
      substance during the second session.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Huperzine A improves cognitive function by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. This
      enzyme is responsible for the degradation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. inhibition
      of acetylcholinesterase may allow for greater availability of acetylcholine, which may allow
      for better nerve conduction and therefore enhanced cognitive function and possibly muscular
      contraction.

      Huperzine A (200 mcg, Swanson®, Fargo, North Dakota) and placebo capsules will be
      administered in a single oral dose. The dose of Huperzine A to be used is comparable to
      previous research (Xu et al, 2011). Placebo capsules will consist of rice flour. The
      participants will ingest the capsules with 250 mL of water 30-45 minutes before exercise is
      initiated.

      A paired-sample t-test with alpha set to p ≤ 0.05 for statistical significance will be used
      to analyze the data. Outcomes measured during the first and second experimental sessions will
      be compared to each other. The participants will be compared to themselves during previous
      sessions, so a paired sample t-test will be used to calculate the difference between the
      sessions. Data will be presented as means ± SE. Data analyses will be performed with
      Microsoft Excel; and other analyses may be performed as needed to gain further insights about
      the data.

      A statistical power analysis was performed (G*Power software, version 3.1.5, University of
      Kiel, University of Dusseldorf, and University of Mannheim, 157 Germany) based on the
      following inputs: two-tailed paired t-test, alpha=0.05, desired power=0.80, sample size=15
      subjects. The results indicated that a standardized effect size of 0.78 (i.e. large effect)
      will be detectable. As many as 20 subjects will be recruited and enrolled to ensure that
      complete data on 15 subjects are available in the event of screen fails and dropouts.

    <time_frame>This test will be implemented during a 2 minute window during the last 10 minutes of endurance exercise.</time_frame>
    <description>Digit span will be used as a measure of working memory. During a period of two minutes, the participants will be presented with a series of digits at a rate of one digit per second, and will be required to to repeat them verbatim. If they succeed, they will be presented with a longer series by one digit. The longest series that they are able to correctly repeat will be the number of their score (i.e. if they are able to repeat a series of 7 digits, their score will be 7).</description>
