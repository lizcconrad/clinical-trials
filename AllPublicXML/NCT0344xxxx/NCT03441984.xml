  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, single-dose, open label, randomized 3-way cross-over study to compare BA of
      pediatric study drugs TRIUMEQ and (DTG/3TC) in healthy volunteers under fasted conditions.
      Study will be conducted in 2-parts. Each part 1 and part 2 will comprise of 3-treatment
      periods (TP) where Part 1, will assess BA, of pediatric TRIUMEQ dispersible tablets with an
      adult TRIUMEQ conventional tablet formulation and Part 2, will assess BA, of pediatric
      DTG/3TC dispersible tablets with adult DTG and 3TC conventional tablets formulation. Total
      duration of study is 9-weeks and will be conducted in approximately 36 subjects. The 2-parts,
      may be run in parallel as they are independent of each other. TRIUMEQ is a registered
      trademark of GlaxoSmithKline group of companies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is 2-Part. Part 1 is dose escalation phase and Part 2 is dose expansion phase.
      Every part subject will receive 2 treatments, A and B. Treatment A, subjects will receive
      GSK2857916, at dose of 2.5 mg/kg, if well tolerated escalated to 3.4 mg/kg, in next cohort of
      subjects to determine RP2D dose. If not tolerated, lower dose, 1.9 mg/kg may be given. As
      SOC, subjects will receive lenalidomide, as 25 mg or 10 mg orally daily; with dexamethasone
      as 40 mg or 20 mg. Treatment B, subjects will receive GSK2857916, as the same way as in Part
      1, with 21-Day cycle alongwith, bortezomib, at a dose of 1.3 mg/m^2, subcutaneously (SC) or
      intravenously (IV), with dexamethasone at a dose of 20 mg orally, or IV, which can be reduced
      later. Part 2 will occur post Part 1, whereRP2D dose from Part 1 will be given with Treatment
      A with lenalidomide, 25 or 10 mg and dexamethasone 40 or 20 mg and for Treatment B, the RP2D
      dose alongwith bortezomib 1.3 mg/m^2, and dexamethasone at 20 mg.

    <intervention_model_description>2-part study with 3-TPs each. Part 1, compares relative BA of TRIUMEQ dispersible tablets for pediatric populations (DTG, 5 milligram [mg]/abacavir [ABC] 60 mg/3TC 30 mg), when administered as direct-to-mouth and when dispersed into purified water, with adult TRIUMEQ conventional tablet (DTG 50 mg/ABC 600 mg/3TC 300 mg), administered as direct-to-mouth (reference). Additionally, part 2 will compare relative BA of DTG/3TC (DTG 5 mg/3TC 30 mg), dispersible tablets for pediatric populations, when administered as direct-to mouth and when dispersed into purified water, with adult DTG (50 mg) and 3TC (300 mg) conventional tablets, when administered as direct-to-mouth (reference). Each TP, in Part 1 and 2 will have, wash-out period of 7-days (with minus 4 hours) between each single dose, for flexible dosing. During TPs, subjects will be admitted, to clinic on Day-1, following completion of last study procedure on Day 4, post which follow-up visit conducted, 7 to 10 days after last dose.</intervention_model_description>

             how to properly use these methods of contraception; All female subjects participating
             in the study should be counselled on safer sexual practices including the use and
             benefit/risk of effective barrier methods (e.g., male condom) and on the risk of human
