      Single-blind, multi-centre, prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing Ligamys
      Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) repair, Internal Bracing ACL repair and conventional ACL
      reconstruction for relative clinical efficacy and economic benefit.

      Patients with a primary proximal acute ACL rupture will be included in either study 1 (0-4
      weeks post rupture) or study 2 (5-12 weeks post rupture) of the LIBRE study.

    <textblock>
      Rationale The conventional operative treatment of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture
      is an ACL reconstruction, whereby the residual ruptured ACL is removed and replaced by an
      autograft hamstring tendon.

      Recently, two alternative natural healing techniques have been developed and proof of concept
      have been established. The two repair techniques are: Dynamic Intraligamentary Stabilization
      (DIS) and Internal Brace Ligament Augmentation (IBLA). Both DIS and IBLA allow the rupture to
      heal by itself. The biggest difference between the two techniques is that the DIS system
      consists of a polyethylene suture and a spring screw system, which stabilizes the knee joint
      with the same force during flexion and extension of the knee, and the IBLA system consists of
      a 2mm high molecular weight polyethylene FiberTape®.

      Objective The aim is to identify the optimal ACL technique for treating an acute ACL injury
      that can deliver an enhanced clinical efficacy and economic benefit for two time frames (0-4
      weeks and 5-12 weeks) following ACL rupture.

      Study design Two separate, interventional, single-blind, comparative, multi-centre,
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) will be conducted. The University Hospital of Antwerp
      (UHA) and the University Hospital of Brussels (UHB) are the two participating sites. A total
      of 90 patients will be included in the study, 36 for study 1 and 54 for study 2.

      The anticipated study duration is 48 months which will include a three month starting-up
      phase, 18 month recruitment period, a 24 month follow-up period and three months for final
      analysis. The study data will be collected over three periods: pre-operative, per-operative
      and post-operative.

      To meet the aim the time-dependent nature of ACL repair surgery has to be taken into account.
      As the DIS should be performed within a short period after the ACL rupture, study 1 is
      limited to 4 weeks after ACL rupture. IBLA can be performed up to 12 weeks after ACL rupture,
      therefore the time limit for study 2 is 12 weeks after ACL rupture. ACL reconstruction is
      preferably performed when the knee has 'cooled down', and this is from 5 weeks post-rupture.
      There is no time limit for the ACL reconstruction, since this can be performed up to several
      years post-rupture.

      • Study 1: RCT 1 DIS versus IBLA within 4 weeks after the ACL rupture.

      • Study 2: RCT 2 IBLA versus the conventional ACL reconstruction between 5-12 weeks after the
      ACL rupture.

      The DIS will be matched to the conventional ACL reconstruction group of study 2 to compare
      these two treatments. The IBLA from study 1 will be matched to the IBLA from study 2.

      Study population Patients with a primary acute proximal ACL rupture, below the age of 50
      years. The ACL remnant must be suitable for repair.

      Intervention The conventional ACL reconstruction, DIS or IBLA surgery. Main study objectives
      Primary objective: change of 15 points in IKDC score from baseline (pre-rupture) to 6 months
      post-operative.

      Main secondary objectives: Failure/re-rupture, Tegner score, Lysholm score, EQ-5D-5L, return
      to work/sport, Lachman test and complications.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, and benefit Proof of
      concept have been established and the expected complications are similar in the three
      treatment arms. The major benefit of the alternative repair techniques is the preservation of
      the native ACL and its own proprioceptors possibly leading to a faster recovery time.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in IKDC Score from baseline (pre-rupture) to week 26 post-operative between treatment groups. At 6 months follow-up the primary outcome will be measured, a change of 15 IKDC points between the treatments is considered clinically meaningful.</time_frame>
    <description>The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) is a commonly used instrument to determine the outcome following various knee procedures, including ACL reconstructions. In essence, it is a subjective well-known tool that provides patients with an overall function score (range between 0 to 100). The score is interpreted as a measure of function with higher scores representing higher levels of function. The questionnaire addresses 3 categories: symptoms (i.e. pain, swelling, stiffness etc.), activity (rising from chair, going up and down stairs, jumping, squatting etc.) and knee function. The knee function studies focus primarily on one question: &quot;How is the knee function post-operative compared to the situation before the injury?&quot;. In conclusion, the IKDC score is a reliable, well established and both patient and clinician friendly tool (i.e. it is easy and it requires little time to complete).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Failure (re-rupture/instability complaints)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 post-operative to week 104 post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Re-rupture: Clinical and MRI-confirmed. Re-rupture of the graft or the repaired ACL. Instability complaints: AP translation difference of &gt;3 mm (Lachman test) between the injured knee and the contralateral knee and subjective instability complaints.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tegner score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-rupture), week 13 post-operative, week 26 post-operative, week 52 post-operative, week 104 post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>The Tegner (activity) score provides a method of grading daily activities, recreation, and competitive sports. It is developed to complement the Lysholm score, based on observation that a decreased activity level may hide limitations in function scores. A score is assigned based on the level of activity that the patient selects as best representing their current activity level. The final score ranges from 0 to 10, where 0 represents 'disability because of knee problems', whereas a score of 10 corresponds to 'participation in professional competitive sports'.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lysholm score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-rupture), week 13 post-operative, week 26 post-operative, week 52 post-operative, week 104 post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>The Lysholm score has an easy scoring system that allows to determine an overall function score based on 8 items (pain, instability, locking, swelling, limp, stair climbing, squatting, and need for support). The total score is the sum of response to each item and ranges from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate a better outcome with fewer symptoms or disability.</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-operative) to week 104 post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group as a measure of Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). The EQ-5D consists of a descriptive system and the EQ VAS. The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale (score 0-100). EQ-5D-5L is an EQ-5D with 5 levels of severity for each of the 5 dimensions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Return to work/sport</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (post-operative) to week 104 post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Measuring after how many weeks/ post-operative the patient returns to work/sport and after how many weeks/months the patient returns to his/her pre-injury work/sport level (100% return to work/sport).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Isokinetic measurement (Biodex/CSMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operative, 3 months post-operative, 6 months post-operative, 12 months post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Isokinetic muscle torque measurements are commonly used to monitor the progress in muscle rehabilitation after knee ligament injuries. Insulated joints and their surrounding muscle groups can be tested in biomechanically correct positions, at velocities which correspond to the joint function. Various isokinetic dynamometers are in use today to evaluate muscle power such as the Biodex™ and the Computer Sports Medicine International™ (CSMI). The Biodex™ and the CSMI™ devices not only measure isometric (static) strength and concentric strength (where the muscle shortens during force production) but are also capable of measuring eccentric strength (where the muscle is lengthened while producing force). Information obtained via isokinetic measurements allows for a more efficient revalidation and evaluation of the revalidation.</description>

    <measure>MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operative, 6 months post-operative, 12 months post-operative, 24 months post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation of the healing of the ACL will be performed by means of a MRI-assessment according to Howell (Howell classification).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-operative) to week 104 post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>A VAS pain measures the amount of pain that a patient feels, ranging across a continuum from 'no pain' to 'an extreme amount of pain' (score 0-10). The distance from the 'no pain' endpoint represents the patient's pain score. VAS, is an easy assessment tool to use in patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6 post-operative to week 104 post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>During the VAS satisfaction, patients are asked to show their satisfaction of the surgery and revalidation level on a line between 0 and 10, 0 meaning 'not satisfied' and 10 meaning 'fully satisfied' between the two endpoints of the line. The distance from the 'not satisfied' endpoint represents the patient's satisfaction score.</description>
