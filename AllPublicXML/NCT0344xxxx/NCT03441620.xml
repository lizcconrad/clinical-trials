  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we propose to investigate the effects of dietary achievable doses of
      strawberries on serum LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and related lipid profiles, measures of
      glycemia and insulin resistance, and biomarkers of inflammation in a 14 week controlled
      crossover study.

      Screening and consenting: Any interested participant will be screened via a telephone call,
      and based on this information, participants will then be scheduled for the screening visit,
      consented and enrolled in the study. The screen forms have been attached to the protocol. For
      those who do not qualify, screen forms will be immediately destroyed. The screen visit will
      involve an 8 hour fasting state and the following procedures:

        -  Completing screening questionnaire

        -  Measuring height, weight, blood pressure, and waist size

        -  Drawing about 30mL blood for blood glucose and lipids and comprehensive metabolic panel
           All subjects will be asked to follow usual diet and lifestyle, and refrain from other
           sources of berries and related products while on the study. Subjects will also maintain
           3-day food records at screen, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of the study. Height, weight, blood
           pressure and waist circumference will be measured by trained personnel at MPE 326 (KNS
           facility for clinical research). Blood draws will be performed by trained phlebotomists
           (to be hired) at MPE 326, and all procedures will be performed by trained research
           personnel [PI &amp;Co-PI: Basu, Izuora and graduate student (to be hired)]. In case of blood
           pressure, an average of at least three readings, 10 min apart, will be measured at each
           visit for each participant. Blood glucose (fasting and postprandial at two hours) will
           be determined at each time point. The oral glucose tolerance tests will be conducted at
           MPE 326 and blood samples will be sent to Quest Diagnostics, Las Vegas. Insulin
           resistance will be calculated using the homoeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR). The
           HOMA-IR is a standard and widely used formula in calculating insulin resistance based on
           fasting glucose values. These values will be calculated using a Microsoft excel
           spreadsheet for each participant. Screening tests will include clinical laboratory tests
           for blood glucose, lipids, C-reactive protein and metabolic panel to determine
           eligibility in the study
