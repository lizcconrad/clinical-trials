      Interstitial lung disease includes a heterogeneous group of chronic lung conditions that is
      characterized by exertional dyspnoea and poor health related quality of life . includes
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis of unknown cause And another groups are caused by occupational,
      inorganic or organic exposure, drug- induced toxicities, or are secondaries to connective
      tissue disease The clinical course and outcome of interstitial lung diseases are highly
      variable between different sub types, but survival after diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis is only 2.5 to 5 years is a progressive and fibrosing lung disease that is
      characterized by architectural distortion of the lung parenchyma and is progressive, with a
      dismal prognosis Also patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis generally demonstrate
      greater abnormalities of exercise induced gas exchange than those with other forms of
      Interstitial lung disease

      fibrosis is only 2.5 to 5 years is a progressive and fibrosing lung disease that is
      characterized by architectural distortion of the lung parenchyma and is progressive, with a
      dismal prognosis Also patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis generally demonstrate
      greater abnormalities of exercise induced gas exchange than those with other forms of
      Interstitial lung disease People with exhibit limitation in peak exercise capacity, which is
      associated with impaired ventilation, gas exchange and pulmonary perfusion abnormalities Also
      in people with interstitial lung diseases there is a relationship between quadriceps muscle
      weakness and exercise capacity raising the importance of skeletal muscle dysfunction.
      Furthermore, since interstitial lung diseases is the leading diagnosis referred for lung
      transplant characterizing skeletal muscle dysfunction and its relationship to exercise
      capacity prior to lung transplant is of specific interest for this population.

      The cause of muscle dysfunction in individuals with lung disease is multifactorial, including
      factors such as disuse, hypoxaemia, malnutrition, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation and
      medication Pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress are thought to be pivotal in the
      pathogenesis of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia
