  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: 1) To examine whether the real transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      group would perform better in the cognitive training (CT) intervention than the sham tDCS
      group and the CT group; 2) To determine if, as a consequence of the stimulation generated by
      the use of tDCS, there would be a transfer effect to other cognitive domains and to cognitive
      tasks in activities of daily living; 3) To investigate the time and spatial responses of tDCS
      on the brain cortex during and after tDCS application.

      Hypothesis to be tested: By applying anodal tDCS with the combination of a CT delivered via
      the use of tablet PCs in older adults at risk of MCI, it will enhance their cognitive task
      performance in CT and subsequently generalize to other cognitive domains as well, involving a
      transferability to cognitive tasks in activities of daily living.

      Design and subjects: A multi-centered single-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) with
      three groups (CT alone/Sham tDCS with the combination of a CT/ Real tDCS coupling with CT)
      The participants who will take part of this study will be older adults at risk of MCI Study
      instruments: tDCS, Ipad, Neuron Up CT Apps, EEG. Interventions: The intervention will last
      for 9 sessions (3 sessions per week for 3 weeks). Sham tDCS and real tDCS, will be combined
      with the same CT which is used in the CT group. During the experimental intervention, anodal
      tDCS will be placed on left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and cathodal tDCS on the
      contralateral deltoid muscle with the combination of a CT. During the experimental
      intervention, anodal tDCS will be placed on left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and
      cathodal tDCS on the contralateral deltoid muscle with the combination of a CT.

      Main outcome measures: Cognitive assessments, CT performance, EEG. In addition, delta and
      theta frequency suppression and alpha increment power under the anode electrode will be
      observed.

    <measure>Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 30-point test about several cognitive domains (visuospatial/executive, naming, memory, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall and orientation) and a screening tool used of MCI and dementia.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Digit Span Test</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The test measures short term memory in such a way that sequences of digits are presented and have to be recalled in forward and reverse order. Testing ends when the maximal list length is reached or when subjects fail to recall the trial at one sequence length.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Trial Making Test (TMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>TMT encompasses visual attention and processing speed, it consists of 2 parts in which a set of 25 dots in the first part and 24 dots in the second part have to be accurately connected. Time performance is measured as the main outcome</description>

    <measure>Riverhead Behavioral Memory Test (3rd edition) (RBMT-3)</measure>
    <time_frame>40 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It includes 14 subtests assessing aspects of visual, verbal, recall, recognition, immediate and delayed everyday memory. Additionally prospective memory skills and the ability to learn new information are measured as well</description>
