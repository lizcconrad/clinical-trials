        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria for All Participants:

             consent

          -  Body Mass Index between 18 and 40 kilograms per meters squared, inclusive, at
             Screening

          -  Voluntary agreement to provide written informed consent, and the willingness and
             ability to comply with all aspects of the protocol

          -  Nonsmokers or smokers who smoke 20 cigarettes or less per day

          -  Participants with normal liver function

        Additional Inclusion Criteria for Healthy Participants:

        - Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is ≥ 90 milliliters per minute (mL/min), as determined
        by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula

        Additional Inclusion Criteria for Participants with Renal Impairment:

        - Diagnosis of severe renal impairment (GFR is 15 to 29 mL/min, as determined by the MDRD
        formula) that has been stable (without any change in disease status) for 60 days prior to
        study Screening and is confirmed on Day -1, as determined by the investigator by MDRD
        formula. If the renal function classification for the participant changed from screening to
        Day -1, estimated GFR (eGFR) should be repeated once within 24 to 48 hours. If eGFR
        variability across these scheduled and repeat time points indicates the participant does
        not consistently meet the criteria for one renal category group, participant enrollment
        into a renal category group will be at the discretion of the medical monitor and
        investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion Criteria for All Participants:

             cause) or have been sterilized surgically (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, total

             to Screening

          -  A positive urine drug test or a positive breathalyzer alcohol test at Screening or Day
             -1

          -  Participation in another interventional clinical trial within 4 weeks, or 5 times the
             half-life of the investigational drug (whichever is longer), of lemborexant

             signs, ECG, or clinical laboratory testing

          -  Use of any prohibited prescription or over-the-counter medication within 2 weeks or 5
             half-lives (whichever is longer) before Screening, or plans to use any such treatment
             during the study. For participants with renal impairment, chronic stable
             administration of medications necessary for maintaining the clinical status of the
             participant may be permitted after consultation with the Medical Monitor.

        Additional Exclusion Criteria for Healthy Participants:

          -  Presence of clinically significant illness requiring treatment or that may influence
             the outcome of the study (e.g., psychiatric disorders, disorders of the

             injections

          -  New significant illness that onset within 2 weeks prior to study drug administration

             as determined by the investigator. Participants with a history of Type I or Type II
             diabetes may be eligible, providing that, in the investigator's opinion, the disease
             has been stable. Participants receiving insulin therapy may be eligible provided they
             have been on a stable (i.e., dose has not changed) treatment for at least 2 weeks
