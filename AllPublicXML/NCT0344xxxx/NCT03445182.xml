  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of DentalVibe (DV) in reducing
      injection pain and anxiety associated with local anaesthesia in paediatric patients.

      The clinical trial is a randomized split-mouth assignment. Included patients are 8-12 years
      old requiring local anesthetic infiltration with conventional syringe (CS) for extraction of
      two primary maxillary molars bilaterally. Eligible patients undergo two single-visit
      treatments after CFSS-DS measurement before each, where as DV is allocated to either first or
      second local anaesthesia procedure. Primary outcome measure will be pain felt during
      injection, reported by patient on VAS. Secondary outcome measures: self-reported anxiety
      during injection on FIS; pain-related behavior according to FLACC scale; heart-rate dynamics;
      patient preference to local anaesthesia method - CS or CS+DV.

    <textblock>
      Achieving local anaesthesia in children is one of the critical aspects of pain management.

      In recent years, several innovative dental appliances have been developed on the concept to
      reduce the pain of needle injection by applying pressure, vibration, microoscillations or a
      combination of them.

      Тhe aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of DentalVibe (DV) in reducing
      injection pain and anxiety associated with local anaesthesia in paediatric patients.

      The clinical trial is a randomized split-mouth assignment. Included patients are healthy
      positive children 8-12 years old requiring local anesthetic infiltration for extraction of
      two primary maxillary molars bilaterally.

      Eligible patients undergo two single-visit treatments after CFSS-DS measurement of dental
      fear prior to each. Local anaethetic is delivered through buccal infiltration with
      conventional syringe, where as DentalVibe Comfort System Injection is allocated to either
      first or second local anaesthesia procedure. Primary outcome measure will be pain felt during
      injection, reported by patient on visual analogue scale. Secondary outcome measures:
      self-reported anxiety during injection on Facial Image Scale; pain-related behavior according
      to FLACC scale; heart-rate dynamics; patient preference to local anaesthesia method -
      traditional infiltration or DentalVibe-assisted injection.

    <measure>Pain felt during injection using visual analogue scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after local anaesthetic delivery</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported pain by the patient immediately after local anaesthesia infiltration using a VAS (visual analogue scale), containing a combination of Numeric Rating Scale (0-10, where 0 means no pain, 10 - worst possible pain) and Wong-Baker Faces Pain Scale, including pictures of facial expressions with correlating numbers of 0-10 (0 being 'no hurt' and 10 being 'hurts worst'). The combination allows children to pick a facial expression, that corresponds with their pain and see a number that matches it.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain-related behavior evaluated on the Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability Behavioral Pain Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>During local anaesthesia procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluated by the outcomes assessor. The FLACC scale has five criteria - Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability, which are each assigned a score of 0, 1 or 2. Total score of scale is summed in range 0 to 10, where: 0=relaxed and comfortable; 1-3=mild discomfort; 4-6=moderate pain; 7-10=severe pain.</description>

    <measure>Self-reported anxiety during injection evaluated on FIS</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after local anaesthetic delivery</time_frame>
    <description>The Facial Image Scale (FIS) comprises a row of five faces from very unhappy (score 5) to very happy (score 1).</description>

    <time_frame>Start: in the waiting room, at least 5 minutes before local anaesthesia procedure. End: at least 5 minutes after treatment.</time_frame>

    <measure>Assessment of self-reported dental fear on CFSS-DS questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to each visit</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment will be performed prior to both visits. The Children's Fear Survey Schedule - Dental Subscale (CFSS-DS) questionnaire consists of 15 items related to different aspects of dental treatment, including fear of injections, scored as follows: Not afraid = 1; a little afraid = 2; fairly afraid = 3; quite afraid = 4; and very afraid = 5. Total score: 15 to 75. Children with CFSS-DS ≥32 are defined as dentally anxious.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient preference to local anaesthesia method</measure>
    <time_frame>One week after second procedure</time_frame>
    <description>One week after the second dental visit, the patient is reached by a phone call and asked: &quot;Which method do you prefer to put your tooth to sleep? With the vibrating device or without it?&quot;</description>
