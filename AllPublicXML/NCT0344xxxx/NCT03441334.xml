    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 5 individuals post-stroke to examine the feasibility and efficacy of a
      high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with body weight
      supported treadmill training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to examine the feasibility and efficacy of 5Hz repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to bilateral motor areas as an adjuvant
      intervention to task-specific body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) in individuals
      with subacute stroke.

      Five individuals with a diagnosis of subacute stroke will be recruited and assigned to either
      high frequency or sham rTMS group.Both groups will receive a comprehensive assessment of
      their motor function, gait performance and neurophysiological function before the training.
      Both groups will then go through a 10 week (24 sessions) of gait training with body weight
      supported treadmill. For the high frequency rTMS group, they will receive 5 Hz rTMS applied
      to bilateral motor areas prior to each gait training session. For the sham rTMS group, they
      will receive a sham stimulation prior to the gait training sessions. All participants will
      receive another comprehensive assessment after the training concludes. The assessor will be
      blinded to the intervention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in walking speed</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's regular and fast walking speeds (in m/s) will be measured using GaitRite. A faster walking speed indicates a better gait performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measure using Stroke Impact Scale (SIS). The SIS is a paper and pencil questionnaire consisting 59 items grouped into 8 domains. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale; a higher item score indicates a lower level of difficulty experienced with the item. Item scores are averaged and transformed into domain scores ranging from 0 to 100. A higher domain score indicates a lower level of difficulty. The SIS is well-validated in stroke.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in motor function</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Motor function will be quantified using Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment is well-validated in stroke and has a total score ranging from 0 to 100. A higher total score suggests a better level of motor function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in cortical excitability</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cortical excitability will be measured using single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. Excitability will be quantified using motor evoked potential amplitude (in mV). A higher motor evoked potential amplitude indicates a greater level of excitability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in walking endurance</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Walking endurance will be measured using Six Minute Walk Test and measured in meters. A higher score in the 6 minute walk test (in meters) indicates a better walking endurance.</description>

    <description>The High Frequency rTMS group will receive real repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in 5Hz at 90% of resting motor threshold delivered to the bilateral motor areas via a figure of 8 air-filmed coil. The stimulation is structured as 24 10-second trains with a inter-train interval of 30 second.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The Sham rTMS group will receive the same protocol but delivered via a sham coil which generates the same auditory and cutaneous feedback as the real stimulation. However, there will be no active stimulation.</description>

    <description>Participants in the intervention group will receive 1200 stimuli at the intensity of 90% of resting motor threshold via an air-filmed coil placed on the vertex. The stimulation will be delivered across 24 sessions (in 10 weeks). Right after each session, participants will receive a 45-minute structured body weight supported treadmill training.</description>
