  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In general, men and women experience differing degrees of age-related decreases in physical
      function, with women having a greater prevalence of functional limitations and disability. A
      key predictor of this decrease in functional capacity is the reduction in leg muscle maximal
      power (product of force and velocity), which can be improved with exercise training. However,
      the development of exercise interventions to optimally improve skeletal muscle function in
      older adults has been difficult, in part because we now know that men and women respond
      differently to the same exercise training stimulus. In fact, the fundamental mechanisms by
      which habitual exercise improves physical function in older adults are still not well
      understood. The proposed studies are designed to address these knowledge gaps by examining
      the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the response to two distinct exercise
      training paradigms, and determining how these responses differ between older men and women.
      The investigators hypothesize that molecular, cellular and whole muscle contractile
      performance will be most improved in men by traditional low-velocity, high-load resistance
      training, and in women by high-velocity, low-load power training. Moreover, sex-specific
      structural responses in myofilament remodeling, protein expression and post-translational
      modifications will explain these sex-specific performance adaptations to each modality. To
      test these hypotheses, data will be gathered from 50 healthy, sedentary older men and women
      (65-75 years) prior to and following a 16-week unilateral exercise training program in which
      one leg undergoes resistance training and the other power training. The Specific Aims of this
      project are to identify the sex-specific effects of low-velocity resistance training versus
      high-velocity power training on: Aim 1) skeletal muscle function at the molecular, cellular
      and whole muscle levels, and Aim 2) protein expression and modification as well as size at
      the molecular and cellular levels. The within subject, unilateral intervention design
      provides a powerful model to minimize the effects of between-subject variability, and the
      translational approach will take advantage of our unique expertise with state-of-the-art
      measures from the molecular to whole body levels.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Older adult (65-75 years old) volunteers will be healthy, by self-report, and
             sedentary, defined as no formal exercise program for the year prior to evaluation and
             &lt; 2 sessions (30 min or more) of volitional exercise per week. Volunteers will be
             ambulatory without the use of walking aids and living independently in the community.
             All participants will be required to obtain a physician's consent to participate in
             the study, due to the exercise component, as is common practice in the Department of
             Kinesiology.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  - History of major neurological or neuromuscular condition that may impact physical
             function, including cerebrovascular disease, peripheral neuropathy, neurodegenerative
             disease, demyelinating disease, cerebellar or extrapyramidal disease, etc.
