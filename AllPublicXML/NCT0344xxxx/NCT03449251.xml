  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type two diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common, long term metabolic disorder characterised by
      hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose) resulting from insulin resistance and relative insulin
      insufficiency. The risk of developing insulin resistance and subsequently T2DM is increased
      by being overweight and also through a sedentary lifestyle. As the onset can be gradual,
      physiological damage may have occurred prior to diagnosis. Diabetes is associated with the
      development of microvascular complications (diabetic nephropathy, neuropathy, and
      retinopathy), and macrovascular complications (coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial
      disease, and stroke). While there are many treatments available for T2DM, these complications
      may still arise, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. There is therefore an urgent
      need to identify novel signalling pathways that may contribute to the development of diabetes
      related complications. The identification of these pathways may ultimately lead to the
      development of new therapies targeting better blood glucose control and preventing these
      subsequent complications.

      Both animal and human studies have indicated that two endogenous peptides, apelin and relaxin
      both act as vasodilators in the human cardiovascular system and could also have beneficial
      action in T2DM. Therefore, we aim to carry out experimental medicine studies to test this
      hypothesis, and explore the signalling pathway in the human vascular system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An extensive body of evidence demonstrates a direct association between T2DM and
      cardiovascular complications and mortality. Unfortunately, current therapies for diabetes
      have failed to be translated into improvements in cardiovascular outcomes, highlighting an
      urgent need to develop novel therapeutic strategies that can ultimately achieve the dual
      outcome of improving glycaemic control and improving cardiovascular function.

      While the precise cellular mechanisms involved remain to be elucidated, we hypothesise that
      the apelin and relaxin pathways meet these two criteria and therefore are potential
      therapeutic targets in conditions of abnormal glucose metabolism and heart failure.

      Apelin and relaxin are safe for parenteral use as they are naturally occurring peptide
      hormones, have a short half-life and will be rapidly cleared. They target endogenous
      receptors and post-receptor signalling, and have been used in human trials without any
      significant side effects reported.
