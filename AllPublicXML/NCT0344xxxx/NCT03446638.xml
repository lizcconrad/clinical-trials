  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, randomized, parallel group phase II study will investigate the efficacy of
      computational biology-informed treatment vs. standard of care treatment for patients with
      relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that personalized treatment informed by computational biology simulation
      technology will improve treatment outcomes for patients with relapsed or refractory MDS.

    <description>Patients randomized to this arm will receive an FDA-approved drug or combination of drugs predicted to have a therapeutic effect based on their individual MDS disease genetic profile by a computational biology simulation software program. The specific drug or combination of drugs that a patient on this arm will receive will be decided jointly by a molecular oncology board comprised of physicians, pharmacists, and nurse coordinators and the treating physician. Patients will receive a minimum of 2 months and a maximum of 4 months of treatment with the selected drug or combination of drugs.</description>

             relapsed after any duration of time from last best response or is refractory to
             induction therapy (defined as 4 cycles of treatment with a hypomethylating agent, 2
             cycles of lenalidomide, 1 cycle of low intensity chemotherapy, or 1 cycle of high
             intensity chemotherapy)

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (i.e., women who are pre-menopausal or not surgically
             sterile) may participate, provided they meet the following conditions:

               1. Must agree to use physician-approved contraceptive methods (e.g., abstinence,
                  intrauterine device, oral contraceptive, double barrier device) throughout the
                  study and for 3 months following the last dose of study treatment; and

               2. Must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to
                  beginning treatment on this trial

          -  Males with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use physician
             approved contraceptive methods (e.g., abstinence, condoms, vasectomy) throughout the
             study and should avoid conceiving children for 6 months following the last dose of
             study treatment.

             a fetus or nursing child are unknown

          -  Must not have had treatment with any anti-cancer therapy (investigational or standard)
             within the previous 21 days prior to the first dose of study drug or less than full
