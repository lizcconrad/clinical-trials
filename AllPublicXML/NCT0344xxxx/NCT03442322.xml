  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Of the 1.4 million nursing home (NH) residents in long term care facilities, more than half
      have Alzheimer's disease or dementia. Due to changes in their familiar daily routines,
      difficulty expressing their thoughts or asking for what they need, and overstimulation (such
      as noise) or under stimulation (such as lack of activity), individuals with dementia often
      display disruptive behaviors like resisting help or continually repeating the same phrases.
      Medications are often prescribed to reduce agitation and aggressive behavior; however, these
      medications may not be effective and can have a negative impact on the individual. Therefore,
      families and other stakeholders strongly advocate the use of other types of approaches that
      focus on minimizing the cause of the behavior. Two facility-based methodologies include the
      transdisciplinary approach for integrated dementia care, which combines the expertise of all
      NH staff, who work together to build a common language and approach for each resident, and
      the multidisciplinary approach for problem-based dementia care, in which each staff member
      conducts individual assessments and makes discipline-specific recommendations. While prior
      research suggests that both of these facility-based approaches are useful, the circumstances
      under which each approach is most effective are not clear. This project will prospectively
      randomize 80 nursing homes to one of the two treatment arms to compare the effect of the
      transdisciplinary approach versus the multidisciplinary approach.

      This study will examine the difference between the two comparators with respect to facility
      rates of medications dispensed to residents with dementia, leading to enhanced quality of
      life for the resident.

      This project is important because it will address a key clinical dilemma NH staff face as
      they strive to optimize the use of alternative approaches to reduce disruptive behaviors in
      residents with dementia. Transforming the quality of dementia care in NHs and enhancing the
      quality of life of residents with dementia are high priorities for families and other
      advocates.

          -  each serve &gt;60 long-term care residents with Alzheimer's or dementia

          -  meet Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services' minimum requirements for NHs (e.g.,
             meeting the mandated number of hours of staff training on dementia care, performing
             regularly scheduled resident assessments).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Facilities will be excluded if they have

          -  less than 60 long-stay residents

          -  an existing formal dementia care program in place

          -  an off-label psychotropic medication reduction program

          -  is located in a state that requires more than the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid
             Services' minimum for staff training requirements on the topic of dementia care
