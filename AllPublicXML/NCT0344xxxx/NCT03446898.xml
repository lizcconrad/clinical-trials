  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This ambispective cohort study aims to evaluate the effect of high altitudes environment on
      human's physiological and metabolic markers, specific markers of main human systems, and
      incidence rate and severity of chronic mountain sickness (CMS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Qinghai-Tibet plateau is a high altitudes area with average 3,000-5,000 meters height in
      China. As the partial pressure of oxygen in inspired air falls with increasing terrestrial
      elevation above sea level, many physiological variables in human body could be affected by
      this hypobaric hypoxic environment. Up to date, there are no large scale clinical trials
      assessing these changes in chinese population. The study here would like to provide the
      newest medical information on the changes of physiological variables and correlation between
      specific risk factors in chinese adults living at high altitudes for work purpose.
