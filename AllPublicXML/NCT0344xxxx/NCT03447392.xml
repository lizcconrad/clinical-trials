  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although interventions combining patient education and postdischarge management have
      demonstrated benefits in patients with chronic heart failure, the benefit attributable to
      patient education alone is not known. The investigators hypothesized that a patient discharge
      education program would improve clinical outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure.
