      The study was aimed to assess the effects of open thoracic paravertebral block on
      postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing open pulmonary lobectomy under general
      anesthesia. Then, A total of 90 patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)
      scores of Ⅰ or Ⅱ, scheduled for open pulmonary lobectomy under propofol - remifentanil total
      intravenous anaesthesia, were randomly divided into PCIA group (group G), Ultrasound-guided
      TPVB combined with PCIA group (group U), and open TPVB combined with PCIA group (group
      E).Finally, the study find that Open TPVB can provided satisfactory analgesia for patients
      undergoing open pulmonary lobectomy under general anesthesia, and the analgesia efficacy was
      equivalent to the TPVB under ultrasound guidance,which should be popularized.

      Purpose: The study was aimed to assess the effects of open thoracic paravertebral block on
      postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing open pulmonary lobectomy under general
      anesthesia.

      Methods: A total of 90 patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores of Ⅰ
      or Ⅱ, scheduled for open pulmonary lobectomy under propofol - remifentanil total intravenous
      anaesthesia, were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 30 each) by using a random number
      table: PCIA group (group G), Ultrasound-guided TPVB combined with PCIA group (group U), and
      open TPVB combined with PCIA group (group E). In group G, patients were received PCIA after
      the surgery. In group U, TPVB was performed on the operated side under ultrasound guidance
      with 0.25% ropivacaine 30 ml combined with the PCIA after the surgery. In group E, the TPVB
      was performed under the direct vision with 0.25% ropivacaine 30 ml combined with the PCIA.
      The Visual Analogue Score (VAS) at rest and during coughing, the sensory nerve block segment,
      as well as the respiratory rate were measured and recorded at different time-points.
      Furthermore, the hemodynamic vital signs at different time - points, the number of
      successfully delivered doses 48 h after the surgery, as well as the incidence of
      postoperative complications were also recorded and analyzed.
