    <textblock>
      obstetric hemorrhage remains one of the major causes of maternal death in both developed and
      developing countries. Because of its importance as a leading cause of maternal mortality and
      morbidity, and because of evidence of substandard care in the majority of fatal cases,
      obstetric hemorrhage must be considered as a priority topic for national guideline
      development.

      Some obstetricians believe that the cervix of women at non-labor cesarean section is
      undilated and might cause obstruction of blood or lochia drainage, leading to postpartum
      hemorrhage and endometritis from the collection of lochia or debris. Dilatation of the cervix
      helps with the drainage of blood during postpartum, reducing intrauterine infection or the
      risk of postpartum hemorrhage. To avoid this problem, some obstetricians routinely dilate the
      cervix from above during an elective/ non-labor cesarean section using finger, sponge forceps
      or other instruments

      Obstetric hemorrhage remains one of the major causes of maternal death in both developed and
      developing countries. Because of its importance as a leading cause of maternal mortality and
      morbidity, and because of evidence of substandard care in the majority of fatal cases,
      obstetric hemorrhage must be considered as a priority topic for national guideline
      development. Obstetric hemorrhage encompasses both antepartum and postpartum bleeding (Penney
      and Brace, 2007). The direct pregnancy-related maternal mortality rate in the United States
      is approximately 7-10 women per 100,000 live births. National statistics suggest that
      approximately 8% of these deaths are caused by Post Partum Hemorrhage (PPH) (Berg et al.,
      1996). In industrialized countries, PPH usually ranks in the top 3 causes of maternal
      mortality, along with embolism and hypertension. In the developing world, several countries
      have maternal mortality rates in excess of 1000 women per 100,000 live births, and World
      Health Organization statistics suggest that 25% of maternal deaths are due to PPH, accounting
      for more than 100,000 maternal deaths per year (Abouzahr, 1998). The most recent Practice
      Bulletin from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists places the estimate at
      140,000 maternal deaths per year or 1 woman every 4 minutes. The rate of PPH increased from
      1.5% in 1999 to 4.1% in 2009, and the rate of atonic PPH rose from 1% in 1999 to 3.4% in 2009
      (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2006). In the triennium 2006-2008, 261
      women in the UK died directly or indirectly related to pregnancy. The overall maternal
      mortality rate was 11.39 per 100,000 maternities. Direct deaths decreased from 6.24 per
      100,000 maternities in 2003-2005 to 4.67 per 100,000 maternities in 2006-2008 (p = 0.02). The
      number of deaths from postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) has halved to ﬁve. (Centre for Maternal and
      Child Enquiries (CMACE). In many countries caesarean section (CS) has become the mode of
      delivery in over a quarter of all births. It is the most commonly performed operation in
      obstetrics (Meikle and Steiner 2005). Infectious morbidity is the most frequent complication
      of caesarean delivery. Of women who have caesareans, 5-24% have clinically significant
      fevers; and 6-21% are diagnosed with uterine infections (endomyometritis or endometritis), 1-
      5% with more extensive pelvic infections including abscesses and 2-9% with breakdown of the
      surgical incision, most often caused by wound infection (Ramsey and White 2005). Strategies
      to minimize postoperative infectious and other morbidities have included modifications of
      surgical technique, changing of gloves, methods of placental delivery and altering the
      uterine position during repair of the uterine incision. However, none of these studies have
      evaluated the dilatation of the cervix during elective CS (Dodd 2008). The practice of
      routine cervical dilatation at elective cesarean section is performed by some surgeons to
      facilitate discharge of lochia from a uterus that was not in labor in the immediate post
      -operative period (Nagele 1996). A mechanical dilatation of the cervix at caesarean section
      is deﬁned as an artiﬁcial dilatation of the cervix performed by ﬁnger, sponge forceps or
      other instruments at non labor caesarean section.An important concern when dilating the
      cervix in a non -labor uterus is the theoretical risk of ascending infection to the uterus
      from the vagina, abdominal cavity and abdominal incision (Hofmeyr 1995). In addition,
      cervical dilatation may be associated with the creation of a false passage or hemorrhage from
      cervical injury. However, an undilated cervix may prevent discharge of lochia following
      elective CS with retention of lochia, a potential culture medium for bacteria, which can
      cause puerperal genital tract infection. Some published data from developed countries have
      suggested that there is no difference in outcome between a practice of routine cervical
      dilatation or none dilatation at elective cesarean section (Ahmed 2005). Ian Donald thought
      it was 'a wise practice' to pass a dilator from inside the uterus (Donald 1979), but Munro
      Kerr's view was thus: 'It has never been my practice to pass a dilator through the cervix
      after abdominal delivery'. Dickinson mentioned dilation of the cervix using ring forceps
      (Dickinson 1999). Turnbull's Obstetrics mentions using an extra glove on the left hand to
      dilate the cervix (Hofmeyr 1995). The information currently available about the advantages of
      cervical dilatation at caesarean section is inconclusive. Therefore, evidence to support the
      effectiveness or safety of cervical dilatation at caesarean section is needed (Cochrane
      2011).

Blood from the uterine incision, soaked towels and blood in suction bottle before placental delivery will not be added to the blood measurements.
