  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate whether children with Down syndrome and children with
      typical development exhibit different levels of accuracy demonstrating novel verbs taught
      under three conditions: semantic cues (perform action), syntactic cues (sentence frame), and
      combined (syntactic and semantic cues). The participants complete an eligibility evaluation
      and then one verb learning session (approximately 60 minutes in length). During that verb
      learning session they are taught sets of words under each condition (i.e., within-subjects
      design) and then asked to identify and label those target words immediately after
      instruction.

    <description>The examiner labels each target word and performs the corresponding action six times in each condition. She elicits the target word from the participant two times per word per condition and provides feedback on accuracy each time. In the semantic cues condition, the examiner prompts the child to perform the target action twice. In the syntactic cues condition, instead of only saying the target word with the present progressive verb marker, the examiner uses two forms of complete sentences while performing the action (i.e., &quot;I am X-ing,&quot; and &quot;See. I X.&quot;). In the combined condition, the examiner prompts the child to perform the target action and consistently uses complete sentences.</description>

    <description>Verb Learning Session Teaching phase. The examiner labels each target word and performs the action 6 times in each condition. She elicits the target word from the participant 2 times per word per condition and provides feedback on accuracy.
Testing phase. Receptive probes are administered after every 2 words are taught. Expressive probes are at the end of the condition. For receptive probes, the examiner asks the participant to identify novel verbs and for expressive probes, the examiner asks the child to label the novel action. Testing after 2 items is designed to decrease memory load. Participants have a brief break between conditions.
Data are collected on: a) child responses on standardized assessments, (b) responses to verb learning probes, (c) parent responses to intake form, and (d) relevant medical history from electronic medical record.
None of the above procedures present more than minimal risk to participants or research staff. Vanderbilt IRB approved all procedures.</description>
