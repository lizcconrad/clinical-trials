    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot before and after interventional study is to determine if early
      intervention and provision of menus regarding appropriate diet choices for melphalan
      autologous transplant patients experiencing nausea and diarrhea will improve nutrition status
      and overall calorie and protein intake throughout the transplant process.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients undergoing melphalan autologous transplants will be included in this study

          -  All patients that will be included in this pilot before and after interventional study
             will be inpatient on floors 5900, 6900 or 8900 of Barnes-Jewish Hospital

          -  Per hospital protocol, all patients who will receive a melphalan autologous transplant
             will be admitted and remain inpatient for the duration of the transplant process.
             There will be no exclusion for dietary restrictions or food allergies as the
             foodservice provided to patients is room service, all food allergies are noted and
             suitable alternatives are provided as a standard of service.

          -  Once a patient has been determined to meet criteria for the study, they will be
             approached by a member of the research team between day -2 and day 0 of transplant for
             consent. Patients must consent for the study by day +1 of transplant to be enrolled.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients &lt;18 years of age

          -  Pregnant women

          -  Prisoners
