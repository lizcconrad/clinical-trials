  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The evolution of the health care system in Western countries has increased the scope of the
      tasks assigned to doctors in their daily lives. The burden of administrative tasks and the
      use of IT tools reduce the time spent with the patient. Indeed, in a very recent work
      published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, Sinsky et al. showed that in 4 different
      specialties (general medicine, internal medicine, cardiology and orthopaedics) for every hour
      spent in front of a patient, each physician spent two hours on tasks in the absence of the
      patient1. This distribution of time was found in the Wenger et al. study in 36 internal
      medicine interns, since a ratio of 1:3 between the working time spent in the presence of the
      patient (1.7 hours) and that spent in front of a computer (5.2 hours) was noted2.

      The reduction in the clinical time devoted directly to the patient is a major source of
      dissatisfaction for physicians, which can even extend to burnout3. Moreover, it has been
      shown that the importance of computer tasks in everyday life is correlated with the
      occurrence of burnout4. Finally, beyond these clinical times directly or indirectly linked to
      patient care, the time spent on other tasks (administrative, travel time between different
      sites,...) appears to be significant (20% in Sinsky et al.)1.

      The anesthesiologist faces the same constraints as other specialties, but no work has been
      specifically concerned with the distribution of time spent on the different tasks. Compared
      to other specialties, anesthesiologist is also regularly confronted with specific
      organisational tasks within the operating room that could reduce the time spent directly with
      patients.

      The objective of this work is to determine the division of the different tasks in a
      anesthesiologist's work day by analysing the time spent directly with the patient but also
      that allocated to his or her care outside of his or her presence, as well as that devoted to
      organizational or administrative tasks.
