    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, single-dose study will be conducted in adult male and female subjects (N = 16)
      who are in general good health and selected for participation in the study according to the
      selection criteria. This study will assess the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of
      PT2977 Tablets. The study will consist of two periods and will be conducted in a crossover
      fashion.

      Subjects will be randomized in equal numbers to two sequences of meal conditions (fasting and
      non-fasting). Serial blood samples will be collected after dose administration in each
      period. Subjects will be confined at the clinical research for a portion of each period.
