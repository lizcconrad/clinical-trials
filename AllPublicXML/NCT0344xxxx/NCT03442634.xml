      this study helps us to compare and evaluate prospectively the benefits and safety of early
      hydration on bowel movement after cesarean section it includes two groups, a control group
      and a study group. the study group will get 200 ml of sugar free water within 1 hour after cs
      while the control group will get 200 ml of sugar free water 6 hours after cs

      Traditionally, patients are not given fluids or food after cesarean sections until bowel
      function returns as evidenced by bowel sounds, passage of stool or flatus since , uneventful
      (uncomplicated) cesarean sections have no effect on intestinal functions and with putting in
      minds the need of the mother for early hydration , movement , breast feeding and early
      discharge; that is why we are investigating the effectiveness and safety of early oral
      hydration after cesarean sections
