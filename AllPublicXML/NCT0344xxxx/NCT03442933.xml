  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The two most important problems of the musculoskeletal system in cyclists are low back pain
      (60%) and knee pain (33%). There is no clear hypothesis about the development of low back
      pain in cyclists, but several authors agree that it may be due to the maintenance of a
      maintained posture, with the lumbar spine in inversion and the characteristics associated
      with this sport (long duration, static posture, high intensities), so it is recommended a
      preparation of the musculature (strength-endurance work) and exercises to improve the
      postural scheme in the cyclist.

      The project proposes to analyze the acute effect of a long-lasting bicycle trip (3 hours) on
      the muscles involved in low back and knee pain, see, lumbar paravertebral, quadriceps and
      hamstrings, by means of tensiomyography (TMG).

      The participation in the study requires only 2 assistances to the data takings that will be
      developed in the training laboratory of the Faculty of Sciences of Physical Activity and
      Sport of the European University. Said sessions will begin with an initial assessment, which
      will be carried out: an anthropometric assessment (height and weight), evaluation of pain
      tests with the EVA scale, the threshold of pain pressure and a questionnaire, muscle
      assessment with the tension monitor, a non-invasive tool that allows us to evaluate the
      contractile properties of superficial muscles through an isometric contraction induced by
      electrostimulation, and the assessment of mobility of the lumbar spine.

      Once the initial assessment is completed, the participants will perform a brief 8-minute
      cycle ergometer warm-up, repeat the initial assessments once again and make a bicycle trip
      through a previously programmed route lasting approximately 3 hours. Upon return, the
      participants will return to all previous assessments.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>It is a variable derived from the tensiomiographic assessment. Measured in millimeters (mm). Higher values represent a lower muscle stiffness, and lower values represent higher muscle stiffness of the examined muscle.</description>
