  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the utility of different chlorhexidine mouthwash concentrations on ICU
      patients to decolonize their oral cavities from gram-negative bacteria, since this is a
      non-desirable condition that leads to higher mortality rates and longer hospitalization
      times. One group will receive the 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthwash and the other group will
      receive the 2% chlorhexidine mouthwash.
