  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neck pain which is common musculoskeletal system problem in all populations, negatively
      affects functional status and quality of life. Muscle spasms, postural problems in cervical
      and thoracic regions and impairment on respiratory parameters (respiratory functions and
      respiratory muscle strength) is seen with neck pain. Manual therapy and exercise are widely
      preferred in the treatment of neck pain for improve pain, posture, muscle strength, range of
      motion, functional status and quality of life.

      There are some studies showing that manual therapy improves respiratory parameters in
      pulmonary diseases but studies are lacking for neck pain. Our aim is to indicate that effects
      of manual therapy, manual therapy for different regions (cervical and/or thoracal region) and
      exercises for pain, posture, quality of life and also respiratory parameters in patients with
      chronic neck pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Manual therapy and exercises are evidence-based methods for improving pain, muscle strength,
      range of motion, function and quality of life in individuals with neck pain. These
      physiotherapy approaches have been shown to improve respiratory functions in patients with
      neck pain and also in pulmonary diseases such as cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive
      pulmonary diseases.

      Studies show that to improve respiratory parameters in patients for chronic neck pain,
      mobilization of thoracic region and exercises for endurance of deep neck muscles are
      beneficial. Despite the proposal given in this study, there are few studies evaluating the
      relationship between respiratory functions and the strength of respiratory muscles in
      patients with neck pain in detail, and also the effectiveness of different
      physiotherapy-rehabilitation methods on respiratory functions on neck pain. In a single study
      on this subject, thoracic region manual therapy, stretching exercise program and both of
      these applications were applied for the subjects. At the end of the treatment, respiratory
      functions developed in all three groups; but both applications group have been shown to more
      effective than thoracic manual therapy group for increasing respiratory functions.Exercises
      and manual therapy for cervical and/or thoracic region frequently used for chronic neck pain
      but there are no studies that compare manual therapy for different region on respiratory
      parameters. Therefore, our aim is to determine the effects of exercises with manual therapy
      methods for cervical and/or thoracic region in chronic neck pain patients on pain, posture,
      quality of life, as well as on respiratory parameters.

    <description>The measurements were performed from a crook lying position with a pressure biofeedback device (Stabilizer, Chattanooga, USA), which was placed behind participants' neck. The device was initially inflated to a baseline pressure of 20 mmHg. The participants had to successively perform 3 10-s holds of a head nodding action at each of the 5 pressure levels (22 mmHg, 24 mmHg, 26 mmHg, 28 mmHg and 30 mmHg). Participants' deep neck flexors were considered fatigued when pressure decrease at the pressure sensor, apparent activation of the superficial neck flexors or a jerky action during holding of the pressure level were observed.</description>
