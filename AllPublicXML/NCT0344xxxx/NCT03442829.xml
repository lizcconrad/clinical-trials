  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the impact of repeated sweet breakfast consumption versus repeated
      non-sweet breakfast consumption on subsequent sweet and non-sweet food preferences and
      intakes
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized to receive either sweet or non-sweet breakfasts for three
      consecutive weeks, and impacts on food preferences and intakes will be assessed at baseline,
      after 1 week, and after three weeks. Preferences for sweet and non-sweet foods will be
      assessed during two taste tests at each assessment time, where six different foods will be
      rated. Sweet and non-sweet food consumption will also be measured at two meals at each
      assessment time - breakfast and lunch. Identical buffet meals composed of sweet and non-sweet
      foods suitable for consumption at breakfast and lunch will be provided ad-libitum.
