  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was performed in patients aged 6-18 years after the Ravitch procedure and
      thoracotomy. The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pain
      control provided by the multimodal approach that involves the continuous infusion ropivacaine
      with fentanyl vs. bupivacaine with fentanyl through thoracic epidural catheter. Secondary
      aims were to identify the determinants of acute post-operative pain at rest, during deep
      breathing and coughing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects were randomized to the Ropivacaine/Fentanyl (RF) or Bupivacaine/Fentanyl (BF)
      group.

      To perform a thoracic surgical procedure, all patients were premedicated with midazolam, and
      then, paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, fentanyl, propofol, pancuronium or
      rocuronium (in children &lt; 10 years old) and suprane were used to introduce and maintain the
      anesthesia. Thoracic epidural catheters were placed following induction of anesthesia and
      endotracheal intubation.

      Intraoperative analgesia was introduced by a single dose of lidocaine 2% (2 mg/kg). Then
      after 15 minutes, the patients from the RF group received ropivacaine 1% (1-3 mg/kg) and
      those from the BF group bupivacaine 0.5% (0.5-1 mg/kg). After 60 minutes 0.2% ropivacaine
      solution with fentanyl or 0.125% solution of bupivacaine with fentanyl was infused with the
      flow rate of 0.1 ml/kg/hr.

      Depending on the allocation to the group, postoperative analgesia was continued either with
      0.2% ropivacaine and fentanyl or 0.125% bupivacaine and fentanyl, based on the concentration
      and the flow rate described above. In addition, intravenous paracetamol was administered as
      standard every 6 hours (the maximum of 60 mg/kg daily) along with non steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs. In children &gt; 14 years of age, ketoprofen was injected at the dose
      of 1 mg/kg (the maximum of 200 mg daily) and in younger children ibuprofen (orally or
      rectally, up to 30 mg/kg daily) every 8 hours. Metamizol was given as a &quot;rescue drug&quot; (20
      mg/kg).
