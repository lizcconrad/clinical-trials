    <textblock>
      Introduction: Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is an important health condition of the population and
      its prevalence continues to grow due to population aging, economic development and
      urbanization. The exercise is an important factor of prevention and control, thereby
      decreasing the risk of metabolic diseases, cardiovascular diseases and improving the
      functionality of the patient with diabetes.

      Objective: Evaluate the response of resistance training associated with whole-body vibration
      on peripheral circulation and functional performance of elderly with type 2 diabetes.

      Methods: This is a clinical trial study, controlled, randomized and blinded, which will
      follow the guidelines established by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
      (CONSORT). Patients will be recruited in the light of the eligibility criteria and randomly
      divided into 3 groups: resistance training associated with whole body vibration (G1),
      resistance training associated with vibration sham (G2) and control group-guidelines about
      foot care (GC), establishing 36 treatment sessions, three times a week for the G1 and G2.

    <description>The workout will be held three times a week and will last a total of 12 weeks (3 months) for 45 minutes, where there will be 5 minutes of heating, 19 minutes of exercise with load, 16 minutes of vibration &quot;sham&quot; and 5 minutes of slowdown. The vibration sham; will be held with the disconnected platform. A device will be connected producing a noise similar to the sound of the connected platform for a time equivalent to the treatment protocol, since it will not be possible to distinguishing noticeably stimulate vibrator. Participants that will undergo false vibration will not have contact with those who carry out the real treatment.</description>
