  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The prognosis of patients with rare cancers in general and sarcomas in particular suffers
      from delay in diagnosis. Routes to diagnosis for sarcoma need to be quicker and more
      streamlined, but have neither been studied in detail in larger numbers before, nor in a
      direct comparison between two countries with different health systems. Comprehensive
      assessment of diagnostic delays and its determinants, including demographic, clinical,
      psychosocial and health care system factors, is necessary to improve referral pathways and
      come to best practice and patient reported outcomes for sarcoma patients.

      Research questions to be answered:

      This study aims to quantify diagnostic delay (including patient, general practitioner and
      system delay) and evaluates routes to diagnosis and referral to sarcoma expert centres in the
      Netherlands and England; to comprehensively evaluate risk factors of diagnostic delay;
      determine the association between diagnostic delay and outcomes (health-related quality of
      life, quality-adjusted life years, patient satisfaction, TNM classification, time to
      local/distant relapse and overall survival); and to assess differences between both
      countries. This should lead to advices about faster referral where possible.

      The researchers will conduct a longitudinal cohort study among all sarcoma patients (≥18
      years of age) that will be newly diagnosed in 1.5 years period from October 1st 2017 to March
      30st 2019 in one of the participating study centers (5 centers in The Netherlands, 3 centers
      in England).

      Patients will be invited before the start of treatment (with a two months eligibility window)
      and receive a questionnaire on diagnostic delay, risk factors and patient-reported outcomes.
      The questionnaire on patient-reported outcomes will be completed again 3 months, 6 months,
      1-year and 2 years later.

      Data collection will be done within PROFILES, an international registry for cancer patient
      reported outcomes (www.profilesregistry.nl). Clinical data will be collected through cancer
      registries and the junior investigator will collect extra data from patients' records.
