  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous literature has found potential association between selenium deficiency and
      inactivated glutathione peroxidase and deiodinase, which may contribute to subsequent
      elevation of T4 and ratio of T4/T3. Conduction of a case-control study (ID: Liuyanping3) has
      been applied on Clinicaltrials.gov to further elucidate effect of selenium deficiency on
      thyroid function. Based on its data, the investigators will perform a randomized,
      placebo-controlled,single-blinded crossover study on 20 participants with selenium deficiency
      to verify health consequence of selenium.
