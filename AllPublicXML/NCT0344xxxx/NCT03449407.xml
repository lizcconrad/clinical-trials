  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are commonly reported as source of distress, disability
      and mortality in schizophrenia. Despite proven efficacy of antipsychotics, many patients
      still experience drug-refractory AVH. It has been postulated that AVH is maintained by
      negative emotions. Yet, little is known about the temporal relationship and underlying
      mechanisms between negative affect and AVH. Utilizing both an ecologically-validated method
      and brain imaging technique, this study aims to uncover the role of emotions in the
      maintenance of psychotic symptoms.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychotic symptomatology as measured by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Scale of Assessment for Positive Symptoms (SAPS), and the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales (PSYRATS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) is an interview-based assessment of the severity of symptoms associated with schizophrenia, including positive, negative, and general psychopathology. Scale of Assessment for Positive Symptoms (SAPS) is an interview-based scale of positive symptoms of schizophrenia. SAPS consists of four areas: hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behaviour and positive formal thought disorder. Each area includes ratings of specific symptoms and a global rating. The Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale (PSYRATS) is a 17-item semi-structured interview measuring the severity of multiple dimensions of auditory hallucinations and delusions, including conviction and duration.</description>
