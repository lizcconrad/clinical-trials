      topical skin care product.

      Cross sectional study will utilize gene-specific candidate and genome wide association
      analysis to identify SNP's that may be associated with response to a topical product.
      Investigators and patients will be blinded to the genetic test results, and participants will
      be blinded to the skin product applied.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. At least 21 years old in general good health as determined by a health questionnaire.

          2. Willingness to cooperate and participate by following study requirements and to report
             any adverse symptoms immediately.

          3. Willingness to discontinue the use of all facial products other than the assigned test
             material and their regular brands of glamour products. The glamour products must be
             the subject's regular brand and have been used for a minimum of one month prior to the
             start of the study.

          4. Willingness to remove make up at least 30 minutes prior to each scheduled clinic
             visit. No other topical products should be applied to the face until the study visit
             has been completed.

          5. Willingness to avoid daily direct sun exposure on the face, whether natural or at
             tanning salons.

          6. Willingness to discontinue antiaging cosmetics including alpha hydroxyacid products
             (including Lachydrin©), beta hydroxyacid products (including salicylic acid), poly
             hydroxyacid products, retinol products, acetyl glucosamine or other effective
             anti-aging topical products on the face 2 weeks prior to the start of the study and
             throughout the duration of the study.

          7. Completion and signing of a Informed Consent and Enrollment form, HIPAA form, photo
             release form, medical intake, skin habits survey.

          8. Willingness to complete all study assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Individuals who currently or in the last month have regularly used certain topical or
             oral medications which, in the opinion of the Investigators, may interfere with the
             study or that may expose study participants to unacceptable risks. Such products
             include oral prescription steroids or anti-inflammatories, topical steroids, or
             prescription skin treatment except for mild acne, as determined by the investigators.

          2. Subjects who have a history of disease or current disease or regularly use topical or
             oral medications which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with the
             study or that may expose study participants to unacceptable risks. (i.e. oral or
             topical steroids or anti-inflammatories, etc.).

          3. Uncontrolled metabolic disease such as diabetes, hyperthyroidism, or hypothyroidism or
             active Hepatitis, immune deficiency, or autoimmune disease as determined by the health
             questionnaire.

          4. Pregnancy, nursing, or planning to become pregnant during the course of the study as
             determined by the health questionnaire.

          5. History of skin cancer within the past 6 months.

          6. Use of topical prescription retinoids for anti-aging including Retin-A®, Retin-A
             Micro®, Renova®, Avita®, Tazorac®, or Differin® within 2 weeks prior to the start of
             the study.

             Use of oral retinoids within 6 months of the study start.

          7. Subjects must not have had mid-depth or superficial chemical peel or other anti-aging
             procedures on the face (laser, intense pulsed light, injectable fillers
             microdermabrasion, etc.) within 2 months of the study start.

          8. Known allergies or sensitivities to test material ingredients or any topical skin care
             product (i.e., alpha hydroxyacids, retinol, sunscreens, moisturizers, cleansers,
             masques, toners, etc.).

          9. Individuals currently participating in other clinical testing.

         10. Start of hormone use (including for birth control) or changed hormones less than three
             months prior to the start of the study. Qualified subjects must not be taking hormones
             or must have been taking them for at least three months prior to the study start.
