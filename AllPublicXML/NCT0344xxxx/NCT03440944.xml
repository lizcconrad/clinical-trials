    <textblock>
      Obtaining intravenous access (IVA) is the most common procedure performed in the emergency
      department (ED). Placement of IVA allows for blood work and delivery of intravenous fluids
      and medications. The implementation of ultrasound guided peripheral IVs (UGPIV) have allowed
      for ultrasound to be used to place an IV into patients with difficult vein access (DVA). An
      alternative device to place is a midline catheter (MC). The use of MCs against UGPIV has not
      been compared in a randomized study. Aim 1: To determine if UGPIVs have a higher failure rate
      than midline catheters within 72 hours of placement. Aim 2: To collect information to perform
      a direct cost analysis of UGPIV against that of the midline catheter. Aim 3: Assess patient
      satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to determine if the midline catheter is superior to the
      ultrasound guided IV with respect to survival at 72 hours.

      Aim 1: To determine if UGPIVs have a higher failure rate than midline catheters within 72
      hours of placement. There are several reasons why UGPIVs may fail. UGPIVs are shorter than
      midline catheters, and shorter catheters may fail due to infiltration which can be a result
      of malposition as well as having the catheter pull out of the vessel. It is being
      hypothesized that by using a midline catheter with a guidewire for placement with additional
      catheter length placed into the vessel, midlines will be superior to UGP\Vs with regards to
      survival time of the catheter. The investigators will assess catheter survival daily until 72
      hours (when UGPIV are recommended to be changed). The total lifetime of the midline catheters
      will be recorded.

      Aim 2: To perform a direct cost analysis of UGPIV against that of the midline catheter. This
      study will not be large enough to complete a robust cost effectiveness analysis to compare
      UGPIV to mid line catheters. As a part of this study the investigators will collect
      information including but not limited to: the number of catheters used for IVA attempts, time
      for placement of each device complications, and need for additional IVA during
      hospitalization.

      Aim 3: For patients that remain hospitalized at 72 hours a satisfaction survey will be
      administered to determine patient experience and preference for the type of vascular access
      that they receive.
