      The post-traumatic stress state affects up to 6.2% of patients at 2 months post partum.

      Emergency cesarean section and rescue hemorrhage are identified risk factors for postpartum
      stress disorder or postpartum depression.

      These complications (emergency cesarean section and hemorrhage of delivery) alter the
      mother-child relationship and cognitive development of the child.

      The experience of an emergency Cesarean section or a haemorrhage of deliverance generates
      apprehension about a subsequent pregnancy. Some patients abandon a future pregnancy project
      for fear of reliving these experiences.

      Currently, at the southern hospital, the risk factors for developing a state of
      post-traumatic stress are not sought by the care teams. No specific follow-up is planned for
      patients who have had an emergency caesarean section or hemorrhage of delivery.

      The investigators wish to study the psychological consequences of emergency cesarean section
      and rescue haemorrhage, the risk factors for post-traumatic stress disorder after emergency
      cesarean section or hemorrhage of delivery, and their consequences on the mother-child
      relationship to better identify situations at risk of psychological trauma and provide
      appropriate care for patients (consultation with a postpartum psychologist).
