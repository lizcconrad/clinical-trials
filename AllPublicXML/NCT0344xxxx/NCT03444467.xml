  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is comparing the new medicine NNC9204-1513 with a standard therapy of glucagon
      (GlucaGen®). This is the first time NNC9204-1513 is given to humans.

      Participants will either receive NNC9204-1513 or GlucaGen® - which treatment you get is
      decided by chance (like flipping a coin). Neither the participant nor the study doctor will
      know which study medicine (NNC9204-1513 or GlucaGen®) the participant is receiving (double
      -blinding). In case of emergency, this information will be readily available.

      NNC9204-1513 is a new medicine for rescue treatment of severe low blood sugar and currently
      not available on the market (doctors cannot prescribe this medicine). The participant will
      receive two or three single injections below the skin. One injection will contain
      NNC9204-1513 or GlucaGen®. The other injection will include placebo - this is a product that
      looks like the actual study drug but without any active ingredients. If a third injection is
      given, this will contain NNC9204-1513 or placebo. NNC9204-1513 and GlucaGen® will be given
      using different devices and volumes. In order to mask these external differences, a &quot;double
      dummy&quot; approach will be used, that means when you get either of the study medicine
      (NNC9204-1513 or GlucaGen®) you will get another injection which contains no medicine called
      'placebo' (it will not have any effect on the body). Dependent on the injection volume to be
      administered, injections are given by either syringe with needle or an injection pen (NovoPen
      Echo®). The study will last for up to 39 days.
