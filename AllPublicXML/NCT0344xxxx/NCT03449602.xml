  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients who are planned to undergo a medical thoracoscopy for obtaining pleural
      biopsies will be enrolled in the study.

      One hundred subjects will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to undergo thoracoscopy to the following
      groups:

      Group A (mini-thoracoscopy) Group B (Conventional rigid thoracoscopy) Primary outcome: (a)
      diagnostic sensitivity of mini-thoracoscopy and conventional rigid thoracoscopy in the
      diagnosis of exudative pleural effusions
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A significant proportion of patients with pleural effusions remain undiagnosed after
      performance of diagnostic procedures including cytological and microbiologic analysis of the
      pleural fluid and closed pleural biopsies. In this study, the investigators plan to compare
      the yield and safety of mini-thoracoscopy and conventional rigid thoracoscopy with the larger
      diameter scope.

      This is a prospective study that will be conducted at the Thoracic Endoscopy Suite of the
      Department of Pulmonary Medicine, PGIMER, Chandigarh.

      Consecutive patients who are planned to undergo a medical thoracoscopy for obtaining pleural
      biopsies will be enrolled in the study

      One hundred subjects will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to undergo thoracoscopy. The
      randomization sequence will be generated using a computer (in blocks of 10), and the
      allocation will be placed in opaque sealed envelopes. The patients will be randomized to the
      following groups:

      Group A (mini-thoracoscopy): The mini-thoracoscope manufactured by Richard Wolf GmbH,
      Knettligen, Germany will be used. It has an outer diameter of 5.5 mm and a working channel
      diameter of 3.5 mm.

      Group B (Conventional rigid thoracoscopy): The rigid thoracoscope manufactured by Richard
      Wolf GmbH, Knettligen, Germany will be used that has an outer diameter of 10 mm and channel
      internal diameter of 5 mm.

      Primary outcome: (a) diagnostic sensitivity of mini-thoracoscopy and conventional rigid
      thoracoscopy in the diagnosis of exudative pleural effusions.
