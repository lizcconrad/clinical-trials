  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate how a high-fructose diet, either by high fructose
      intake from complex, natural foods or by fortifying the diet with corn syrup, affects the
      metabolism. Furthermore, it will be investigate if there are differences between obese and
      normal weight participants.
