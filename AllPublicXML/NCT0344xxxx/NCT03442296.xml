  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related hearing loss is highly prevalent and hearing health care is underutilized. The
      primary objective of the proposed randomized controlled trial is to investigate the efficacy
      of a community health worker (CHW)-delivered hearing loss intervention program. A preceding
      pilot study demonstrated preliminary effectiveness of the intervention program in reducing
      self-reported hearing handicap, and highlighted its acceptability among the target
      demographic. The proposed trial will now expand upon lessons learned through previous pilot
      studies and expand to other affordable residences for low-to-moderate income older adults in
      Baltimore. Primary outcome measurements will investigate intervention effects on hearing
      handicap, with secondary measurements investigating effects on domains such as social
      isolation and quality of life. This trial is a first-in-kind investigation of a novel
      community-based intervention that addresses hearing loss in a vulnerable, urban population.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>10 Item Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly Screening (HHIE-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Self reported social and emotional effect of hearing loss. Each item has three answers: &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot; and &quot;No&quot;, with &quot;Yes&quot; scoring 4, &quot;Sometimes&quot; scoring 2, and &quot;No&quot; scoring 0. An individual can score up to a maximum of 40 points (maximum handicap). A score of 0-8 indicates no handicap, 10-24 is moderate handicap, and 26 or greater signifies severe hearing handicap.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Self-reported Loneliness</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Self reported loneliness through the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale, a 20 item scale to measure loneliness and social isolation. Participants answer questions with &quot;I often feel this way&quot; (4) , &quot;I sometimes feel this way&quot; (3), &quot; I rarely feel this way&quot; (2), or &quot;I never feel this way&quot; (1). The maximum score is 80.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-reported Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between Baseline and 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported depression through the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) Patient Depression Questionnaire. The individual recalls how often, over the last two weeks, they have been bothered by problems: &quot;not at all&quot; (0), &quot;several days&quot; (1), &quot;more than half the days&quot; (2), or &quot;nearly every day&quot; (3) . The maximum score is 27. A score of 0-9 indicates none to mild depression and higher scores indicating more severe depression.</description>
