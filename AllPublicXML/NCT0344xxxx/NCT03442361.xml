      Background: Intravenous lipid emulsions (IVLE) are an essential component of parenteral
      nutrition (PN). Omega-6 reducing strategies may improve outcomes, including reduced PN
      associated liver disease.

      Objective: The primary objective was to compare serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), among
      surgical and medical patients provided with either Intralipid or Clinoleic lipid emulsions.

      Design: In this quasi-experimental study the medical records of surgical and medical adult
      patients were reviewed from 3 Canadian hospitals that received PN with either soybean oil
      (Intralipid) or predominantly olive oil (Clinoleic) based lipid emulsions for at least 7
      consecutive days.

      A few small studies have shown that a predominantly olive oil based IVLE is well tolerated
      and safe, however the clinical relevance of this IVLE is uncertain as no clear benefit in
      outcomes has been observed in small randomized clinical trials. Given the limited data
      available for the adult population reporting on the experience with olive oil based IVLE, we
      designed a quasi-experimental study to review our experience with Clinoleic compared to
      Intralipid. The primary objective was to compare the impact of Intralipid and Clinoleic IVLE
      on serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), pre-PN to after one week of PN (i.e. between day 8 to 16
      post-PN initiation), while controlling for the ordered lipid dosing. Secondary objectives
      were to assess if there were differences between the IVLEs on the remaining liver function
      tests, lipid dosing, incidence of infectious complications, length of stay in hospital and
      30- day mortality.

      This retrospective quasi-experimental chart review was conducted in 3 tertiary care hospitals
      in Calgary, AB between July 01, 2012 to June 30, 2013 and July 01, 2014 to June 30, 2015.
      Standard soybean oil-based therapy, Intralipid was the only available IVLE in Calgary, AB
      until July 2013, at which time predominantly olive oil Clinoleic was approved as an
      alternative in the hospital formulary, accounting for the dates chosen for the study. Ethics
      approval from the Conjoint Health Research and Ethics Board at the University of Calgary was
      obtained prior to the initiation of the study.
