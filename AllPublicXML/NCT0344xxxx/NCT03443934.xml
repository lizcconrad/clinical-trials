  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver cirrhosis is a chronic disease characterized by a progressive accumulation of fibrosis,
      loss of liver function and portal hypertension leading to several hemodynamic changes.The
      exact pathophysiological mechanisms causing the hyperdynamic alterations in cirrhosis are not
      fully elucidated.

      Aim:

      The aim of the study is to assess hemodynamic alterations in liver cirrhosis by non-invasive
      MRI and echocardiography compared to portal hypertension measured with liver vein
      catheterization (HVPG, hepatic vein pressure gradient). Furthermore, the aim is to explore
      hemodynamic differences between cirrhotic patients and healthy subjects.

      Study design and cohort:

      The study has a cross-sectional design and a cohort with 54 patients with liver cirrhosis -
      with and without complications and 18 healthy volunteers. The patients are recruited at the
      Gastrounit Hvidovre University Hospital.

      The day before the first visit patients are hospitalized and fasting overnight. At first
      visit liver vein catheterization (LVC) and echocardiography are performed. Second visit must
      be performed within 4 weeks after first visit. At the second visit patients are fasting
      minimum 6 hours before having MR-flow scanning, cardiac-MR and MR-Elastography (MR-E).

      The healthy volunteers are only offered MR-flow scanning, cardiac MR and MR-E as well as
      urine- and blood tests
