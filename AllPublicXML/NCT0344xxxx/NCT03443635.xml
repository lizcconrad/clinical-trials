  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cooking for Health Optimization with Patients (CHOP) is the first known multi-site
      prospective cohort study with a nested Bayesian adaptive randomized trial in the preventive
      cardiology field of culinary medicine. It is also the first known longitudinal study to
      assess the impact of hands-on cooking and nutrition education on patient outcomes, with those
      classes taught by medical students and other future and current medical professionals who
      have first been trained in those classes on how to integrate diet and lifestyle counseling of
      patients with their respective scopes of clinical practice. CHOP is the primary research
      study of the world's first known medical school based teaching kitchen, The Goldring Center
      for Culinary Medicine at Tulane University School of Medicine. Medical trainees and
      professionals are followed in this study long-term to understand how the classes impact their
      competencies in patient counseling, attitudes about the counseling, and their own diets.
      Patients who consent to being randomized to these classes compared to standard of care are
      studied within the nested Bayesian adaptive randomized trial to understand how the classes
      impact their health outcomes, clinical and food costs, and the costs of health systems caring
      for these patient populations. CHOP is designed as a pragmatic population health trial to
      hopefully improve healthcare effectiveness, equity, and cost by establishing an
      evidence-based, scalable, sustainable model of healthcare intervention targeting the social
      determinants of health, while complementing the pharmacological and/or surgical management of
      patients.
