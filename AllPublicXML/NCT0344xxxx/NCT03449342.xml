      This study will test the well-known medicine turoctocog alfa for any side effects. The
      purpose is to test turoctocog alfa for any side effects in the Indian population. The
      participants will get turoctocog alfa. Turoctocog alfa is already a well-known medicine in
      India, and can be prescribed by the study doctor. The participants will get an injection
      every second day or 3 times per week. This is decided by the study doctor. The study doctor
      will decide the amount and how often the participants must take the medicine. The study will
      last for about 16 weeks. The participants will have 5 visits with the study doctor. If the
      participants agree to participate in this study, the participants will receive the first
      injection at the second visit, thereafter the participants will be trained to do the
      injection by themself.
