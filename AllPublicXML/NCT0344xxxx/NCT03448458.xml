  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well gallium Ga 68-DOTATATE positron emission
      tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) works in treating patients with castration
      resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other placed in the body. Gallium Ga 68-DOTATATE
      PET/CT may help doctors to identify those patients with early neuroendocrine
      transdifferentiation and who are at greater risk for poor outcomes.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      Establish the feasibility of using gallium Ga 68-DOTATATE (68Ga-DOTATATE) PET as a predictive
      imaging biomarker for neuroendocrine transdifferentiation in prostate cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      Correlate progression of disease with degree of uptake on 68Ga-DOTATATE PET examination.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gallium Ga 68-DOTATATE intravenously (IV). Within 55-70 minutes, patients
      undergo PET/CT.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for at least 1 year.

    <description>Will be summarized using descriptive statistics. The inter-rater agreement will be assessed by Kappa statistics or intra-class correlation coefficient. The degree of uptake will be plotted against length of time to progress, and the association will be described by Spearman correlation coefficient with 95% confidence interval (CI). In addition, will dichotomize degree of update by median and defined it as high vs. low, and apply Wilcoxon rank sum test or Fisher exact test wherever appropriate.</description>
