  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center Phase 1, First-in-Human study conducted in 2 Parts, testing AMG 424 in
      subjects with relapsed/ refractory multiple myeloma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of the study is dose evaluating and aimed at assessing the safety and tolerability of
      AMG 424 while determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or biologically active dose in
      subjects with relapsed/ refractory multiple myeloma.

      Part 2 of the study will further evaluate safety and tolerability of the AMG 424 MTD dose
      determined in Part 1, in groups of subjects with relapsed/ refractory multiple myeloma that
      include those with high or low cytogenetic risk.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Multiple myeloma meeting the following criteria:

               -  Pathologically-documented diagnosis of multiple myeloma that has relapsed after
                  prior lines of therapy that must include a proteasome inhibitor (PI),
                  immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), and, where approved and available, anti-CD38

          -  Known history of primary plasma cell leukemia or evidence of primary or secondary
             plasma cell leukemia at the time of screening

          -  Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia

          -  Amyloidosis

          -  Dexamethasone at cumulative doses of greater than 160 mg or equivalent &lt;3 weeks prior
             to study Day 1 is not allowed. Use of topical or inhaled steroids is acceptable

          -  Anticancer treatment (chemotherapy, IMiD, PI, molecular targeted therapy) &lt; 2 weeks
             prior to study Day 1

          -  Treatment with a therapeutic antibody targeting CD38 &lt; 12 weeks prior to study Day 1

          -  Systemic radiation therapy or major surgery &lt; 28 days prior to study Day 1 as well as
