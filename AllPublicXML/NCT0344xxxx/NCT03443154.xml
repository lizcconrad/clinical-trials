  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if a vaginal fluid (VF) test can predict
      very early preterm birth in patients who are scheduled to have an exam indicated cerclage for
      severe cervical shortening.

      Prior to participants undergoing a scheduled amniocentesis two swabs to collect vaginal
      secretions for the VF tests will be done. During the amniocentesis your doctor will remove
      amniotic fluid as part of the routine clinical care. From that fluid sample, the study will
      use less than a quarter teaspoon for the amniotic fluid study test (AF test). Data regarding
      maternal and birth outcomes will be collected by medical record review.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine if a vaginal fluid (VF) test can predict
      very early preterm birth in patients who are scheduled to have an exam indicated cerclage for
      severe cervical shortening.

      Prior to participants undergoing a scheduled amniocentesis, an ultrasound will be done to
      confirm cervical length and dilation. During a separate sterile speculum exam, the physician
      will use two swabs to collect vaginal secretions for the VF test. During the amniocentesis
      the doctor will remove approximately 2 teaspoon of amniotic fluid as part of your standard
      clinical care. From that fluid sample, the study will use less than a quarter teaspoon for a
      amniotic fluid study test (AF test). Data regarding maternal and birth outcomes will be
      collected by medical record review.

      The vaginal fluid (VF) sample collection will take approximately 15 minutes to do. The total
      time in the study is about seven and a half months (from the time the patient consents until
      4 weeks after delivery). The only study procedure the patient will experience during her
      study participation is the collection of the vaginal fluid specimens.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant age 18 years or older

          -  Gestational age between 16w0d to 25w6d

          -  Singleton fetus with no apparent major anomalies on ultrasound exam

          -  Sonographically absent cervical length and/or sterile digital exam of 2cm or greater
             dilation

          -  Exam-indicated cervical cerclage has been recommended by clinician and patient agrees
             to proceed with cervical cerclage placement

          -  Decision has been made by provider to perform pre-cerclage amniocentesis to rule-out
             infection, with the understanding that cerclage is contraindicated if findings
             indicate probable or definitive infection, and patient agrees.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Planned termination of pregnancy

          -  Clinical features consistent with placental abruption or chorioamnionitis
