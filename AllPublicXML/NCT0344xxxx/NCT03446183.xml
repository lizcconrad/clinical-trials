      Investigating the short term smoking cessation on metabolism, examining of participant of
      smoking cessation workshops and former participants' file survey for metabolic aspects
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective: To examine metabolic aspects occurring during the first 6-12 months following
      smoking cessation in participants of smoking cessation workshops.

      Design: A two armed study: prospective and retrospective. Prospective: Weight, BMI, waist
      circumference and waist: hip ratio were measured before, during and 6 months post cessation
      program. Retrospective: Blood test data for Blood fasting glucose (BFG) and lipid profile
      from the year preceding the workshops and the year after them were analyzed from
      participants' files. Smoking status was verified by phone conversation.
