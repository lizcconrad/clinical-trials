  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center phase I clinical study aimed at determining the
      maximum-tolerated dose and safety of Lintuzumab-Ac225 in combination with CLAG-M chemotherapy
      in the management of relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia. This study uses a 3+3 design
      to estimate the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (RR-AML) in adults is an important therapeutic
      challenge. Nearly 60% of AML patients ultimately relapse or have refractory disease, and
      failure to achieve remission in this population is almost universally fatal. Therefore, a
      critical need exists for the development of novel therapies.

      Currently, for RR-AML, many institutions utilize the chemotherapy regimen of CLAG-M
      (cladribine, cytarabine, G-CSF, mitoxantrone) based on a reported morphological complete
      remission (CR) rate of 58% in prospective clinical trials. Because of this, and its favorable
      performance when compared with outcomes reported for other regimens utilized in RR-AML, we
      believe enhancing the efficacy of CLAG-M is a rational approach to improve therapy in RR-AML.

      A promising approach that could enhance the clearance of leukemic blasts when added to CLAG-M
      chemotherapy is a monoclonal antibody radioconjugate directed against markers expressed in
      leukemic cells. Radiation has known cytotoxic properties in chemo-resistant AML. The benefit
      of an antibody radioconjugate would be leukemic specific delivery of potent radiotherapy with
      potentially minimal systemic off-target side-effects. One such antibody radioconjugate is
      Lintuzumab-Ac225, a highly cytotoxic alpha radiation emitter that targets the CD33 cell
      surface antigen, which is expressed on leukemic cells.

      In this novel study, we aim to add the radioconjugated antibody Lintuzumab-Ac225 to salvage
      CLAG-M chemotherapy in order to improve the treatment response for patients with RR-AML.

    <description>Dose-escalation will be conducted according to a 3+3 design. The initial dose of Lintuzumab-Ac225 will be 0.25 uCi/kg (Dose level 1), and the highest dose administered will be 0.75uCi/kg.
if 0/3 pts have no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), new patients enter next dose level.
if 1/3 pts has DLT, 3 pts treated at same dose level.
if 0/3 pts at that dose level has DLT, new pts enter higher level.
if 1 or more of the additional 3 pts has a DLT, no further pts started at dose level, preceding dose is the MTD.
if 2/3 of initially dosed patients have a DLT on first dose, study terminated.
if 0/3 have DLT at highest dose, additional 3 enrolled.
MTD = highest level at which no more than 1/6 experience a DLT.</description>

    <description>All patients who receive study drug will be closely monitored for adverse events (AEs).
