  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal excretion is a minor elimination route of telotristat etiprate. So this trial is
      intended to assess the drug behaviour in subjects with decreased renal function.

      This is a staged study with Part B contingent upon the results of Part A. Part A will enrol a
      total of 16 subjects, eight with severely impaired renal function and eight healthy subjects.
      Part B with enrol a total of 16 subjects, eight subjects in each additional renal function
      group, i.e. mildly impaired renal function group and moderately impaired group.
