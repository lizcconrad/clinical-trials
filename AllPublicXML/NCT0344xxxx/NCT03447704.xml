      BCD-085-5 is an International, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled
      Clinical Study of the Efficacy and Safety of BCD-085. BCD-085 is a monoclonal antibody to
      interleukin 17. During BCD-085-5 trial patients with active ankylosing spondylitis will
      receive 120 mg of BCD-085 subcutaneously every other week or placebo up to Week 16. Starting
      from week 16 all patients will receive BCD-085. Efficacy, PK and safety parameters will be
      evaluated.
