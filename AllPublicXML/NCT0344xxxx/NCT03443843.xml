          -  Healthy, ambulatory male and female subjects between 18 to 65 years of age

          -  Self-reported seasonal allergic rhinitis to ragweed pollen for at least 2 years prior
             to screening

          -  Documented positive skin prick test response to common ragweed (ambrosia
             artemisiifolia) pollen at screening or within the previous 12 months conducted at
             research site (prick with wheal diameter &gt;= 5 mm larger than the diluent response)

          -  Subject must have allergy symptoms prior to each dose

          -  Subject is willing to stop use of current decongestant and allergy medications at the
             start of the washout period prior to priming and during the trial

          -  At the discretion of the investigators, subjects may be considered with self-reported
             mild intermittent asthma (Using &lt;=2 doses of SABA (short-acting beta agonists) per
             week) or exercise-induced asthma

          -  Subject is free of any clinically significant disease that required a physicianÂ´s care
             and/or would interfere with trial evaluations, procedures or participation

          -  Subject is able to repeatedly and reliably perform PNIF measurements and must achieve
             PNIF value of &gt;=60L/min at screening

          -  Subject must be capable of reading English and willing to participate in all aspects
             of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - any significant medical condition which, in the judgment of the investigator, is a
        contraindication to the use of loratadine, pseudoephedrine and fluticasone propionate, or
        might interfere with the trial. These may include subjects with injury or surgery to the
        nose that is not fully healed, fungal infections, immunocompromised conditions (HIV,
        tuberculosis), severe nosebleeds, narrow-angle glaucoma, chickenpox measles..., severe
        facial pain or thick nasal discharge, sinusitis, constant whistling sound from the nose,
        structured abnormality of the nose, uncontrolled thyroid disease (e.g., hyperthyroidism,
