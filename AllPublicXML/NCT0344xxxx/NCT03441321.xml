    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies how well social-media intervention works in reducing
      indoor tanning in high-risk indoor tanners. Social-media intervention delivered via Facebook
      may help to promote healthy behaviors, positive body image, and to understand young women's
      perception of a social media campaign.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct a randomized control trial to examine the efficacy of the intervention versus
      (vs.) a Facebook-delivered control group on reducing indoor tanning behavior among high-risk
      indoor tanners.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants periodically read the content on the study-specific secret Facebook
      group related to living a healthy lifestyle including avoiding indoor tanning and excessive
      ultraviolet exposure, managing stress, healthy eating, promoting physically active
      lifestyles, and promoting a healthy body image, and participate in the group by providing
      reactions, commenting on the posts, or by sharing study relevant information within the group
      for 8 weeks.

      GROUP II: Participants participate in secret Facebook groups that utilize content from the
      intervention content library related to other health topics of interest (e.g., physical
      activity, healthy eating, alcohol misuse prevention, stress reduction, sleep) for 8 weeks.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 18 months.
