  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind feasibility study
      comparing the intervention of perioperative nutritional supplements (immunomodulation,
      carbohydrate loading, and protein isolate) with an identical placebo for each solution in
      patients with gastrointestinal cancer undergoing surgery. Eligible and consenting patients
      will be randomly allocated to receive the intervention or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.

      This study will assess the feasibility of a large, multi-centre trial by establishing the
      feasibility of randomization to intervention or placebo. This study will be conducted at the
      Juravinski Hospital and will enroll 100 patients over 18 months.

      The study intervention includes three perioperative nutritional supplements: (1) a protein
      supplement administered 3 times a day for 30 days before surgery, (2) a sugar-based
      supplement administered the day prior to and the day of surgery, and (3) a formulated liquid
      diet containing arginine, RNA, proteins and omega-6 fatty acids (referred to as
      immunonutrition for the purposes of this study) administered for 5 days prior to and 5 days
      after surgery.

      The primary outcome for each eligible patient is defined as being randomized to intervention
      or placebo. The criteria for success of this study is defined as the proportion of eligible
      patients randomized as ≥ 60%. If the estimated proportion is &lt;40%, the trial will be
      considered not feasible. If the proportion is between 40%-59%, the trial will be considered
      feasible with modifications to improve enrolment. Other secondary objectives include
      compliance with study intervention, estimating differences in postoperative complications,
      length of hospital stay, and quality of life between groups.
