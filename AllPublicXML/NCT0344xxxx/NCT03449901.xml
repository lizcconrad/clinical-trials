  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have recently demonstrated that argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1)
      expression is silenced in 88% of all sarcomas (n=708), and that this loss is associated with
      a decreased overall survival. Using the extracellular arginine depleting enzyme PEGylated
      arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20), an extracellular arginine depleting enzyme, the investigators
      demonstrated ADI-PEG20 induces a prosurvival metabolic reprogramming in ASS1-deficient
      sarcomas that redirects glucose into the serine/folate pathway directing the carbons from
      glucose into pyrimidine biosynthesis, thus sensitizing cells to death by the pyrimidine
      antimetabolite gemcitabine by using metabolomics. The synthetic lethality was increased by
      the addition of docetaxel. Therefore a phase II clinical trial of ADI with gemcitabine and
      docetaxel, a standard second line therapy for soft tissue sarcoma will be conducted to
      determine if the clinical benefit rate of gemcitabine and docetaxel is improved by the
      metabolic changes induced by ADI-PEG20

Progressive disease: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.

    <description>CBR = proportion of patients who have experienced complete response (CR)+ partial response (PR) + stable disease (SD) lasting 24 weeks or longer
CR: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis).

             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  History of seizure disorder not related to underlying cancer.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.

          -  Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential
             for pharmacokinetic interactions with the study treatment. In addition, these patients
             are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive
             therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
