  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Osteoporosis and Osteopenia are common bone disorders, characterized by low
      bone mass, signs of bone deterioration and are responsible for typical bone fragility.
      Physical activity is certainly a valid prevention tool because it contributes to a healthy
      energy balance, increasing muscle mass and providing beneficial effects in bone metabolism.
      Stress induced by more vigorous activities such as weight lifting, increases the risk of
      injury, particularly in the elderly. Therefore, alternative strategies with lower risk of
      injury are indicated such as whole body vibration and walk.

      Objective: Compare the effect whole body vibration and walking on muscular strength, balance
      and functional performance in the elderly with Osteoporosis and Osteopenia

      Methods: It is a clinical trial study, controlled, parallel, randomized and blind, which will
      follow the guidelines established in the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
      (CONSORT). Participants will be randomly distributed in 2 groups: the experimental group (GI)
      that will hold the training in the vibrating platform and the control group (GC) that will
      perform the walk, settling 1 treatment session. All participants will be subjected to the
      initial and final assessment.
