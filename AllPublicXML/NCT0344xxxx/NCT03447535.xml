    <textblock>
      Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
      Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM 5) as: &quot;A pattern of angry/irritable mood,
      argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness lasting at least 6 months exhibited during
      interaction with at least one individual who is not a sibling.&quot; &quot;The disturbance in behavior
      is associated with distress in the individual or others in his or her immediate social
      context (e.g., family, peer group, work colleagues), or it impacts negatively on social,
      educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.&quot; Children with &quot;classic&quot;
      oppositional defiant disorder, except for mild forms, show symptoms in several settings (at
      home, at school, with peers).

      In this study, the investigators will consider the specifics of children presenting
      &quot;intrafamilial&quot; oppositional defiant disorder (IODD). These children's symptoms are confined
      to only one setting: the home. Therefore, the aim of this study will be to characterize
      children with intrafamilial oppositional defiant disorder. The investigators want to
      understand the differences between IODD and classical forms of ODD in terms of psychiatric
      comorbidities, medical histories and cognitive abilities. They also investigate what
      clinicians currently do to help these families.

      Definition: Extended description of the protocol, including more technical information (as
      compared to the Brief Summary), if desired. Do not include the entire protocol; do not
      duplicate information recorded in other data elements, such as Eligibility Criteria or
      outcome measures.

      Limit: 32,000 characters.

      Child-to-parent violence was kept secret for a long time. Searchers don't know much about
      this type of domestic violence, however they recently tried to investigate more on the
      subject. Bousquet et al. carried out a review of literature on the subject, and grouped the
      articles that they found. There was only one study concerned with children with Intrafamilial
      Oppositional Defiant Disorder (IODD) which is called in the study Oppositional Defiant
      Disorder with family tyranny (Delaunay et al., 2008).

      IODD is described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM) as a
      mild form of Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD). This term characterizes children that meet
      the criteria for ODD (&quot;a pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or
      vindictiveness&quot;) but their symptoms are confined to only one setting: the home. Therefore,
      the aim of this study is to characterize Intrafamilial ODD children and the particularities
      of their families.

      Nowadays, new treatment strategies exist in Montpellier, designed to be used as group
      therapies. In these groups, non-violent resistance methods are taught to the parents. The
      efficiency of this therapy is currently being studied. To improve this therapy and to offer
      appropriate therapies to the children themselves, it is important to improve the
      acknowledgement of these &quot;tyrannical children&quot;. This is the aim of this study. To reach this
      goal, the investigators will compare the medical records of the children with IODD to those
      of the children with classic ODD.

      On one hand, they expect children with IODD to be more anxious and smarter than children with
      &quot;classic&quot; ODD. On the other hand, they expect they will have had diseases that changed
      interactions with their parents. They also assume they will come from small families: i.e.
      they may be an only child, educated by a single parent, or they may have wealthy parents.
      Finally, they hypothesize that clinicians won't treat the children with IODD the same way as
      those with &quot;classic&quot; ODD.

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The psychometric test used to characterize the specific primary outcome measure is the Kiddie-SADS-PL Schedule For Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children Present and Lifetime Version.
The K-SADS-PL is a semi-structured interview aimed at early diagnosis of affective disorders such as anxiety disorder, depression, bipolar disorder. It generates reliable and valid child psychiatric diagnoses (1). It is specifically designed for school children aged 6 to 18. In this study, the K-SADS-PL test is performed by psychiatry residents or by psychologists.
The interview is performed during the evaluation day (hospital day care) or during the pre-study visit for patients participating in the &quot; react &quot; protocole.</description>

    <measure>Measure of Intellectual qQuotient</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) is an individually administered intelligence test for children aged 6 to 16.
The test generates a Full Scale IQ (formerly known as an intelligence quotient or IQ score) that represents a child's general intellectual ability.
In our study, both WISC IV and WISC V have been used. The Fifth Edition is the most current version, and has therefore been used for the most recent tests.
The WISC IV provides four index scores: Verbal Comprehension Index, Processing speed Index,Working Memory Index, Perceptual Reasoning Index (see below).
The WISC V provides 5 index scores: Verbal Comprehension Index, Visual Spatial Index, Fluid Reasoning Index, Working Memory Index, and Processing Speed Index (see below).
For the measure of the intellectual quotient and for the measure of all the index scores, the average is 80-120. Bellow average values represents poorer outcome.</description>
