  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MICS CABG (Minimally invasive coronary surgery), where coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)
      is completed through a small incision over the left chest, has evolved to become a safe and
      less invasive alternative to conventional sternotomy CABG. Several observational studies have
      suggested significantly shorter time to return to physical activity for MICS CABG patients
      compared to sternotomy CABG patients. A randomized study is warranted to validate these
      findings, provide higher level of evidence, and potentially lead to changes in practice. The
      MIST Trial is a multi-centre, prospective, open label, randomized control trial comparing
      quality of life and recovery in the early post-operative period, between patients undergoing
      MICS CABG versus patients undergoing sternotomy CABG. Patients referred for isolated CABG for
      multi-vessel coronary artery disease and deemed technically suitable for sternotomy CABG as
      well as for MICS CABG are considered for enrollment into the trial. Quality of life
      questionnaires (The SF-36, Seattle Angina Questionnaire and EQ-5D-5L) will be used to assess
      the quality of life and recovery in patients undergoing sternotomy CABG or MICS CABG at 1
      month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months follow up.
