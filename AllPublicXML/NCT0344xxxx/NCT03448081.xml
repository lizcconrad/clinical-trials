    <textblock>
      A Phase 2 study evaluating safety, tolerability, and efficacy of SNA-120 ointment when
      administered topically with calcipotriene ointment for the treatment of pruritus and
      psoriasis.

    <textblock>
      All subjects are required to meet eligibility requirements and undergo a calcipotriene run-in
      period (Part A) prior to qualifying and randomizing into the study to receive either SNA-120
      or Placebo ointment in combination with calcipotriene ointment (Part B). Combination therapy
      (SNA-120 ointment + calcipotriene ointment or Placebo ointment + calcipotriene ointment) is
      to continue over an 8 week period to evaluate safety, tolerability and the efficacy of
      treatment on both persistent pruritus and the visible signs and symptoms of psoriasis.

          -  Chronic pruritus of the psoriasis plaques at least 6 weeks prior to screening

          -  At least moderate baseline overall itch associated with psoriatic plaques

          -  Willing and able to undergo a 4-week run-in with calcipotriene ointment dosing and
             remain on this stable regimen throughout the study

          -  Mild or moderate psoriasis at screening and baseline

          -  Subject's plaques are amenable to treatment with a topical medication

          -  Willing and able to discontinue all other topical products to treat psoriasis and/or
             itch, including topical steroids

          -  Willing and able to avoid prolonged exposure of the designated treatment plaques to
             ultraviolet (UV) radiation (natural and artificial) for the duration of the study

             insufficiency, or severe hepatic disorders

          -  Thyroid abnormalities that, in the opinion of the investigator, are clinically
             relevant and may affect assessments

          -  Current diagnosis of guttate, erythrodermic, exfoliative, or pustular psoriasis

          -  Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of bacterial infection of the skin

             with calcipotriene

          -  Known hypersensitivity to SNA-120 (pegcantratinib), calcipotriene, the study treatment
             excipients, and /or polyethylene glycol (PEG), or a history of drug or other allergy
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates participation

          -  Currently enrolled in an investigational drug or device study or has used an
             investigational drug or an investigational device treatment within 30 days or 5

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating, or are planning to become pregnant during the
             study

          -  Subjects previously participating in any SNA-120 (and/or CT327 or pegcantratinib)
