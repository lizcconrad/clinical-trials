  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel web-based intervention (Optimune),
      which was designed to introduce relevant cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques to
      women with breast cancer who are past the active eradication phase and free from disease
      recurrence. The present study will test the hypothesis that Optimune has an impact on immune
      status, markers of inflammation and psychometric outcomes. Therefore, 150 woman with breast
      cancer will be recruited and randomized to two groups: (1) a control group, in which they may
      engage with any treatment (Care-as-Usual, CAU) and receive access to Optimune after a delay
      of 6 months (i.e., CAU/wait list control group), or (2) to a treatment group that immediately
      receives 12-month access to Optimune and may also use CAU. The primary outcome measure is the
      effect on inflammatory parameters six month post-baseline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression and fatigue is common in breast cancer survivors and its presence is associated
      with personal suffering, increased inflammatory activity, and worse prognosis. While in the
      phase of acute treatment many women receive short-term psychological support to better cope
      with the situation, this is not standard of care in the years following. Web-based
      psychological interventions are easily accessible and preliminary evidence suggests that such
      interventions can be effective. However, no trial has yet examined whether a CBT-based
      internet intervention designed to meet the needs of breast cancer survivors can achieve
      effects on immune status, inflammation and psychometric outcomes, when offered as adjunct to
      care as usual.

      In this study, the investigators will study treatment effects of the novel web-based program
      Optimune when added to treatment as usual. Beyond established CBT techniques targeting
      depression, anxiety, and fatigue, this intervention specifically includes elements that have
      shown effects on markers of immune status and inflammation, including sleep and stress
      management (e.g., mindfulness-based techniques) and lifestyle optimization (dietary and
      physical activity advice). The delivery and training of content is continuously
      individualized to match users' preferences and needs, based on responses within the program.
      The intervention is delivered via the internet and protected by individually assigned
      passwords. The program can be accessed for 365 days after registration.

      This randomized controlled trial will include 150 women with breast cancer who are past the
      active eradication phase and free from disease recurrence. Participants will be recruited
      from various settings, including web-based advertisement and internet forums/groups.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to either (1) a control group, in which they receive
      care as usual (CAU) and are given access to the web-based intervention (Optimune) after a
      delay of 6 months (i.e., CAU/wait list control group), or (2) a treatment group that may also
      use CAU and in addition immediately receives 12-month access to the web-based intervention
      (Optimune). Measurements are collected at pre-treatment (T0) three months (T1), six months
      (T2), nine months (T3) and twelve months (T4).

    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months (also assessed at 6, 9 and 12 months post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be measured using the Brief Fatigue Inventory Questionnaire (BFI-9) questionnaire. Scale Range: 0 to 90.
The BFI is a 9-item, 11-point rating scale. The first three questions measure fatigue severity from 0, indicating &quot;no fatigue,&quot; to 10, indicating &quot;as bad as you can imagine,&quot; at current, usual, and worst levels. The following six questions assess fatigue interference with daily activities. Response options range from 0, indicating &quot;does not interfere,&quot; to 10, indicating, &quot;completely interferes.&quot; Interpretation: A global fatigue score can be obtained by averaging all the items on the BFI.
Higher scores on the BFI correspond to greater self-reported levels of fatigue</description>

    <measure>Determination of cancer-related emotional stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months (also assessed at 6, 9 and 12 months post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Cancer-related emotional stress will be measured using the standardized IES-R (Impact of Event Scale) Questionnaire. Scale Range: 0 to 88 The IES-R is a 22-item self-report measure that assesses subjective distress caused by traumatic events. Items are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;extremely&quot;). The IES-R yields a total score (ranging from 0 to 88) and subscale scores can also be calculated for the Intrusion, Avoidance, and Hyperarousal subscales.
Interpretation: Higher scores correspond to greater self-reported levels of post-traumatic stress.</description>

    <description>Anxiety will be measured using the standardized GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) questionnaire. Scale Range: 0 to 21 The GAD-7 is an instrument for screening, diagnosing, monitoring and measuring the severity of anxiety. GAD-7 scores of 5, 10, and 15 represents mild, moderate, and severe anxiety.
Interpretation: Higher scores correspond to greater self-reported levels of anxiety.</description>

Interpretation: Higher scores correspond to greater self-reported levels of fear of progression.</description>
