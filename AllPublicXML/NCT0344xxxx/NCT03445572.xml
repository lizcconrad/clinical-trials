  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn if meditation can help to improve cancer-related
      symptoms in hospitalized cancer patients. The meditative practices taught in this study are
      yoga based, but does not involve postures.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 90 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, participant will be randomly assigned (as
      in the roll of a dice) to 1 of 3 groups. This is done because no one knows if one group is
      better, the same, or worse than the other.

        -  In Group 1, participant will take part in meditative slow breathing (MSB).

        -  In Group 2, participant will take part in Isha Kriya (IK) meditation.

        -  In Group 3, participant will be placed on a waitlist and participant will receive
           standard supportive care.

      The study staff will tell participant which group participant will be in.

      Group 1 and 2:

      Participant will perform MSB or IK meditation 2 times each day (1 time in the morning, 1 time
      in the evening) for 28 days. Each meditation section will last about 15 minutes.

      To perform MSB, participant will take slow, deep breaths. Participant will be asked to focus
      on participant's breathing. The study staff will teach participant how fast or slow
      participant should be breathing, but the goal is to take deep breaths about 4-5 times each
      minute for 15 minutes. The study staff will also give participant written instructions.

      To perform IK meditation, participant will sit cross-legged or in a chair, with participant's
      hands on participant's thighs (palms facing upward), and participant's eyes closed.
      Participant will slowly inhale and exhale for about 9 minutes. With each inhale and exhale,
      the study staff will instruct participant to mentally repeat certain phrases to yourself.
      After that, participant will then inhale and on the exhale, let out a long &quot;Ahhh&quot; sound.
      Then, participant will slightly lift participant's face upwards and focus on the space
      between participant's eyebrows. The study staff will be with participant while participant
      performs IK meditation to lead participant through these steps.

      Participant will be given a diary to write down when participant starts and stops
      participant's meditation each day. This diary will be reviewed by the study staff. The study
      staff will call participant 1 time each week to make sure that participant is completing
      participant's meditation and answer any questions participant may have. This call should last
      about 5-10 minutes. If participant prefers it, the study staff can also contact participant
      by FaceTime or Skype.

      In addition to meditation, participant will complete 1 questionnaire every week about
      participant's symptoms and quality of life. It should take about 10 minutes to complete this
      questionnaire. Participant will complete an additional symptom questionnaire during Weeks 1
      and 4. It should take about 10 minutes to complete. These questionnaires will be completed
      online. The study staff will send participant a link to complete the questionnaires.

      Group 3:

      During the first 28 days of the study, participant will not take part in any meditation.
      Instead, participant will receive standard supportive care. After 28 days, participant may be
      able to switch over to Group 2 and take part in IK meditation. If participant is not able to
      return to the hospital, the study staff can teach participant this technique over FaceTime or
      Skype, if this is more convenient for participant. If participant does not want to take part
      in the IK meditation, participant does not have to in order to take part in this study. The
      study staff can discuss this with participant in more detail.

      Participant will not complete questionnaires while on study if participant is in Group 3.

      Length of Study Participation:

      If participant is in Groups 1 or 2, participant will be called by the study staff on Day 48
      of the study and participant will complete the 2 questionnaires about participant's symptoms
      and quality of life over the phone. After this phone call, participation on this study will
      be over.

      If participant is in Group 3 and participant chooses to receive IK meditation, participation
      in this study will be over after 56 days (28 days of supportive care and then 28 days of
      meditation).
