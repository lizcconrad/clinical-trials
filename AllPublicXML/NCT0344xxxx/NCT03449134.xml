  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of gefapixant in reducing
      cough frequency as measured over a 24-hour period.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study had a Screening period (minimum of 7 days and up to approximately 14 days) to
      determine participant inclusion, a Baseline visit including 24 hours of objective measurement
      of cough. The study had two treatment periods (a main 12-week treatment period and a 40-week
      extension period), and a 14-day follow-up period.
