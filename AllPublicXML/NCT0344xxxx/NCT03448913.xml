  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study evaluates difference in chronic pain after six months from surgery
      between patients who received PECS block and general anesthesia versus general anesthesia
      alone.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PECS block is used as a pain relief technique during breast surgery. However at the actual
      state of knowledge there is no strong evidence that its use could lower incidence of chronic
      pain compared to general anesthesia alone.

      Moreover for its use an adequate skill with ultrasound machine is required. For this reason
      only some anesthesiologists in our reality use this technique it in clinical practice.
