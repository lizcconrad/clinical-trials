  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by a
      gradual, irreversible decline of language function (Mesulam, 2001). There are no known
      treatments for PPA so far. The relentless progression of PPA symptoms eventually leads to a
      profound impairment in communication ability and, ultimately, to more generalized deficits of
      cognition. Some cases and small studies reported that Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
      (TMS), one of the non-invasive neuromodulation tech, can be employed to facilitate language
      production and improve the language ability in patients with PPA. Herein we will explore the
      tolerance and efficacy of TMS for the treatment of PPA by the randomized controlled trial
      .Meanwhile the functional MRI tech will be used to investigate the neural network changing in
      the procedure

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All participants had also been evaluated previously by a behavioral neurologist at the
        Peking Union Medical College Hospital and had been clinically diagnosed with a variant of
        PPA.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Scored below 15 on the mini-mental state exam (MMSE) due to concerns that global
             cognitive impairment might preclude their ability to follow the directions and
             interfere with task performance.

          2. Had a history of seizures or unexplained loss of consciousness, pregnancy, surgical
             breach of the skull, or any other medical or surgical contraindication to receiving
             noninvasive brain stimulation.

          3. Is unable to complete the treatment and evaluations
