  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The efficacy rate on gastroscopy</measure>
    <time_frame>0, week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy rate is obtained from the following formula using the subject whose erroneous score is improved by 50% or more as compared with before the study drug administration.
The efficacy rate(%) = (number of effective cases)/(all cases) x 100
Effective case is determined by the grade change of erosion. A case in which the grade changes from 4 to 2 or 1, from 3 to 1, or from 2 to 1 is judged as an effective case.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cure rate on gastroscopy</measure>
    <time_frame>0, week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Judging from the gastroscopic examination as normal (no erosion), the cure rate is obtained as follows.
Cure rate(%) = (number of cures(no erosion))/(all cases) x 100</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who were diagnosed with acute or chronic gastritis in a gastroscopy performed
