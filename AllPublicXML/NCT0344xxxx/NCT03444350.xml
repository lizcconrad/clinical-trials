      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinicaland laboratory (as oxidative stress and
      pro-inflammatory mediators) effects of the use of gaseous ozone in periodontal treatment in
      addition to scaling and root planning.

      The study population consisted of 40 patients with CP (chronic periodontitis). It was
      performed with two groups; The Test Group, and the Control Group. SRP plus gaseous ozone [1 W
      (100 mJ, 10 Hz)] was applied to the Test Group. The Control Group, on the other hand, had
      only SRP.The clinical periodontal parameters were performed and saliva samples were taken
      before SRP (baseline) and 1 month after treatment. The periodontal examination involved
      assessing the plaque index, gingival index , probing depth, and clinical attachment level.
      The total antioxidant status, total oxidant status, nitric oxide, 8-hidroxi-deoksiguanosine,
      myeloperoxidase, glutathione, malondialdehyde and transforming growth factor-beta levels were
      determined in the saliva samples.

      The study has been designed in a randomized parallelly-controlled and double-blinded design
      as a full-mouth clinical trial. The duration of the study was 1 month.

      The study was performed with two groups; The Test Group, and the Control Group. SRP plus
      gaseous ozone [1 W (100 mJ, 10 Hz), (n=20)] was applied to the Test Group.

      The Control Group, on the other hand, had SRP plus placebo (n=20). The patients were
      distributed in random order to the 2 groups (each group had 20 patients). One patient in the
      Ozone Group and 2 patients in the Control Group left the study.

      The following clinical periodontal parameters were performed immediately before SRP
      (baseline), and 1 month after treatment for each test and control groups. Plaque index, GI,
      PD and CAL were recorded. All clinical parameter measurements were used a manual periodontal
      probe (PCP- 12, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA).

      The total antioxidant status, total oxidant status, nitric oxide, 8-hidroxi-deoksiguanosine,
      myeloperoxidase, glutathione, malondialdehyde and transforming growth factor-beta levels were
      determined in the saliva samples.

    <masking_description>The clinician who performed the therapy (S.D.) was not informed about the modality of the treatment till the first session of each patient (right at this moment, a sealed envelope was opened and the clinician was then able to see the treatment modality). The results of the study were evaluated in a blinded manner (both before treatment and after treatment).
The ozone was applied in the gingival sulcus of all teeth with a fine-tipped tool placed in the periodontal pocket. It was moved in the apical-coronal direction in a sweeping motion. Within 30 seconds, this application was applied in mesial, distal, buccal, and lingual manner. No ozone application was used in the Control Group, and they received only placebo.</masking_description>
