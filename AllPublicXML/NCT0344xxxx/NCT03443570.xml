  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project was undertaking by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University and other 2 well-known
      hospitals in China. In order to report the efficacy and safety of rituximab combining with
      bortezomib for the treatment of adults with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), compared to
      rituximab alone .

      The investigators anticipate to undertaking a parallel group, multicentre, randomised
      controlled trial of 100 ITP adult patients from 3 medical centers in China. One part of the
      participants are randomly selected to receive rituximab (given with a fixed dose of 500 mg
      administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks, for 2 times totally) combining with
      bortezomib (given subcutaneous injection at a fixed dose of 2.0 mg weekly, for 4 times
      totally), the others are selected to receive rituximab alone (given with a fixed dose of 500
      mg administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks, for 2 times totally). Platelet
      count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment, adverse events
      are also recorded throughout the study in order to report the efficacy and safety of the
      combination therapy compared to rituximab alone therapy for the treatment of adults with ITP.
