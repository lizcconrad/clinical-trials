    <textblock>
      A randomized double-blind study of the effect of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) on stool
      microbiota composition, microbiota localization, and metabolic parameters in healthy
      subjects. It includes a 17-day in-patient stay, randomization to an emulsifier-free group or
      a CMC group with the same diet except baked goods/sorbet with added CMC at 15g/person/day.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a randomized double-blind, controlled feeding experiment examining the effect of CMC
      on the stool microbiota composition, gene expression, and microbiota localization with
      respect to the epithelium. In addition, the investigators will assess the impact of CMC
      exposure in the diet on markers of metabolic syndrome including response to oral glucose
      tolerance testing and other plasma metabolite measurements.

      Sixteen healthy volunteers will be recruited for a 17-day in-patient study. All participants
      will receive 3 full days of freshly prepared emulsifier-free food to begin the study. This
      will be called the &quot;washout period&quot;. Participants will then be randomized into an
      &quot;emulsifier-free&quot; arm and a &quot;CMC&quot; arm in a 1:1 ratio.

      Both arms will continue the same diet except that the &quot;CMC&quot; arm's brownie and sorbet will
      have CMC added to achieve a level of 15 gm per person per day consumption. Serial collection
      of fecal, plasma, urine and mucosal biopsy samples will be performed to investigate the
      extent to which CMC consumption by humans impacts the gut microbiota and its interaction with
      the host parameters related to inflammation and metabolism. Participants will have daily
      urine and stool collections. Sigmoidoscopies and glucose tolerance testing will be completed
      on day 4 and 17. Blood samples are collected on days 1-5, 8, 10, 12, 15, and 17.

    <description>CMC is one of many synthetic dietary emulsifiers that are incorporated into a variety of processed foods. We have recently shown that, in mice, consumption of P80 and CMC, alters microbiota composition, have pro-inflammatory potential and promote microbiota encroachment into the colonic mucosa, low-grade inflammation, and metabolic syndrome. However, it is not known whether these compounds have similar effects in humans. We would like to study these effects in the human gut microbiota.</description>
