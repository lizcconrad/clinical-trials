  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-partum haemorrhage continues to be a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity,
      accounting for more than 125 000 deaths per year across the world. Prompt diagnosis and
      effective action are the cornerstones of management and are crucial to prevent fatal maternal
      haemorrhage.

      Considering that published data are extremely limited, the aim of our study will be to
      evaluate retrospectively the efficacy of Hayman's Haemostatic Suture for the treatment of
      resistant post-partum hemorrhage resistant to pharmacological therapy.

      Post-partum haemorrhage continues to be a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity,
      accounting for more than 125 000 deaths per year across the world. Prompt diagnosis and
      effective action are the cornerstones of management and are crucial to prevent fatal maternal
      haemorrhage.

      The Hayman suture offers the potential advantages that can be applied fast and easy, a key
      point in an emergency situation, and avoids having to perform a lower segment hysterotomy
      when post-partum haemorrhage follows a vaginal delivery, therefore minimising the trauma to
      the atonic bleeding uterus.

      Considering that published data are extremely limited, the aim of our study will be to
      evaluate retrospectively the efficacy of Hayman's Haemostatic Suture for the treatment of
      resistant post-partum hemorrhage resistant to pharmacological therapy.

    <intervention_name>Hayman's Haemostatic Suture</intervention_name>
    <description>After the uterus is exteriorised, bimanual compression is applied to check whether this stopped the bleeding, before the suture is applied. A number 2 polyglactin suture on a straight needle is used to transfix the uterus from front to back, just above the reflection of the bladder, and is then tied above the fundus of the uterus, while an assistant applies bimanual compression.</description>
