      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, single-arm, post-approval study of the
      FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System intended to characterize the safety of the
      Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System when used in people with diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 920 adult subjects, aged 18 years and older with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, who require
      daily blood glucose monitoring to manage their diabetes, will be enrolled to obtain at least
      736 subjects who complete the final visit. Subjects will utilize capillary SMBG for managing
      diabetes for 6 months (control phase) followed by diabetes management using FreeStyle Libre
      for 6 months (intervention phase). Subjects will maintain a diary/log book of Adverse Events
      during each phase. Assessment of Adverse Events will occur via self reporting at each monthly
      visit and/or phone call.
