  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A question is raised about the possibility of accurate localization of the SLN (sentinel
      lymph node) detected by CTLG (Computed Tomography Lymphography) which offers a detection rate
      of 100% in many studies In Oncology center, Mansoura University (OCMU), the surgical oncology
      unit had a previous experience in using charcoal for localization of non-palpable suspicious
      breast lesions and it showed promising results in comparison to traditional localization
      methods In addition, we had another study using silver wire for localization of breast masses
      before neoadjuvant therapy.

      In the study, the investigators will study the usage of both methods as preoperative
      localization methods for the SLN detected by CT lymphography in breast cancer patients The
      investigators suppose that this method can offer two main advantages over the traditional SLN
      intraoperative methods which are; saving operative time needed for the intraoperative
      procedure as well as solving the problem of the need for complex logistic preparations
      especially for the usage of radioisotope method.

    <description>50 patients with node negative early breast cancer. The patients were randomized into two groups; SLN localized using CTLG guided injection of liquid charcoal suspended solution (first group) or by placing a 3 cm silver wire using spinal needle (second group). For every patient, SLN biopsy was performed using the traditional method with blue dye. Then dual search for the SLN localized by both the novel &amp; traditional method was performed.</description>
