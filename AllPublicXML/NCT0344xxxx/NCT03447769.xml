      The primary purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy and safety of canakinumab versus
      placebo as adjuvant therapy in adult subjects with stages AJCC/UICC v. 8 II -IIIA and the
      subset of IIIB (T&gt;5cm N2 disease) completely resected (R0) non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC).
