  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Family dynamics and caregiver responses to a child with traumatic brain injury are implicated
      both as precipitating events as well as factors influencing outcomes of abusive head trauma
      (AHT). However, no family behavioral health intervention exists to meet the unique needs of
      families with infants and very young children with AHT. The study utilizes a randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) to assess the efficacy of an evidence-based behavioral intervention to
      improve outcomes for families and children with AHT. The investigators will examine outcomes
      in multiple dimensions, including clinical, cognitive, family, caregiver, child behavior, and
      service usage over time compared to patients not receiving the intervention. The
      investigators will then examine characteristics of patients and families that are best suited
      for this behavioral health intervention.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60 children (ages 6 months to 2 years) and their caregiver referred to the Non-Accidental
      Brain Injury Care Clinic at the Children's Hospital Colorado (CHCO) will recruited for
      participation in the study. Consenting patients will be randomized to receive care as usual
      or to receive the Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) intervention. Data for all
      participants will be collected at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months.
      Outcomes in multiple dimensions, will be assessed including clinical recovery, cognitive,
      language, and motor functioning, family functioning, caregiver mental health including
      anxiety, depression, competency, and stress. The investigators will also examine service use
      over time. Analyses will first assess trajectories of recovery for both groups using data for
      all time points. Analyses assessing the intervention will focus on caregiver mental health
      features, family functioning, service use, and child scores on language motor, cognitive, and
      socio-emotional measures. Finally, injury, initial family, and child functioning data will be
      aggregated in a latent class approach to assess what family and child characteristics may be
      most amenable to improvement in general and for the intervention group in particular.

    <description>Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) is an in-home, 10-session, manualized parent-training program for children ages 6 months through 2 years who have experienced early adversity. ABC utilizes parent-child interactions to enhance positive interactions with the child through live coaching with particular focus on nurturing behaviors, following the child's lead, non-frightening behaviors. These behaviors include appropriate soothing and comforting when a child is distressed, responding to or imitating a child in a contingent way, and displaying warmth.</description>
