  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New daily persistent headache (NDPH) is a primary headache disorder characterized by the
      daily and unremitting headache pain patients experience with a distinct onset. Despite the
      known significant impairment associated with NDPH, the process by which some patients with
      NDPH recover within months while others do not is unknown.

      The investigators propose to refine the clinical definition and suggest a novel mechanism
      underlying new daily persistent headache (NDPH) in adolescents. In non-responding patients,
      they further aim to investigate low-dose naltrexone for the treatment of new daily persistent
      headache.

      Adolescents ages 10-17 will be recruited from Boston Children's Hospital Pediatric Headache
      Program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate low-dose naltrexone for the treatment of new
      daily persistent headache (NDPH) in adolescents ages 10-17. New daily persistent headache
      (NDPH) is a primary headache disorder with a reported prevalence of 3.5% in adolescents.
      Patients with NDPH have compromised academic performance, school absence, anxiety, depressed
      mood, sleep impairment, family disruption, and high health care costs. Despite the known
      significant impairment associated with NDPH, the process by which some patients with NDPH
      recover within months while others do not is unknown. With the goal of enhancing the clinical
      definition of NDPH, investigators will describe differences between patients with NDPH who
      recover within a few months and those who do not.

      Additionally, little is known about which medications effectively manage and treat NDPH. One
      proposed medication that may benefit children and adolescents with NDPH is low-dose
      naltrexone. Naltrexone is an anti-inflammatory agent, similar to the opioid antagonist
      naloxone. Naltrexone is an effective treatment for opioid addiction, however, it was recently
      discovered that when taken in low doses (1/10 of the typical dose) naltrexone is capable of
      reducing the severity of chronic pain symptoms. By acting on glial cells in the nervous
      system as well as other receptors in the brain, naltrexone is capable of exerting analgesic
      effects. With this analgesic property, it has been speculated that low-dose naltrexone may be
      an effective treatment for the management of several chronic pain conditions, including
      headache.

      Although more research must be conducted to evaluate long-term effects of using low-dose
      naltrexone, prior studies show that there are little short-term consequences associated with
      using this drug as a form of treatment for chronic pain symptoms. Investigators aim to assess
      the efficacy and safety of low-dose naltrexone in the treatment of patients with NDPH.

    <description>1. A change in pain intensity scores and headache frequency- The NRS, numerical rating scale will be used, with a pain score between 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being worst pain imaginable, for NDPH patients, chronic and recovered, completing 3 months of naltrexone, as compared to a cohort of patients with NDPH on standard treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional disability</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>1. A change in functional disability scores - The functional disability inventory (FDI) will be used to assess differences in disability pre- and post-naltrexone treatment, as well as between recovered and persistent patients.
The FDI is a valid and reliable measure consisting of 15 items concerning perceptions of physical and psychosocial function. Total scores range from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater disability.</description>

Each item is rated on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being worst pain imaginable. The PSQ will be used to assess differences in pain sensitivity pre- and post-naltrexone treatment, as well as between recovered and persistent patients.</description>
