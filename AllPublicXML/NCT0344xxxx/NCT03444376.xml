  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must be female and age â‰¥ 18 years (19 years for Korean sites)

          2. Patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced, inoperable or metastatic
             cervical cancer who is positive for HPV-16 or HPV-18 AND failed (or not eligible to)
             standard-of-care chemotherapy and/or radiation.

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0-1

          4. Life Expectancy of at least 6 months

          5. Patients must agree to provide either an archival tumor tissue sample or fresh biopsy
             sample for baseline biomarker tissue analyses, including staining for PD-L1. If
             archival tissue is not available and the patient does not have biopsy-accessible tumor
             lesions, the patient will be excluded.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has disease that is suitable for local therapy administered with curative
             intent.

          2. Any other current or previous malignancy within the past three years that, in the
             opinion of the Principal Investigator will interfere with study-specific endpoints.

          3. Patient is expected to require any other form of antineoplastic therapy while on
             study; including systemic chemotherapy, radiation therapy (except for palliative
             purposes) biological therapy, or immunotherapy not specified in this protocol.

          4. Patient has a history of active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or
             carcinomatous meningitis.

          5. Patients have received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2
             agent or if the patient has previously participated in Merck MK-3475 clinical trials.

          6. Patients with active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppressive treatment
             within the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or
             immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic
             corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is
             not considered to be an excluded systemic treatment and will be permitted. Patients
             whose autoimmune disease is well-controlled and who require ongoing systemic therapy
             that is not immunosuppressive in nature (e.g. patients with Grave's disease post
             thyroid ablation receiving levothyroxine) are eligible.

          7. Patients with a history of either solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell
             transplantation(HSCT)
