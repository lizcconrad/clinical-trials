  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) called TAK-164.
      TAK-164 is being evaluated in participants with advanced GCC-positive GI cancer (Part A) or
      CRC (Part B) to determine safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) and MTD/RP2D of
      TAK-164, as well as the preliminary efficacy. The study will include approximately 95
      evaluable participants.

      In Part A (Escalation), approximately 45 participants with GI carcinoma will be enrolled in 2
      arms planned dose escalation scheme. Those include patients with various GI malignancies such
      as carcinomas of esophagus, stomach, colon, and pancreas. The starting dose for Arm 1 will be
      0.004 mg/kg of TAK-164 administered IV on Day 1 every 3 Week (Q3W). Arm 2, will enroll
      approximately 20 participants after at least 4 dose levels of TAK-164 in Part A. TAK-164 will
      be administered IV on Days 1 and 15 every 2 Week (Q2W).

      In Part B (Expansion), approximately 50 participants will be enrolled to receive TAK-164
      infusion at determined RP2D in Part A. Participants will follow either the Q2W schedule or
      the Q3W schedule and will be followed until disease progression (PD), unacceptable toxicity,
      or until they choose to withdraw consent.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted to include United States, Spain, Netherlands and
      United Kingdom. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 55 months.
      Participants will attend an end of study (EOS) visit 30 days after the last dose of TAK-164
      or just prior to the start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy, whichever occurs first.

    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR), or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR is disappearance of all target lesions. PR is at least 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ, 5 lesions in total representative of all involved organs were identified as target lesions at baseline. Target lesions were selected on the basis of size (longest lesions) and suitability for reproducible repeated measurements.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with CR, PR or stable disease (SD) with a minimum of 12 weeks duration. Duration of SD is defined as the time from the date of first study drug administration to the date of first documentation of disease progression for participants who achieved SD as the best overall response. CR is disappearance of all target lesions. PR is at least 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Progressive Disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline smallest sum of LD, since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is defined as the time from the date of first documentation of a response to the date of first documentation of PD according to RECIST version 1.1 criteria. PD is defined as at least 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline smallest sum of LD, since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Participants without documentation of PD at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of their last response assessment that is stable disease or better.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the date of first study drug administration to the date of first documentation of PD or death. PD is defined as at least 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline smallest sum of LD, since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.

          5. For participants enrolled in the expansion cohorts in which tumor biopsies are
             obtained:

               -  Known bleeding diathesis or history of abnormal bleeding, or any other known
                  coagulation abnormalities that would contraindicate the tumor biopsy procedure.

               -  Ongoing therapy with any anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents (example, aspirin,
                  clopidogrel, heparin, or warfarin).
