  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Modern display technique seems to optimize visualization in minimal-invasive surgery. Many
      systems are available right now with a fundamental difference between the passive polarizing
      3-dimensional (3D) and 2-dimensional (2D) technique. Data seems to show a benefit for the 3D
      technique in the visualization of the operative field. This could lead to more precision in
      minimal-invasive surgery. 2D-systems with high resolution of 4.096 x 2.180 pixels (4K) could
      be a promising alternative. This study wants to evaluate if 3D- or 4K- display technique
      could optimize surgeons´ view and improve the performance during minimal-invasive surgery.
      Therefore medical students and surgeons of different experience levels will perform surgical
      tasks on a minimal-invasive training system.They will be randomized to use first the 3D- or
      the 4K-display system in the training set-up. After completing the tasks with one system the
      minimal-invasive training set-up will be repeated with the other display system. NASA
      (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) task load index is evaluated after each
      round. The ability for stereoscopic vision is tested after finishing the complete training
      set-up with both systems. The primary outcome parameter surgical performance will be
      evaluated in this study defined as the performance time and the number of defined mistakes
      made during each task.
