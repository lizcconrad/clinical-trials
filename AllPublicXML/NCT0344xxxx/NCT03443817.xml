      Introduction In order to guarantee chronic patients &amp; elderly a high quality service from
      health care organizations in the coming decades, new technologies have been implemented to
      treat patients from a distance. There is still a need for more studies on the efficacy and
      cost-effectiveness of tele-rehabilitation (TR) and its long-term effects needs also to be
      determined. To guarantee individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) a
      high quality service from health care organizations in the coming decades and economically
      save the national health systems for an expensive bill for the treatment of COPD, new actions
      plans has to be taken into use. Hereby, more patients can be treated with less human
      resources while still sustaining or even improving today's services. The importance of such
      welfare action plans has to maintain a high quality of service that individuals with COPD are
      willing to accept. Here, TR seems to be a good welfare action plans. Despite proof of
      improved cost-effectiveness, no studies support the benefits of TR in COPD patient with
      respect to adherence, security, treatment efficacy and improved quality of life.

      Aim To assess and compare the feasibility and effect of a tele-rehabilitation program with a
      new and innovative TR platform (NITRP) compared to standard treatment with respect to
      exercise capacity, quality of life and activities of daily living in patients with COPD.

      Method and material The study is a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing the
      effects of a follow-up tele-rehabilitation program and conventional follow-up rehabilitation
      in patients with severe COPD. 54 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be
      randomized in two groups to either an 8 week follow-up tele-rehabilitation program or to
      standard follow up after rehabilitation. Participants will be tested at baseline, after 8
      weeks and 6 months after cessation of the training programs. In the intervention group, a
      real- and a virtual physiotherapist agent will facilitate the rehabilitation.

      Ethical considerations This study will not pose any risk to the patient as compared to
      current practice. Participation is voluntary and the patient may at any time withdraw from
      the study without consequences for future care or treatment. The questionnaires and the test
      methods used are clinically recognized instruments. Signed informed consent will be obtained
      from the all participants after verbal and written information and before the study starts.
      The study will not be initiated before approval from the Ethics Committee and the Data
      Protection Agency has been obtained. The study will follow the general research ethical rules
      as expressed in the Helsinki Declaration II.

      Intro

      To guarantee chronic patients and elderly a high quality service from health care
      organizations in the coming decades, new technologies has been implemented to treat patients
      from a distance. This document reflects the latest research studies based on
      tele-rehabilitation (TR), its application in chronic lung diseases and the topics that still
      needs to be investigated.

      TR Studies of TR in patients with lymphedema (Galiano-Castillo et al., 2014) or COPD
      (Paneroni et al., 2014)(Tousignant et al., 2012)(Dinesen, Seeman, and Gustafsson,
      2011)(Dinesen, Huniche, and Toft, 2013) or in the orthopedic areas as, lower back
      (Palacín-Marín et al., 2013), knee (Cabana et al., 2010) (Tousignant, Moffet, et al., 2011)
      (Tousignant, Boissy, et al., 2011) and shoulder (Eriksson et al., 2009)(Eriksson, Lindström
      and Ekenberg, 2011) show that tele-technology has been developed to a level where it is
      possible to treat, test and follow-up patients from a distance. Patients who have not been
      offered such solutions face increased risks of hospital-acquired infections (Dancer, 2009)
      and longer travel and waiting time to get treated. The public sector expects higher
      expenditure due to treatment and transportation cost, specifically in chronic patients and
      the elderly whose numbers tends to increase according to demographics trend (Palacín-Marín et
      al., 2013)(Barros et al., 2011)(Parker and Thorslund, 2007)(Yach, Hawkes, Gould, and Hofman,
      2004). Such facts points to the need of creating and improving solution that overcome such
      health care challenges.

      TR seems to be a good approach to reach patients in low inhabited areas (Hill and Sppath,
      2010), changing health care to self-care (Haarder, 2011), empowering patient's awareness on
      their disease and increasing the flexibility patients need to acquire to obtain healthier
      behaviors. Although the interest in TR research is high, there is still a need for more
      studies on the efficacy (Paneroni et al., 2014) and cost-effectiveness of TR (Paneroni et
      al., 2014) (Langberg, Lindahl, Kidholm, and Dinesen, 2014) just as the long-term effects of
      TR have to be determined (Langberg et al., 2014).

      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) COPD is among the most resource costly diseases
      we face in our century (Kjøller, Juel and Kamper-Jørgensen, 2007). In Denmark, approximately
      430,000 people have COPD of which around 50,000 have severe COPD (Kirkegaard N, Brandt A,
      Timm H, 2013)(Mannino, Doherty and Sonia Buist, 2006). Eriksen (Eriksen and Vestbo, 2010)
      states that up to 42.3% of patients with COPD discharged from hospitals are readmitted the
      following year, and 17% of patients treated in emergency departments require hospitalization.
      Danish pulmonary physicians concluded that COPD cost the Danish society three billion DKK in
      2002 (Hos, 2007) where up to 20% of the most severe COPD patients consume over 70% of the
      total health expenditure (Jansson et al., 2002). Nowadays, some municipalities have already
      problems with offering rehabilitation services to all COPD patients in some areas in Denmark
      (Kjøller, Juel and Kamper-Jørgensen, 2007). Actions implementing TR for COPD patients have
      been started and research begins to show some improvements.

      Pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD The objective of treatment for patients with COPD is to
      delay the progression of the disease, prevent acute exacerbations, improve quality of life,
      reduce symptoms and reduce mortality. Rehabilitation of COPD includes among others physical
      training and patient education (Sundhedsstyrelsen, 2007). There is a need for an improved
      prevention and treatment of exacerbations (Barnes et al., 2013). Despite the poor evidence
      about determinants of physical activity and impact of treatment in COPD patients
      (Gimeno-Santos et al., 2014), a wide range of interventions are commonly used by
      physiotherapist to treat individuals with COPD (Kozu et al., 2011),(Kenn, Gloeckl and Behr,
      2013) (Garrod and Lasserson, 2007). Researchers have shown significant improvement in general
      condition (Lacasse, Guyatt and Goldstein, 1997)(Ries et al., 1995)(Lacasse et al.,
      2009)(Nava, 1998)(Simpson et al., 1992), quality of life (Wijkstra et al., 1995)(Bendstrup et
      al., 1997), long-term survival (Godoy, 2007), sputum clearance (Garrod and Lasserson, 2007)
      (Oldenburg et al., 1979); Health-related quality of life (Almagro and Castro, 2013)
      (Blackstock et al., 2013) (Jones, 2013)(Bendstrup et al., 1997), training of muscle strength
      and exercise tolerance (Ortega et al., 2002)(Bendstrup et al., 1997), walking distance (Ries
      et al., 2007) (Ringbaek et al., 2008) (Wedzicha et al., 1998), exercise capacity, endurance
      (Lacasse, Guyatt and Goldstein, 1997) (Ries et al., 1995) (Lacasse et al., 2009) (Nava, 1998)
      (Simpson et al., 1992); days of hospitalization (Ries et al., 2007) (Griffiths et al., 2000),
      tachypnea (Lacasse, Guyatt and Goldstein, 1997) (Ortega et al., 2002) and morbidity (Godoy,
      2007). Although the advantages of PR are many, its implementation should be placed alongside
      the routine treatment options (Ozalevli et al., 2010). It has been shown that the frequency
      of emergency department presentations and hospital admissions in COPD patients was
      significantly reduced after participation in early discharge care with ongoing follow-up
      support (Lawlor et al., 2009).

      Tele-rehabilitation in COPD Tele-rehabilitation at home is feasible and well accepted by
      patients, although technology may be perceived as difficult (Paneroni et al.,
      2014)(Tousignant et al., 2012). It seems to improve walking capacity, dyspnea, quality of
      life and daily physical activity (Paneroni et al., 2014). The interaction between the COPD
      patients at home and the healthcare professionals at the clinic through TR has evolved as a
      dialogue channel forming the basis for mutual learning processes and new relationships
      (Dinesen et al., 2011). Here, patients exhibit four types of attitudes about their
      tele-rehabilitation: indifference, learning as part of situations in everyday life, feeling
      of security and motivation for performing physical training (Dinesen, Huniche and Toft,
      2013). Preliminary evaluations from tele-rehabilitation initiatives in Scotland showed
      tele-rehabilitation to be more cost effective for patients living in remote areas compared to
      an out-reach- or centralized model (Hill and Sppath, 2010).

      Hypothesis:

      There is still a need for more studies of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of TR, just as
      also the long-term effects of TR have to be determined. To guarantee individuals with COPD a
      qualitative service from health care organizations in the coming decades and economically
      save the national health systems for an expensive bill to treating COPD, new actions plans
      has to be taken in mind in order to treat more patients with less human resources and still
      sustaining or improving today's services. The importance of such welfare action plans has to
      maintain a quality of service that individuals with COPD are willing to accept. Here, TR
      seems to be a good welfare action plans. Despite improved cost effectiveness, evidence
      supporting patient ´s adherence and security, treatment efficacy and improvements of quality
      of life with tele-rehabilitation in COPD is still warranted.

      To assess and compare the feasibility and effect of a follow-up tele-rehabilitation program
      after standard COPD rehabilitation with a new and innovative TR platform (NITRP) compared to
      standard follow-up after COPD rehabilitation with respect to exercise capacity, quality of
      life and activities of daily living in patients with COPD.

      The primary purpose of the study is to assess the effect of tele-rehabilitation after
      standard COPD rehabilitation with a NITRP compared to the usual follow-up after standard COPD
      rehabilitation on exercise capacity and quality of life in COPD patients based on the
      following hypotheses:

      Activities of daily living, exercise capacity and health-related quality of life are equal or
      improved by follow-up tele-rehabilitation after standard COPD rehabilitation compared to
      follow-up.

      The secondary purpose is to investigate the efficacy and cost effectiveness of follow-up
      tele-rehabilitation after standard COPD rehabilitation with a NITRP compared to usual
      follow-up on &quot;number of acute exacerbations and number of visits to the health care system in
      a period of time&quot; and &quot;rehabilitation- and transportation costs&quot; in rehabilitation of COPD
      patients based on the following hypothesis:

      The rehabilitation costs of tele-rehabilitation after standard COPD rehabilitation are lower
      or equal compared to conventional rehabilitation response.
