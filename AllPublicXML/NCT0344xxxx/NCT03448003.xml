  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to develop a cancer prevention program for women who may
      be at risk for breast cancer and who do not have a regular diet, exercise, and stress
      management plan in place. The program will include dietary recommendations, physical
      activity, stress management and mindfulness training, learning sleep hygiene techniques, and
      behavioral counseling in addition to social support.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Baseline Visit:

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, participant will have a baseline visit so
      researchers can measure how participant has changed before and after taking part in the
      prevention program. Participant will come to the clinic for some of these tests/procedures
      and others will be completed at home.

      At the clinic:

        -  Participant will complete questionnaires electronically on a hand-held computer about
           participant's sleeping habits, how participant has been feeling, diet, exercise, and the
           general quality of participant's life. It should take about 30 minutes to complete.

        -  Participant will have strength tests of participant's upper and lower body, lasting no
           more than 30 seconds. During these tests, participant will sit in a chair and then stand
           up and sit down again.

        -  Participant will sit and stand as many times as participant can in 30 seconds.
           Participant will also be asked to perform as many bicep curls as participant can in 30
           seconds while holding a 5-pound weight.

        -  Participant will have a DEXA scan to measure participant's body-fat level. If
           participant can become pregnant, urine will be collected for a pregnancy test. If
           participant is pregnant, participant will not have a DEXA scan.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for tests to measure hormones and
           participant's immune system responses. Participant will need to fast (have nothing to
           eat or drink except water) for 12 hours before this blood draw. Participant will be
           provided with healthy snacks after participant's blood draw.

      At home:

        -  Participant will be given an at-home kit to collect a stool sample to measure
           participant's gut microbiome (the types of bacteria in participant's stomach and
           intestines). This testing will also include genetic testing of the micro-organisms (such
           as bacteria) found in participant's stomach and intestines. Participant will not receive
           the results of this testing. Participant will be given instructions on how to return the
           stool sample back to the Human Genome Sequencing Center at Baylor College of Medicine.

        -  Participant will complete a 6-minute walking test at the clinic. During this test,
           participant will be asked to quickly walk down a hallway of at least 100 feet in length
           or participant will walk on a treadmill for 6 minutes. Researchers will measure how far
           participant can walk in 6 minutes.

        -  Participant will be given an accelerometer to wear for 5 days. The accelerometer
           measures how many steps participant takes each day. At the end of 5 days, participant
           will send the accelerometer back to the study staff in a self-stamped, pre-paid envelope
           that participant will be given.

        -  Saliva will be collected 4 times each day (when participant wakes up, 45 minutes after
           waking up, 10 hours after waking up, and at bedtime) for 3 days in a row to measure
           participant's cortisol levels. Cortisol is a hormone in the body related to stress. To
           collect the saliva, participant will chew on a cotton ball for a few seconds and then
           put the cotton in a small plastic tube (which participant will be given). Participant
           will write down the times at which participant took these samples and then send the
           samples back to the study staff in a self-stamped, pre-paid envelope. The saliva samples
           will be destroyed after being tested.

      The baseline visit will last about 1 day or can be split into 2 half-days.

      Study Groups:

      Participant will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This
      is done because no one knows if one group is better, the same, or worse than the other.

        -  In Group 1, participants will take part in the cancer prevention program for 26 weeks.

        -  In Group 2, participants will not have any intervention for about 6 months but will
           continue to have the study visits described below. After 6 months, participant will be
           able to take part in the cancer prevention program and be part of the study again for a
           similar length of time. Participant will take part in the cancer prevention program for
           an additional 6 months.

      Group 1 Participants Only:

      If participant is in Group 1, participant will take part in a cancer prevention program
      (called mobile integrative oncology prevention program). As part of the cancer prevention
      program, participant will have online sessions counseling participant in the areas of diet,
      exercise, mind-body practice, and behavioral counseling over the course of up to 12 weeks.
      Participant will first have a day-long session, or two half days, in person so participant
      can meet the intervention team. After Week 12 of counseling, an additional 3 dietary,
      exercise, and mind-body sessions may be scheduled over the next 3 months.

      Each week participant will have 1-2 physical activity sessions, 1-2 nutrition and diet
      sessions, and 1-2 mind-body practice sessions (such as yoga) that should last about 60
      minutes each; for a maximum of 12 sessions of each over 12 weeks. Participant will also have
      1 behavioral counseling session each week for up to 26 weeks.

      The intervention programs will be provided by a licensed professional (such as a personal
      trainer, dietician, or yoga instructor). Each session will be video and audiorecorded.

      Participant will be given the contact information for the personal trainer, dietician,
      behavioral counselor, and/or yoga instructor in order to answer any questions or concerns
      participant may have during the study.

      Participant will be given a link to a study-specific website in which participant will set up
      a profile online. The study staff will help participant set up this account using
      participant's email address. If participant does not have an email address, an account will
      be created for participant. This website will be a &quot;hub&quot; for this study. Participant will use
      the website to track participant's diet, exercise, and mind-body exercises (described in more
      detail below). Participant's profile will be password-protected. The website will have
      digital copies of the educational information participant will receive throughout the
      program.

      If participant smokes, participant will also be referred to MD Anderson's Tobacco Treatment
      Program.

      Physical Activity:

      During each online session, a personal trainer will advise participant on types of exercises
      participant should be performing during the week. A personal trainer will work with
      participant's individual fitness level to create an exercise program for participant.
      Participant may be asked to exercise with the trainer during these sessions. The trainer can
      help participant modify the exercises, if needed. Participant should exercise 3-5 times each
      week for about 30-60 minutes each time with varying degrees of intensity. The personal
      trainer will tell participant how often to exercise and how intensely participant should be
      exercising.

      Before exercising, participant will need to receive permission from participant's regular
      care doctor (a medical release). If any medical issues arise that may affect participant's
      safety while performing physical activity, participant will need to be re-evaluated by
      participant's doctor and get a new medical release.

      Participant will use participant's profile on the study website to track participant's
      exercise.

      Diet/Nutrition:

      During the diet/nutrition sessions, participant will be taught to shop and how to cook a
      mostly vegetarian diet. The dietician will tell participant about healthy foods, cooking
      techniques, and which restaurants and places to shop are considered healthy.

      Participant will be asked to use participant's profile on the study website to track
      participant's eating habits.

      Mind-Body Practice:

      During these sessions, participant will be taught about meditation techniques (such as
      deep-breathing exercises) and yoga-based practices. Participant should practice these
      techniques for about 1 hour every day.

      Participant will be asked to use participant's profile on the study website to track
      participant's mind-body practice.

      Behavioral Counseling and Social Support:

      As part of behavioral counseling and social support, participant will be given workbooks on
      paper and online to work on goal-setting and to address barriers participant faces in
      participant's day-to-day life. Participant will meet with a counselor 1 time each week online
      or by phone for 26 weeks. Participant may also join a webinar (a seminar that is held online)
      1 time every month that is hosted by a member of the study staff. Each webinar will cover a
      special topic related to counseling and social support and will involve interactive
      discussions.

      Participant will also have an opportunity to voluntarily take part in a Facebook group for
      program members and staff only, designed to increase sharing of information, recipes,
      experiences, and so on. If participant chooses to belong to this virtual group, participant
      can communicate with others in the program in addition to staff members. Participant does not
      have to take part in the Facebook group to take part in this study.

      Follow-up Visits:

      If participant is in Group 1, participant will have follow-up visits after participant has
      completed 12 weeks of the cancer prevention program and then again about 26 and 52 weeks
      after that.

      If participant is in Group 2, participant will have a follow-up visit at about 12 and 26
      weeks after participant was assigned to Group 2. If participant decides to take part in the
      cancer prevention program, participant will repeat the baseline visit above, take part in the
      program, and then have follow-up visits at 12 weeks after the program and then again about 26
      and 52 weeks after that.

      During these follow-up visits, participant will complete the same tests/procedures performed
      at the baseline visit. Participant will only have a DEXA scan at 26- and 52- weeks. In
      addition, participant will complete questionnaires online on a desktop, laptop, tablet, or
      smartphone about what participant has eaten recently.

      After the 52-week follow-up time point, participant will take part in an interview about
      participant's experience in the study and in making lifestyle changes. This interview will
      last about 30-60 minutes.

      Length of Study Participation:

      Participant's active participation in this study will be over after participant completes the
      follow-up visits.
