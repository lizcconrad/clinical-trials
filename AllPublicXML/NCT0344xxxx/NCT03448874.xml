      Study procedures:

      Pre-surgery:

        -  Screening will be performed among adult subjects who are scheduled for an elective
           colorectal surgery. Once potential eligibility to the study is determined based on the
           study's inclusion/exclusion criteria, study procedures will be explained to the
           candidate and participation will be offered.

        -  Informed consent process.

        -  Pre-surgery assessments will be according to the routine practice at the site and
           determined by the treating physician.

      Intra-operative:

        -  During the surgery, after confirmation of the intra-operative exclusion criteria,
           completion of anastomosis creation and only after leak test was performed , subjects
           will be allocated to one of the two treatment arms with a 1:1 ratio based on a
           randomization scheme (either to the Standard of care (SOC) or to Seal-G MIST arms).

        -  Device (Seal-G MIST System) application (to Seal-G MIST treatment arm only).

      Post-operative follow-up:

        -  Subjects will be followed during post-operative period until discharge from the hospital
           for clinical and subclinical leaks according to the SOC.

        -  In an event of suspected anastomotic leak, patient will be treated according to severity
           of leak and PI clinical judgement (conservative treatment, drainage, diversion,
           anastomosis take down).

        -  Subjects will be followed up for leaks and related AE/SAEs at the day of the surgery and
           for a period of 15 weeks (±2 weeks) post-surgery, including the following activities:

             -  Daily while hospitalized (in accordance with the site routine procedures)

             -  At 1 month (±1 week) and 15 weeks (±2 weeks) post-surgery (Hospitalization for
                elective procedure (i.e. chemotherapy treatments) will not be considered as SAEs)

    <masking_description>This study is single blinded. The subject will be blinded to the treatment arm; however, by nature of the type of the proposed study, blinding of the investigator/ surgeon is not feasible. In order to minimize bias, subjects will be randomized during the surgery upon confirmation of the intra-operative exclusion criteria. This will ensure that the surgeon will not know prior to surgery and until completion of anastomosis creation, whether or not Seal-G MIST will be used.</masking_description>
