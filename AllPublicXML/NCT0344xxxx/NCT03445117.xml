  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia and influenza are among the top causes of hospitalisation and death in the elderly.
      While vaccinations are recommended against these diseases, a large proportion of elderly in
      the community remain unvaccinated, with approximately only 10% vaccinated for either disease.
      In this study, the investigators aim to implement an intervention package within GP clinics
      to increase influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates, especially among elderly patients
      with chronic diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza and pneumococcal disease contribute considerably to hospitalisation and mortality
      in the elderly. While recommended vaccines can reduce disease burden, vaccine uptake remains
      very low in Singapore, with approximately only 10% of elderly appropriately vaccinated for
      either disease. Improving vaccine uptake rates could be effected through private sector
      primary care clinics, which are highly accessible in Singapore. An intervention bundle we
      piloted in one clinic comprised physician reminders and patient-targeted posters and
      brochures. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccine rates both increased by &gt;30% over the baseline,
      although half of eligible patients remained unvaccinated. There is thus scope to devise a
      more effective intervention bundle and demonstrate its efficacy through a more robust and
      generalisable study design.

      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention bundle deployed in general
      practice clinics to promote influenza and pneumococcal vaccine uptake among elderly patients.
      The intervention bundle components include educational materials such as posters and flyers,
      which also serve as reminder slips for attending physicians. The intervention will be
      implemented in a two-arm cluster randomised crossover trial in up to 30 primary care clinics.
      Control arm clinics will receive no interventions. Clinics will be randomised into either of
      the two arms for a period of 3 months, followed by a washout of 1 month before a crossover is
      performed. The investigators will subsequently compare vaccination rates during intervention
      and control periods to provide evidence for effectiveness of the intervention.

    <description>a) The educational intervention comprises putting up posters on vaccination in the clinic, as well as provision of a specially designed flyer to the clinic, which will be handed out by the clinic assistants to all patients 65 years and above, at the point of registration. The poster and flyer content will provide simple messaging to encourage patients to receive influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations and inform them of available healthcare subsidies. b) Reminders to physicians: The flyers will also serve as physical prompts to physicians to encourage vaccination for their patients. Doctors and clinic staff will also be updated on the study protocol and the recommended adult vaccination schedule before commencement of the study.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients seen at our partner GP clinics / FMCs who are 65 years and above, with or
             without chronic disease, inclusive of those who present with acute infections (data
             will be captured and they will be part of the base patient population for our study).
             This is the same target population for both influenza and pneumococcal vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients not seen at our partner GP clinics / FMCs, or who are below 65 years old.
             Based on this criteria, pregnant women are automatically excluded from our study.
