        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with fractures that met these criteria, underwent definitive surgery and had
             complete clinical and radiographic follow up until fracture union at either
             institution were included in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologic fractures, and fractures in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta,
             neuromuscular disorders or any systemic disease that was associated with a
             predisposition to fractures or altered fracture healing were excluded.
