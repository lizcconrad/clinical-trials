  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This partially randomized clinical trial studies how well a behavioral intervention works in
      reducing indoor tanning. Artificial ultraviolet indoor tanning increases the chance of
      developing skin cancers. Behavioral interventions use techniques to help participants change
      the way they react to environmental triggers that may cause a negative reaction.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To use a series of three qualitative research studies and a pilot social media study to
      inform the development of an indoor tanning intervention. (Phase 1a-d) II. To develop and
      evaluate an online tailored indoor tanning (IT) intervention based on findings from phase 1.
      (Phase 2)

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE I (QUALITATIVE RESEARCH AND PILOT STUDY): Participants participate in interviews, focus
      groups, and pilot test of social media through a closed, secret Facebook group to help guide
      intervention development.

      PHASE II (INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT): The web-based, tailored intervention is developed.

      PHASE II (INTERVENTION): Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants receive intervention, weekly text messages about IT reduction, and
      personalized booster intervention. Participants then receive text messages twice weekly for 4
      weeks.

      GROUP II: Participants are placed on wait-list and may receive full intervention after
      follow-up.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3 months.
