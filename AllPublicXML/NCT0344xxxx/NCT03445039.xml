  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Implant placement in the posterior maxilla is always troubled by the insufficient
      bone volume. Trans-alveolar sinus floor elevation (TSFE) has been proven a predictable
      surgical procedure to increase the bone height in the posterior maxilla. However, questions
      as the necessity of the bone grafting is necessary during the sinus lift and could the TSFE
      be performed when the residual bone height is below 5mm are still being debated. Besides,
      high-quality evidence on comparing the clinical outcome of transalveolar sinus floor
      elevation with osteotome and modified sinus floor elevation with crestal non-cutting drills
      is limited.

      Methods/Design: 120 adult patients who fit the inclusion criterions are being recruited from
      the first clinical division, School and Hospital of Peking University (Beijing, China). All
      the patients are assigned into four groups according a table of random numbers. Participants
      receive 1) TSFE using osteotomes with bone grafting; 2) TSFE using osteotomes without bone
      grafting; 3) modified TSFE with bone grafting; and 4) modified TSFE without bone grafting.
      The clinical operators will be concealed with the assignment until the beginning of surgical
      procedures. In a one year follow up period, implant survival rates, complications, implant
      stability, bone remodeling around the implant and patient-reported outcome (visual analogue
      scale for intraoperative discomfort and postoperative pain) are observed and documented. The
      implant stability is gauged by the resonance frequency analysis for 7 times (2,
      4,8,12,16,26,52 weeks). And the bone remodeling is observed and compared by CT scan.

      Discussion: The result of the trial will support a better decision making in atrophy
      posterior maxilla when implant placement is needed. If favorable, the use of the modified
      TSFE would achieve as ideal outcome as the traditional TSFE but with less trauma and
      postoperative discomforts. Besides, whether the bone graft procedure is necessary for the
      TSFE will also be discussed.

    <description>The post operative pain is access by the patient via visual analog scales. The VAS questionnaire consists a 100mm long and two anchors, one at each end. The anchors are verbal &quot;No pain&quot; and &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot;. The patient will mark on the line to represent their pain intensity. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100.</description>
