    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and
      PK/PD of SCB-313 (recombinant human TRAIL-Trimer fusion protein) administered once daily over
      3 days via IP bolus injection for the treatment of cancer patients with recurrent refractory
      malignant ascites.
