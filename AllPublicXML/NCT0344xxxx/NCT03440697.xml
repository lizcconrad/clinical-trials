    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to define the complex genetic and pathogenic basis of
      thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) and other forms of aortopathy and/or aortic valve disease by
      identifying novel disease-causing genes and by identifying important genetic modifiers for
      aortic and aortic valve disease severity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is a type of aortopathy describing dilation of the proximal
      aortic dimensions including the aortic root, which is a risk factor for aortic dissection and
      sudden cardiac death. TAA and other forms of aortopathy (e.g. aortic tortuosity or aortic
      hypoplasia/stenosis) develop in the presence or absence of additional cardiovascular
      malformations including bicuspid aortic valve. TAA is associated with connective tissue
      disorders (e.g. Marfan syndrome), and familial clustering has been identified in a
      significant proportion of nonsyndromic cases, establishing high heritability. Pedigree
      analysis of TAA kindreds clearly identifies complex inheritance; however, progress towards
      understanding the genetic basis of TAA and other forms of aortopathy and, ultimately, the
      susceptibility to aortic dissection remains incomplete. There is a clinical need to develop
      novel methods for predicting disease risk based on genotype and phenotype, to further
      elucidate the genetic and pathogenic mechanisms of aortopathy, and to improve medical and
      surgical therapies. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that individual genetic
      variation modulates susceptibility to disease severity and progression. The goals of this
      study are 1) to ascertain a cohort of subjects who have aortopathy and/or aortic valve
      disease including TAA or who have genetic risk for the development of aortopathy and/or
      aortic valve disease, 2) to collect paired blood and tissue samples from well-characterized
      subjects, family members of subjects, and controls to perform genome-wide DNA sequence,
      histopathologic, transcriptional, and proteomic analyses, and 3) to establish a tissue
      biorepository with detailed phenotype information to facilitate a broad spectrum of current
      and future studies.
