  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Broad, diverse, and innovative efforts are needed to address the growing dual public health
      challenges of obesity and diabetes, especially for those at increased risk like minority
      older adults. The emerging field of health games offers an innovative opportunity to reach
      populations to provide healthy eating and physical activity messages. Little research has
      focused on the use of health games specifically tailored for older adults. This study builds
      upon a health game designed to provide knowledge, facilitate movement, enhance motivation,
      and encourage healthy eating (HE) and physical activity (PA) behaviors in youth. This study
      will adapt, implement, and evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, adherence, and
      preliminary outcomes of the game among overweight/obese African American older adults.
