  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries (tooth decay) is the most prevalent childhood disease in the world. Multiple
      interventions are available to treat and prevent caries. The aim of the proposed study is to
      compare the benefit of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) and fluoride varnish versus fluoride
      varnish and glass ionomer sealants. This study is a five-year, cluster randomized, pragmatic
      controlled trial conducted in public elementary schools in New York City.

    <textblock>
      Dental caries is the most prevalent childhood disease in the world and can lead to infection,
      pain, reduced quality of life, and negative educational outcomes. Multiple prevention agents
      are available to arrest and prevent dental caries, however little is known of the comparative
      effectiveness of combined treatments in pragmatic settings. The aim of the presented study is
      to compare the benefit of silver diamine fluoride and fluoride varnish versus fluoride
      varnish and glass ionomer therapeutic sealants in the arrest and prevention of dental caries.

      This is a longitudinal, pragmatic, cluster randomized, single-blind, non-inferiority trial to
      be conducted in low-income minority children enrolled in public elementary schools in New
      York City, New York, United States, from 2018-2023. The primary objective is to assess the
      non-inferiority of alternative agents in the arrest and prevention of dental caries.
      Secondary objectives are to assess oral health-related quality of life and educational
      outcomes. Caries arrest will be evaluated after two years, and caries prevention and
      secondary outcomes will be assessed at the completion of the study. Data analysis will follow
      intent to treat, and statistical analyses will be conducted using a two-sided significance
      level of 0.05.

      Notably, the standard of care for dental caries is office-based surgery, which presents
      multiple barriers to care including cost, fear, and geographic isolation. The simplicity and
      affordability of silver diamine fluoride may be a viable alternative for the arrest and
      prevention of dental caries in high-risk children.

    <description>One drop (0.05 ml) of silver diamine fluoride (Advantage ArrestTM) solution at 38% concentration (2.24 F-ion mg/dose) will be dispensed per child. Posterior tooth surfaces to be treated will be dried, after which the SDF will be applied with a micro-brush to all asymptomatic carious lesions and to all pits and fissures on bicuspids and molar teeth for thirty seconds. Fluoride varnishes (5% NaF) will then be applied to all teeth.
Dosage frequency will be twice-yearly.</description>

    <description>Pits and fissures on all bicuspids and molar teeth will be sealed with glass ionomer sealants (GC Fuji IX). Glass ionomer sealants (interim therapeutic restorations) will also be placed on all frank asymptomatic carious lesions. Fluoride varnishes (5% NaF) will then be applied to all teeth.
Dosage frequency will be twice-yearly.</description>
