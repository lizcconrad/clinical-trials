  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prospectively compare erectile function at 12 months, utilizing the abbreviated
      International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) score, for men treated with an immediate
      repair versus a delayed repair.

    <textblock>
      This was a prospective randomized study conducted at 2 tertiary level institutions in
      Jamaica, the University Hospital of the West Indies (UHWI) and the Kingston Public Hospital
      (KPH). All cases of penile fracture were recruited from the emergency room (ER) of both
      hospitals between the period January 2015 to January 2017 and all patients were over 18 years
      of age.

      Information on demographics, length of time since the injury, mechanism of injury and risk
      factors for erectile dysfunction (Diabetes mellitus, Hypertension, Dyslipidemia, Smoking) was
      collected. Erectile function was objectively assessed utilizing the abbreviated International
      Index for Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5), and scores at initial presentation were taken to
      represent the premorbid erectile function.

      A block randomization sequence was created and cases were allocated 1:1 to either immediate
      repair (group 1) or delayed repair (group 2). Allocation sequence numbers were kept concealed
      in sequentially numbered folders and access was only granted to the principal investigator.

      For Group 1 (Immediate repair)

      Patients were admitted to hospital and underwent emergency repair via a subcoronal
      circumferential degloving approach.

      For Group 2 (Delayed repair)

      Patients were not admitted. Instead, they were discharged from hospital and given an elective
      surgery date 7 - 10 days after the injury. Oral Diclofenac Sodium 50mg was prescribed to be
      taken as needed and instructions to abstain from any sexual activity.

      All patients were then re-examined at 6 weeks for quality assurance. They were then
      instructed that resumption of sexual activity would be safe.

      Routine clinic visits were scheduled at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. IIEF-5 scores were
      obtained from all patients at 12months.

    <description>The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) is recorded as a total score. It is measured by a self-reported questionnaire with 5 domains, with each domain consisting of 5 options. The score ranges from 5 to 25, with 5 being the lowest score (severe erectile dysfunction) and 25 being the best score (maximal erection).</description>

    <measure>Penile nodule</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The penis is examined and palpated for the presence of nodule formation at the fracture repair site. It is recorded as &quot;present&quot; or &quot;not present&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Penile pain during sexual intercourse</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patient is asked if there is pain in the penis during sexual intercourse. It is recorded as &quot;present&quot; or &quot;not present&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Penile curvature</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patient is asked if there is an acquired curvature of the erect penis. It is recorded as &quot;present&quot; or &quot;not present&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Surgical Satisfaction Questionnaire (SSQ-8) is administered. There are 8 questions with 5 possible options in each domain. The questionnaire results are recorded as descriptive terms for each domain.</description>
