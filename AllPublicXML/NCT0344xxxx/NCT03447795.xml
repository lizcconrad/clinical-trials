  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alveolar bone resorption following tooth extraction is unavoidable. Graft placement following
      extraction is recommended when considering restorative procedures afterwards. The extracted
      tooth was considered a clinical waste. However, it is now seen as a convenient and available
      source for graft material. Different protocols are applied to process the extracted tooth for
      obtaining the graft material and investigations are needed to assess the protocol with the
      best outcome.

    <description>CBCT scans will be taken at first day and at 6 months after the grafting procedures. The scans will be compared using predetermined reference points, buccolingual and vertical dimensions will be measured in cross-sectional images using the same reference points and lines. The difference in mm will be subtracted.</description>

    <description>Bone samples from at least one control and one intervention site will be taken during implant placement. Patients will be asked to sign and additional informed consent. A trephine bur will be used to obtain samples and then sent to the department of oral histology for assessment</description>
