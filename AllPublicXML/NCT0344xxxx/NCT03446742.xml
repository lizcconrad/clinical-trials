  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Despite the various beneficial effects, cardiovascular rehabilitation programs
      (CVRP) have been associated with the appearance of signs and symptoms. Risk stratification
      protocols are used to stratify into risk trials for an occurrence of events during physical
      exercise, although studies investigating their efficacy in predicting signs and symptoms
      during VCTV are inconclusive. In addition, several clinical, physical and biochemical
      parameters have been used in the literature as risk markers for the appearance of adverse
      events, and to investigate whether these parameters are capable of predicting a possibility
      of intercurrences during PRCV sessions.Objectives: 1) to evaluate the efficacy of risk
      stratification protocols in predicting signs and symptoms during the performance of a PRCV;
      2) to analyze the correlation between clinical, physical and biochemical parameters measured
      at rest with the presence of signs / symptoms in participants of a PRCV; 3) to evaluate
      whether changes in clinical, physical or biochemical parameters induced by PRCV influence the
      appearance of signs and symptoms during PRCV. Materials and Methods: To perform this study,
      data from 70 patients inserted in a PRCV will be evaluated. The study will be divided into
      three subprojects that can be divided into three stages: 1) risk stratification of patients
      who will participate in the study by two independent evaluators (Study 1) and evaluation of
      clinical parameters (cardiorespiratory parameters and autonomic modulation evaluation);
      (maximal isometric resistance, maximal isometric contraction, functional capacity and level
      of physical activity) and biochemical (IL-6, TNF-alpha and IL-10) (Studies 2 and 3). Patients
      will then be followed up by 24 sessions during the PRCV routines to evaluate signs and
      symptoms, for posterior correlation with the risk stratification obtained in each protocol
      (Study 1), and with resting values of clinical, physical and biochemical studies (Studies 2
      and 3); 2) Patients perform the normal routines of their PRCV for a period of 6 months (Study
      3); 3) The patients will again have their clinical, physical and biochemical parameters
      evaluated and then will be followed up for another 2 months (24 sessions) during the routines
      of the PRCV sessions to evaluate signs and symptoms, which will allow to evaluate if gains /
      losses in these parameters exert influence on the appearance of signs and symptoms during
      PRCV sessions.

    <description>Initially all patients will have their charts analyzed, from which data will be extracted for characterization of the population, and anthropometric data will be measured for calculation of body mass index. Afterwards, patients will have their clinical, physical and biochemical parameters. They will be followed up for a period of 2 months during the routines of the cardiovascular rehabilitation sessions for assessment of signs and symptoms. In the second stage the patients will perform the normal routines of their cardiovascular rehabilitation program for a period of 6 months. In the third stage, patients will have their clinical, physical and biochemical parameters and then followed up for another 2 months during the routines of the sessions of the cardiovascular rehabilitation program to evaluate signs and symptoms, which will allow to evaluate if gains/losses in the physical parameters can exert influences in the appearance of signs and symptoms during the sessions.</description>

    <description>The cardiovascular rehabilitation program is performed three times weekly on alternate days and each session lasts approximately 60 minutes divided as follows: 5 minutes to the initial rest where blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and signs and symptoms are assessed; 15 minutes of warm-up, composed by global stretches, lower and upper limb exercises, and exercises combining the two modes; then, patients go to the resistance phase (30 minutes), where are performed an individualized aerobic protocol according to their HR reserve values using bicycle and treadmill (at the 4th and 10th minute of both ergometers at HR is evaluated, and in the bicycle is also evaluated the BP of all the patients). The end of the protocol is composed of 10-minute relaxation, during which the patients perform a small cardiovascular deceleration (a few laps around the room, with free speed) and, finally, lie down at rest. The presence of signs and symptoms is assessed at all stages of the program.</description>
