    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled study evaluates the effect of home biofeedback compared to pelvic
      floor physical therapy for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence. Half of the
      participants will use a home biofeedback device for 3 months and the other half will attend
      pelvic floor physical therapy appointments for 3 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biofeedback has been shown to be highly effective the treatment of stress urinary
      incontinence when used in conjunction with pelvic floor physical therapy under the
      instruction of a healthcare provider. Home biofeedback has not been well studied, even though
      several FDA cleared devices are on the market and available for patients to purchase. It is
      unclear if the biofeedback improves women's urinary incontinence, or if the increased contact
      with a healthcare provider causes the improvement.

      Using a home biofeedback device, a woman places the device in her vagina and contracts the
      muscles of her pelvic floor to improve the strength, which can improve or cure incontinence
      when performed over time. Typically it takes 3 months for benefit to be seen.
