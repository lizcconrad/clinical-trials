  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 2 adaptive study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability
      and pharmacokinetics of PF-06730512 following multiple injections in adult subjects with
      primary FSGS. In addition, the intention is to obtain an early indication of efficacy. This
      study may have two doses in two separate cohorts, and it will be conducted in 2 phases: an
      optional longitudinal observational Natural History Phase (Part A) and an adaptive Treatment
      Phase (Part B).
