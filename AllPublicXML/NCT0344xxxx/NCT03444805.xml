      The aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness of various post-transplant treatment
      management approaches on clinical and immune biological responses after Autologous
      Hematopoietic Stem Cell transplantation (AHSCT) for Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) as currently
      performed by the different treatment protocols used in routine clinical practice across
      Europe in various EBMT centres

      NISSc-2 is a prospective observational study specifically designed to assess the
      effectiveness of various post-transplant treatment management approaches on clinical and
      immune biological responses after Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell transplantation (AHSCT)
      for Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) as currently performed by the different treatment protocols used
      in routine clinical practice across Europe in various EBMT centres through the careful
      recording and analysis of routinely collected clinical and immune biological data, and
      specific data regarding post-transplant use of SSc active treatments, including:

        -  Steroids,

        -  SSc active treatments after AHSCT such as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), azathioprine,
           cyclophosphamide (oral or IV), methotrexate, polyclonal antibodies (such as ATG) or
           monoclonal antibodies (rituximab, belimumab or any others) as well as their respective
           dosage and duration of each treatment. These post-transplant treatments can be
           administered for various reasons, which can be specified by local investigators, such as
           per local protocol decision for maintenance therapy, or for disease progression with or
           without prior clinical response, during routine clinical follow-up. Patients who do not
           receive any post-transplant therapy will also be observed.

      Different protocols are used in the different centres, but it is not yet clear, which
      approach will be the most efficient and the safest. The role of stem cell purification with
      CD34-selection also needs to be determined prospectively.

      In addition, the EBMT Autoimmune Diseases and Immunobiology Working Parties developed and
      implemented guidelines for 'good laboratory practice' in relation to procurement, processing,
      storage and analysis of biological specimens for immune reconstitution studies in AD patients
      before, during and after AHSCT [16]. To follow post-transplant immune reconstitution
      according to ADWP GCP, results of routine analyses performed by centres under standardized
      conditions on available biological samples will be investigated in correlation to clinical
      outcome parameters. Every centre will follow its own local protocol for AHSCT, which usually
      refers to the recent update of the EBMT guidelines for AHSCT in autoimmune disease.

      We therefore specifically designed NISCC-II to prospectively capture various post-ASHCT
      management protocols and their effect on the observed clinical response after AHSCT.
