  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the quantitative effects of sodium-free chloride
      supplementation on electrolyte balance, volume status, and sodium avidity in stable heart
      failure patients in a highly controlled environment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the biology
      and therapeutic potential of sodium-free chloride supplementation. While sodium homeostasis
      has been the focus of substantial investigation, very little research has been devoted to
      understanding chloride homeostasis. Thus, this proposal is designed to obtain the full
      spectrum of information pertaining to chloride, such as novel areas with great interest by
      the scientific community (i.e. modulation of the WNK-kinase system and the use of exosomes),
      to more practical/basic questions (i.e. what happens to sodium chloride balance when a
      patient is challenged with chloride).

      This study is designed as a highly controlled inpatient &quot;GCRC&quot; arm to be compared to a real
      world efficacy study that has been proposed as a separate study. With extensive biobanking
      and analysis of samples in the inpatient setting, we will be able to deliver a great wealth
      of information on the biology and therapeutic potential of manipulating chloride homeostasis
      in heart failure.
