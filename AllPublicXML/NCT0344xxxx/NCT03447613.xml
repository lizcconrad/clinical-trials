  <brief_summary>

      To test the hypothesis that retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness is correlated with Aβ
      and Tau concentration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in an older population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness changing has been reported in Alzheimer's Disease
      (AD) patients at an early stage, and has been demonstrated as a potential biomarker able to
      predict cognitive deterioration (Hinton DR et al., N Engl J Med 1986; London A et al. Nat Rev
      Neurol 2013; Chang LY et al., Alzheimers Dement 2014). However, whether RNFL thickness is
      correlated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) features of AD pathogenesis (e.g., Aβ and Tau)
      remains unclear. The investigators thus conducted this observational cohort study to test the
      correlation between RNFL thickness changing and CSF, to further validate RNFL as a potential
      AD biomarker.

      1 ml of CSF was collected from a spinal needle by anesthesiologists during the spinal
      anesthesia before the administration of the local anesthetic. The CSF was collected in an
      Eppendorf tube and was immediately stored in a -80 °C degree freezer until the time of
      measurement.
