      All participants will be subjected to Serum measurements of CA-125 by the immunoradiometric
      assay, Ultrasound evaluation of the Adnexal masses which is described according to origin
      (ovarian/extraovarian); position (right/left/bilateral); number of lesions; type of lesions
      (unilocular/multilocular); size in three dimensions (longitudinal, anteroposterior and
      transverse diameters); intracystic fluid echogenicity; number of loculations; presence and
      size of septations (only thickest one of septations is considered); presence, number and size
      of solid papillary projections (largest thickness is considered); presence and size of the
      largest solid component (three diameters); presence and measurement of fluid volume in the
      posterior cul-de-sac and presence and location of lesions suggestive of metastases. Then
      surgical intervention will be done with pathological examination of the specimen
