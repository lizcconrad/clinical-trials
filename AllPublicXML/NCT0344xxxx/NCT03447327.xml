  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the work: Is to evaluate the prognosis of single burr hole under local anesthesia in
      management of CSDH according to clinical picture, risk factors, and age.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients and methods: We studied 67 consecutive patients with CSDH operated by single burr
      hole craniostomy under local anaesthesia from Mars, 2014 to February, 2015 in Zagazig
      University Hospitals according to the aetiology, clinical picture, risk factors, and
      complications.
