    <textblock>
      Although mannitol is used for brain relaxation during neurosurgery and in the treatment of
      raised intracranial pressure; there is not a consensus on its safe, effective dose and the
      duration of its administration. This study aimed to compare the effects of the mannitol in
      different use times, on the brain relaxation, electrolyte, lactate levels of the blood,
      peroperative fluid balance and the volume of the urine in supratentorial mass resection
      surgeries.

    <description>difference in brain relaxation after drug administration
The assessment was performed using a 4-point scale,
1 denoting bulging or the condition that additional methods for brain relaxation are immediately and always required in order to continue the surgical procedure because of brain swelling;
2, firm or the condition that additional methods for brain relaxation are occasionally required to continue the surgical procedure;
3, adequate; 4, perfectly relaxed.
In all patients, the degree of brain relaxation was assessed at the time of dural opening and satisfactory brain relaxation was defined as a brain relaxation score of 3 or 4.
