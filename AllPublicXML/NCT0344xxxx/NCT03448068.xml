  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid medications such as morphine, hydrocodone and oxycodone are standard for treating pain
      after surgery, however there are disadvantages. Because of the way opioids work, gastric
      bypass patients may have an increased risk of having sedation or problems with breathing. In
      patients with sleep apnea, opioids may increase the risk of severe apnea.

      Ketamine is an alternative pain medicine that can be used to treat pain after surgery and may
      have fewer effects on breathing. Using ketamine as part of the regimen may be a better choice
      for laparoscopic gastric bypass patients.

      This study is being done to find out if intraoperative ketamine infusion combined with
      continuation for twenty-four hours post-surgery provides superior pain control and decreases
      post-operative opioid use versus standard non-ketamine therapy.
