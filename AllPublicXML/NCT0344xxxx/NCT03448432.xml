    <textblock>
      Anemia during pregnancy occurs in 41% of women. The most common etiology is iron deficiency,
      but studies to determine prevalence of other causes of anemia in pregnancy are still lacking.
      However, anemia in pregnancy lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes and increase risk of maternal
      and f≈ìtal morbidity and mortality. Specific management of anemia is so needed.
