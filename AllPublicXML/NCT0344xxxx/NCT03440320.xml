      Aim 1: Develop and manualize the MY-Skills intervention. Using focus groups, clinical
      reasoning, literature, and findings from previously tested interventions of yoga and
      self-management, the researchers will develop, refine, and standardize the MY-Skills
      intervention for chronic pain. In parallel, the researchers will develop a control group that
      includes exercise and health and wellness education. The expected outcomes include MY-Skills
      intervention workbooks for participants and training and teaching manuals for
      interventionists leading the MY-Skills intervention group and control group.

      Aim 2: Assess feasibility and acceptability of MY-Skills and research procedures including
      planned assessments. In this small RCT, the researchers will examine feasibility and
      acceptability of the 8-week MY-Skills procedures and intervention compared to an exercise and
      health and wellness education control group. Participants will include 30 caregiving dyads
      randomly assigned to the two groups (15 dyads for My-Skills and 15 dyads for control group; N
      = 30 dyads/60 participants). The primary hypothesis is that MY-Skills will be feasible and
      acceptable to caregiving dyads, as measured by benchmarks for recruitment, screening,
      attendance, and completion of assessments and intervention. Surveys will be administered and
      focus groups will be conducted to understand participant satisfaction and experiences with
      MY-Skills. After each intervention session, interventionists, caregivers, and care recipients
      will rate their satisfaction with the session content and activities.

      The long-term goal of this study is to advance best practices in complementary and
      integrative health (CIH) to improve health for caregivers and individuals with chronic
      disabilities. This proposal is focused on merging exercise and education to improve pain for
      individuals in a caregiving dyad. The objective of this study is to develop and test the
      MY-Skills intervention, thus, addressing the critical need for innovative pain interventions
      focusing on the caregiving dyad. To achieve this objective and support a future randomized
      controlled trial (RCT), the researchers will conduct a mixed-methods study, including a small
      RCT.

      focus groups will be conducted to understand participant satisfaction and experiences with
      MY-Skills. After each intervention session, interventionists, caregivers, and care recipients
      will rate their satisfaction with the session content and activities. To assess change on the
      primary outcome (pain-related disability) and secondary outcome measures, members of the
      caregiving dyad will complete pre and post-assessments guided by the Biopsychosocial model.
