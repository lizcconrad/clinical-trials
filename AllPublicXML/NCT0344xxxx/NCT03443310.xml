    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a prospective comparative study. All patients will receive
      prophylactic anticoagulation according to routine hospital protocol after surgery. A bedside
      ultrasound examination will be performed by a trained anesthesiologist prior to the surgery
      and then daily beginning on postoperative day 2 until patient discharge.

      Recent studies conducted at the emergency department evaluated the usefulness of an
      abbreviated bedside compression ultrasound test for diagnosis of Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT)
      in the proximal region. This abbreviated ultrasound test conducted in the groin and popliteal
      regions to assess the compressibility of the femoral and popliteal veins required as little
      as 3.5 min to complete 15 and can be easily mastered by residents with minimum training.
      These studies showed a promising sensitivity ranging from 70% to 100% and a specificity
      ranging from 75.9% to 99.6%.

      Anesthesiologists are now well-trained in performing ultrasound scans as they perform
      ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve blocks routinely. Scanning for significant proximal DVT
      could potentially be anesthesiologists' extended role as they follow up patients who
      underwent orthopedic surgeries for postoperative pain control as part of the acute pain
      service.
