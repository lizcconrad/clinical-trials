  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social difficulties are serious and frequent complicating factors in the treatment of
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To better understand how treatment of post-traumatic
      stress disorder impacts neural mechanisms of social cognition, the investigators are
      examining behavior and brain processes associated with response to Trauma Management Therapy.
      Understanding the behavioral and neural impact of psychotherapy may contribute to development
      of more effective treatments for PTSD.

    <textblock>
      PTSD is associated with significant interpersonal difficulties that interfere with
      functioning. As such, this work is intended to evaluate the empirical support for a novel
      treatment that fills a significant gap in the treatment options available to Veterans with
      PTSD who suffer with interpersonal difficulties. In this study the investigators will (i)
      evaluate the efficacy of Trauma Management Therapy (TMT) for treating PTSD-related
      interpersonal dysfunction, as well as PTSD-related fear and anxiety, and (ii) evaluate neural
      mediators of clinical improvements associated with TMT.

      This work will provide insights into the mechanisms by which treatments may lead to
      improvements in social functioning, informing both the biological basis of psychotherapy and
      the development and refinement of alternative therapeutic interventions targeting social
      impairments.

      Treatment seeking Veterans with PTSD will be randomized to one of two treatments: (i) Trauma
      Management Therapy, consisting of 15 sessions of individualized exposure therapy followed by
      14 sessions of group-based social and emotional rehabilitation, or (ii)
      Exposure+Psychoeducation consisting of 15 sessions of individualized exposure therapy
      followed by 14 sessions of group-based psychoeducation. Veterans enrolled in both the TMT and
      EXP+EDU arms will undergo functional neuroimaging as they engage in an emotional image
      viewing task, as well as two social interaction tasks. Neurobehavioral assessments will be
      made prior to and following completion of treatment.

    <measure>Change in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5</measure>
    <time_frame>CAPS-5 will be assessed at two time-points per participant: pre-treatment (week 0) and at completion of treatment (week 8).</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5; Weathers et al. 2013; 2017) is a 30 item semi-structured instrument for the diagnosis and assessment of severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Each DSM-5 item is rated on a 0 (absent) to 4 (extreme/incapacitating) scale, and total score is calculated by summing severity scores across items. Total CAPS-5 severity can range from 0 to 80.</description>

    <measure>Change in Social Adjustment Scale - Self-Report</measure>
    <time_frame>SAS will be assessed at two time-points: pre-treatment to treatment (week 0) and at completion of treatment (week 8).</time_frame>
    <description>The Social Adjustment Scale (SAS; Weissman &amp; Bothwell, 1976) is a 54 item self-report measure that assesses social adjustment in six social areas of functioning including work, social and leisure activities, extended family, marital, parental, and family. Each item is rated on a five point scale, and within each of domain items are averaged. Thus, scores in each domain can range between 1 (high social adjustment) and 5 (low social adjustment).</description>

    <description>The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5; Weathers et al., 2013; Bovin et al., 2016) is a 20 item self-report measure assessing DSM-5 PTSD symptom severity. Each DSM-5 item is rated on a 0 (absent) to 4 (extreme/incapacitating) scale, and total score is calculated by summing severity scores across items. Total CAPS-5 severity can range from 0 to 80.</description>

    <description>Change in Aggression Questionnaire (AQ; Buss &amp; Warren, 2000) is a 34 item self-report measure that assesses severity of self-perceived aggression and anger. Each item is rated on a 1 (Not at all like me) to 5 (Completely like me) scale, and total scores can range from 34 to 170.</description>

    <description>Change in Interpersonal Trust Scale (ITS; Rotter, 1967) is a 25 item self-report measure that assesses trust within relationships. Each item is rated on a 1 (low trust) to 5 (high trust) scale, and total scores can range from 25 to 125.</description>
