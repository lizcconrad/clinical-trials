  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate efficacy and safety of fibrinogen concentrate
      BT524, when administered to patients with major blood loss during elective spine surgery.The
      study aims to demonstrate that BT524 is at least not worse than the comparator fresh frozen
      plasma in reducing intra-operative blood loss.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibrinogen is the first coagulation factor to become critically reduced during
      intra-operative bleeding. Therefore, rapid fibrinogen supplementation to restore
      physiological plasma levels is an important component to achieve and maintain hemostasis in
      bleeding patients. In this study, patients with major blood loss during elective spine
      surgery will be randomized 1:1 to a single intravenous transfusion of the fibrinogen
      concentrate BT524 or to fibrinogen-containing fresh frozen plasma (FFP).
