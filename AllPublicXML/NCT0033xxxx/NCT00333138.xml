    <time_frame>Month 6,12,60 and Last observation (up to 80 months in average)</time_frame>
    <description>The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is a scale for assessing disability in 8 functional systems (visual, brain stem, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel &amp; bladder, cerebral, other functions). An overall score ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS) is calculated. Disability progression was determined by the EDSS score based on the following criteria: One point increase from baseline in patients with baseline EDSS score from 0 to 5.0; or half a point increase in patients with baseline EDSS score of 5.5 or above. Percent of patients free of disability progression was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The last observation was the last observation available for each patient which ranged from 1 to 2801 days</description>

    <time_frame>Month 3 and 6</time_frame>
    <description>For each patient, the arithmetic mean of the two FTY720 trough blood levels from month 3 and 6 was calculated. This was taken as the patient's steady-state trough levels. Venous blood samples (3 mL) were collected before the dose in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-containing tubes at protocol-scheduled visits at months 3 and 6 in all patients.</description>

             practicing an acceptable method of birth control. Females of childbearing potential
             with a negative pregnancy test at baseline prior to entry into the treatment period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Core Study

          -  Patients with other chronic disease of the immune system, malignancies, pulmonary or
             heart disease, etc

          -  Pregnant or nursing women

        Extension Study

          <description>A patient was defined as free of lesions if s/he had zero lesions. The sum of all new T2-weighted lesions at Month 1 to last observation was zero (the sum is missing if one of the assessments was missing).

Extension: In dose -blind period and open label, fingolimod 1.25 mg once daily for 9-18 months (6 months to 24 months). Later, all patients converted to fingolimod 0.5 mg, once daily for rest of the study participation.</description>

        <title>Time to Event Analysis: Kaplan Meier Estimates of Percentage of Relapse-free Patients</title>
        <description>The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is a scale for assessing disability in 8 functional systems (visual, brain stem, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel &amp; bladder, cerebral, other functions). An overall score ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS) is calculated. Disability progression was determined by the EDSS score based on the following criteria: One point increase from baseline in patients with baseline EDSS score from 0 to 5.0; or half a point increase in patients with baseline EDSS score of 5.5 or above. Percent of patients free of disability progression was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The last observation was the last observation available for each patient which ranged from 1 to 2801 days</description>

        <description>For each patient, the arithmetic mean of the two FTY720 trough blood levels from month 3 and 6 was calculated. This was taken as the patient’s steady-state trough levels. Venous blood samples (3 mL) were collected before the dose in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-containing tubes at protocol-scheduled visits at months 3 and 6 in all patients.</description>
