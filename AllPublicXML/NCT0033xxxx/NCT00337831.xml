  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be treated with hemodiafiltration (HDF) in postdilution mode, as a control
      therapy, during 9 weeks. During week 5 the 1st intervention treatment, predilution
      hemofiltration (HF) or predilution HDF, will be performed as a midweek session. After 4
      additional weeks of control therapy the other intervention treatment will be performed.
      Samples will be taken during week 4, 5 and 9: from inlet blood flow (0, 30, 60, 120 and 240
      min), from outlet blood flow and dialysate outflow (30, 60, 120 and 240 min).
