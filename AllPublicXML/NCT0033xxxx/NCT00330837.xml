  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inadvertent puncture of an unintended object in a vascular access procedure is common and can
      lead to serious consequences. Inadvertent common carotid artery (CCA) puncture while
      targeting the internal jugular vein (IJV), for example, is reported to have an incidence of
      2% - 8% and usually results in localized hematoma formation. The hematoma may enlarge rapidly
      if the patient is coagulopathic, or if a large puncture wound is produced by the introduction
      of the sheath itself into the CCA. Airway obstruction, pseudoaneurysm, arterio-venous fistula
      formation and retrograde aortic dissection have all been reported as a consequence of CCA
      puncture. In the presence of occlusive (atheromatous) carotid disease, inadvertent puncture
      may carry the risk of precipitating a cerebrovascular accident.

      In this study, we aim to collect color Doppler and B-mode ultrasound videos from the most
      common ultrasound-guided vascular access sites - internal jugular vein, subclavian vein,
      femoral vein, basilic vein, and brachial vein. The videos will also include structures in
      close proximity to the intended veins. Using such database, we will run various vessel
      tracking and identification algorithms to evaluate their performance. Our ultimate goal is to
      develop an algorithm that will aid the ultrasound operator in identifying structures and
      differentiating between arteries and veins.
