    <measure>The study will evaluate the feasibility of using helical tomotherapy to deliver IMRT in post-hysterectomy endometrial cancer patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year from the start of radiation therapy.</time_frame>
    <description>The study will be deemed infeasible if greater than 10% of patients experience one of the following:
Patient cannot be given the treatment because her anatomy is such that a dosimetrically satisfactory treatment plan cannot be devised for her.
The patient experiences any grade 4 acute toxicity judged to be related to her external radiation treatment.
Within 1 year of the start of radiation therapy, the patient develops any grade 4 late toxicity judged to be related to her external radiation treatment.
Within 1 year of the start of radiation therapy, the patient develops any in-field pelvic recurrence.
Within 1 year of the start of radiation therapy, the patient dies from causes judged to be related to her treatment.</description>

    <description>IMRT (upper third of vagina &amp; para-vaginal tissue and the common, external and internal iliac nodal regions) 160-180 cGy daily fractions for a total dose of 4500-5120 cGy. Once a day treatment four to five days a week for approximately 6 weeks.
Intracavitary vaginal brachytherapy - some patients will be given this and it will be decided by the treating physician.
Carboplatin - AUC 6, IV over 30-60 minutes following completion of paclitaxel, given once every 3 weeks (3 weeks=1 cycles) for a total of 6 cycles
Paclitaxel - 175 mg/m2, 3 hour continuous IV infusion, administered prior to carboplatin, given once every 3 weeks (3 weeks=1 cycles) for a total of 6 cycles</description>
