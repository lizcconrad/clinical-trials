    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial is studying two different combination chemotherapy regimens
      to compare how well they work when given before a peripheral stem cell transplant in treating
      young patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors or
      high-risk medulloblastoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) together with a peripheral stem cell transplant
      may allow more chemotherapy to be given so that more tumor cells are killed. It is not yet
      known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective when given before a peripheral
      stem cell transplant in treating supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors or
      medulloblastoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if treatment of pediatric patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial primitive
      neuroectodermal CNS tumors or high-risk medulloblastoma with intensive induction chemotherapy
      comprising vincristine, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, and cisplatin in combination with
      high-dose methotrexate and leucovorin calcium followed by consolidation chemotherapy
      comprising carboplatin and thiotepa and peripheral blood stem cell rescue results in a higher
      complete response rate then in patients treated with the same regimen without high-dose
      methotrexate and leucovorin calcium.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether biologic characterization of these tumors will refine therapeutic
      stratification separating atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors from primitive neuroectodermal
      tumors (PNETs) and possibly identifying other markers of value for stratification within the
      group of PNETs.

      II. Compare event-free survival and patterns of failure in patients treated with these
      regimens.

      III. Compare the acute, chronic, and late effects of these regimens, particularly in terms of
      tolerance to the same consolidation regimen after treatment with 2 different induction
      regimens, in these patients.

      IV. Compare the gastrointestinal and nutritional toxicities of these regimens in these
      patients.

      V. Compare the quality of life outcomes in patients treated with these regimens.

      VI. Compare the neuropsychological effects of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      diagnosis* (M0 medulloblastoma with ≥ 1.5 cm² residual tumor vs M1 medulloblastoma [positive
      lumbar CSF cytology] vs M2, M3, or M4 medulloblastoma vs supratentorial PNET [any M-stage] vs
      M0 medulloblastoma &lt; 8 months without residual disease or with &lt; 1.5 cm² radiographic
      measurable residual tumor vs anaplastic M0 medulloblastoma without residual disease or with &lt;
      1.5 cm² radiographic measurable residual vs classic M0 (nondesmoplastic) medulloblastoma with
      &lt; 1.5 cm² radiographic measurable residual tumor).

      NOTE: *All diagnoses are for children &lt; 36 months unless otherwise noted.

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 induction treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive vincristine IV on days 1, 8, and 15; etoposide IV over 1 hour on days
      1-3; cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 2; cisplatin IV over 6 hours on day 3; and
      filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 4 and continuing until blood
      counts recover. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive vincristine IV on days 1, 8, and 15; high-dose methotrexate IV over
      4 hours on day 1; and leucovorin calcium IV or orally every 6 hours beginning on day 2 and
      continuing until methotrexate levels are in a safe range. Once methotrexate levels are in a
      safe range, patients then receive etoposide IV over 1 hour on approximately days 4, 5, and 6,
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on approximately days 4 and 5, and cisplatin IV over 6 hours
      on approximately day 6. Patients also receive G-CSF IV or SC beginning 24 hours after the
      completion of chemotherapy and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every
      3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      In both arms, patients with stable disease or partial response after induction therapy
      proceed to second-look surgery followed by consolidation therapy. Patients with a complete
      response after induction therapy proceed directly to consolidation therapy.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Beginning no more than 6 weeks after completion of induction therapy,
      patients receive consolidation therapy comprising carboplatin IV over 2 hours and thiotepa IV
      over 2 hours on days 1 and 2 and G-CSF IV or SC beginning on day 54 and continuing until
      blood counts recover. Patients also receive autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) IV
      on day 4. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and tissue samples are collected at baseline for correlative studies, including gene
      expression profiling, biological marker analysis (i.e., cMyc, ErbB2/ErbB4), comparative
      genome analysis, and mutation analysis.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for 4 years and then
      annually thereafter.
