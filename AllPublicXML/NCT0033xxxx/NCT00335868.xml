      RATIONALE: PHA-739358 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well PHA-739358 works in treating patients with
      chronic myelogenous leukemia that relapsed after imatinib mesylate or c-ABL therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Explore the clinical efficacy of PHA-739358, in terms of hematological response lasting
           ≥ 4 weeks, in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia that relapsed after imatinib
           mesylate or c-ABL therapy.

        -  Explore the safety profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Explore the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug and its N-oxide metabolite PHA-816359
           in plasma.

        -  Explore the modulation of histone H3 and CRKL phosphorylation after PHA-739358
           administration.

        -  Explore the relationship between plasma drug levels and the modulation of histone H3 and
           CRKL phosphorylation.

        -  Explore the clinical efficacy of this drug, in terms of cytogenetic response in bone
           marrow.

        -  Explore response depending on status of T315I mutation in BCR-ABL kinase.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive PHA-739358 IV over 6 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      benefitting from treatment may receive additional courses at the discretion of the
      investigator.

      Patients undergo blood collection and bone marrow biopsies periodically for pharmacologic and
      biomarker correlative studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16 patients will be accrued for this study.
