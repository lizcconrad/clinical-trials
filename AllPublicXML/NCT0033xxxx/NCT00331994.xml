      Primary objective: to assess the efficacy of Bacillus clausii versus metronidazole in the
      eradication of the small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, 30 days after the end of treatment.

      Secondary objective: to assess the efficacy of Bacillus clausii versus metronidazole in
      avoiding recurrence of the small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, 90 days after the end of
      the treatment; to assess the efficacy of Bacillus clausiiversus metronidazole in improving
      irritable bowel syndrome -related symptoms; to assess the efficacy of Bacillus clausii versus
      metronidazole in the satisfactory relief of overall irritable bowel syndrome symptoms and of
      abdominal discomfort or pain; to assess the efficacy of Bacillus clausii versus metronidazole
      in improving irritable bowel syndrome quality of life.
