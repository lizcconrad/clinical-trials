  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to assess the effects of an ankle strap on the effectiveness of a
      laterally-wedged insole with ankle strapping in reducing knee symptoms and improving static
      and dynamic lower limb biomechanics. Using a repeated measures, modified cross-over design,
      the following aims and hypotheses will be addressed:

      Biomechanical Hypotheses

        1. Use of the insole with ankle strapping significantly alters hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle
           towards 180Â° or talar valgus angulation.

        2. Use of the insole with ankle strapping significantly reduces peak knee external varus
           moment during gait.

        3. Use of the insole with ankle strapping significantly reduces foot external rotation
           (out-toeing) or widened base during gait analysis.

        4. The radiographic HKA angle and tilt angle of the talus will predict knee peak external
           varus moment during gait.

      Clinical Hypotheses

      1. The use of an insole with ankle strapping over a two-week period will reduce knee pain
      (Visual analogue scale, and Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Survey).

      Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a common cause of pain and disability and the medial
      compartment is involved most frequently. If conservative mechanical therapies could reduce
      knee OA symptoms, risks to patients might be minimized through reduction in use of
      pharmacotherapy or surgery. A lateral heel wedge with strapping of the ankle joint has been
      reported to induce a similar therapeutic effect to that of proximal tibial osteotomy. It is
      presumed that the mechanism for this involves correction of genu varum. However, the effects
      on the static lower limb mechanical axis and the dynamic knee adduction moment, a risk factor
      for knee OA symptoms and progression, have not been assessed, so the mechanism of effect is
      currently unknown. The proposed protocol would compare lower limb mechanical alignment
      (measured by radiographic hip-knee-ankle angle) and dynamic knee varus moment (measured by
      3-dimensional gait analysis) with and without the strapped insole to further understanding of
      the mechanism of effect on subjects with knee OA. Additionally, this protocol would assess
      analgesia and whether use of the insole reduces known knee joint unloading compensatory
      mechanisms during gait. Through measurement of radiographic lower limb alignment, dynamic
      knee varus moment, and ankle/foot static and dynamic angles, a model would be developed
      relating radiographs with dynamic moments, potentially allowing greater risk stratification
      for knee OA development and progression through use of radiographs. In addition to
      elucidating the mechanism of effect of this insole and developing a model for radiographic
      interpretation, this protocol would be the fist study of this insole involving non-Japanese
      subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects aged 45 or over will be included if they have predominantly medial
             compartment knee OA by American College of Rheumatology criteria, with medial knee
             pain rated at least 40/100mm on a visual analogue scale on most days of the month
             during one of the past 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential subjects with a body mass index (BMI) of greater than 35 will be excluded to
             avoid the potential confounding effect of increased weight on the height of the
             insole. Other exclusion criteria will include: known injury or surgery involving bone
             or cartilage of the knee or ankle which may alter gait, history of factors which might
             alter response to use of a laterally wedged insole (e.g. greater or similar reduction
             in lateral compared with medial femorotibial jont space width on posterior-anterior
             radiographs, tibial osteotomy, congenital foot problems, fused joints, foot deformity,
             known limitation of range of motion of the subtalar joint), known neuromuscular
             disease, co-morbid disease which might confound gait analysis (e.g. hip OA, ankle OA,
             hallux rigidus, valgus deformity of the midfoot, other symptomatic deformity of the
             foot, advanced arthroplasty of the hindfoot, previous ankle arthrodesis, unable to
             walk without a gait aid), current use of an orthotic insole, inability to comply with
             study protocol.
