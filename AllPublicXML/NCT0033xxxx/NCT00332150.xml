  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parental approval to enroll their sick children in clinical research was studied. However,
      the motivation of parents to enroll healthy children and/or babies was not yet studied. The
      importance of clinical research among the healthy population is of extreme value. The aim of
      this study is to assess the motivation, medical trust and other factors influencing parents'
      decision to enroll their healthy baby in a clinical study.

      Mothers to either healthy full-term babies post delivery or preterms will be asked to
      anonymously answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire includes demographic data, questions
      regarding their approach to medical issues, factors that influence her to enroll her baby in
      a research trial (different research types, different benefits from the research and fears).
      Finally, the mother will be asked if she will be willing to enroll her baby to on-going
      studies in the department.
