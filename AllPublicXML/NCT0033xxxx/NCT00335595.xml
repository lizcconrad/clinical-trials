      The purpose of this study is to compare the free time to disease progression of combination
      therapy with capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab until disease progression versus
      capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab for 6 cycles followed by bevacizumab until disease
      progression or a premature drop out of the study.
