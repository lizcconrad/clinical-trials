  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of Femara (letrozole)
      and Gleevec (imatinib mesylate) can shrink or slow the growth of the tumor in patients who
      have hormonal sensitive advanced breast cancer.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To determine the efficacy of Letrozole plus Imatinib Mesylate in patients with ER and or
           PgR positive metastatic breast cancer. Efficacy will be measured by the rate of clinical
           tumor response.

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of Letrozole plus Imatinib Mesylate in patients
           with metastatic breast cancer.

        -  To determine the time to disease progression and overall survival in patients with
           metastatic breast cancer who are treated with Letrozole plus Imatinib Mesylate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Letrozole is an antihormonal drug used in the standard treatment of advanced hormonal
      sensitive breast cancer. Imatinib mesylate is a drug (not chemotherapy) that binds to certain
      proteins on the tumor cells and prevents them from further growth. Imatinib mesylate is
      thought to prevent the potential resistance to letrozole, which may make the letrozole more
      effective.

      Before the treatment starts, you will have blood tests (2-4 teaspoons), CT scans of your
      chest and abdomen, and a bone scan. Blood tests (2-4 teaspoons) will be repeated every week
      for 4 weeks and then every month for the length of the study. The blood tests are done to
      evaluate how the drug affects breast cancer related markers in the blood. These blood tests
      will be done at screening, and then at Months 2 and 4. The CT scans will be repeated every 2
      months as is standard for your care.

      You will take letrozole once a day by mouth and imatinib mesylate twice a day by mouth until
      intolerable side effects occur or until your tumor grows further. You will stop the treatment
      if your tumor grows or intolerable side effects occur.

      This is an investigational study. Letrozole is FDA approved for the treatment of advanced
      breast cancer and is commercially available. Imatinib mesylate is approved for chronic
      myelogenous leukemia and is being investigated for use in the treatment of breast cancer. A
      total of 45 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Postmenopausal women able to comply with the protocol requirements with metastatic
             breast cancer, whose tumors are estrogen (ER) and/or progesterone (PgR) positive,
             defined by core biopsy immunohistochemistry with greater than 10% positive malignant
             epithelial cells.

             immunohistochemistry.

             may have previously received chemotherapy in the adjuvant/ neoadjuvant setting, though
             this is not required. Prior chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer is allowed.
             Concomitant bisphosphonates are allowed for patients with bone metastases and who have
             another site of measurable disease.

          4. Post menopausal status defined by one of the following : no spontaneous menses for at

             New York Heart Association's Functional Classification).

          4. Other concurrent malignant disease with the exception of cone-biopsied in situ
             carcinoma of the cervix uteri, or adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma
             of the skin, or other curable cancers e.g. Hodgkin's disease or NHL, provided 5 years
