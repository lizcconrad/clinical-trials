  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase II study to allow patients with advanced kidney cancer access to sunitinib malate
      treatment and to find out the good and bad effects of taking 37.5 mg sunitinib malate in a
      continuous daily regimen (once per day) for one year.

    <description>OR = subjects with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) persisting &gt; = 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. A CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions.

Total FKSI score = sum score of the 15 item scores; total range: 0 - 60; 0 (most severe symptoms and concerns) to 60 (no symptoms or concerns).

For each question, patient rates condition for the past week on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Total FACIT-Fatigue score = sum score of the 13 question scores; total range: 0 - 52; higher total score represents less fatigue.
