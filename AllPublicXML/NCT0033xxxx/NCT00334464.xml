  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anticoagulation with warfarin is a common and potentially hazardous therapeutic intervention.
      It is a leading cause of iatrogenic bleeding events and, hence, of malpractice claims. There
      are no good alternatives presently for warfarin anticoagulation, and even when alternatives
      become available (i.e., ximelagatran), cost, labeling, and experience (outcomes-related)
      issues will continue to favor an extensive and ongoing use of warfarin. If the present study
      is able to confirm an advantage for a genotype-driven algorithm, in terms of improved
      efficiency, therapeutic efficacy, and, especially, safety, then a pharmacogenetics approach
      to warfarin dosing can be recommended as the basis for an Intermountain Health Care
      (IHC)-wide quality improvement initiative that should improve patient outcomes, reduce
      resource use (costs of achieving safe and therapeutic anticoagulation), and reduce adverse
      clinical events. COUMA-GEN is a prospective, randomized study of patients who are to begin
      chronic warfarin therapy for specific, qualifying clinical reasons (i.e., atrial fibrillation
      (AF), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or post-orthopedic surgery prophylaxis). Qualifying
      patients will be consented and randomized to an individualized, genotype-based
      warfarin-dosing regimen or to standard care (without knowledge of genotype). In each study
      arm, a predicted maintenance dose will be determined. All patients will receive a baseline
      International Normalized Ratio (INR). For patients in all 3 entry strata, a starting dose of
      warfarin that is twice the assigned daily maintenance dose (according to the specific
      treatment arm) will be prescribed on the first and second days, and then the dose will revert
      to the assigned maintenance dose.

      The objectives of this study are to determine

        1. whether the pharmacogenetic guided arm can maintain patients a greater time in
           therapeutic range (TTR - percentage of values in the targeted therapeutic range once a
           therapeutic INR has been established) without clinical adverse events (i.e., bleeding
           complications or thromboembolic events),

        2. whether the pharmacogenetic guided arm can achieve a higher percentage of therapeutic
           warfarin levels by days 5 and 8 of therapy (without intervening non-study dose
           adjustment), and

        3. whether the pharmacogenetic guided arm can reduce the need for unplanned dose
           adjustments and additional INR measurements because of excessive (or insufficient) INR
           level and clinical adverse events, i.e., bleeding complications or thromboembolic
           events.

      The goal is to achieve &gt;75% TTR in the PG-algorithm arm. Compare proportion of patients
      reaching therapeutic INR on days 5 and 8 and the subsequent and overall proportion (&quot;time&quot;)
      of INR measurements in therapeutic range (TTR) over 3 months between standard and PG-based
      arms.

      This study will enroll 200 qualifying, consenting patients of either gender, 18 years and
      above, any ethnicity, with life expectancies &gt; 1 year, beginning on chronic outpatient
      warfarin therapy for AF, or emergency department/outpatient therapy for spontaneous DVT, or
      inpatient therapy (and continued for 1 mo) after orthopedic surgery for DVT prevention, or
      heart failure patients (EF&lt;25% or apical akinesis or left ventricular aneurysm or extensive
      wall motion abnormality) being started on therapy to reduce the risk of thromboembolism.
