    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of erlotinib, tipifarnib,
      and temsirolimus when given together with sorafenib and to see how well they work in treating
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma. Sorafenib, erlotinib,
      tipifarnib, and temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Sorafenib and tipifarnib may also stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving sorafenib together with erlotinib,
      tipifarnib, or temsirolimus may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of tipifarnib, erlotinib hydrochloride, or
      temsirolimus in combination with a fixed dose of sorafenib in patients with recurrent
      glioblastoma mutiforme or gliosarcoma who are not taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs.
      (Phase I)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Characterize the safety profile of the doublet combinations of tipifarnib-sorafenib,
      erlotinib hydrochloride-sorafenib, and temsirolimus-sorafenib in patients with recurrent
      glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma. (Phase I and II) II. Characterize the
      pharmacokinetics of these doublet combinations, evaluating single-agent pharmacokinetics of
      each agent and the combination pharmacokinetics to determine drug-drug interactions. (Phase I
      and II) III. Determine the efficacy of each of the doublet combinations, in terms of 6-month
      progression-free survival, in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma.
      (Phase II) IV. Determine the efficacy of each of the doublet combinations, in terms of
      12-month survival and objective tumor response, in patients with recurrent glioblastoma
      multiforme or gliosarcoma. (Phase II)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Perform exploratory correlative laboratory studies by examining tissue markers of signal
      transduction pathways by immunohistochemical analysis using tissue blocks obtained prior to
      initiation of protocol therapy, either from the time of diagnosis or subsequent tumor
      resection. (Phase II) II. Determine the relationship between tumor and blood biomarkers and
      clinical outcome of patients treated with the combination of targeted agents. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of tipifarnib, erlotinib
      hydrochloride, and temsirolimus followed by a phase II open-label study.

      PHASE I: Patients are sequentially assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups.

      GROUP 1: Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily and oral erlotinib hydrochloride once
      daily on days 1-28.

      GROUP 2: Patients receive sorafenib as in group 1. Patients also receive temsirolimus IV over
      30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.

      GROUP 3: Patients receive sorafenib as in group 1. Patients also receive oral tipifarnib
      twice daily on days 1-21.

      In all groups, treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      In each treatment group, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib
      hydrochloride (group 1), temsirolimus (group 2), or tipifarnib (group 3) sequentially until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined for each group. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity during
      the first course of therapy.

      PHASE II: Patients receive sorafenib as in phase I. Patients also receive erlotinib
      hydrochloride, temsirolimus, or tipifarnib as in phase I at the MTD determined in phase I.

      Tissue that was collected during a prior surgery is examined for biomarkers by
      immunohistochemistry (in patients enrolled in the phase II portion of the study). Biomarkers
      examined include epidermal growth factor receptor, HER-2, AKT, S6 ribosomal protein, and Erk.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.
