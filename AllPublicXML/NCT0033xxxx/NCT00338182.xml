  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this protocol is to investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD1152
      when given as a continuous 48-hour infusion every 14 days and as a 2-hour infusion for 2
      consecutive days every 14 days in patients with advanced solid malignancies.
