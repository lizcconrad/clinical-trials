  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-cardiac surgery is associated with significant cardiac morbidity and mortality. Volatile
      anesthetics have a cardioprotective effects which results in preservation of left ventricular
      function and lower troponin I levels. Lower troponin release has been correlated with better
      long term event free survival in both cardiac and non cardiac surgery. A recently completed
      meta-analysis suggests that sevoflurane is a superior volatile agent. The evidence of a
      cardioprotective effect in non-cardiac surgery is lacking. Base on the current literature, we
      intend to evaluate the protective potential of sevoflurane versus propofol anesthesia in high
      risk patients undergoing elective non-cardiac procedures.

      Hypothesis: The use of Sevoflurane as a general anesthetic reduces postoperative troponin
      release, the incidence of myocardial infarction and/or long term morbidity in patients at low
      to moderate risk of postoperative cardiac complications, who are undergoing noncardiac
      surgery.
