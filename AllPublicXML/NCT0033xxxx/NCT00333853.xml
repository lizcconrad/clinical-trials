    <textblock>
      Insulin therapy requires monitoring and frequent review of glucose levels to optimize dosing.
      Effective presentation and data analysis are essential. We examined HbA1c changes using the
      OneTouch(R) UltraSmart(R) System (Test Group), an integrated glucose meter and electronic
      logbook, compared to established meters with paper logbooks (Control Group).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects with type 1 or type 2 insulin-treated diabetes mellitus with a
             baseline HbA1c greater than or equal to 8.0%.

          -  The lower age limit for pediatric subjects was at the discretion of the pediatric
             investigators and their Institutional Review Board (IRBs).

          -  The upper age limit for pediatric subjects was 20 years (i.e., not having reached
             their 21st birthday on date of enrollment).

          -  Subjects must have monitored blood glucose at least 2 times per day. - Subject's
             current blood glucose meter has download capability, however, the subject did not
             routinely use this capability on his/her own.
