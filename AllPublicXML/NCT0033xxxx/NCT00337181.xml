      This protocol will study the clinical course of HIV-infection among volunteers who have
      received either a placebo injection or the experimental vaccine combination of ALVAC-HIV and
      AIDSVAX B/E prior to HIV-1 infection. The study will assess whether those who received the
      experimental vaccine combination have a slower progression of HIV disease compared to those
      who received the placebo injection.

      Prospective cohort study of the clinical course of HIV-1 infection occurring after candidate
      HIV-1 vaccination (breakthrough infection) with ALVAC-HIV (vcP1521) and AIDSVAX B/E. This
      study will enroll volunteers who become HIV-infected during the course of follow up in a
      phase III preventive HIV vaccine trial conducted in Rayong and Chon Buri, Thailand.
      Volunteers will be enrolled in this protocol to provide additional long-term follow up to
      establish whether differences in viral load after infection (comparing vaccine to placebo)
      are associated with altered disease outcomes, as well as provide more detailed immunologic
      and virologic assessment of these volunteers.
