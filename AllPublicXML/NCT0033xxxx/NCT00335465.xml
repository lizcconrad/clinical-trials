  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the present study is to assess changes of myocardial glucose uptake
      (MGU) during clamp studies using positron emission tomography (PET) scanning in patients with
      type 2 diabetes and idiopathic left ventricular dysfunction (LVD).

      The secondary objectives of the study are: assessment of changes of myocardial
      microcirculation at rest and during adenosine stimulation using PET; assessment of changes in
      myocardial structure and function evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); assessment
      of glycaemic control by measurement of HbA1c, fasting blood glucose and insulin levels;
      assessment of safety (adverse event profile, laboratory data).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  LV systolic dysfunction (2D-Echo LVEF &lt; 50%) with or without LV dilation (2D-Echo LV
             EDD &gt; 56 mm) or left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) &gt;55mm with or without
             LV dysfunction

          -  angiographically normal coronary arteries (&lt; 50% vessel narrowing);

          -  newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes;

          -  previously diagnosed: OAD treated type 2 diabetic patients able to take part in the
             study after a one-month wash-out period and insulin treated type 2 diabetic patients
             able to take part in the study after one week wash-out period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             chemical structures;

          -  likelihood of requiring treatment during the study period with drugs not permitted by
             the clinical study protocol;

          -  treatment with any investigational product in the last 30 days or 5 half-lives
             (whichever is longer) before study entry;

          -  current use of investigational agents or participation in any other investigational
             studies during study period;
