    <textblock>
      The study is to evaluate a device for male reproductive sterilization and determine if this
      device is successful at blocking the sperm.

      Ninety subjects from two centers in the United Stated will be followed closely for 24 months.

      If you are someone interested in a vasectomy, you may be eligible to participate in this
      clinical study.

      This feasibility study is intended to collect pertinent clinical information on the use of
      the Shepherd Medical Intra Vas Device (IVD) necessary to support the design of a future
      pivotal study. The IVD is intended to occlude the vas deferens and thus accomplish male
      reproductive sterilization and to offer an additional method to vasectomy.
