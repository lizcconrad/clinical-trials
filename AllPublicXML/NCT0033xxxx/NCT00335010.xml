  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to investigate if NTG, administered intravenously during
      gastric tube reconstruction, could preserve gastric fundus tissue blood flow and oxygenation
      and reduce the incidence of postoperative leakage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Complications of oesophagectomy and gastric tube reconstruction are leakage and stenosis,
      which may be due to compromised microvascular blood flow (MBF) in the gastric tissue. We
      recently demonstrated that peri-operatively decreased MBF could be improved by topical
      administration of nitro-glycerine NTG). In this present study we investigate the effect of
      intravenous NTG on gastric microcirculation.

      This single centre, prospective, double blinded study randomized thirty-two patients
      scheduled for esophagectomy into two groups. The intervention group received intravenous NTG
      during gastric tube reconstruction, as the control group received normal saline.

      Baseline values of MBF, microvascular haemoglobin O2 saturation (μHbSO2), and microvascular
      haemoglobin concentration (μHbcon) were determined at the gastric fundus before and after
      gastric tube construction and after pulling up the gastric tube to the neck.
