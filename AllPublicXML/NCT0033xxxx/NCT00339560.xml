      The key aims of this study include estimation of possible risk associated with a history of
      gallstones, bacterial infection for the biliary tract, other medical history, diet, use of
      tobacco and alcohol, obesity, reproductive factors, and family history of cancer. Information
      will be used to examine risk patterns a) seperately by anatomic subsite; b) among patients
      with gallbladder cancer vs. controls undergoing cholecystectomy for gallstones; c) among the
      patients with bile duct cancer vs. Hospital controls without cancer who undergo surgery for
      removal of bile duct stones. We will also attempt to ascertain reasons for cancer who undergo
      surgery for removal of bile duct stones. We will also attempt to ascertain reasons for the
      rising incidence of biliary tract cancers in Shanghai. Serum collected from all subjects will
      be analyzed for estrogens and other hormones, vitamins C and E, cholesterol, and bacterial
      antibodies (including salmonella typhi, paratyphi, and escherischia coli). Bile fluid will be
      cultured for aerobic bacteria, and gallstones analyzed for color, cholesterol, and evidence
      of bacteria infection. A major challenge in biliary tract cancer research is to determine how
      cancer risk factors differ from those for gallstones or biliary duct stone disease, since
      many people have gallstones (or biliary duct stones) but few develop cancer.
