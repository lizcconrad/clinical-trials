  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that continuous positive pressure applied to the airway will decrease the
      ability of the nose to warm and humidify inspired air compared to zero or negative pressure.

      We will use continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a device commonly used to treat
      patients with sleep apnea, to vary the pressure in the airway and determine if increased
      pressure decreases the ability to warm and humidify inspired air. If our hypothesis is
      correct, it may explain the reason why CPAP is poorly tolerated in patients with sleep apnea;
      i.e., less ability to warm and humidify air leading to more nasal mucosal irritation.
