          <description>HADS: participant rated questionnaire with 2 subscales. HADS-A assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks); HADS-D assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). Each subscale comprised of 7 items with range 0 (no presence of anxiety or depression) to 3 (severe feeling of anxiety or depression). Total score 0 to 21 for each subscale; higher score indicates greater severity of anxiety and depression symptoms. Number of participants evaluable=182,181,176,185.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Weekly Mean Sleep Quality Score</title>
          <description>Daily quality of sleep diary consists of 11-point NRS ranging from 0(best possible sleep) to 10(worst possible sleep). Participants rated their quality of sleep during past 24 hours, self-assessment done daily upon awakening. Baseline=Last 7 available scores before taking study medication up to and including Day 1. The weekly mean quality of sleep score was based on LS Means using mixed model repeated measures ANCOVA, with treatment, center, week, and treatment-by-week interaction in the model and the baseline mean sleep score used as the covariate. Weekly mean sleep quality score is defined as the mean of the last 7 daily sleep diary entries.</description>
          <population>FAS included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication, regardless of medication compliance. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies participants evaluable for this measure. 'n' participants evaluable at given time point for each group, respectively.</population>

        <description>FIQ: 20-item self-administered questionnaire designed to assess areas such as health status, progress, and outcomes in participants with fibromyalgia. 11 items related to physical functioning, other items assess pain, fatigue, stiffness, difficulty working, and symptoms of anxiousness and depression. FIQ contains 10 sub-scales scored from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more impairment in the subscale attribute. Total score range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating more impairment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Short Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey at Week 14</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health. The score for a section is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning) and is reported as 2 summary scores; Physical Component Score and Mental Component Score. Total score range for the summary scores = 0- 100, where higher score represents higher level of functioning.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 14</time_frame>
        <population>FAS included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication, regardless of medication compliance. Missing data were imputed using LOCF method. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies participants evaluable for this measure.</population>

        <description>MAF is a 16-item self-administered questionnaire that yields a Global Fatigue Index (GFI), measures 4 dimensions of fatigue: degree and severity, amount of distress it causes, its timing and degree to which fatigue interferes with activities of daily living. Only 15 items are used to calculate the GFI. GFI score range from 1 (no fatigue) to 50 (severe fatigue).</description>
