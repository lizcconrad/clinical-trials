  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mastocytosis is a disorder characterized by presence of excessive numbers of mast cells in
      skin, bone marrow and internal organs. It can affect both children and adults, males and
      females and individuals from all ethnic backgrounds, although precise demographic information
      about the affected populations is not available as it is a rare disorder. Mastocytosis in
      children is generally limited to the skin and follows a self limited course, while it is a
      disorder of the hematopoietic stem cell associated with somatic mutations of the c-kit gene
      in most patients with adult-onset of disease. There is no known curative therapy for most
      patients with systemic mastocytosis. Recent research studies identified several subtypes of
      disease with distinct clinical and pathologic features, however, a precise understanding of
      the incidence as well as molecular pathology of different disease subtypes is lacking. This
      study aims to examine molecular and cellular pathological aspects of disease in patients with
      mastocytosis and correlate findings with clinical presentation and prognosis. Patients will
      undergo a routine history and physical examination, and diagnostic tests will be ordered as
      dictated by each patient's clinical presentation. Blood and bone marrow will be obtained for
      diagnostic and research purposes. Genetic analysis of the c-kit gene regulating mast cell
      growth and differentiation will be performed. It is hoped that findings obtained from this
      study will help to design novel therapies for mastocytosis and other disorders in which mast
      cells play a critical role.
