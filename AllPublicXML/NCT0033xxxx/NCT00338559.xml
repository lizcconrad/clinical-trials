  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of airway management on vomiting after strabismus surgery is unknown. The purpose
      of this study is to find out whether the use of different airway devices, such as LMA, which
      is a special mask placed in the throat or Endotracheal tube (ET tube), which is a soft tube
      placed in the wind pipe, affects the incidence of vomiting after surgery. Two hundred six
      children between the ages of 2 and 12 years are expected to take part in this study.

      The child will be checked by the study doctor to determine if he/she qualifies to be part of
      the study. The study doctor may not want the child to take part in this study if he/she is
      currently in another research study; or if the child has been in any other research study
      within the last 30 days, or if the child is extremely obese, or has reflux or another GI
      problem.

      If the child qualifies for the study, he/she will receive routine general anesthesia. For
      airway management, the child will have either a LMA or ET tube. The child has an equal chance
      of receiving either one of these airways devices, much like the coin flip.

      After surgery, the child will be transferred to the recovery room (PACU). If the child vomits
      in PACU, he/she will receive rescue medication, which can be repeated if the need arises.

      A research coordinator will call the parents the following day to find out whether the child
      vomited after leaving the hospital, in the car or at home, for any complications and
      receiving any medications.
