      This is a two-part study in which Part A will assess the effects of GW679769 after 1 dose on
      the function of the nerves that supply the bladder. The technique for measuring the nerves
      function is called Neurometry. Part B will assess the effect of repeat doses of GW679769 on
      the bladder nerve function. Part B will also assess the effects of the drug on overactive
      bladder symptoms using a three-day patient diary.

      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of GW679769 on
      Current Perception Threshold (CPT) following a single 150 mg dose (Part A) and to evaluate
      the effect of CPT and symptoms of overactive bladder following 28 days of repeat dosing with
      120 mg GW679769 administered once daily (Part B) in patients with neurogenic bladder due to
      incomplete spinal cord injury
