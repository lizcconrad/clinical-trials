    <textblock>
      Overall trial objectives:

        1. Can treatment with tonabersat reduce the number of days with aura and/or migraine
           headache in patients with migraine with aura

        2. How well tolerated is treatment with tonabersat

      The study is based on the hypothesis that the unique mechanism of action of tonabersat will
      inhibit some of the early events in the generation of aura and migraine headache and so be
      effective as prophylactic treatment

             the study period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients experiencing headache other than migraine or tension headache

          -  Overuse of acute migraine treatments defined as more than 14 daily doses per month
             with analgesics or more than 9 daily doses per month of ergots or triptans within the
             last two months

          -  Migraine prophylactic treatment within two months prior to entry to the trial

             tricyclic antidepressants (during the last 2 months), antiepileptic dugs (during the
             last 2 months), calcium channel blockers, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, daily NSAIDs,
             daily paracetamol, high dose magnesium supplements (600mg/day). Parenteral
             administration of botulinum toxin is also excluded. These drugs are permitted when
             given for diseases other than migraine provided that, in the opinion of the
             investigator the dose can be kept constant throughout the trial.

          -  Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, have significant cerebrovascular
             disease e.g. transient ischaemic attacks, stroke

             of the upper limit of normal for their age group

          -  Patients with hepatic dysfunction defined as a liver function test (AST, ALT, alkaline
             phosphatase, bilirubin) of greater than twice the upper limit of normal for their age
             group

          -  Patients with known alcohol or other substance abuse

          -  Use of an investigational drug (for any indication) within 30 days or 5 half-lives,
