  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether immunonutrition and pre operative nutrition
      can reduce lenght of respirator support, lenght of stay in the ICU and incidence of post
      operative infections

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elective surgical repair of a Thoraco (Abdominal) Aneurysm Aorta (T(A)AA) is associated with
      high mortality and morbidity. Important complications are renal failure, paraplegia and
      respiratory failure.

      A retrospective study we performed also revealed high post operative infection rates and high
      incidence of respiratory failure.

      Improving immune status may reduce the occurrence of infections due to immune chances.
      Immunonutrition may enhance the patient’s immune system. Many clinical trials of
      immunonutrition in critically ill and surgical patients have been performed. In meta-analyses
      it has been shown that immunonutrition results in lower infections rates and shorter ‘length
      of stay’ in hospital after major surgery. Immunonutrition has not been studied yet in TAA(A)
      surgery. Controversy exists in septic patients.

      We designed a prospective randomized placebo controlled trial to study the effect of
      immunonutrition on time on ventilatorsupport, lenght of stay in the intensive care unit and
      incidence of postoperative infections after TAA(A) surgery. Patients start with oral
      supplements besides their normal diet 5 days before surgery. After the operation, the
      nutrition is continued by protocol and administered by nasogastric tube until normal entral
      feeding is possible. The control group wil receive iso caloric and iso nitrogen nutrition.
