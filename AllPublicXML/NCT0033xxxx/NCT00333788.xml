    <textblock>
      The study will continue to assess the safety of certolizumab pegol (CDP870) as well as
      examine the evolution of long term efficacy in Crohn's disease patients who completed study
      C87042 [NCT00308581]. It will also assess the effect of subcutaneous CDP870 400 mg on direct
      cost parameters.

    <description>Clinical response is defined as at least a 100 point decrease from Baseline of study C87042 (NCT00308581) in Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI).
Subjects maintained their clinical response at Last Visit if they did not meet criteria for loss of response [CDAI score &gt;150 points and a minimum increase in CDAI of 70 points versus Baseline of study C87042 (NCT00308581)] at 2 consecutive visits.
A CDAI score of 150 or below indicates remission and a score above 450 indicates extremely severe disease.

    <description>Clinical response at Baseline of this study of at least a 100 point decrease from Baseline of study C87042 in Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI)
Loss of response = both a CDAI score &gt;150 points and a minimum increase in CDAI of 70 points versus Baseline (Week 26 of study C87042) as confirmed at 2 consecutive visits. Subjects losing response will be considered as having the event on the date of the first visit where response was lost. Subjects who discontinued the study without having lost response will be censored on the date of discontinuation (i.e. date of last visit performed).</description>
