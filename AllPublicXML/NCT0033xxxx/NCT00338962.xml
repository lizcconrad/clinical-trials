      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of naltrexone in combination with an
      SSRI to reduce alcohol consumption in alcoholic patients with comorbid PTSD and depression.

      We hypothesize that the combination of naltrexone and SSRI will exhibit a greater decrease in
      alcohol consumption than that seen with treatment with SSRI alone, or with a combination of
      another class of antidepressant and naltrexone. We also hypothesize that SSRI will be
      effective in treating PTSD and depressive symptoms and naltrexone will be well tolerated.

      OBJECTIVE: Alcoholics with current comorbid mental disorders constitute the majority of
      alcoholics in clinical settings. Although there are two FDA approved medications for the
      treatment of alcoholism (naltrexone and disulfiram), there are no established
      pharmacotherapies for individuals with comorbid alcoholism and psychiatric illnesses. Studies
      suggest that the class of antidepressants known as serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors
      (SSRIs) is effective in reducing alcohol use in depressed individuals. In addition, a small
      open label study has shown that SSRIs have similar effects on individuals with comorbid PTSD
      and alcoholism. Preclinical studies have shown that the combination of a serotonergic agent
      and naltrexone was more effective than either medication alone in suppressing alcohol intake.
      To address this issue, we are conducting a 13 week randomized clinical trial evaluating the
      effects of paroxetine, desipramine and naltrexone in reducing alcohol use in alcohol
      dependent individuals who currently meet DSM-IV diagnosis for Depressive Disorder or PTSD.
      RESEARCH PLAN: One hundred and twenty subjects who are alcohol dependent patients with
      comorbid PTSD or Depressive Disorder will be recruited from the following West Haven VA
      sources: the Substance Abuse Treatment program, the PTSD clinic, the Women's clinic, clinical
      referrals and advertisement. These subjects will be randomized in a double-blind fashion to
      one of four cells. We will compare paroxetine versus desipramine and naltrexone versus
      placebo. The antidepressant will be started at a low dose and titrated upward on a fixed
      schedule. The target dose will be 40mg for paroxetine and 200mg for desipramine. Minimum
      dosage permitted for study retention will be 20mg for paroxetine and 150mg for desipramine.
      Pharmacological treatments will last 13 weeks. Psychosocial treatment will involve medication
      compliance therapy, using the Microelectric Event Monitoring (MEMS) bottle caps. The specific
      aim of the research is to compare the relative effectiveness of paroxetine versus desipramine
      and naltrexone versus placebo in reducing the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption.
      METHODOLOGY: The primary outcome measures of major interest will include: frequency and
      quantity of alcohol consumption, self-reported craving, self-reported psychiatric and
      emotional distress, diagnostic assessment or psychiatric symptoms and side effects. These
      outcomes will be measured by the following: self-assessments, Timeline Followback, Hamilton
      Depression and anxiety scales, CAPS, ASI, Quality of Life, breathalyzer tests and monthly
      liver function tests.

    <description>The OCDS is a 14-item (rated 0-4), self-administered questionnaire for characterizing and quantifying the obsessive and compulsive cognitive aspects of craving and heavy (alcoholic) drinking, such as drinking-related thought, urges to drink, and the ability to resist those thoughts and urges. A higher total score indicates higher craving and ranges from 0-48.</description>

    <description>The CAPS is the gold standard in PTSD assessment. The CAPS-5 is a 30-item structured interview that can be used to:
Make current (past month) diagnosis of PTSD Make lifetime diagnosis of PTSD Assess PTSD symptoms over the past week Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5). A higher score is associated with higher severity of PTSD. The score is interpreted as follows: 0-19=Asymptomatic/few symptoms 20-39=Sub-threshold/mild PTSD 40-59=Threshold PTSD/moderate 60-79=Severe PTSD &gt;80=Extreme PTSD</description>

Side effects and common adverse symptoms were evaluated by the research staff weekly, using a modified version of the ystematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events. The symptoms that are known to be associated with treatment with desipramine, paroxetine, and naltrexone were specifically screened or on a weekly basis. The symptoms were then clustered into the following categories: gastrointestinal, emotional, cold and flu symptoms, skin, sexual, neurological, and cardiac.</description>

A higher total score indicates higher craving and ranges from 0-48.</description>

        <description>Differences in mean number of side effects reported for each group. Side effects and common adverse symptoms were evaluated by the research staff weekly, using a modified version of the ystematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events. The symptoms that are known to be associated with treatment with desipramine, paroxetine, and naltrexone were specifically screened or on a weekly basis. The symptoms were then clustered into the following categories: gastrointestinal, emotional, cold and flu symptoms, skin, sexual, neurological, and cardiac.</description>
