  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I trial will assess the feasibility of using a vaginal ring to deliver the
      candidate microbicide dapivirine (TMC120) for 7 days. The study population will consist of 13
      healthy, sexually abstinent women. Safety and tolerability will be assessed through clinical
      and laboratory assessments. Feasibility of drug delivery will be assessed by measuring
      dapivirine (TMC120) concentrations in vaginal fluids, vaginal and cervical epithelial tissue,
      and plasma.
