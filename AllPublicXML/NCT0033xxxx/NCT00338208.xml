  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We wish to evaluate a potential training program for patients with glaucoma, to become more
      efficient users of prescribed low vision devices for distance and near vision tasks. We
      hypothesize that the devices will improve efficiency. Prescribed devices will include a stand
      magnifier, a handheld magnifier, spectacle magnifiers for near vision, and a handheld
      monocular (telescope) and a bioptic telescope (spectacle-mounted telescope) for distance
      vision. The success of being able to use optical devices is dependent upon training. Optical
      devices are currently accepted and used for patients with visual conditions that decrease
      their central vision. The bioptic telescope is a pair of glasses with a small telescope
      mounted within the carrier lens. The glasses look and feel like a normal pair of glasses, but
      have a black device (telescope) protruding from the top of one lens for better identifying
      distance objects. The spectacle magnifier is mounted in a pair of glasses also for near
      vision

      You will be asked a series of oral questions regarding your health status and vision level of
      functioning (Expectations of Visual Functioning Form, NEI-VFQ, Linear Rating Scale, and
      Geriatric Depression Scale) in the Vanderbilt Eye Clinic. You will undergo a mobility
      pre-test to assess your ability to find objects in the distance as well as read . You will
      undergo a low vision examination in the eye clinic. You will receive the optical devices and
      then receive brief instructions on the use of the devices . You will then undergo a
      pre-training evaluation. You will receive approximately 6 training sessions with your
      prescribed devices for up to 1 hour each time. You will return to the Vanderbilt Eye Clinic
      for the post-training distance and near vision assessments with the devices . You will be
      asked the series of oral questions again regarding your health status and vision level of
      functioning .
