  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether &quot;red morphine drops&quot; applied in the mouth are
      superior to an equivalent amount of morphine applied as subcutaneous injection for the relief
      of breathlessness in terminal patients suffering from primary lung cancer or lung metastases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breathlessness or dyspnea in terminal cancer patients with lung cancer is common and opioids
      such as morphine is the mainstay of symptomatic treatment. Subcutaneous administration of
      morphine provides fast symptomatic relief, but it has been the impression in our institution
      that &quot;red morphine drops&quot; applied orally may have equal or better efficacy and faster onset
      time.

      Comparison: Patients with lung cancer or lung metastases with moderate to severe dyspnea at
      rest are treated with either orally applied &quot;red morphine drops&quot; or an equivalent amount of
      morphine applied subcutaneously.
