      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a drug called Ultratrace iobenguane I 131
      that has radioactivity, to measure how long it takes for the drug to be absorbed and passed
      out of the body, and to measure how much radioactivity is absorbed into different tissues of
      the body.

      Iobenguane, which is also known as MIBG, has been used in many patients who have types of
      cancers caused by what are known as neuroendocrine tumors, such as pheochromocytoma,
      paraganglioma, and carcinoid. Iobenguane is absorbed by neuroendocrine tumor cells. The
      radioactive portion of the study drug, Ultratrace iobenguane, is a form of iodine called I
      131. The I 131 is absorbed into the tumor with the iobenguane, and the radioactivity should
      kill the tumors. The type of iobenguane being studied is called Ultratrace because of the new
      way in which this form of iobenguane is made. This study is the first time in which
      Ultratrace iobenguane will be given to patients. The purpose of the study is to give a low
      dose of iobenguane just to find out if the drug is safe, to measure how long it takes the
      drug to be absorbed and passed out of the body, and to see how much radioactivity is absorbed
      by different types of tissues of the body.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients will enter one of two study arms depending on their type of neuroendocrine tumor.

        Arm P patients must:

          -  Have a biochemical or histopathological diagnosis of either adrenal pheochromocytoma
             or extra-adrenal paraganglioma (biochemical diagnosis includes plasma-free
             metanephrines and 24-hour urine test for catecholamines/metanephrines)

          -  Disease is metastatic or has recurred following surgery

          -  Have a CT scan performed (for later measurement of disease volume by the core lab)
             within 90 days of the administration of study drug without any interventions between
             CT and iobenguane I 131 imaging.

        Arm C patients must:

          -  Have a histopathological diagnosis of carcinoid, or by plasma chromogranin A (CgA) and
             24-hour urine test for 5-hydroxyindole-acetic-acid (5HIAA)

          -  Disease is metastatic or has recurred following surgery

          -  Have a CT scan performed (for the later measurement of disease volume by the core lab)
             within 90 days of the administration of study drug without any interventions between
             CT and iobenguane I 131 imaging.
