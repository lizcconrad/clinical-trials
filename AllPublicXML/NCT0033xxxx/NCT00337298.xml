    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of two antihypertensive drugs on retinal
      vessel diameter in young type 1 diabetics. The retinal vessel analyzer (RVA) was used to
      investigate how the drugs affected vessel diameter, when the subjects were exposed to an
      increase in blood pressure, induced by isometric muscle contraction and when they were
      stimulated by flickering light.

      Diabetes is a leading cause of blindness in the western part of the world. Diabetic patients
      develop diabetic retinopathy which can progress to blindness. Diabetic retinopathy is
      associated with an increase of blood flow in the retinal vessels, ischaemia in the periphery
      and macular oedema. It has been shown in previous trials, that the pressure and metabolic
      autoregulation is disturbed in patients with diabetes, and it is believed to contribute to
      the development of diabetic retinopathy.

      In healthy subjects the retinal arterioles will contract during an increase in blood
      pressure, but trials have shown that this response is impaired in diabetics. When the retina
      is exposed to flickering lights, the metabolism increase and the arterioles in healthy
      subjects dilates. In diabetics this dilation is impaired. In this trial we want to
      investigate if an ACE-inhibitor (lisinopril) or calcium channel blocker (amlodipine)
      influence this response in subjects exposed to increased blood pressure vs increased retinal
      metabolism.
