    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to compare the ability of two doses of OT-551 ophthalmic
      solution and drug-free solution to safely and effectively prevent or delay the progression of
      nuclear cataracts that frequently develop as a result of vitrectomy (surgery for retina
      repair), thereby avoiding the need for a second surgery (cataract removal). Victrectomies
      involve removal of the jelly-like substance (vitreous) that is located in a cavity behind the
      lens.
