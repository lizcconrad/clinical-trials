  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In collaboration with members of The International Melanoma Consortium, we propose to study
      melanoma in families lacking mutations in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2 (CDKN2 or
      p16) gene, or the cyclin-dependant kinase 4 (CDK4). CDKN2 and CDK4 are both genes that encode
      presumed tumor suppressor genes, mutant forms of which are known to cause increased
      susceptibility to melanoma. The purpose of the present study then is to confirm the existence
      of and to identify additional gene(s) involved in heritable melanoma (cutaneous and ocular)
      and their precursor lesions (atypical nevi) by linkage analysis and gene mapping strategies.
      It is clear that the risk to develop atypical nevi and/or melanoma is strongly influenced by
      genetic and environmental factors (e.g. sun exposure). Characterization of such genes could
      provide important insights into the inheritance, pathogenesis, and treatment of this
      increasingly important disease.

      In collaboration with members of The International Melanoma Genetics Consortium, we propose
      to study melanoma in families lacking mutations in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2
      (CDKN2A), or the cyclin-dependant kinase 4 (CDK4) genes. CDKN2 and CDK4 are both genes that
      encode presumed tumor suppressor genes, mutant forms of which are known to cause increased
      susceptibility to melanoma. The purpose of the present study then is to confirm the existence
      of and to identify additional gene(s) involved in heritable melanoma (cutaneous and ocular)

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Inclusion into this study was restricted to families containing at least three CMM cases
        with DNA available for genotyping, and CDKN2A and CDK4 involvement and had been excluded.

        All families must be mutation negative for both CDKN2A and CDK4.

        This study will also include families with at least one case of ocular and two cases of
        other cutaneous melanomas, or at least 2 ocular melanomas (except where they occur in
        parent and child).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Any family showing evidence of haplotype sharing in the 9p21-p22 region, where CDKN2A is
        located, was also excluded.
