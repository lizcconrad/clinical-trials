    <textblock>
      This pilot study was designed to explore the effects of combined treatment with raloxifene
      HCl 60 mg and oral 17 beta-estradiol 1mg/day on the number of vasomotor episodes (hot flashes
      plus night sweats) in postmenopausal women discontinuing continuous combined hormone
      replacement therapy (ccHRT) compared to women treated with raloxifene HCl 60 mg alone.
