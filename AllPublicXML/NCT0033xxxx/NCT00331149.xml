  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to compare the effectiveness and tolerability of a new prolonged
      release formulation of ropinirole with the currently marketed immediate release formulation
      which is prescribed in many countries. The new prolonged release formulation allows the drug
      to be taken once a day rather than three times a day. This study will also evaluate the side
      effects of the new prolonged release formulation of ropinirole

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Diary cards completed by the participants was used to assess the duration of &quot;off&quot; and &quot;on&quot; periods. During the treatment period 2, 24 hour diary cards were completed by the participants (except for the Baseline period when four diary cards were completed). The participants completed diary cards on the same 2 days of each relevant week. Each 30 minute period was marked as either &quot;off&quot;, &quot;on&quot; or asleep. Troublesome dyskinesias were involuntary twisting, turning movements which caused discomfort were also recorded. The general definition of &quot;off&quot; included a lack of mobility with or without additional features such as tremor or rigidity. The total number of hours spent both &quot;off&quot; and &quot;on&quot; or asleep were summed for the two (four for the Baseline Period) 24 hour diary cards and the amount of awake time spent &quot;off&quot; per 24 hour period was determined. Percentage of participants with at least a 20% maintained reduction in baseline time spent &quot;off&quot; at Week 24 were presented.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with a score of 'much improved' or 'very much improved' on the clinical global impression-global improvement (CGI-I) scale at Week 24 LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I global improvement scale allows the investigator to rate the participant's total improvement from beginning the treatment (baseline). The scale was rated as 1-7, from 1: very much improved, 2: much improved, 3: minimally improved, 4: no change, 5: minimally worse, 6: much worse and 7: very much worse. CGI global improvement scale was assessed at Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24 (and at early withdrawal, if applicable. Higher score indicates worsening and lower score indicates very much improvement. A participant was considered as a CGI-I responder when he/she had a score of (1) Very Much Improved or (2) Much Improved.</description>

    <measure>Mean change from baseline to Week 24 LOCF in the thermometer score of the Euro-Qol 5D (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D was a standardized, participant-administered instrument which produced a simple descriptive profile (thermometer) and a single index value (utility) of a participant's current health status. Thermometer was a 20-cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) anchored at 0: worse imaginable health state and 100: best imaginable health state. Participants were required to indicate how good or bad was their health by marking a line on the scale. The point at which the line crossed the thermometer was taken as the score. Week 0 was the baseline and change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline values from the on-treatment values.</description>

    <measure>Mean change from baseline to Week 24 LOCF in the utility score of the EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D was a standardized, participant-administered instrument which produced a simple descriptive profile (thermometer) and a single index value (utility) of a participant's current health status. Utility score was computed from 5 dimensions of health: (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety /depression). Each dimension comprised 3 levels (some, moderate, extreme problems), and generated a total of 243 theoretically possible health states. The Utility score was combined scores from 5 dimensions, which valued between -0.594 (representing the worse possible health) and 1 (representing the perfect health). Week 0 was the baseline and change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline values from the on-treatment values.</description>

    <measure>Mean change from Baseline in the total score of the Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS) at Week 24 LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PDSS comprised of a series of 15 VAS addressing commonly reported symptoms associated with sleep disturbance in PD. The participant or caregiver completed the scale based on their experiences in the past week. Scores for each item ranged from 0 (representing the most severe) to 10 (the least severe). The maximum score for the PDSS was 150 (participant was free of all symptoms). Week 0 was the baseline and change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline values from the on-treatment values.</description>

    <measure>Mean change from Baseline in the total movement severity score of the abnormal involuntary movement scale (AIMS), with participants in an &quot;on&quot; state at Week 24 LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The AIMS was a 12 item, investigator performed assessment of facial and oral movements, extremity movements, trunk movements, global judgments and dental status according to predefined criteria. Items 1-10 were rated on a 5 point severity scale with 0: none to 4: severe. Items 11 and 12 were yes or no items. The AIMS total movement severity score was obtained by summing together the responses to the first seven items and ranged from 0 to 28, with higher scores representing more severe involuntary movement. The AIMS was assessed at Week 0, 12, 24. Week 0 was the baseline and change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline values from the on-treatment values.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants requiring re-instatement of L-dopa</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were defined as having a re-instatement of L-dopa, if at any point during the on-treatment phase (excluding down-titration), their dose of L-dopa was increased, up to, or above their baseline level. Percentage of participants requiring reinstatement of L-dopa was reported at Week 24.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from baseline in the dose of L-dopa at Week 24 LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The start and stop dates of L-Dopa medication were used to determine the dose being taken on a specific date or at an assessment. The dose recorded on the actual date of assessment was used when reporting the corresponding dose. The total daily dose of L-dopa (mg) was calculated as Unit dose per tablet (mg) * Daily Frequency * No of Tablets per administration. Mean change from baseline in the dose of L-dopa at Week 24 was reported. Week 0 was the baseline and change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline values from the on-treatment values.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of all adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 27</time_frame>
    <description>Data for number of participants who presented one or more adverse events (serious or non serious) was reported. An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence (MO) in a participant temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product (MP), whether or not considered related to the MP and can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with its use. The SAE was any untoward MO that, at any dose, results in death, life threatening, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, congenital abnormality or birth defect, that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants who were unable to titrate weekly during the 4 week forced up titration due to poor tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>There was no specific question in the CRF to capture the reason why participants were unable to titrate weekly during this period, the data on the reason for withdrawal in the CRF was thus evaluated in those participants who withdrew during the forced titration period. Data for the number of participants withdrawn (Yes/No) is presented.</description>
