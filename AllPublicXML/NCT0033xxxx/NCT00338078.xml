  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether oxygen therapy during sleep improves
      quality of life, exercise capacity and heart function among patients with chronic heart
      failure and central sleep apnea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxygen therapy reduces the number of central apneas among patients with congestive heart
      failure but it is unknown whether quality of life and heart function also improve. We aim to
      test whether the quality of life, exercise capacity and heart function are improved with
      nocturnal oxygen therapy during 6 weeks with nocturnal oxygen from oxygen concentrator or
      nocturnal air from placebo concentrator.
