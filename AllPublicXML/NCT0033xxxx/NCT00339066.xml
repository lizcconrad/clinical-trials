      This study will determine the relationship between brain lesion severity, treatment response,
      and frontal lobe brain function in people with late-life depression (LLD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression in older adults is a major public health problem and it often goes underdiagnosed
      and undertreated. A significant number of people with LLD, especially those with
      cerebrovascular risk factors, have subcortical grey matter and frontal deep white matter
      brain lesions. Some studies suggest that these lesions, or hyperintensities, may be
      associated with poor acute and long-term depression treatment response. Similarly, studies
      have shown that people with LLD frequently have functional deficits in the frontal lobe
      portion of their brains. This dysfunction has been shown to be associated with poor acute
      treatment response with a tricyclic antidepressant drug, as well as with a greater risk for
      depression relapse. The applicability of these findings to other classes of antidepressant
      medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), however, remains
      unknown. Additionally, more information is needed about the interaction between frontal brain
      lesions and executive function deficits in LLD. This study will determine the relationship
      between brain lesion severity, treatment response, and frontal lobe function in people with
      late-life depression who are being treated with the SSRI sertraline.

      Participants in this open label study will first undergo neuropsychological testing to
      determine eligibility. All eligible participants will be treated with sertraline for 12
      weeks. Dosages will begin at 25 mg per day, and will be increased to 50 mg per day after 4
      days. Any other dosage modifications will depend on the participant's individual response to
      the medication. All participants will have an MRI scan at some point during the study.
      Assessments of symptoms and treatment response will occur at the study site biweekly until
      Week 8, and then again at Week 12.
