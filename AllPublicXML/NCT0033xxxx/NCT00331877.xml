  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decisions to limit life sustaining treatments are made for most patients dying in the ICU,
      usually with input from the family. The well-being of the family may be jeopardized by
      involvement in the decision-making process and bereavement. We evaluated the ability of a
      proactive communication strategy (family conference and providing family members with a
      bereavement information leaflet) designed to improve family well-being.
