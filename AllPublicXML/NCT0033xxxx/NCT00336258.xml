  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic lower extremity DVT
      detected by US-Doppler and procoagulant microparticles in a selected group of cancer patients
      suffering from an advanced stage of the disease.

      An attempt will be made to determine whether there is a correlation between this prevalence
      and various clinical and laboratory parameters.

      The association between malignancy and venous thromboembolism(VTE) is well known. VTE is one
      of the most common complications seen in cancer patients Early detection of VTE can identify
      patients who may benefit from anticoagulant therapy and prevent morbidity and mortality.

      There are recommendations for hospitalized cancer patients who are bedridden with an acute
      medical illness to receive prophylaxis, but in practice this is not clear cut.It has been
      shown, in other selected groups of patients that Ultrasound Doppler can be used in order to
      diagnose asymptomatic DVT (deep vein thrombosis). Hematological coagulation tests, including
      procoagulant microparticles will be performed for the evaluation of coagulation profile, in
      order to evaluate the possible correlation between the prevalence of asymptomatic DVT and
      these laboratory parameters.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cancer patients with an advanced stage of the disease, hospitalized in the oncology
             department.

          -  WHO performance status of 3( i.e. spends more than half his/her time in bed or seated)
             - or 4 ( i.e. completely confined to bed or to chair) : for at least a week; according
             to the treating physician, the poor performance status results from advanced
             malignancy.

          -  Patient is asymptomatic for lower extremity DVT according to the treating physician

        Exclusion Criteria:
