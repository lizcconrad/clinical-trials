      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of vorinostat when given together
      with azacitidine in treating patients with nasopharyngeal cancer or nasal natural killer
      T-cell lymphoma that has recurred (come back) at or near the same place as the original
      (primary) tumor, usually after a period of time during which the cancer could not be detected
      or has spread to other parts of the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vorinostat and
      azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Vorinostat and
      azacitidine also may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth. Giving vorinostat together with azacitidine may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Define toxicity profile of escalating doses of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)
      given in conjunction with a fixed dose of 5 Azacytidine (5AC) (azacitidine) in patients with
      locally recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma and natural killer (NK)-T cell
      nasal lymphoma.

      II. Define the biologically optimal dose of SAHA given in conjunction with a fixed dose of
      5AC in patients with locally recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma and NKT cell
      nasal lymphoma based on evidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic induction in tumor
      biopsies and plasma.

      III. Study the effect of 5AC on the pharmacokinetic of SAHA in patients with locally
      recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma and NK-T cell nasal lymphoma.

      IV. Assess the effect of SAHA on histone acetylation as measured in tumor and peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells of patients with locally recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma and NK-T cell nasal lymphoma V. Assess the effect of 5AC on EBV promoter
      demethylation as measured in tumor patients with locally recurrent and metastatic
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma and NK-T cell nasal lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vorinostat (SAHA).

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-10 and vorinostat orally (PO)
      twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with responding disease may continue treatment at the discretion of the principal
      investigator. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SAHA until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

    <measure>Precision of the estimated dose-response curve based on induction of lytically replicated viral particles in the plasma following treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A non-parametric and a parametric approach will be used. The non-parametric approach will entail averaging the biologic effects from the patients at each time point, plotting them versus dose, and connecting the points to get the dose-response curve. The parametric approach will use a polynomial regression model with two degrees of freedom for modeling dose. A spline model may also be used.</description>

    <description>Performed using a validated high performance liquid chromatography method. Maximum concentration (Cmax) and time to Cmax will be read off the curve, terminal T1/2 will be derived using the slope of the terminal portion of the semilogarithmic concentration-time plot, incorporating at least 3 time points in the extrapolation of the curve. Area-under-the curve (AUC) (infinity) of the semilog plot will be estimated using the trapezoidal method, and oral clearance (CL/F) will be derived using Dose/AUC, volume of distribution will be calculated.</description>
