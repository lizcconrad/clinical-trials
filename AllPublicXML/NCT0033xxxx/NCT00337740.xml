  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whether beta-blockers or banding is the best therapy for primary prophylaxis of variceal
      bleeding is subject to debate. A randomized comparison between the two treatments was
      performed in candidates for liver transplantation. Patients with Child B and C cirrhosis with
      high risk varices and no previous variceal bleeding are randomized to propranolol or variceal
      bleeding. Primary end point is variceal bleeding

  <why_stopped>
    From the interim analysis resulted that more than 1000 patients were required to demonstrate a
    significant difference between the 2 treatments.
