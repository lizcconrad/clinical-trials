      The purpose of this study is to determine if the naturopathic Anti-Inflammatory Diet results
      in reduced inflammation and a better response by the immune system when compared to a
      standard diabetic diet based on the current American Diabetes Association guidelines.

      This study will test the effects of two different diets on the immune system and inflammation
      in diabetes and pre-diabetes. These diets are the &quot;Anti-Inflammatory Diet&quot; (AI Diet) used by
      many naturopathic doctors and a standard diabetic diet based on the American Diabetes
      Association recommendations (ADA Diet). The AI diet excludes wheat, dairy products, eggs, red
      meat, caffeine, alcohol, peanuts and certain fruits and vegetables. The ADA diet includes
      most foods but controls the amount of each of the food groups.

      Naturopathic physicians often use healthful diets to treat diseases but many of these diets
      have not been compared to usual medical diet treatments. We will be looking at blood markers
      that show how the immune system responds to the different diets. We are expecting that the AI
      diet will result in less inflammation and a better response by the immune system than the ADA
      diet. We will also be looking at levels of blood lipids and glucose to see any effects on
      these risk factors.
