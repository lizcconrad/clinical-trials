  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many infertile patients have a decreased chance of becoming pregnant when using in vitro
      fertilization (IVF). For these patients, many different treatments are available, but none of
      them have been shown to be better than the others. We are testing which of three different
      treatments are better than the others. Patients who are expected to have a decreased response
      to ovarian stimulation will be randomized to either a microflare protocol, an antagonist
      protocol, or a demi-halt protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infertile patients with an anticipated poor response to ovarian stimulation will be
      randomized to one of three different protocols in their upcoming IVF cycle. Each of the
      protocols will be performed as is the standard of care with the addition of serum evaluation
      during the course of the stimulation as well as follicular fluid analysis which is obtained
      as a byproduct of the oocyte retrieval. Chart review will be performed to collect background
      characteristics (including age, ethnicity, previous fertility treatment), treatment response
      (such as oocyte number, embryo grade, embryo quality), and pregnancy outcome (such as
      miscarriage, singleton pregnancy, or higher-order multiple pregnancy). Statistical analysis
      will be performed to determine if one protocol leads to higher pregnancy rates and
      multivariate analysis will be performed to determine potential etiologic variables.
