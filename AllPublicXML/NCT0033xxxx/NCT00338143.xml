      This is a Phase IIIb, open label, uncontrolled, multicenter study designed to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of 12 weeks of subcutaneously administered efalizumab in subjects
      with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy and may also
      be receiving topical therapies, PUVA, or UVB phototherapy during the efalizumab treatment
      period.
