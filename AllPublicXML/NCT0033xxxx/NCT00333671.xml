  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic macular oedema is characterized by fluid accumulation in the retinal tissue from
      leaking retinal vessels, the capillaries. This state can lead to severe visual loss and
      blindness. According to basic physiologic rules several factors influence the fluid transport
      between the capillaries and the surrounding tissue. One of these factors is the balance
      between the large molecules within the vessel lumen and the retinal tissue. Some drugs change
      this balance, the osmotic balance, by moving the fluid from the tissue to the vessel lumen.
      In relation to diabetic macular oedema, treatment with such a drug potentially would reduce
      the retinal thickness because it extracts fluid from the retinal tissue. Glycerol has this
      potential. If reduction of the thickness with glycerol is confirmed, then it proves the
      significance of the osmotic balance in the basic nature of diabetic macular oedema.

      In this study we therefore examine the time dependent change in retinal thickness after
      glycerol intake by an instrument called optical coherence tomography (OCT). The participants
      drink glycerol and the thickness of the retina is then monitored closely by OCT during the
      following three hours. Since diabetic changes in the retina are focal pr. definition, the
      secondary purpose of the study is to find any regional differences in the response. The
      examinations are repeated at a second visit where the patient drink another dose of glycerol,
      because we also want to analyse for a dose dependent response. Which dose is given at each
      visit is randomised on beforehand. In addition to measuring the retinal thickness a variety
      of examinations are performed both before and during the study, e.g. blood samples and
      systemic blood pressure measurements.

      In general, when oedema is present, increasing the osmotic pressure in the retinal
      capillaries by an osmotic drug induces transcapillary fluid transport from the retinal tissue
      to the vascular lumen, according to the Starling equation. Theoretically, in diabetic macular
      oedema the event would lead to reduction of the retinal thickness, which could then be
      visualised by Optical Coherence Tomography. The main purpose of this trial is therefore to
      evaluate and quantify the changes in retinal thickness of the oedema after increasing the
      intracapillary osmotic pressure with glycerol ingestion. A reduction of the retinal thickness
      will confirm the application of the Starling osmotic forces on diabetic macular oedema.
      Secondly, we want to describe any regional differences in the retinal response and analyse
      for dose dependent variations.

      Principles of material and methods: A prospective, randomized, clinical trial on 15 patients
      with diabetic significant macular oedema. At baseline the patients undergo a thorough
      ophthalmologic examination including ETDRS visual acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy, Optical
      Coherence Tomography (Stratus-OCT), 7-field fundus photography followed by fluorescein
      angiography. In addition the systemic blood pressure is measured and blood samples are taken
      to rule out severe renal insufficiency and to estimate glycosylated haemoglobin.

      The patients are all randomised to drink either 1.5 or 3 mL glycerol/kg body weight (max. 250
      mL pr day) on the first of two visit dates. The last dose is given at the second visit. In
      the following three hours the retinal thickness is then monitored closely by Stratus-OCT
      after the glycerol ingestion.

      The plasma osmolality and plasma triglyceride (an indirect indicator of glycerol) are
      confirmed by venous blood samples, also at predetermined times after the last swallow of
      glycerol. In addition the systemic blood pressure and the capillary blood glucose are
      monitored closely during the visit.
