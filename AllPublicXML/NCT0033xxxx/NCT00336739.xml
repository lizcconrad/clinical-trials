      The purpose of this study is to determine whether cinacalcet will increase gastric acid
      secretion in healthy volunteers.

      The calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) was originally found on parathyroid and renal cells and
      more recently it has been identified on cells that regulate gastric acid secretion (G cells
      and parietal cells). However, its role in regulating acid secretion in humans is completely
      unknown and is of potential importance because an acid environment in the stomach enhances
      intestinal calcium absorption. In this pilot project, we will stimulate the CaSR with a
      CaSR-agonist called cinacalcet. Our hypothesis is that activation of the CaSR will in turn
      increase gastric acid production in healthy volunteers.
