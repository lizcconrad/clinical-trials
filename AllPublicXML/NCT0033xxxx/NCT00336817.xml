  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of Myfortic with CellCept
      in liver transplant patients. Myfortic and CellCept are both immunosuppressive
      (anti-rejection) drugs. CellCept is commonly used after liver transplantation but
      gastrointestinal (GI) side effects are very common, sometimes necessitating in its
      discontinuation. Myfortic is a new drug similar to CellCept, except it is enteric-coated. Our
      hypothesis is that Myfortic has less GI side effects than CellCept and also has comparable
      effectiveness to CellCept.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, single center, safety and efficacy study
      comparing Myfortic with CellCept used after liver transplantation. Patients with
      biopsy-proven acute cellular rejection, renal insufficiency (i.e. acute or chronic renal
      failure requiring hemodialysis or patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/min), or
      calcineurin inhibitor-induced neurotoxicity (defined as the presence of neurologic symptoms
      such as tremors, altered mental status, seizures, etc) will be randomized to start on either
      Myfortic (720 mg po bid) or CellCept (1 gm po bid). In those patients with
      calcineurin-induced neurotoxicity or nephrotoxicity, tacrolimus or cyclosporine doses will
      also be reduced to maintain serum trough levels of 4-8 mg/dl or 100-200 mg/dl, respectively.

      Comparison: Thirty patients will be enrolled and randomized in this two-armed, double-blinded
      studyâ€” half of the patients will receive Myfortic and the other half, CellCept.

    <measure>GI Side Effects as Assessed by Gastro Intestinal Symptoms Rating Scale (GSRS) of Enteric-coated Mycophenolate Sodium vs Mycophenolate Mofetil</measure>
    <time_frame>screening, 2, 6 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The GSRS contains 15 items, each rated on a seven-point Likert scale from no discomfort to very severe discomfort. Based on a factor analysis, the 15 GSRS items break down into the following five scale: abdominal pain syndrome ( abdominal pain, hunger pains, and nausea); reflux syndrome (heartburn and acid regurgitation), diarrhea syndrome (diarrhea, loose stools and urgent need for defecation), indigestion syndrome (borborygmus, abdominal distension, eructation and increased flatus) and constipation syndrome (constipation, hard stools, and feeling of incomplete evacuation).
The GSRS is a disease-specific instrument of 15 items combined into five symptom clusters depicting Reflux, Abdominal pain, Indigestion, Diarrhea, and Constipation. The GSRS has a seven-point graded Likert-type scale where 1 represents absence of troublesome symptoms and 7 represents very troublesome symptoms. The total GSRS range of scores is 15 to 105 with higher scores meaning the worst of symptoms.</description>

        <title>GI Side Effects as Assessed by Gastro Intestinal Symptoms Rating Scale (GSRS) of Enteric-coated Mycophenolate Sodium vs Mycophenolate Mofetil</title>
        <description>The GSRS contains 15 items, each rated on a seven-point Likert scale from no discomfort to very severe discomfort. Based on a factor analysis, the 15 GSRS items break down into the following five scale: abdominal pain syndrome ( abdominal pain, hunger pains, and nausea); reflux syndrome (heartburn and acid regurgitation), diarrhea syndrome (diarrhea, loose stools and urgent need for defecation), indigestion syndrome (borborygmus, abdominal distension, eructation and increased flatus) and constipation syndrome (constipation, hard stools, and feeling of incomplete evacuation).
The GSRS is a disease-specific instrument of 15 items combined into five symptom clusters depicting Reflux, Abdominal pain, Indigestion, Diarrhea, and Constipation. The GSRS has a seven-point graded Likert-type scale where 1 represents absence of troublesome symptoms and 7 represents very troublesome symptoms. The total GSRS range of scores is 15 to 105 with higher scores meaning the worst of symptoms.</description>

        <title>GI Side Effects as Assessed by Gastro Intestinal Symptoms Rating Scale (GSRS) of Enteric-coated Mycophenolate Sodium vs Mycophenolate Mofetil ( Indigestion Subscale)</title>
        <description>The GSRS contains 15 items, each rated on a seven-point Likert scale from no discomfort to very severe discomfort. Based on a factor analysis, the 15 GSRS items break down into the following five scale: abdominal pain syndrome ( abdominal pain, hunger pains, and nausea); reflux syndrome (heartburn and acid regurgitation), diarrhea syndrome (diarrhea, loose stools and urgent need for defecation), indigestion syndrome (borborygmus, abdominal distension, eructation and increased flatus) and constipation syndrome (constipation, hard stools, and feeling of incomplete evacuation).
The GSRS is a disease-specific instrument of 15 items combined into five symptom clusters depicting Reflux, Abdominal pain, Indigestion, Diarrhea, and Constipation. The GSRS has a seven-point graded Likert-type scale where 1 represents absence of troublesome symptoms and 7 represents very troublesome symptoms.
The Indigestion subscale range is 4 to 28 with higher scores means worst symptoms</description>
