    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Strongest Families (formerly Family Help Program)is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the Strongest Families distance intervention compared to usual or standard
      care that is typically provided to children with mild to moderate sleep onset latency and/or
      bedtime resistance difficulties. This is a single-centre trial based at the IWK Health
      Centre. The primary outcome is change in sleep patterns (sleep onset latency and/or bedtime
      resistance).

    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Family Help Sleep Program is to deliver, primary care mental health
      services to children and their families in the comfort and privacy of their own home.
      Approximately 80 children (6-12 years of age)suffering from mild to moderate sleep onset
      latency and/or bedtime resistance will be randomized.

      The intervention is delivered from a distance, using an educational handbook and telephone
      consultation with a trained paraprofessional &quot;coach&quot; who is supervised by a licensed health
      care professional. The telephone coach delivers consistent care based on written protocols,
      with on-going evaluation by a professional team.
