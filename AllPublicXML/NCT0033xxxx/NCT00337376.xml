  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rapamycin is a drug that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (government)
      for use in patients receiving a kidney transplant to prevent the patient's body from
      rejecting the transplanted kidney. It has shown antitumor effects in the laboratory, but has
      not been approved at this time for the treatment of cancer. Abraxane is a new form of
      chemotherapy that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of
      metastatic breast cancer, and is a promising drug that is being evaluated in clinical trials
      for treatment of other cancers. This is a phase I study designed to find out if different
      doses of Rapamycin, when combined with Abraxane, are safe and well tolerated.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically-confirmed advanced solid tumors.

          -  For patients with metastatic breast cancer, there will be no restriction on prior
             therapy. For patients with other advanced solid tumors, they must be refractory to
             standard therapy or for which no curative standard therapy exists, to be considered.
             Metastatic disease, if present, should not be progressing so as to require palliative
             treatment within 4 weeks of enrollment based on clinical assessment by the
             investigator.

          -  Development of new lesions or an increase in preexisting lesions on bone scintigraphy,
             CT, MRI or by physical examination. Patients in whom the sole criterion for
             progression is an increase in a biochemical marker, e.g., carcinoembryonic antigen
             (CEA), or an increase in symptoms, are not eligible.

          -  No radiotherapy, treatment with cytotoxic agents, or treatment with biologic agents
             within the 4 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this study (6 weeks for mitomycin
             or nitrosoureas). At least 2 weeks must have elapsed from any prior surgery or
             hormonal therapy. Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxicities of any
             prior treatment with cytotoxic drugs, radiotherapy or other anti-cancer modalities
             (returned to baseline status as noted before most recent treatment). Patients with
             persisting, stable chronic toxicities from prior treatment ≤ grade 1 are eligible.

          -  Age ≥18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A).

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

        Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL leukocytes ≥3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL platelets
        ≥100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limits AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)2.5 X
        institutional upper limit of normal creatinine within 1.5 x ULN OR creatinine clearance ≥50
        mL/min/1.73 m² for patients with creatinine levels ≥1.5 ULN.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation and must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 1
             week prior to beginning treatment on this trial. Pregnant and nursing patients are
             excluded because the effects of the combination of Abraxane and Rapamycin on a fetus
             or nursing child are unknown. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately. Sexually active men must also use appropriate contraception method and
             should not father a child while receiving therapy during this study.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Fasting serum cholesterol &lt;350 mg/d L and triglycerides &lt; 400 mg/ d L.

          -  Biopsy is required but patients or physicians may opt out of this part of the trial if
             sufficient justification is provided. Justification must be provided to the PI in
             writing indicating excessive physical risk or psychological trauma if biopsy is taken

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be 4 weeks from chemotherapy or radiotherapy and have recovered from any
             adverse events

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with known active brain metastases. Patients must have completed definitive
             treatment for brain metastases, at least 4 weeks prior to first dose on this study,
             and off steroids for at least 2 weeks, with stable or regressing CNS lesions by MRI or
             CT scan, and no evidence of new lesions.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to agents used in study.

          -  Peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade 2

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the investigational agents may
             have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with these agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated.

          -  HIV-positive patients are ineligible because these patients are at increased risk of
             lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy and the potential
             pharmacokinetic interaction between antiretroviral therapy and the investigational
             agents.

          -  All herbal and alternative medications should be discontinued while on study, these
             include but not limited to: Hydrastis canadensis (goldenseal), Uncaria tomentosa
             (cat's claw) Echinacea angustifolia

          -  Use of any of these medications within 1 week, prior to the first dose of treatment:
             cyclosporine, diltiazem, ketoconazole, rifampin, fluconazole, delavirdine,
             nicardipine, pioglitazone and sulfonamides, erythromycin, clarithromycin,
             itraconazole, metoclopramide, nevirapine, Phenobarbital, phenytoin, indinavir
             fosamprenavir, ritonavir, efavirenz, nefazadone, and St. John's wort.

          -  Consumption of grapefruit juice is prohibited during the study.

          -  Requirement for treatment with warfarin (Coumadin), immunosuppressive agents or
             chronic steroids

          -  Prior therapy with rapamycin, rapamycin analogs or experimental agents targeting mTOR

          -  Prior Abraxane therapy

          -  Active infection or treatment for systemic infections within 14 days of enrollment.
