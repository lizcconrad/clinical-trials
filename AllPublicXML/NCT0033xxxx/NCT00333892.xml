  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To further investigate differences in the immunologic function of various lymphocyte subsets
      in HIV-infected patients who are treated early in their infection and during the chronic
      phase of the infection. Studies will also be done to further delineate the various
      antigen-specific and innate immune responses including characterization of soluble factors
      associated with primary HIV infection.

      Primary HIV-1 infected and chronically infected individuals will be recruited and
      leukapheresis will be performed. This one year study requires that patients be apheresed once
      before initiating therapy and on two other occasions (at month 6 and month 12) after
      suppression of plasma viremia. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be isolated by sodium
      diatrizoate density centrifugation and subjected to immunologic and virologic studies.
