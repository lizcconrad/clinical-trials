    <textblock>
      This study is designed to provide long-term safety and efficacy data for the combination
      doses of VAH (VAL/ HCTZ) 40/6.25mg and 80/12.5mg in essential hypertensive patients. The 350
      patients (approximately) who have successfully finished the core trial CVAH631B1303 and
      signed consent for the extension will be enrolled into this study.
