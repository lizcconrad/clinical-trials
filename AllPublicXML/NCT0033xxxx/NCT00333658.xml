  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research has been designed to learn whether getting regular and specific feedback about
      work performance with small rewards for meeting goals helps people to improve their job
      performance and leads to better work outcomes, improved mental functioning, and better
      quality of life

      This study is designed to test whether systematic work performance feedback with weekly goal
      setting, combined with small rewards given for goal achievement, leads to improved
      vocational, health, and quality of life outcomes for veterans enrolled in the various work
      service programs at this medical center. The long-term goal of this project is to determine
      the effectiveness of these interventions at this medical center and to use this experience
      for a multi-site cooperative study proposal.

      Research Design and Methods: One hundred and fifty subjects accepted into work services at
      this medical center will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: Work Feedback with
      Small Rewards, or Usual Services. In the Work Feedback with Small Rewards condition,
      participants attend a weekly workers meeting where they receive specific feedback based upon
      the Work Behavior Inventory and set weekly goals. They also receive small rewards for goal
      achievement that equal $10 per month. Participants in the Usual Services condition do not get
      specific work feedback but receive all the usual work services normally provided. They also
      receive $10 per month for active participation. Assessments include baseline evaluations of
      mental and physical health, social function, cognitive function, and quality of life.
      Evaluations of mental health, quality of life, and job satisfaction will occur at two months
      and four months. Six-month and twelve month evaluations will repeat the baseline assessment.
      Outcome measures will include biweekly work performance assessments, vocational outcomes,
      mental and physical health status, social and cognitive function, and quality of life
