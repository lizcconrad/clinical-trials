  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose a population-based case-control study among 7000 elementary school children in
      semi-rural Johnston County, NC. Teachers will complete a screening form on each child.
      Controls will be randomly selected. Mothers of potential cases and controls will be
      interviewed by telephone about their child's symptoms of ADHD and exposure history, their
      family history of ADHD, and their reproductive and exposure history. Children's shed baby
      teeth will be analyzed for lead. Mothers will complete brief parenting scales and the Child
      Behavior Checklist. School records will be collected. The study goals are to identify risk
      factors for ADHD including preterm delivery and childhood lead exposure.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        During the first phase of the study, all children will be screened by the homeroom teacher,
        EXCEPT for those students in certain self-contained classrooms. Self-contained classrooms
        for students with an IQ less than 70 or autism will be omitted from the screening. In the
        second phase of the study, children designated as &quot;LEP&quot;, or Low English Proficiency, will
        be excluded from the study.
