  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine
      administered to surgical patients intra-operatively will improve the characteristics of sleep
      post-operatively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physiological similarities exist between the anesthetized state and sleep. Pathways within
      the brain controlling sleep and wakefulness are also affected by anesthesia. One significant
      difference between the states of anesthesia and sleep is the ability to respond whenever a
      relatively mild stimulus is applied, e.g. verbal command or gently shaking. Interestingly,
      this feature of arousability is seen when dexmedetomidine is used for sedation but is absent
      when alternative intravenous anesthetic agents, e.g. propofol, are used to provide similar
      degree of sedation. Recent studies have shown that dexmedetomidine acts on receptors located
      within the locus ceruleus, which are responsible for both sleep and anesthesia.

      During a recent study volunteers received an infusion of dexmedetomidine during the afternoon
      prior to remaining under study conditions for the duration of the night. The study was not
      designed to measure sleep but anecdotal reporting from the participants suggested that they
      were able to resume their normal day's activities whilst the subject receiving placebo felt
      extremely fatigued from lack of sleep. This prompted the establishment of a pilot study to
      determine if dexmedetomidine could provide restorative sleep to people under disturbed sleep
      conditions i.e. postoperative patients.
