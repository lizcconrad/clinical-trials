    <textblock>
      The study is to evaluate and compare the effects on kidney function of three iodinated
      contrast media (CM) in patients at risk of kidney damage evaluating serum creatinine (Scr)
      concentrations up to three days after CM administration.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a combination of DM (type I or II) and renal impairment (RI), defined as
             SCr ≥150 µmol/L (1.7 mg/dL) for men and ≥133 µmol/L (1.5 mg/dL) for women or
             creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≤50 mL/min calculated according to Cockroft-Gault formula,
             referred for coronary angiography with or without PCI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent administration of potentially nephroprotective or nephrotoxic drugs is not
             allowed. Subjects undergoing dialysis or kidney transplantation or with CrCl &lt; 20
             mL/min will not be included.
