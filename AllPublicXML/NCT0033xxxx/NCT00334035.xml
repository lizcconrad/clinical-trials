    <textblock>
      For schizophrenic patients who remained in remission while on maintenance medication, there
      may come a point in time when the relative risk for relapse become so low that
      discontinuation of therapy can be considered. This study is to investigate whether that point
      in time is reached in 12 months following the first episode illness. Moreover, it also aims
      to identify other predictors of relapse as well as to evaluate the costs and benefits of
      maintenance therapy.
