    <textblock>
      Chronic daily headache has been classified into several categories. One category is of sudden
      onset and is called New Daily Persistent Headache (NDPH). Another category of daily headache
      evolves gradually and is called Transformed Migraine (TM). This research study is being
      conducted to compare people with these two kinds of daily headache in order to improve our
      understanding of these conditions.
