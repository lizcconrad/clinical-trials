  <brief_title>Comparative Study of Valsartan and Amlodipine Versus Amlodipine Alone in Hypertension</brief_title>

      The objective of this study is to evaluate efficacy, safety and tolerability of the
      valsartan+amlodipine association in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, in
      comparison to amlodipine alone.

      Patients should have mild to moderate essential hypertension [grades 1 and 2 of WHO
      classification (8)]. The diastolic blood pressure threshold for inclusion in this study is 95
      mmHg, as these patients are more likely to benefit from association therapy than patients
      with lower diastolic blood pressure.

      For safety reasons, patients with severe hypertension (grade 3 of WHO classification) will
      not be included in this study. Moreover, patients developing severe hypertension (MSDBP &gt; 110
      mmHg and/or MSSBP &gt; 180 mmHg) during the open-label treatment phase will be discontinued from
      the study.

        Incl- Patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (grade 1 and 2 of WHO
        classification).

        - Patients with essential diastolic hypertension measured by a standard aneroid or mercury
        column sphygmomanometer showing MSDBP &gt; 95 mmHg and &lt; 110 mmHg and MSSBP &lt;180 mmHg.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe hypertension (grade 3 of WHO classification: DBP &gt;= 110 mmHg and/or SBP â‰¥ 180
             mmHg) or malignant hypertension.

          -  Inability to completely discontinue all antihypertensive medications safely for a
             period of at least 2 weeks as required by the protocol.

          -  Evidence of a secondary form of hypertension, such as coarctation of aorta,
             hyperaldosteronism, unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, Cushing's disease,
             pheochromocytoma, polycystic kidney disease, etc.
