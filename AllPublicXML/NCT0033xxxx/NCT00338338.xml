    <textblock>
      The sustained reduction in elevated blood pressure and lower incidence of adverse events of
      Lacidipine may provide additional benefits for hypertension patients than other CCBs (calcium
      channel blockers). This study is to compare the efficacy and safety of Lacidipine with
      Amlodipine, the most widely used CCB in Taiwan, in hypertensive patients.
