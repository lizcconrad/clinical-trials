      RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as cellular adoptive immunotherapy, may stimulate the
      immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Aldesleukin may stimulate
      the white blood cells, including lymphokine-activated killer cells, to kill tumor cells.
      Giving cellular adoptive immunotherapy during or after surgery may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well cellular adoptive immunotherapy works in
      treating patients with glioblastoma multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the feasibility, side effects, and toxicity associated with intracranial
           cellular adoptive immunotherapy comprising aldesleukin-stimulated lymphokine-activated
           killer cells in patients with glioblastoma multiforme.

        -  Determine progression-free and overall survival of these patients.

        -  Compare survival of these patients to that of contemporary and historical controls.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo therapeutic craniotomy.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis to obtain lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells 3-7 days
      before therapeutic craniotomy OR 4-6 weeks after therapeutic craniotomy. Patients receive
      cellular adoptive immunotherapy comprising aldesleukin-stimulated LAK cells intracranially at
      the time of therapeutic craniotomy OR via an Ommaya reservoir (placed during craniotomy) no
      sooner than 4-6 weeks after therapeutic craniotomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
