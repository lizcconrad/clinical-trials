    <textblock>
      About 20-25% of deliveries are by cesarean section. Most are elective with use of regional
      anesthesia (spinal/epidural). Drop of blood pressure after regional anesthesia is common. It
      have the risk of reduction of blood flow to the placenta and the fetus.

      No studies had followed the newborns their first days of live,of mothers who developed
      hypotension in durins CS.

      A reterospective study of all full term babies, born in elective cesarean section with use of
      regional anesthesia. Two groups will be define rgarding maternal hypotention following
      regional anesthesia - maternal hypotention (study group) or normal maternal BP. The
      definition of Maternal hypotension: decrease in 10% or more in mean BP in compared to first
      BP taken at admition.

      Data will colect from mothers and neonates records as well as operation data. Maternal data:
      gravida, parity, diseases, medications, demographics, and all data regarding the operation
      (blood pressures, Heart rates, saturation, treatment given etc.).

      Infant data: gestational age, birth weight, sex, Apgar, cord pH, clinical manifestations,
      medications, time of hospitalization.
