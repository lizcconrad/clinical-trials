      Background: Intravenous infusion of lidocaine may decrease postoperative pain and speed
      return of bowel function. The investigators therefore tested the hypothesis that including
      perioperative lidocaine infusion improves recovery from laparoscopic colectomy and shortens
      the duration of hospitalization.

      Methods: Forty patients scheduled for laparoscopic colectomy were randomly allocated to
      receive intravenous lidocaine (bolus injection of 1.5 mg.kg-1 lidocaine at induction of
      anesthesia, then a continuous infusion of 2 mg.kg-1.h-1 intraoperatively and 1.33 mg.kg-1.h-1
      for 24 h postoperatively) or an equal volume of saline. All patients received similar
      intensive postoperative rehabilitation. Postoperative pain scores, opioid consumption, and
      fatigue scores were measured. Times to first flatus, defecation, and hospital discharge were
      recorded. Postoperative endocrine (cortisol and catecholamines) and metabolic (leucocytes,
      C-reactive protein, and glucose) responses were measured for 48 h. Data (median [25%-75%
      interquartile range] Saline vs Lidocaine groups) were analyzed using Mann-Whitney tests.
      P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.
