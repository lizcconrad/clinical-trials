  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to define the optimal management of localised transitional cell
      carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder. The main objective is to evaluate whether
      chemoradiation is superior to radiotherapy alone.

      Whilst concurrent chemo-radiation is increasingly being looked upon as the treatment of
      choice for patients referred for bladder preservation, the study by the NCI of Canada (Coppin
      CM, Gospodarowicz MK et al.Improved Local Control of Invasive Bladder Cancer by Concurrent
      Cisplatin and Pre-operative or Definitive Radiation.J. of Clinical Oncol. 14(11): 2901-2907,
      1996) is the only randomised trial to show some superiority of concurrent Cisplatin and
      radiation treatment over radiation alone in increasing pelvic tumour control. There was no
      impact on overall survival. However, this study had relatively small subject numbers and
      included two distinct treatment options. In one group the patients were treated with a
      bladder sparing approach and in the other by pre-operative therapy and cystectomy with the
      type of definitive treatment being decided upon by both the treating Specialist and patient.
      At 5 years the pelvic failure rates in the radiation alone and chemo-radiation arms were 59%
      and 40% respectively. With half of the patients in each group having had planned cystectomy
      as part of their treatment regimen, the above rates of local relapse (especially in the
      chemo-radiation arm) are disappointing.

      Given the concerns with the above study, and the continuing paucity of randomised phase III
      studies comparing chemo-radiation with radiation alone, there lies an opportunity for
      Australasian centres to take up the challenge. For this study, the proposed schedule for the
      chemo-radiation arm is to be the same as that being investigated in our previous phase II
      study (six weekly doses of Cisplatin plus radiation to a dose of 64Gy in 32 fractions over
      6.5 weeks). This will be compared with radical radiation alone (64Gy in 32 fractions over 6.5
      weeks).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven TCC of the urinary bladder. Mixed tumours comprising

             also eligible.

          -  Clinically and radiologically localised T2, T3 or T4a non-bulky disease (&lt;= 7cm in
             maximum dimension), N0, M0.

        If radiological evaluation of a lymph node is interpreted as &quot;positive&quot; this must be
        evaluated further by either lymph node sampling or percutaneous needle biopsy. Patients
        with histologically confirmed lymph node metastases will not be eligible.

          -  Maximal TUR.

          4. intravesical BCG

        does not exclude the patient from being eligible. However, the patient should have an
        adequate functioning bladder (this should be clarified with the referring Urologist and if
        need be voiding volumes should be measured).

          -  Creatinine clearance &gt;= 50ml/minute by calculation or measurement.

             10^9/L and a platelet count &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L.

          -  ECOG status of 0, 1 or 2.

          -  No age limit applies provided the patient is mentally, physically and geographically
             capable of undergoing treatment and follow-up.

          -  No significant intercurrent morbidity.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pure squamous carcinomas or adenocarcinomas.

          -  Extensive or multifocal CIS change in the bladder.

          -  T3 or T4a tumours unsuitable for curative treatment (i.e. &gt; 7cm in any dimension),
             T4b, node positive and metastatic disease.

          -  Presence of ureteric obstruction due to tumour infiltration at the UO not amenable to
             stenting.

          -  Previous radiation treatment to the pelvis.

          -  Previous significant pelvic surgery.

          -  Significant bowel or gynaecological inflammatory disease.

          -  Creatinine clearance &lt; 50ml/minute by calculation or measurement. A white blood cell
             count &lt; 3.5 x 10^9/L with an absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1.5 x 10^9L and/or a platelet
             count &lt; 100 x 10^9/L.

             5 years, except for:

               1. non-melanoma skin cancer, and/or

               2. (a) Stage T1 well differentiated prostatic carcinoma in men, and In situ
                  carcinoma of the cervix in women.
