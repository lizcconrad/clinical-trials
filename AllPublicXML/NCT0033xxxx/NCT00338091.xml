    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the trial was to evaluate whether the optimal antiproteinuric doses of
      benazepril (an ACE inhibitor) or losartan (an ARB), as compared with their conventional
      doses, can safely improve the long-term renal outcome in nondiabetic patients with
      proteinuria and chronic renal insufficiency. The second aim was to compare the long-term
      renal protection between benazepril and losartan at similar clinical setting.
