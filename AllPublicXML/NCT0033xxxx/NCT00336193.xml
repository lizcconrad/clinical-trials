  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal examines the impact of an augmented competency based approach to training of
      home visitors and supervisors for delivery of the Nurse Family Partnership (NFP) on staff
      performance, fidelity to the program model, and family outcomes relative to child
      maltreatment and early behaviors associated with youth violence. The central premise
      underlying the proposed study is that the augmented competency based curriculum and clinical
      consultation to supervisors will improve nurses' knowledge and skills in working with
      families, which in turn, will lead to greater fidelity to the home visit guidelines (i.e.,
      quality implementation), which in turn, will result in better maternal and child health
      outcomes.

      A two group experimental design will be used to examine the impact of an augmented
      competency-based curriculum for NFP home visitors and supervisors coupled with structured
      clinical consultation by NFP National Office professional development staff, as compared
      against the standard curriculum currently used, on quality of program implementation and
      family outcomes.
