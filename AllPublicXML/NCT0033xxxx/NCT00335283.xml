  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether aggressive acid suppression with
      Lansoprazole is effective in the treatment of post nasal drip, and also assess the predictors
      of response based on clinical and physiologic parameters.

    <textblock>
      Postnasal drip (PND) is a common complaint that brings patients to the attention of their
      primary care physicians. It is also one of the most common reasons for patients to seek care
      from otolaryngologists. Traditionally, PND has been considered and treated as a symptom of
      sinonasal pathology. It has also been shown, along with Gastroesophageal reflux disease
      (GERD) and asthma, to be a major contributor to the development of chronic cough. PND
      refractory to treatment aimed at sinonasal disease is sometimes treated with anti-GERD
      therapy. This treatment modality is based on clinical experience. To date, there are no
      studies in the literature to support a causal relationship between PND and extraesophageal
      reflux (EER). In a case control study of patients with and without esophagitis El-Serag et al
      reported a significant association (odds ratio 1.6, 95%CI 1.4-1.8) between sinusitis and
      GERD. A later study by Ulualp et al in 11 CT confirmed cases of chronic sinusitis resistant
      to therapy with conventional sinus therapies they found a significantly higher prevalence of
      hypopharyngeal acid exposure in the sinusitis group than controls. Recently, in an open label
      prospective pilot trial, DiBaise et al treated 11 patients with sinusitis and 19 GERD
      patients with omeprazole 20mg bid for 3-months. 9/11 sinusitis patients were found to have
      GERD by pH monitoring and there was moderate (25-89%) improvement in the sinus symptoms in
      the omeprazole treated group. However, there are currently no placebo-controlled trials
      assessing efficacy of PPI's in patients with PND.

    <description>The primary outcome measure was postnasal drainage symptom response measured by using a visual analogue scale. At 8 and 16 weeks, a horizontal symptoms scale from 0% (no change) to 100% (symptoms completely resolved) was presented to participants to assess improvement in postnasal drainage symptoms.</description>

        <description>The primary outcome measure was postnasal drainage symptom response measured by using a visual analogue scale. At 8 and 16 weeks, a horizontal symptoms scale from 0% (no change) to 100% (symptoms completely resolved) was presented to participants to assess improvement in postnasal drainage symptoms.</description>

        <population>Analysis was performed per the protocol. At the completion of the study, all data were analyzed by the department of statistics and epidemiologyfor the primary outcome of interest, which was response rate for both lansoprazole and placebo.

A sample size of 33 patients in treated arm was considered sufficient to detect a difference of 35% between groups, assuming a lansoprazole treatment response of 70% and a placebo response of 35% with an alpha level of .05 and 90% power. A total of 75 patienst was considered an adequate sample size to allow for a 10% dropout rate.</groups_desc>
