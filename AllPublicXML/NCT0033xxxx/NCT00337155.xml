        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          -  Hormone refractory with evidence of rising PSA:

               -  Patient must be maintained on androgen ablation therapy with LHRH agonist (stable
                  dose for at least 8 weeks prior to study entry), or have undergone orchiectomy

               -  Serum testosterone level is required to be ≤ 50 ng/dl

                    -  Flutamide, nilutamide or cyproterone acetate must have stopped at least four
                       weeks prior to study drug administration and progression must have been
                       demonstrated since cessation;

                    -  Bicalutamide must have stopped at least six weeks prior to study drug

               -  Elevated and rising PSA:

                    -  Baseline PSA level ≥ 10 ng/ml

                    -  Progressive rise in PSA, defined as two consecutive increases in PSA
                       documented over a previous reference value (measure 1). The first increase
                       in PSA (measure 2) should occur a minimum of 1 week from the reference value
                       (measure 1. This increase in PSA should be confirmed (measure 3) after a
                       minimum of 1 week. If the confirmatory PSA value (measure 3) is less than
                       the previous value, the patient will still be eligible provided the next PSA
                       measure (measure 4)is found to be greater than the second PSA value(measure
                       2).3. Multifocal skeletal metastases confirmed by bone scintigraphy within
