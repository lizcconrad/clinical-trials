  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy system that has
      been designed to identify the chemical composition of coronary artery plaques in patients
      undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extensive studies conducted over the past 7 years in autopsy specimens have demonstrated that
      NIR spectroscopy can identify the plaque structures that are suspected to cause the acute
      coronary artery syndromes(unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and sudden death).

      The application of NIR spectroscopy to identify lipid deposition within coronary arteries has
      shown promising results in preclinical ex vivo studies (14). Infrared spectra are collected
      as follows: light of discrete wavelengths from a laser is directed onto the tissue sample via
      glass fibers. Light scattered from the samples is collected in fibers and launched into a
      spectrometer. The plot of signal intensity as a function of wavelength can be then used to
      develop chemometric models to discriminate lipid-rich deposits from non-atherosclerotic
      tissue, and from atherosclerotic tissue that is predominantly fibrotic and from blood
      elements. This technique is incorporated into a thin catheter with similar dimensions to an
      IVUS catheter, and the intracoronary dwell time for analysis is similar to the broad
      experience with established techniques with proven safety, such as IVUS.
