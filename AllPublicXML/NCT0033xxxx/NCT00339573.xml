  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to conduct a scientifically valid, descriptive survey to measure the prevalence
      and levels of lead in dust, soil, and paint, and the prevalence and levels of various indoor
      allergens in floor and bedding dust in the nation's housing stock. The survey strategy is a
      population-based, multi-stage area probability sample designed to represent all 50 states.
      The survey will include approximately 1000 homes in at least 100 primary sampling units (PSU,
      a metropolitan area or cluster of counties). Residents of candidate participant housing units
      (HUs) will initially be contacted by a letter to introduce and provide a brief explanation of
      the study. A field interviewer will then visit each candidate HU to screen and recruit
      eligible units into the study. A short Screening Questionnaire will be administered to an
      adult HU resident and an invitation will be extended to those HUs that are eligible to
      participate in the study. A field data collection visit will be scheduled for the following
      week, at the resident's convenience. The collection visit will be conducted by two member
      team (including the same field interviewer that will conduct the screening/recruiting visit)
      and will consist of administration of an informed consent form and Data Collection
      Questionnaire, completion of home observation forms, collection of interior dust and exterior
      soil samples, and conduct of nondestructive paint lead analysis on both interior and exterior
      walls. Soil and dust samples will be shipped to analytical laboratories for lead and allergen
      analysis. Extensive survey design, procedure, and reporting details are provided in the
      National Survey Lead Hazards and Allergens in Housing: Protocol and Sample Design Report
      (Attachment A). It is anticipated that this study will provide allergen-specific data
      regarding: 1) housing conditions, demographic factors, and climate to facilitate evaluation
      of regional, ethnic, socioeconomic, and housing characteristic differences in the indoor
      allergen burden; 2) an estimate of indoor allergen exposure in the U.S. population; 3)
      baseline data that can be used to stimulate future studies which attempt to correlate
      allergen exposure to disease outcome. The study will yield lead hazard data to: 1) estimate
      the number and percent of homes with dust and soil lead levels above selected thresholds; 2)
      identify sources of lead in dust in housing; 3) permit future analysis of lead hazard control
      strategies an costs, including associated policy and regulatory guidelines.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The target population for the Survey is the national housing stock of approximately 95
        million housing units.

        The decision to include or exclude a subset is usually based on such factors as relevancy
        to the study objectives, availability of data from other sources, and effort required to
        obtain the study data.

        None of the possible housing type exclusion or oversampling proposals are based upon
        gender, race, ethnic, cultural, or biological factors.

        Housing built after 1977.

        Housing units in multi-family buildings.

        Manufactured housing units, i.e., mobile homes and trailers.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Housing where children are not permitted to live (elderly housing, nursing homes, college
        dormitories, etc.).

        Group housing - both institutional (prisons or jails, detention centers, hospitals,
        military housing, etc.) and non-institutional (dormitories, fraternities, orphanages,
        rooming houses, missions, work camps, convents, etc.).

        Vacant housing.

        Short-term housing. This category includes homes which are not the resident's sole or
        permanent home, and which the resident present at the time of field data collection spends
        less than three months per year. This includes seasonal, occasional use, recreational, and
        second homes, as well as homes for migrant workers.

        Hotels and motels.
