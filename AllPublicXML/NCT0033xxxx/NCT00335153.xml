      The study was composed of a screening period followed by 3 sequential on-treatment periods,
      as follows:

        -  Screening Period (up to 28 days): determination of eligibility and discontinuation of
           antiparkinsonian disease medications other than levodopa-carbidopa immediate release
           (LC-oral) prior to nasojejunal (NJ) tube placement.

        -  NJ Test Period (2 to 14 days): first hospitalization period, Baseline assessments,
           placement of NJ tube, and optimization of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG)
           treatment via NJ tube and infusion pump (participant was hospitalized for NJ tube
           placement but hospitalization was not required for entire duration of LCIG treatment
           optimization).

        -  PEG-J Period (2 to 14 days): second hospitalization period; placement of PEG-J tube;
           further optimization of LCIG treatment.

        -  Post PEG-J Long-Term Treatment Period (Day 28 to Day 378): LCIG administration via a
           permanent PEG-J tube and infusion pump, with dosage adjusted according to clinical
           condition.

Each question is answered on a 5-point scale (0=never, 1=rarely, 2=sometimes, 3=quite frequently, and 4=nearly always). The caregiver burden is evaluated by the total score (Range 0 to 88) obtained from the sum of the answers to the 22 questions. Higher scores are associated with a higher level of burden for the caregiver.</description>

    <description>All participants were to receive LCIG, via the NJ tube during the nasojejunal (NJ) Test Period and delivered to the proximal small intestine via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy - with jejunal extension tube (PEG-J) during the Post-PEG-J Long-Term Treatment Period. The starting dose was individually determined based on the daily dose of oral levodopa prior to study enrollment.
The infusion dose was individually optimized for each participant on the basis of response and potential adverse events. During the Post-PEG-J Long-Term Treatment Period, LCIG was expected to be infused continuously over approximately 16 hours daily with a rate of infusion ranging from 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour), in most instances.</description>

          <title>Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel (LCIG)</title>
          <description>All participants were to receive levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG), via the nasojejunal (NJ) tube during the NJ Test Period and delivered to the proximal small intestine via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with jejunal extension tube (PEG-J) during the Post-PEG-J Long-Term Treatment Period. The starting dose was individually determined based on the daily dose of oral levodopa prior to study enrollment.
The infusion dose was individually optimized for each participant on the basis of response and potential adverse events. During the Post-PEG-J Long-Term Treatment Period, LCIG was expected to be infused continuously over approximately 16 hours daily with a rate of infusion ranging from 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour), in most instances.</description>

          <description>All participants were to receive LCIG, via the NJ tube during the NJ Test Period and delivered to the proximal small intestine via PEG-J during the Post-PEG-J Long-Term Treatment Period. The starting dose was individually determined based on the daily dose of oral levodopa prior to study enrollment.
The infusion dose was individually optimized for each participant on the basis of response and potential adverse events. During the Post-PEG-J Long-Term Treatment Period, LCIG was expected to be infused continuously over approximately 16 hours daily with a rate of infusion ranging from 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour), in most instances.</description>

            <description>All participants were to receive LCIG, via the NJ tube during the NJ Test Period and delivered to the proximal small intestine via PEG-J during the Post-PEG-J Long-Term Treatment Period. The starting dose was individually determined based on the daily dose of oral levodopa prior to study enrollment.
The infusion dose was individually optimized for each participant on the basis of response and potential adverse events. During the Post-PEG-J Long-Term Treatment Period, LCIG was expected to be infused continuously over approximately 16 hours daily with a rate of infusion ranging from 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour), in most instances.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) Total Score at Endpoint</title>
        <description>The AIMS is an investigator-completed rating scale that has a total of 12 items rating involuntary movements of various areas of the participant's body. Items 1 through 10 are rated on a 5-point scale of severity from 0 (none), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe), and items 11 and 12 are yes/no questions regarding issues with teeth or dentures. The total AIMS score was calculated by summing items 1-10, with a possible range of 0-40; a negative change indicates improvement. The AIMS was to be performed at consistent times, when the subject was experiencing his/her worst &quot;On&quot; time (dyskinesia [involuntary muscle movement]).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Average Daily &quot;Off&quot; Time at Endpoint</title>
        <description>Based on the Parkinson's Disease Symptom Diary. &quot;On&quot; time is when PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug. &quot;Off&quot; time is when PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug. The diary is completed every 30 minutes for the full 24 hours of each of 3 days prior to selected clinic visits. It reflects both time awake and time asleep. Daily totals are normalized to a 16-hour scale (i.e. 16 hours of awake time). The normalized totals for the 3 days prior to the visit are averaged for the analysis. Negative change from baseline for &quot;off&quot; time indicates improvement.</description>

            <description>All participants were to receive LCIG, via the NJ tube during the NJ Test Period and delivered to the proximal small intestine via PEG-J during the Post-PEG-J Long-Term Treatment Period. The starting dose was individually determined based on the daily dose of oral levodopa prior to study enrollment.
The infusion dose was individually optimized for each participant on the basis of response and potential adverse events. During the Post-PEG-J Long-Term Treatment Period, LCIG was expected to be infused continuously over approximately 16 hours daily with a rate of infusion ranging from 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour), in most instances.</description>

        <description>The UPDRS is an Investigator-used rating tool to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease. The Part I Score is the sum of the answers to the 4 questions that comprise Part I, each of which are measured on a 5-point scale (0-4). The Part I score ranges from 0-16 and higher scores are associated with more disability.</description>

The PDQ-39 Summary Index is the sum of all answers divided by the highest score possible (i.e. number of answers multiplied by 4) which is multiplied by 100 to put the score on a 0-100 scale. Higher scores are associated with more severe symptoms.</description>

The starting dose was individually determined based on the daily dose of oral levodopa prior to study enrollment.
The infusion dose was individually optimized for each participant on the basis of response and potential adverse events. During the Post-PEG-J Long-Term Treatment Period, LCIG was expected to be infused continuously over approximately 16 hours daily with a rate of infusion ranging from 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour), in most instances.</description>

        <description>The PDQ-39 is a self-administered questionnaire which comprises 39 items addressing 8 domains of health in Parkinson's disease patients. The PDQ-39 Domain: Mobility (e.g., fear of falling when walking) includes 10 questions, each answered on a 5-point scale. The domain scores are calculated by first summing the answers to the questions in the domain. The sum is divided by the highest score possible (i.e., number of answers multiplied by 4) and the quotient is multiplied by 100 to put the score on a scale from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate a better perceived health status. Higher scores are consistently associated with the more severe symptoms of the disease such as tremor and stiffness.</description>

Higher scores are consistently associated with the more severe symptoms of the disease such as tremor and stiffness.</description>

        <description>The PDQ-39 is a self-administered questionnaire which comprises 39 items addressing 8 domains of health in Parkinson's disease patients. The PDQ-39 Domain: Social Support includes 3 questions, each answered on a 5-point scale. The domain scores are calculated by first summing the answers to the questions in the domain. The sum is divided by the highest score possible (i.e., number of answers multiplied by 4) and the quotient is multiplied by 100 to put the score on a scale from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate a better perceived health status. Higher scores are consistently associated with the more severe symptoms of the disease such as tremor and stiffness.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EuroQol Quality of Life Scale (EQ-5D) Summary Index at Endpoint</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D is a participant answered questionnaire scoring 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. EQ-5D health states, defined by the EQ-5D descriptive system, are converted into a single summary index by applying a formula that essentially attaches values (also called QOL weights or QOL utilities) to each of the levels in each dimension. EQ-5D Summary Index values range from -0.11 to 1.00 with positive change indicating improvement.</description>

            <description>All participants were to receive LCIG, via the NJ tube during the NJ Test Period and delivered to the proximal small intestine via PEG-J during the Post-PEG-J Long-Term Treatment Period. The starting dose was individually determined based on the daily dose of oral levodopa prior to study enrollment.
The infusion dose was individually optimized for each participant on the basis of response and potential adverse events. During the Post-PEG-J Long-Term Treatment Period, LCIG was expected to be infused continuously over approximately 16 hours daily with a rate of infusion ranging from 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour), in most instances.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) Total Score at Endpoint</title>
        <description>The ZBI is a 22-item questionnaire regarding the caregiver/subject relationship and evaluates the caregiver's health condition, psychological well-being, finances and social life. Each question is answered on a 5-point scale (0=never, 1=rarely, 2=sometimes, 3=quite frequently, and 4=nearly always). The caregiver burden is evaluated by the total score (Range 0 to 88) obtained from the sum of the answers to the 22 questions. Higher scores are associated with a higher level of burden for the caregiver.</description>
