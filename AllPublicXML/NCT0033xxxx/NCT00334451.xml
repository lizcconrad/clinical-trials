      The RAPID-RF Registry aims to characterize LATITUDE® Patient Management's alert feature:
      LATITUDE Active Monitoring™ by evaluating type and frequency of alert notifications and
      alert-related medical interventions. This registry will also assess clinical outcomes
      including quality of life and New York Heart Association Class changes over time, mortality,
      hospitalizations and heart failure-related event rates.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who meet current indications for a Guidant RF-enabled CRT-D device (e.g.
             CONTAK RENEWAL 3 RF family of CRT-D devices) which is compatible with the LATITUDE
             Communicator. Indications include: NYHA Class III, IV; EF of ≤ 35%; QRS duration of ≥
             120 ms; and optimized pharmacologic therapy

          -  Patients who have an analog telephone line compatible with the LATITUDE Communicator.
             The LATITUDE Communicator must be placed within 8 feet of where they sleep for
             successful remote interrogations to occur.

          -  Patients who receive the study components including the LATITUDE Communicator, weight
             scale, and blood pressure monitor

          -  Patients who are willing and capable of providing informed consent prior to implant
             and willing to participate in the RAPID-RF Registry

          -  Patients who remain in the clinical care of a RAPID-RF investigator at approved
             centers

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are expected to receive a heart transplant during the course of the study

          -  Patients who have received or who will receive a tricuspid valve prosthesis during the
             course of the study

          -  Patients who have previously received an implantable cardiac resynchronization device
             (e.g., biventricular pacemaker or biventricular ICD)

          -  Patients whose life expectancy is less than 12 months

          -  Patients who are currently enrolled in another observational registry or
             investigational study that could directly impact the treatment or outcome of the
             RAPID-RF Registry. Contact Guidant's Clinical Application Research Study (CARS)
             department to determine eligibility.

          -  Patients who are younger than 18 years of age

          -  Patients who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during the study

          -  Patients who are unable or refuse to comply with the protocol requirements
