  <brief_title>Study of HuCNS-SC Cells in Patients With Infantile or Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL)</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with infantile or late infantile NCL have either a reduced amount of, or are
      missing, the palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) enzyme or the tripeptidyl peptidase 1
      (TPP-I) enzyme. Human central nervous system stem cells (HuCNS-SC) are an investigational
      product derived from human brain cells. HuCNS-SC have been shown to survive and migrate
      within the brains of mice. When grown in the laboratory, HuCNS-SC have been shown to produce
      the PPT1 and TPP-I enzymes. In mice missing the PPT1 enzyme, HuCNS-SC have been shown to
      increase the amount of this enzyme in the brain, to reduce the amount of abnormal storage
      material in the brain, and to prevent the death of some neurons (a type of cell) in the
      brain.

      Participation in this study will involve screening assessments, surgery to implant HuCNS-SC,
      medication to suppress the immune system, and a series of follow-up assessments. The length
      of time from the start of screening through to the last follow-up visit will be approximately
      13 months, with frequent visits to the study center during this time. After completion of
      this study, patients will be monitored for an additional 4 years under a separate long term
      follow-up protocol.
