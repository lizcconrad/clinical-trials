  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cyclosporine Ophthalmic Emulsion is currently used in the treatment of dry eye syndrome.
      Contact lens wearers frequently suffer from dry eye syndrome. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion verses re-wetting drops in the relief of dry eye
      symptoms in contact lens wearers
