      This study is designed to assess the effectiveness of the video-based intervention over and
      above current standard practice for pain control in the pediatric emergency department (ED).
      This is a single-center trial based at the IWK Health Centre. The primary outcome will be
      based on the Child-Adult Medical Procedures Interaction Scale (CAMPIS) coding of the
      video-taped pain response of the research participants (3-5 years old).

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the pain and anxiety that children experience
      when they have venipuncture procedures performed can be reduced by a video-based distraction
      and coping strategy intervention. An instructional video has been designed to educate parents
      and children about what is going to happen during the venipuncture procedure, to teach coping
      skills that can be used before and during the painful procedure, and to provide distraction
      during the procedure by using an entertaining video segment.

      Approximately 168 children (3-5 years of age) who are seen in the IWK ED requiring
      venipunctures for blood collection or IV starts will be randomized. Parent and child training
      in distraction and coping strategies will be provided by means of a self-administered
      video-delivery via a portable DVD player. Fifty percent of the eligible participants will
      receive the distraction and coping strategies intervention and 50% will receive the standard
      medical care provided by the IWK ED. Those receiving standard care will be evaluated for
      outcome results and then be compared to the intervention group. It is expected that children
      who receive the intervention will report less pain and anxiety associated with venipunctures
      than those who receive standard care.
