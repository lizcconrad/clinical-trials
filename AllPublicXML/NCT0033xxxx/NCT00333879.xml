      This is a two-year proof-of-concept study to evaluate a new Virtual Reality (VR)
      &quot;holographic&quot; sound system for use as an audiological Orientation and Mobility (O&amp;M) training
      tool. This new system avoids the limitations of other technologies (i.e., binaural recordings
      and existing VR sound systems) that have been employed with limited success for audiological
      training. Four advancements in the state-of-the-art represented by this new holographic
      system provide new promise for audiological O&amp;M training. First, unlike binaural systems, the
      new system allows the person to move their head in a natural fashion to localize sounds.
      Second, a spherical microphone array is used to record sound environments so as to retain the
      direction from which each ambient sound originated. When these recorded sound environments
      are later presented through head-tracking headphones in a VR environment, real-time software
      maintains the directionality of the sound so that it remains true no matter how the person
      moves or turns their head. Third, this new system models the actual physical acoustic
      structure of each person's head and ears to present sounds as they would be heard by that
      particular person in the recorded setting. Fourth, this system uses software algorithms to
      isolate specific sounds (i.e., of a moving vehicle) so that during virtual playback, these
      sounds can be inserted into the virtual sound field at will and in a customizable fashion to
      create truly unique and flexible virtual sound presentations.

      There are two study hypotheses. First, when using sounds to negotiate traffic intersections,
      skills employed by experienced travelers in real environments will readily transfer to the
      proposed VR environment to the extent that audiological tasks performed in real environments
      are just as easily performed in the VR environment. Second, when the VR environment is
      enhanced to emphasize critical sound cues and eliminate distracting or confusing noises and
      sounds, performance by skilled travelers in the VR environment will be significantly better
      than in the actual environment.

      The objectives are to: (1) adapt the existing spherical microphone array and digital
      recording software algorithms to best suit the capture of critical intersection sounds used
      for intersection negotiations; (2) develop software algorithms to deconstruct intersection
      sounds, isolating each sound for the VR construction of specific environments of varying
      complexity; (3) determine the level of sound detail necessary for negotiating intersections
      successfully; (4) expand the existing system to obtain the desired level of detail; (5)
      develop software to provide the ability to control the relative emphasis of a variety of
      sound elements being presented so as to simplify the auditory task; and (6) employ study
      participants to compare performance in the VR environment with outdoor performance.

      Once validated, this system should be able to: (1) leverage instructor time by providing
      students with an effective means of practicing audiological skills on their own, (2) provide
      instructors with a means of introducing concepts in a graduated learning sequence that is not
      dependent on the happenstance availability of specific sounds and conditions found in real
      environments, and (3) provide audiological training for environments not located in the
      vicinity of the training site, but which do represent the veteran's home community.

      Research will be conducted in collaboration with investigators in the Perceptual Interfaces
      and Reality Laboratory (PIRL) at the University of Maryland who initially conceived and
      developed this holographic VR sound system.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Accuracy in Judging Direction of Traffic at Traffic Intersection</measure>
    <time_frame>4 trials over 30 minutes after 30 minutes of training</time_frame>
    <description>Standing at an intersection subject indicates when traffic is moving left to right and right to left in front of him, versus traffic moving to and away on the street parallel to his path. Subject can respond in only two ways: 1) traffic is moving on the street in front of me, or 2) traffic is moving on the street beside me.
Each trial lasts 5 minutes with a 2 minute and 30 second break between trials. Traffic stops and starts 5 times over the 5 minutes, each time moving in one of two randomly selected directions: 1) left and right in front of the subject, or 2) forward and back along the street beside the subject.
The participant must correctly state the direction of traffic at least 4 out of five times for the equipment under test to be counted as efficacious for presenting accurate 3D sound information to the participant.</description>

    <measure>Accuracy in Selecting Appropriate Time to Cross Street</measure>

    <description>Subject is able to state when it is safe to cross the street based on traffic on the street beside him accelerating into motion after traffic on the street in front of him coming to a stop. Subject must state is it safe to cross within 5 seconds of the cars on the street beside him accelerating into motion.
The system under test will be considered efficacious if the subject is correct at least 4 out of 5 times. This counts as being efficacious for that one subject.</description>

The system under test will be considered efficacious if the subject is correct at least 4 out of 5 times. This counts as being efficacious for that one subject.</description>
