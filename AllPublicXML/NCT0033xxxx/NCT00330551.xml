      risperidone in treating people with first-episode schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a severely disabling brain disorder. People with schizophrenia often
      experience hallucinations, delusions, thought disorders, and movement disorders. Proper
      treatment of first-episode schizophrenia may increase the chances of controlling disease
      progression on a long-term basis. People experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia
      are more responsive to treatment than those with chronic schizophrenia, but are also more
      susceptible to adverse treatment side effects. Atypical antipsychotic medications have been
      shown to produce fewer adverse side effects than older &quot;typical&quot; antipsychotics. Risperidone
      is a type of atypical antipsychotic medication that is used to control the symptoms of
      schizophrenia. This study will determine the effectiveness of oral risperidone versus
      long-acting injectable risperidone in treating people with first-episode schizophrenia.

      Participants in this open label study will be randomly assigned to receive either orally
      administered risperidone or long-acting risperidone administered via injection. Participants
      assigned to oral risperidone will receive medication in doses that are determined to be
      optimal by the study psychiatrist. Participants assigned to long-acting risperidone will
      receive an injection of risperidone once every 2 weeks. Dosages will begin at 25 mg and will
      be adjusted as necessary to achieve the optimal dosage. Following 2 to 3 months to achieve
      outpatient risperidone dosage stabilization, the randomized medication conditions will begin
      and participants will be monitored for 1 year. Study visits will occur once weekly throughout
      the study. They will include group therapy meetings focused on everyday living skills; family
      education about schizophrenia; assessments of medication response; and individual meetings
      with a case manager for counseling and evaluations of schizophrenia symptoms.
