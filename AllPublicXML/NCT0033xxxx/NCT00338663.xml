      The purpose of the study is to determine if there is difference in immediate postoperative
      pain levels (48 hours) between patients who wear a knee immobilizer splint compared to
      patients who do not wear a knee immobilizer splint after an anterior cruciate ligament
      reconstruction surgery.

      This study will attempt to evaluate the efficacy of knee immobilization on patient
      postoperative pain levels following an ACL reconstruction. There is a lack of consensus in
      the area of postoperative knee bracing/immobilization. A survey of Canadian surgeons
      indicates that the primary reason for postoperative knee immobilization is to reduce pain. To
      the investigators' knowledge, there are no studies comparing the use of immediate (0-48
      hours) postoperative knee immobilization versus no immobilization and pain control in this
      patient population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Clinical: Patients' aged 18-40, ACL deficiency as determined by MRI or physical exam
        (positive lachmann and pivot shift tests) resulting in giving way episodes (acute or
        chronic) unresponsive to non-operative management and therefore requiring primary ACL
        reconstruction.

        - Arthroscopic: Concomitant meniscal resection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Clinical: Previous surgery on either knee (not including a diagnostic arthroscopy
        arthroscopy or simple partial meniscectomy,) Concomitant lower extremity fracture,
        Ipsilateral collateral ligament injury within past 3 months, Time from ACL injury less than
        6 weeks, Allergy/intolerance to Tylenol 3 with codeine and to Percocet, Third Party or
        Medical Legal.

        - Radiological: Skeletal immaturity (open growth plates).

        - Arthroscopic/surgical: Concomitant posterior cruciate ligament or collateral ligament
        repairs, Osteochondral lesions requiring microfracture, Meniscal repair, Patients not
        having both their semitendinosus and gracilis harvested.
