  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive ventilation has become increasingly important in the management of patients with
      acute respiratory failure. One of its major goals is to prevent the need for invasive
      ventilation, which is associated with numerous complications. This study compares the
      usefulness and safety of two noninvasive techniques which are used in Medical practice:
      Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation using a face mask and extrathoracic biphasic
      ventilation using a cuirass. Each of these techniques has advantages and disadvantages and
      both may not suit all patients. It is therefore important to compare the two in terms of
      effectiveness in preventing invasive ventilation and their side effects profile, so that we
      can improve our understanding and expertise in the treatment of patients in respiratory
      failure.

    <textblock>
      Non-invasive ventilation is becoming a frequent and important treatment option for patients
      with acute respiratory failure, in order to avoid endotracheal intubation and associated
      complications. Non-invasive techniques include positive pressure mask ventilation, negative
      (iron lung) ventilation and extrathoracic biphasic cuirass ventilation. However, large,
      prospective randomized trials comparing these techniques are lacking.

      This prospective, randomized study will compare the effectiveness and side effects of
      non-invasive positive pressure mask ventilation vs extrathoracic biphasic cuirass ventilation
      in patients with acute respiratory failure.

      Methods: Medical patients with acute respiratory failure caused by different etiologies, not
      requiring immediate endotracheal intubation, will be randomized to receive either positive
      pressure via face mask or extrathoracic biphasic ventilation via cuirass. Clinical response
      and/or the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation will be assessed throughout the
      study. Cross-over to the alternative mode will be provided in case of intolerance or lack of
      response.

      Study endpoints: Need for endotracheal intubation, ICU and hospital mortality, length of
      ventilation, length of ICU and hospital stay and complication rates using the two modes.

      Importance &amp; implications: No studies have yet compared these two modes of noninvasive
      ventilation in acute respiratory failure. This study can improve our understanding and
      evidence based knowledge in the treatment of patients with acute respiratory failure.
