      This study is to assess VariZIG™ for the treatment of patients at risk for developing serious
      complications from chicken pox.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In most individuals, chicken pox or varicella zoster (VZV) infections are benign; however, in
      certain at-risk populations such as immunocompromised patients or infants VZV disease can
      produce significant morbidity and mortality. In such patients, varicella zoster immune
      globulin (VZIG) has been used to prevent or reduce the severity of VZV infections in at-risk
      patients exposed to individuals with active infections. Massachusetts Public Health Biologic
      Laboratories (Boston, MA) has discontinued manufacture of the only FDA approved VZIG product.
      Cangene Corporation (Winnipeg, Canada) is conducting this expanded access IND protocol for
      VariZIG™, which is a purified human immune globulin preparation made from plasma of donors
      with high anti-varicella antibody titers.

      This study is an open label, non-randomized, expanded access study that will make VariZIG™
      available to eligible patients for whom there is no alternative licensed treatment while a
      pivotal study is conducted. The study will begin recruiting in February 2006 and will collect
      safety and basic efficacy data over 42 days following VariZIG™ administration. Physicians
      will be required to assess measures of varicella infection as well as provide study specific
      documentation.
