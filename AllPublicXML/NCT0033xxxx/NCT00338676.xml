    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis (AS) is AS is caused by calcium deposits in the aortic valve. Calcification
      is progressive and eventually leads to reduced leaflet motion with obstruction of the left
      ventricular outflow. The only treatment is surgery. There are evidences that AS is a
      regulated process with similarities to atherosclerosis but determinants of AS progression are
      unknown. The study aims at evaluating these determinants and more specifically the role of
      lipids, inflammation and platelet aggregation.

      Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular disease and the second most common
      indication for cardiac surgery in Western countries. AS prevalence increases with age and
      with aging of the population, AS is a major public health problem. AS is due to calcium
      deposits within the aortic valve. Calcium deposit is progressive and eventually leads to
      reduced leaflet motion with obstruction of the left ventricular outflow. There is currently
      no effective medical therapy. Once the stenosis is severe and patients symptomatic, outcome
      is poor unless surgery (aortic valve replacement) is promptly performed. AS has long been
      considered as a passive and degenerative process. Recent data challenged this concept,
      showing that AS is an active and highly regulated process with some similarities to
      atherosclerosis. However, AS progression is highly variable from one individual to another
      and determinants of AS progression are poorly known. Their identification is crucial if we
      want to develop new medical strategies. The aims of the present study are to identify the
      determinants of AS progression and more specifically to evaluate the role of lipids,
      inflammation and platelet aggregation.
