  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of growth hormone treatment on phosphorus
      levels in the body. Phosphorus is an important mineral for bone growth. It is well known that
      growth hormone treatment improves bone density and bone mineral content. The amount of
      phosphorus is maintained by the kidneys. Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 has recently been
      recognized to help kidneys control phosphate levels.

      This study will compare Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 levels in children with and without
      growth hormone deficiency. Children with growth hormone deficiency will have levels taken
      before starting growth hormone replacement and after it has been initiated.
