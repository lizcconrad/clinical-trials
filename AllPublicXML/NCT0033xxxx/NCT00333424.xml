    <textblock>
      The development of a safe and effective vaccine for HIV is the subject of intensive
      world-wide research. Various approaches are being investigated in monkey models and humans.
      This is a randomized, double-blind trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a
      candidate preventative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine strategy in 24 healthy
      adult Thai volunteers with no identifiable risk behaviour for HIV-1 infection. Volunteers
      will receive three &quot;priming&quot; vaccinations at weeks 0, 4 and 8 (pHIS-HIV-AE, a DNA vector
      delivering AE clade HIV-1 genes). This will be followed at week 12 by single &quot;boost&quot;
      vaccination (rFPV-HIV-AE, non-replicating, recombinant fowlpox virus vector delivering the
      same HIV-1 genes). Safety and immunological monitoring will continue to 52 weeks

          -  Laboratory blood values within clinically acceptable range

          -  Women of reproductive potential must have a negative urine beta-human chorionic
             gonadotropin (B-HCG) pregnancy test at both the screening and baseline visits

             whole duration of the study (52 weeks)

          -  Agreement to undertake HIV testing and to receive results

          -  Provision of written informed consent approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee
             (IEC).

        Exclusion Criteria:

                  (&quot;higher risk of HIV infection&quot; is defined as individuals reporting unprotected
                  anal intercourse (UAI), unprotected intercourse with sex workers and/or sharing
