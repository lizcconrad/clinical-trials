    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to evaluate the Smart Wheelchair Component System (SWCS) for
      power wheelchairs and the Smart Power Assistance Module (SPAM) for manual wheelchairs in
      realistic indoor environments with target users performing realistic tasks. We will combine
      group trials involving individuals who have a visual impairment (but do not have a mobility
      impairment) with several single-case studio involving individuals who have a visual and
      mobility impairment. Our long-term objective is to provide independent mobility to veterans
      with mobility and sensory impairments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are currently very few mobility options for veterans who have a mobility impairment and
      visual impairment, and this population will grow as the number of older veteran's increases.
      The goal of this project is to evaluate the Smart Wheelchair Component System (SWCS) for
      power wheelchairs and the Smart Power Assistance Module (SPAM) for manual wheelchairs in
      realistic indoor environments with target users performing realistic tasks. We will combine
      group trials involving individuals who have a visual impairment (and may or may not have a
      mobility impairment) with several single-case studies involving individuals who have a visual
      and mobility impairment.

      The key questions that will be addresses by the proposed research are:

      Can smart wheelchair technology improve performance on realistic navigation tasks for
      individuals with visual and mobility impairments?

      Will smart wheelchair technology increase the amount of independent travel by individuals
      with visual and mobility impairments?

      Will using a smart wheelchair for an extended period of time diminish a person's ability to
      operate a &quot;traditional&quot; wheeled mobility aid?

    <description>Time to complete the course was recorded. The indoor course was set up in the research laboratory to include a straight path and 90 degree turns that included obstacles such as a cardboard box, a large orange cone, and a desk chair. The location of these obstacles were randomly placed in order to test whether or not the SPAM or SWCS was able to detect objects.</description>
