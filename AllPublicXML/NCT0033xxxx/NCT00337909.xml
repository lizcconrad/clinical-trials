      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the design and effectiveness of a
      computer-based training program on the memory and cognitive abilities of mature individuals
      undergoing healthy aging.

      The purpose of this study is to test the new progressions design of a computer-based training
      program and to demonstrate the effectiveness of this refined cognitive training regimen on
      participants' performance on normed neuropsychological measures.

      Subjects meeting eligibility criteria and providing written, informed consent will complete
      40 one hour sessions of a computer based training program.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A)Participants must be at least 60 years old B)Participants must have a Mini-Mental State
        Exam (MMSE) score of 24 or higher to ensure that participants do not meet common criteria
        for dementia C)Participants must be a native English speaker D)Participants must be able to
        see well enough to read the consent form E)Participants must be able to hear well enough to
        understand ordinary spoken conversation when the clinical specialist holds a paper in front
        of his or her face to prevent the participant from lip-reading.

        F)Participants must be willing to commit to the time requirements of the study and not have
        any scheduled trips or absences for more than 1 week during the training.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A)Participants must not be planning to begin cholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) therapy or to
        change their dosing levels. Subjects currently using AChEI will be included if they have an
        established steady dosing history at least one month prior to the study and are expected to
        continue at the same dosage throughout the study.

        B)Participants must not have had a head trauma that caused them to lose consciousness in
        the past five years and have had no subsequent symptoms.

        C)Participants must not have had a stroke within the past year; or have had a stroke that
        has left them with expressive or receptive language problems.

        D)Participants must not have any central nervous system disorder that could contribute to
        cognitive impairment.

        E)Participants must not have a tremor preventing the use of a computer mouse or other
        pointing device.

        F)Participants must not currently be active in another clinical trial.
