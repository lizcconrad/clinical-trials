  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is a continuation of an extensive longitudinal population-based epidemiological
      investigation of the etiology and determinants of type 2 diabetes (and its complications) and
      formerly arthritis. The original baseline observations were made on the residents of the Gila
      Indian Reservation, predominantly Pima Indians, in 1965. We attempt to reexamine the
      population at two-yearly intervals, and have continued to recruit new respondents who,
      because of age and residence or familial relationships, become eligible for entry into the
      project. Eligible persons receive a battery of standardized examinations related to diabetes
      and its complications at two-yearly intervals, including a glucose tolerance test,
      biochemical determinations, such as serum cholesterol and creatinine, insulin, etc., a
      physical examination, and in those aged 15 years and above, retinal photographs, and an
      electrocardiogram. Persons known to have diabetes will be asked to undergo the examination at
      annual intervals to enable more complete and accurate documentation of their health status
      and to identify the development and progression of complications of the disease.

      The data collected have been used to describe the natural history and determinants of
      diabetes and its complications, to investigate factors relating to the etiology of these
      diseases and investigate the genetics of diabetes, its complications and other phenotypes. In
      addition, the project serves to identify subjects with specific characteristics for the
      clinical research projects carried out by the Obesity and Diabetes Clinical Research Section
      and the Diabetes Epidemiology and Clinical Research Section fo the Branch.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The study population is all persons aged 5 years and over residing on the Gila River Indian
        Reservation in Arizona. The vast majority of the eligible subjects are American Indians and
        there are similar numbers of males and females in the population. The study population was
        chosen because our previous work has shown that this population has the highest prevalence
        of Type 2 diabetes in the world. There are small numbers of other racial groups in the
        selected population who are also eligible to participate in the study. They are mainly
        members of the families in the community and therefore by participating they can contribute
        valuable research information to the study. All persons resident in the community aged 5
        years and over are invited to participate in the study at two-yearly intervals. In
        addition, other tribal members and selected family members such as first or second degree
        relatives of the study population who reside, or have moved off the Reservation, are also
        eligible to participate.
