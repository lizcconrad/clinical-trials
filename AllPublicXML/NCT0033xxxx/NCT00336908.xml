  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a blinded, randomized, controlled prospective trial comparing immune response
      (sepsis, inflammatory response, pulmonary vasoconstriction) in 2 groups of infants less than
      3-month old receiving pre and post cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. The infants will receive 1
      out of the 2 following intravenous lipid preparations: Soybean Oil (n-6), or a combination of
      Medium Chain Triglyceride i.e. coconut oil, Long Chain Triglyceride i.e. Soybean Oil, and
      Fish Oil (MCT:LCT:FO). There will be 16 subjects in each group.
