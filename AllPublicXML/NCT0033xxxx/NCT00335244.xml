  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will determine the safety and effectiveness of intravenous L-citrulline
      in children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass during heart surgery. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to either L-citrulline or a placebo (a substance that has no medicine in
      it).

      Citrulline is a protein building block in the body that can convert into another substance,
      nitric oxide (NO), which controls blood pressure in the lungs. Increased blood pressure in
      the lungs can be an important surgical problem; it may also lead to problems following
      surgery, such as severe high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension), increased
      time spent on a breathing machine, and a longer stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). The
      hypothesis of this study is that perioperative supplementation with intravenous citrulline
      will increase plasma citrulline, arginine and NO metabolites and prevent elevations in the
      postoperative PVT leading to a decrease in the duration of postoperative invasive mechanical
      ventilation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increased pulmonary vascular tone (PVT) can complicate the postoperative course of the
      following five surgical procedures for congenital heart defects: 1) unrestrictive ventricular
      septal defect (VSD) repair; 2) atrioventricular septal (AVSD) repair; 3) arterial switch
      procedure for transposition of the great arteries (TGA); 4) bidirectional Glenn shunt
      procedure; and 5) Fontan procedure for single ventricle lesions. PVT is partially controlled
      by NO. Arginine, the precursor to NO, is a product of the urea cycle. Preliminary data have
      been presented regarding 169 infants and children who have undergone one of six previous
      surgical procedures. It was found that urea cycle function and plasma arginine levels were
      significantly decreased in all participants. Furthermore, participants with increased PVT had
      significantly lower arginine levels compared to participants with normal PVT. Finally, a
      genetic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the rate limiting urea cycle enzyme (carbamyl
      phosphate synthetase I [CPSl T1405N]) appeared to affect postoperative plasma arginine levels
      and PVT. The hypothesis is that genetic polymorphisms in the rate limiting urea cycle enzyme
      CPSl, and other important enzymes in the urea cycle, influence the availability of NO
      precursors. It is further hypothesized that perioperative enhancement of urea cycle function
      with the key urea cycle intermediate (citrulline) will increase plasma arginine and NO
      metabolites and prevent elevations in PVT.
