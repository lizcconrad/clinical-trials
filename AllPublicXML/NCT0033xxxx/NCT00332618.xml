  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the trial was to evaluate the efficacy and clinical safety and acceptability
      of Oxygenated Glycerol Triesters in the relief of symptoms of xerostomia versus a reference
      comparator.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Xerostomia is due to inadequate (hyposialia) or inexistent (asialia) saliva secretion.

      There are may causes. Transitory xerostomia may occur in the presence of anxiety (stage
      fright, fear or dehydration). Prolonged xerostomia is most often related to a systemic
      disease, certain medicines or to radiotherapy of the head or neck.

      Salivation depends upon the autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) nervous system for
      its production and on the central nervous system for stimuli-dependant excretion. Substances
      acting on alpha an beta sympathetic receptors, whether agonists or antagonists, may induce
      hyposialia. Atropine, the main antagonist of the parasympathetic system, is present in many
      medicines used for pulmonary, ophthalmic or neurological purposes, potentially causing
      hyposialia. Similarly, imipramine antidepressants, phenothiazine neuroleptics, antihistamines
      and disopyramide predispose to the onset of hyposialia.

      Xerostomia is often accompanied by buccal signs such as impaired sense of taste, halitosis
      and buccal ulcers and interferes with functions such as speech, chewing and swallowing.
      Because of reduced salivary secretion , there is a disturbance of the microbial colonization
      of the buccal cavity. Xerostomia has significant untoward effects on the buccal cavity and
      the quality of life of patients.

      The basis of the treatment of xerostomia involves the use of saliva substitutes and/or saliva
      stimulants. Oxygenated Glycerol Triesters is neither a replacement for nor stimulant of
      saliva. It is a lubricant and protective solution for endobuccal spray.
