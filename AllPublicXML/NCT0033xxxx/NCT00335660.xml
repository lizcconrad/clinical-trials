  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of AV608, a neurokinin 1 (NK-1)
      antagonist, in subjects with Idiopathic Detrusor Overactivity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of AV608 in subjects with idiopathic detrusor overactivity. Female subjects
      between 18 and 65 years of age with a diagnosis of Overactive Bladder Syndrome and urodynamic
      observation of involuntary detrusor contractions during the filling phase will be eligible
      for the trial.

      Eligible subjects will complete a baseline urodynamic assessment. All subjects who
      participate in the study will receive 3 weeks of treatment with AV608 or placebo. At the end
      of the treatment period, subjects will complete a second urodynamic assessment.
