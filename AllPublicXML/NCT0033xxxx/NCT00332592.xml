  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NEC is a serious inflammatory bowel disease, which almost only strikes infants with low birth
      weight and low gestational age. The morbidity and mortality rates are high, and early
      diagnosis and treatment is mandatory. The primary aim of the present study is to investigate
      the clinical use of intragastric microdialysis and whether it is able to select patients, who
      may benefit from either medical or surgical therapy. The aim of intraperitoneal microdialysis
      is to evaluate whether changes in intraperitoneal microdialysis reflect the clinical outcome
      after laparotomy.

      Neonates who are hospitalized because of suspicion of NEC are subjected to intragastric
      microdialysis during the observation period. The catheter is placed in the stomach via the
      naso-oesophageal route. If surgery is necessary a microdialysis catheter is placed in the
      peritoneal cavity prior to wound closure. Samples are collected every 4-hour. Samples will be
      analyzed continuously but the results will not be included in the clinical evaluation of the
      patient.

      A total of 20 patients will be included in this pilot study. The results of the intragastric
      and peritoneal microdialysis will be compared with the clinical course, s-lactate,
      radiological and pathological findings in each patient.
