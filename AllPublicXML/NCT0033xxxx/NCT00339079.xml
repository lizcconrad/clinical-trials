  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypochondriasis is one of the most difficult psychiatric disorders to treat. People with
      hypochondriasis believe that real or imagined physical symptoms are signs of serious
      illnesses, despite medical reassurance and other evidence to the contrary. Symptoms of the
      disorder include a preoccupation with fear of an illness; a persistent fear of having a
      serious illness, despite medical reassurance; and misinterpretation of symptoms. Some
      individuals with hypochondriasis recognize that their fear of having a serious illness may be
      excessive, unreasonable, or unfounded. Episodes of hypochondriasis usually last from months
      to years, with equally long periods of remission. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and the
      antidepressant drug fluoxetine (FLX) have both been shown to be effective treatments for
      hypochondriasis. However, the relative efficacy of a combined approach has yet to be
      determined. This study will compare the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy,
      antidepressant medication, and a combination of the two for treating hypochondriasis.

      Participants in this double-blind study will first report to the study site for two sessions
      to determine eligibility for participation. Eligible individuals will then be randomly
      assigned to receive one of the following four treatments for 12 weeks: CBT only; FLX only;
      CBT plus FLX; or a placebo pill. All participants receiving medication will also receive
      supportive therapy. Treatment response will be assessed at Week 12, and participants who have
      shown improvement will continue in the study for an additional 12 weeks. Participants who
      have not responded to treatment will be removed from the study and will receive open
      treatment. Participants assigned to receive medication or placebo will take medication once
      daily for the full 24 weeks. Participants assigned to CBT only or CBT plus FLX will receive
      CBT weekly for the first 8 weeks, then biweekly until Week 12, and then monthly until week
      24. Outcomes will be assessed at study visits at Weeks 6, 12, 24, and 48, and over the phone
      at Week 36.

The maximum dose for patients who are age 60 or older will be 60 mg/day. The study psychiatrist will have the option of not increasing or lowering the dose if hypochondriacal symptoms have resolved nearly completely for the last two weeks or adverse effects thought to be due to fluoxetine have occurred.</description>

    <description>CBT is based upon the cognitive and perceptual model of hypochondriasis and incorporates established behavioral techniques. There will be six 60-minute individual sessions conducted at weekly intervals. Booster sessions of 20 to 30 minutes will be conducted at Weeks 8 and 12. The introduction of boosters will make the CBT alone and medication alone arms identical in length.</description>

             for fluoxetine).

          -  Approval from treating physician if concomitant psychoactive medications need to be
             withdrawn prior to study participation.

          -  English fluency and literacy.

          -  Any of the following Axis I mental disorders: chronic pain syndrome, schizophrenia,
             schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, bipolar disorder, alcohol abuse or
             dependence disorder (current or within the last six months), or substance abuse or
             dependence disorder (current or within the last twelve months). Patients with other
             comorbid psychiatric disorders are eligible based on the following three criteria:
             hypochondriasis must be the predominant presenting disorder; patient can not have a
             major co-morbid psychiatric disorder rated as &quot;severe&quot; on the Clinical Global
             Impressions Scale (CGI Scale); and patients can not have a co-morbid psychiatric
             disorder that causes significant functional impairment (significant functional
             impairment will be defined as an impairment that interferes in a marked way with
             expected role functioning, vocational and/or interpersonal).

          -  Suicidality within the last 6 months as established by a score of 9 or more on the
             suicidality module of the MINI Plus.

          -  Clinically important abnormalities in ECG, laboratory tests (including thyroid
             function) or physical examination. &quot;Clinically important&quot; abnormalities are those that
             signify a treatment intervention is needed or a medical abnormality has not been
             sufficiently addressed. Patients with medical problems that are stable and chronic are
             eligible, but patients with medical problems that are unstable, acute, or inadequately
             evaluated will be excluded. A current electrocardiogram is required for all patients
             with symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease, including chest pain, dyspnea,
             palpitations, or lightheadedness; if no current electrocardiogram exists, the study
             will obtain one.

          -  History of severe side effects associated with fluoxetine or noncompliance with prior
             CBT for hypochondriasis

          -  Previous adequate trial of either fluoxetine (eight weeks of which two weeks were at a
             minimum dose of 60 mg/day) or CBT for hypochondriasis (at least four sessions

             response. Inability to ambulate or mobility restrictions that prohibit frequent travel

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): CBT is based upon the cognitive and perceptual model of hypochondriasis and incorporates established behavioral techniques.

Placebo: Each patient will receive placebo in 10 or 20 mg pills given according to the following schedule: 10 mg/day for two weeks, 20 mg/day for two weeks, 40 mg/day for two weeks, 60 mg/day for two weeks, and 80 mg/day thereafter.</description>

The maximum dose for patients who are age 60 or older will be 60 mg/day.
