  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the number of women infected with HIV has
      rapidly increased and is continuing to climb. The Women's Interagency HIV Study is being
      conducted in several cities in the United States to learn more about how HIV affects women's
      lives and bodies. It will examine the role of HLA and killer immunoglobulin-like receptors
      (KIR) in HIV and related infections in HIV-positive and HIV-negative women. The study will
      determine the relationship between KIR and HLA genes and the following: the risk of HIV
      infection; HIV levels in the blood; incidence of AIDS; response to highly active
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART); and response to immunotherapy.

      Approximately 3,700 women will participate. Participants will visit the clinic every 6 months
      for 4 years. An HIV test will be given each time to HIV-negative women. A questionnaire will
      also be administered. A physical examination and gynecological examination will be given.
      Blood, vaginal swabs, and urine will be collected for testing. A biological impedance test
      will determine any changes in weight, waist-to-hip ratios, and breast and total body fat. Low
      CD4 counts and hospitalizations for HIV are to be self-reported to study staff.

      The aim of the study is to examine the role of HLA and killer immunolobulin-like receptors
      (KIR) in the natural history of HPV, HCV, and HBV in HIV-positive and HIV-negative women. The
      immune response to viral infection mediated by T lymphocytes is HLA restricted, suggesting
      that HLA class I, and class II might be associated with risk of viral infection, persistence
      and disease progression. Natural killer (NK) cells are a unique group of lymphocytes involved
      in surveillance and killing of foreign or infected cells through a mechanism involving
      recognition of HLA molecules by an extremely diverse set of receptors on the NK cell surface.
      A major group of these receptors are the KIRs. Thus, a relationship between KIR genotype and
      HIV infection is biologically plausible, and requires further investigation in observational
      studies.

      The WIHS study is a prospective study, which may allow us to answer questions relating to the
      role of host HLA and KIR genotype on duration of infection, and the development of
      virus-associated diseases such as cervical cancer (related to HPV infection), and liver
      cancer (HBV and HCV). WIHS is a large, racially and geographically diverse cohort of HIV
      positive (n = 2761), and risk-matched HIV-negative women (n = 942). The large size of the
      cohort will provide substantial statistical power, which is of major importance in any HLA
      association study.
