  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have a poor long-term prognosis.
      Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in patients with CLL has only rarely been
      performed in the past because the clinical outcome after myeloablative conditioning was poor,
      mainly due to the high treatment-related mortality. However long-term disease-free survival
      after allogeneic SCT has been reported. Recently it has been demonstrated by our group and
      others that non-relapse mortality can be reduced significantly with the use of
      reduced-intensity conditioning regimens. Yet, graft versus host disease (GVHD) remains an
      important problem in this setting.

      Alemtuzumab is an effective drug for the treatment of patients with advanced CLL and has been
      successfully applied for GVHD-prophylaxis in the setting of myeloablative and
      reduced-intensity conditioning regimens. The goal of the present study is to evaluate the
      role of alemtuzumab as part of a fludarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning regimen for
      allogeneic SCT in patients with advanced CLL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed or refractory CLL who are eligible for the study receive a
      cytoreductive therapy until SCT. Irrespective to the formal response, patients proceed to
      allogeneic SCT after fludarabine-based reduced-intensity conditioning. The use of granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells &gt; 3 x 10E6 CD34
      cells/kg is recommended, but bone marrow &gt; 1 x 10E8 MNC/kg is accepted. GVHD-prophylaxis is
      based on cyclosporine A adapted to blood levels (150 to 200 ng/mL) over a period of three
      months. In Phase I of the study, alemtuzumab has been applied as part of the conditioning
      regimen until day 5. In Phase II, alemtuzumab is given as cytoreductive pre-treatment with
      the last application of alemtuzumab scheduled for day 14 and after Amendment II in September
      2006 scheduled for day 28. Furthermore methotrexate is given on days 1, 3, 6. and 11 at a
      projected cumulative dose of 45 mg/m2. Subsequent immunosuppressive therapy depends on the
      occurrence of GvHD, the development of chimerism, and residual disease. Patients with
      relapsing or residual disease (minimal residual disease excluded) who do not suffer from GvHD
      should receive donor lymphocytes in increasing dosages. The initial dose is 1 x 105/kg
      T-cells in unrelated donors and 1 x 106/kg in matched related donors. If no GvHD develops
      within 6-8 weeks, the next higher dosage is applied.
