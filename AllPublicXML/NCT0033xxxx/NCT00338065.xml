    <textblock>
      Our experiments are designed to test the overall hypothesis that position-dependent or
      water-dependent intra-ocular pressure (IOP) spikes occur in humans, and that these challenge
      ocular homeostasis.

    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the United States, yet its pathogenesis
      is poorly understood. This is an insidious disorder since the loss of peripheral vision which
      occurs first usually is not noticed by the victim. Approximately 1 million people in the
      United States have glaucoma, but are not aware of it. Glaucoma is not always associated with
      elevated intraocular pressures so that vision screenings which measure just intraocular
      pressure without assessing the optic nerve will also miss these patients with glaucomatous
      damage. Therefore, patients are often diagnosed only when they have severe irreversible
      vision loss. Vascular insufficiency or abnormal autoregulation versus mechanical pressure
      damage has been proposed as a major factor in the development of glaucoma. Presently, therapy
      is based upon lowering intraocular pressure. If a contributing intermittent pressure
      elevation factor can be elucidated and characterized, specific treatment modalities may then
      be developed and their effectiveness can be monitored.
