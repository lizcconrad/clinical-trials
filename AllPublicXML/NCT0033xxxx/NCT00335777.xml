  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study looking at Migranal (study drug) in the treatment of two migraine
      attacks in patients who have a history of cutaneous allodynia (pronounced q-tay-nee-us
      al-o-din-ee-a). Cutaneous allodynia is an increased skin sensitivity experienced during a
      headache. It has been noted in several studies that in patients with migraine, seventy nine
      percent of the patients experienced allodynia on the facial skin on the same side as the
      headache. Understanding more about allodynia may help us understand how the pain system works
      in migraine.

      This study will compare the differences, if any, in attacks treated early with study drug (at
      1-hour from onset) and attacks treated later (at 4-hours). You will be asked to treat one
      attack early and one attack late for this study. If the first attack you treat is early (at 1
      hour following onset of throbbing pain) then the second attack you treat should be late (at 4
      hours following onset of throbbing pain).

      It is hoped that this study will provide information on the use of Migranal in subjects who
      have cutaneous allodynia. The results from this study may be used in the development of
      larger clinical trials. The study drug is a medication that is taken in the form of nasal
      spray.
