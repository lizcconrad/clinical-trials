    <textblock>
      This Phase 2(a) clinical trial is designed as a dose-blinded, block-randomized, multi-center
      study to select a dosage and schedule of rF1V vaccine for further studies based on the immune
      response up to Day 210. Additional immunogenicity and safety/reactogenicity data will be
      collected through Day 540. Selection of dosage and schedule will be based on GMCs and
      seroconversion rates for anti-F1, anti-V and anti-rF1V antibody titers. Approximately 400
      healthy adult volunteers will be enrolled (100 per group) in this study.

      Primary Objective: To select a dosage and schedule of rF1V vaccine for further study based on
      the immune response to F1 and V antigens up to Day 210.

      Secondary Objectives: 1) To assess the safety of three injections of rF1V vaccine
      administered IM at two dosage levels.

      2) To assess the onset and duration of the humoral immune response to F1 and V antigens.

      3) To assess the humoral immune response to rF1V antigen. 4) To collect and store blood
      samples for future plague related research.

      Exploratory Objectives:

      To assess additional humoral immune responses to rF1V vaccine antigens.

          4. Positive prescreening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); hepatitis C virus (HCV)
             or hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg).

          5. A history of immunodeficiency or chronic illness requiring continuous or frequent
             medical intervention, acute/chronic untreated conditions, autoimmune disease or use of
             immunosuppressive medications.

          6. Chronic, severe or recurrent joint pain (4 or more occurrences per year) or arthritis
             of any type.

             such as amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, opiates and
             cannabinoids.

          8. A previous diagnosis of any serious psychiatric disorder. For this purpose, serious
             psychiatric disorder is defined as illness requiring hospitalization within the
             previous 12 months; routine administration of more than one medication to control
             anxiety, mood or sleep disorder; or history of suicide attempt.

          9. Receipt of any blood product or immune globulin in the previous 6 months.

         10. Receipt of any investigational vaccine in the previous 6 months

         11. Donation of blood within 56 days prior to first vaccination or at any time prior to
             Day 210 visit.

         12. Receipt of any investigational drug therapy within 30 days before the first dose of
             rF1V or intent to receive any other investigational drug therapy before the
             post-vaccination Day 540 visit.

         13. A clinically significant abnormality on the ECG.

             unacceptable risk for injury.

         16. Personal history of multiple sclerosis, since immune system stimulation may exacerbate
             this disorder.

         17. Occupational or other responsibilities that would prevent completion of participation
             in the study.

         18. Licensed vaccines are not exclusionary but should be given at least 2 weeks before or
             after immunization (if live vaccine, 60 days before or after immunization) to avoid
             potential confusion of adverse reactions.

         19. Screening laboratory values not within acceptable ranges.

         20. A history of anaphylaxis or other serious adverse reactions to vaccines.

         21. The female volunteer is pregnant

         22. Receipt of therapy with immunosuppressive agents, including high-dose systemic
             corticosteroids (i.e., prednisone-equivalent dose of &gt; or equal to 20 mg/day), within
             3 months prior to or during the study.
