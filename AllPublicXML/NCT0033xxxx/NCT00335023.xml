  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is one of the top five causes of maternal mortality in developed
      and developing countries. The most important treatment of PPH is red blood cell (RBC)
      transfusion. The decision whether to prescribe RBC transfusion is mostly based on postpartum
      haemoglobin (Hb) values. RBC transfusion should be aimed to reduce morbidity and especially
      to improve Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). The goal of the WOMB study is to assess
      the effect of RBC transfusion on HRQoL and to confirm the role of HRQoL in deciding whether
      RBC transfusion is necessary.

      The WOMB study is a multicenter trial in patients with PPH, where a restrictive RBC
      transfusion policy will be compared with a more liberal RBC transfusion policy. Primary
      outcome in this study is fatigue measured with the MFI questionnaire. Inclusion criteria are:
      1) 12-24 h after VD or CS; 2) 4.8 ≤Hb≤ 7.9 g/dL; 3) blood loss ≥ 1000mL or Hb decrease ≥ 1,9
      g/dL; 4) age≥ 18 years; 5) no anaemic symptoms. Patients will be randomised for a RBC
      transfusion or not. The total follow-up period is 6 weeks. HRQoL will be measured at T=0
      (12-24 hours postpartum) 3 days, 1, 3 and 6 weeks postpartum. At T=0 and 6 weeks postpartum
      Hb value will be measured. For the patients who receive a RBC transfusion, the effect of the
      RBC transfusion will be measured with the Hb value, Hct, platelet and leukocyte count, and
      the temperature of the patient before and after the RBC transfusion. The sample size is 500
      patients: 250 allocated to a RBC transfusion and 250 patients allocated to a restrictive
      policy.
