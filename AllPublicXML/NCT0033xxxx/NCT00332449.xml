  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early breast feeding has shown to be important to mother-infant bonding and is associated
      with longer duration of breast feeding. However, little data is available regarding its
      contribution to glucose levels in the newborn infants. Newborns that are at risk to develop
      hypoglycemia may benefit from early breast feeding if this appears to prevent post-partum
      hypoglycemia.

      Mothers will be encouraged to breast feed early after delivery (at the delivery room). Data
      of high risk babies for developing post partum hypoglycemia (Infants of diabetic mothers,
      infants of hypertensive mothers, infants with birth weight more than 4 Kg or less than 2.5 Kg
      and infants with meconium stained amniotic fluid)will be recorded including maternal breast
      feeding times and quality of feeding. Glucose levels shall be routinely monitored and
      recorded at the neonatal department. A comparison of all data will be made between those
      newborns that breast feed after labor and those who were not.
