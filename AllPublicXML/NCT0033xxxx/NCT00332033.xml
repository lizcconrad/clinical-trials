  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) represent a major public health problem with few effective
      therapies. Currently, the only definitive treatment is hysterectomy and women are demanding
      alternative therapies to surgery. We have developed a new approach to the treatment of
      uterine fibroids based on collaborative laboratory research into the molecular,
      ultra-structural, and histopathologic changes that occur with the transformation of normal
      uterine myocytes into abnormal myocytes comprising uterine fibroids. We have confirmed that
      excessive, dysregulated collagen production (fibrosis) and abnormal collagen deposition is an
      underlying etiology in the pathogenesis of leiomyoma. We will test the hypothesis that an
      anti-tumor drug (Pirfenidone) will decrease the size of clinically relevant leiomyomas by
      30%. The specific aim is to compare the effects of pirfenidone with placebo on uterine
      leiomyoma volume. Thirty-two (32) women will be randomized in a double-blinded treatment
      design. Inclusion criteria include women that have completed child-bearing, who are
      candidates for hysterectomy, are using effective contraceptive, and have at least one uterine
      leiomyoma greater than 4 cm diameter confirmed by ultrasound. Women will be excluded if they
      have a body mass index greater than 33 kg/m(2), other gynecological diseases, and history of
      cardiovascular disease or smoking. Response in each treatment group will be assessed by T-2
      weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 3-D ultrasound imaging studies during the
      enrollment period. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to document the response of
      large fibroids to a short-term trial of an anti-tumor drug. The data will be used to further
      define the role of fibrosis in leiomyoma and establish other clinical trials to thoroughly
      evaluate such therapeutic approaches for uterine leiomyomas.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Parous and non-parous women who have completed child-bearing (age criteria of greater
             than 35 years-old, and less than 50 years-old).

          -  Currently practicing or willing to practice contraception throughout the duration of
             the study.

          -  Women with at least one fibroid greater than 4 cm diameter on ultrasound examination.

          -  Women who were planning to undergo hysterectomy for treatment of symptomatic fibroids
             may also participate if they are willing to defer the operation until the study is
             completed. The patients will understand that they may choose to have surgery or any
             other non-study treatment at any time after enrollment and end study participation.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Inability to comply with study visits and requirements.

          -  BMI greater than 33kg/m(2)

          -  History of a serious adverse reaction to study medication.

          -  Inability to tolerate MRI and 3D ultrasound procedures (i.e. presence of an
             intra-uterine device (IUD), pacemakers, aneurismal clips or other metallic devices
             that are not compatible with magnetic resonance imaging).

          -  Medical problems including: genetic diseases that cause fibroids, history of
             thromboembolic (blood clot) events or need for anticoagulation (Coumadin, Heparin,
             etc.).

          -  A history of cancer within the past 5 years.

          -  Abnormal liver function tests (typically, will be greater than 20% elevation). Mild
             elevations will be at the discretion of the investigators, but undiagnosed liver
             conditions will represent an exclusion criterion.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation. Pregnancy will be evaluated by (Beta)hCG test every 30 days.
             Patients will be asked to use non-hormonal contraception methods while on study drug.

          -  Severe anemia (hct. Less than 30). Mild anemia is common in women with fibroids.

          -  Recent rapid growth of fibroids (i.e. doubling in size within one-six months).

          -  Use any of the following medications:

               1. Oral, injectable, or inhaled steroids or megesterol within the past year

               2. Estrogen or progesterone-containing compounds (including oral contraceptives,
                  hormone replacement therapy, transdermal/injectable/vaginal/oral preparations,
                  herbal medications with estrogenic or anti-estrogenic effects) within the past
                  8-12 weeks; or GnRH analogs (Danazol) or other compounds that affect menstrual
                  cyclicity

               3. Agents like Imidazoles, due to possible interference with metabolism.

          -  Unevaluated gynecologic abnormalities (unexplained vaginal bleeding, cervical
             dysplasia, or abnormal adnexal/ovarian mass).
