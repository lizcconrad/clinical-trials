      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide,
      ifosfamide, etoposide, and topotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one
      drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy before surgery
      may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.
      Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is
      not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating Ewing's
      sarcoma.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying combination chemotherapy and topotecan
      to see how well they work compared with combination chemotherapy alone in treating patients
      with newly diagnosed localized Ewing's sarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the event-free and overall survival of patients with newly diagnosed localized
           Ewing's sarcoma treated with doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, vincristine,
           etoposide, and ifosfamide with vs without topotecan hydrochloride.

        -  Compare the side effects of these regimens in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate initial tumor size as a prognostic factor for event-free survival of these
           patients.

        -  Evaluate histological response as a prognostic factor for event-free survival of these
           patients.

        -  Continue evaluation of biologic markers both as related to prognosis and as eventual
           therapeutic targets via encouraging concurrent enrollment on COG-AEWS02B1.

        -  Evaluate radiologic response by positron emission tomography as a prognostic factor for
           event-free survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (≤
      17 vs ≥ 18 years of age) and primary tumor site (pelvic vs nonpelvic [including extra-osseous
      Ewing's sarcoma]). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive vincristine IV over 1 minute once a week on day 1 in weeks 1-3,
           7-9, and 13-15; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on days 1 and 2 in weeks 1,
           7, and 13; cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1 in weeks 1, 7, and 13; and
           ifosfamide IV over 1 hour and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 in weeks 4, 10, and
           16. Patients undergo local therapy comprising surgical resection in approximately week
           18 and/or radiotherapy beginning in approximately week 19. Patients then receive
           vincristine as above in weeks 19-21, 28-30, 34-36, 40-42, and 46-51; dexrazoxane
           hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on days 1 and 2 and doxorubicin hydrochloride as above
           in weeks 19 and 28; cyclophosphamide as above in weeks 19, 28, 34, 40, 46, and 49; and
           ifosfamide and etoposide as above in weeks 22, 25, 31, 37, and 43.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive vincristine IV over 1 minute once a week on day 1 in weeks 1-3,
           7-9, and 13-16; topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 in weeks 1 and
           13; cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 in weeks 1 and 13 and IV over 1 hour
           on day 1 in weeks 7 and 16; ifosfamide IV over 1 hour and etoposide IV over 1 hour on
           days 1-5 in weeks 4 and 10; and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on days 1
           and 2 in weeks 7 and 16. Patients undergo local therapy comprising surgical resection in
           approximately week 18 and/or radiotherapy beginning in approximately week 19. Patients
           then receive vincristine as above in weeks 19-21, 28-33, 37-42, and 46-48; topotecan
           hydrochloride as above in weeks 19, 31, and 40; cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes in
           weeks 19, 31, and 40 and IV over 1 hour in weeks 28, 37, and 46; ifosfamide and
           etoposide as above in weeks 22, 25, 34, 43, and 49; dexrazoxane hydrochloride IV over 15
           minutes on days 1 and 2 in weeks 37 and 46; and doxorubicin hydrochloride as above in
           weeks 28, 37, and 46.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 528 patients will be accrued for this study.
