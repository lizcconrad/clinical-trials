      To evaluate short-term and long-term effects by MR imaging on the technical and functional

      The presence of a cardiac pacemaker (PM) is currently considered an absolute contraindication
      to MR imaging, and most patients with PM are excluded from having MRI. In 2002 there were
      approximately 2.4 million patients in the US with cardiac PM, and this number is growing by
      80,000 annually. A previous study has shown that MRI is indicated in 17% of all patients with
      pacemakers within 12 months of device placement 1, demonstrating the need for a practical and
      safe approach for performing MRI on PM patients.

      The aim of this study is to develop a strategy for safe performance of MR imaging at 1.5T,
      which included exclusion of pacemaker dependent patients and those requiring imaging of the
      thorax, restriction of specific absorption rate (SAR) values to minimize the risk of lead
      heating, and PM reprogramming to avoid interference from time varying gradient fields. The
      safety of this approach is then evaluated in a large group of PM patients including
      assessment of potential myocardial thermal injury by measuring serum troponin I and pacing
      capture thresholds, and performing a 3-month follow-up to evaluate long-term effects.
