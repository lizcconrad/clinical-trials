  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disorder. People with schizophrenia
      sometimes hear voices others don't hear, believe that others are broadcasting their thoughts
      to the world, or become convinced that others are plotting to harm them. These symptoms make
      it difficult for people with schizophrenia to interact normally and establish healthy social
      relationships with others. Cognitive Behavioral Social Skills Training (CBSST) is a group
      behavioral therapy intervention that focuses on improving cognitive and metacognitive
      impairments and social skills deficits that interfere with normal functioning in people with
      schizophrenia. Goal-focused supportive contact (GFSC) is a group therapy intervention that
      focuses on helping people with schizophrenia to verbalize their problems or worries and to
      seek advice from fellow group members. This study evaluated the effectiveness of CBSST versus
      GFSC in improving social functioning in people with schizophrenia. The study will assessed
      changes in cognition, psychotic symptoms, and use of psychiatric healthcare services.

      Participants in this open label study were randomly assigned to one of the following
      treatment groups: treatment as usual (TAU) plus CBSST or TAU plus GFSC. Both interventions
      consist of 2-hour therapy sessions weekly for 36 weeks. Groups receiving each intervention do
      not exceed ten people. CBSST integrates cognitive therapy, social skills training, and
      neurocognitive compensatory aids. Cognitive therapy helps participants challenge unhelpful
      thoughts and build communication and problem-solving skills. Participants receive workbooks
      that describe the skills and contain homework assignments. GFSC focuses on empowering
      participants to share problems, worries, or concerns with others who face similar issues.
      Participants share advice with each other, but therapists do not teach skills. Outcomes were
      be assessed at Months 4.5, 9, 15, and 21 for all participants.

    <description>There are 36 weekly group sessions, each session is 2 hours in length, with a half-hour break after the first hour. The intervention integrates CBT and SST techniques and neurocognitive compensatory aids. All participants are asked to identify a goal. The SST components are based, in part, on a pre-packaged SST intervention available from Psychiatric Rehabilitation Consultants. The CBT components are based on techniques developed for CBT in general and techniques developed specifically for patients with schizophrenia. Cognitive therapy is combined with role-play practice of communication skills and problem-solving training.</description>

    <description>There are 36 weekly group sessions, each 2 hours in length, with a half-hour break after the first hour. GFSC has a number of specific goals and interventions, including providing a safe environment where the patient can discuss her/his feelings and concerns; to validate these feelings and concerns; and to provide support and guidance to the client so that she/he can make progress to solving problems or alleviating concerns and worries. Psychotic symptoms and cognition are not directly targeted. Therapists utilize &quot;non-specific&quot; therapeutic techniques, including providing unconditional positive regard, reflective listening, encouraging, paraphrasing, and summarizing. Therapists do not develop a formulation or teach skills.</description>
