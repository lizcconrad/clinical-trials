      RATIONALE: Celecoxib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor
      and by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to
      kill tumor cells. Celecoxib may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving
      celecoxib together with fluorouracil and radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor
      smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving celecoxib together with fluorouracil
      and radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage II or stage III rectal cancer
      that can be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) overexpression in patients with resectable stage II
           or III rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant celecoxib, fluorouracil, and radiotherapy.

        -  Determine whether administration of celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, results in changes in
           tumor (COX-2 overexpressing) levels of eicosanoids but not in the surrounding normal
           tissue.

        -  Determine if there is a greater change in protein and gene expression in post-treatment
           biopsies when compared to pretreatment biopsies that are greater for tumor (COX-2
           overexpression) than in surrounding normal tissue.

        -  Determine whether patients who express the greatest degree of change in gene and protein
           expression are those most likely to respond to therapy.

        -  Assess the toxicities of concurrent treatment with celecoxib, fluorouracil, and
           radiotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily beginning 5 days prior to radiotherapy and
      continuing until completion of radiotherapy. Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for
      5 weeks. Patients also receive concurrent fluorouracil IV continuously for 5 weeks. Patients
      undergo radical resection 4-10 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy.

      Patients undergo tumor biopsy at baseline and then at the time of surgical resection.
      Patients also undergo blood and urine collection at baseline, 5 days after initiation of
      celecoxib, 7 days after initiation of celecoxib in combination with fluorouracil and
      radiotherapy, and at the time of surgical resection. The specimens are evaluated for COX-2
      expression, eicosanoid production, and gene and protein expression using
      immunohistochemistry, microarray, and mass spectrometry.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 28 patients will be accrued for this study.
