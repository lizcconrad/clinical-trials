      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells mixed with tumor proteins may help
      the body build an effective immune response to kill melanoma cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients
      with metastatic melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine clinical response in HLA-A *0201-positive patients with metastatic melanoma
           treated with an intradermally administered vaccine comprising autologous dendritic cells
           pulsed with MART-1, gp100, and tyrosinase peptides and matured with a cytokine cocktail.

      Secondary

        -  Determine immunologic response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo apheresis to collect dendritic cells (DC). Autologous DC are pulsed ex vivo
      with tumor antigen peptides derived from MART-1: 26-35 (27L), gp100: 209-217 (210M), and
      tyrosinase: 368-376 (370D) and matured with a cytokine cocktail comprising interleukin
      (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-1β, sargramostim (GM-CSF), tumor necrosis factor-α, and prostaglandin E2.

      Patients receive 12 intradermal injections of DC vaccine over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 22,
      and 36. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically until disease
      progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 41 patients will be accrued for this study.
