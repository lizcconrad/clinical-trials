  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The theme of this Morehouse-Emory Partnership Program focuses on elucidating the etiologic
      basis of ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD and discovering new intervention
      strategies to ameliorate CV health in all communities. The proposed Program uses a
      multi-disciplinary strategy to systematically characterize ethnic differences in
      obesity-related CVD by drawing upon the fields of physiology, psychology, biochemistry,
      vascular biology, public health, nursing and clinical medicine.

      Emerging evidence indicates that there are ethnicity-specific differences in the profile of
      biochemical, metabolic and physiological perturbations associated with obesity. The
      implications of these ethnic differences remain to be further defined. Several epidemiologic
      studies have shown that vascular disease and its cardiovascular complications, carry
      significantly higher morbidity and mortality in African Americans compared with
      Caucasians.1-3 These observations may be partly explained by a higher prevalence of
      cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as essential hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and
      tobacco use among African Americans.4-6 However, the pathophysiological processes underlying
      this racial predisposition have not been fully elucidated.7 It is likely that the etiologic
      basis of ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease is multi-factorial and involves dynamic
      gene-environment interactions in which variances in behavior and the social context are
      critical determinants.

      The proposed Program recognizes the importance of incorporating both biological factors and
      social determinants in the analysis of cardiovascular disparities

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Our methodological approach will involve a random digit-dialing cross-sectional survey of
        4000 Metro Atlanta area AA and white residents (ages 30-65 years). This aim will focus on
        using well-validated survey instruments to examine self-reported perceptions of
        psychosocial stress, neighborhood segregation factors and health beliefs related to
        weight/weight control. These parameters will be assessed in relation to the differential
        prevalence of three major outcomes: (1) self-reported maladaptive cardiovascular behaviors
        that predispose to obesity-related CVD (ie high fat/sodium and low fruit/vegetables dietary
        intake and physical inactivity); (2) obesity; and (3) hypertension.

        This study will address the following research questions: Are the observed racial
        differences in maladaptive health behaviors (diet/inactivity) and MetS components (obesity,
        hypertension) associated with: a) perceived psychosocial stress, and if so, does
        depression, neighborhood factors or health beliefs around weight and weight control modify
        this relationship?
