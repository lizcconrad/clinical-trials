      Objectives: to study the impact of Individual Placement and Support (IPS) supported
      employment (SE) compared to treatment-as-usual vocational rehabilitation program (VRP) for
      veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

      Research Design: This prospective randomized study evaluates the impact of IPS-SE compared to
      VRP on occupational, sobriety, psychiatric, and quality of life outcomes and health care
      costs for veterans with chronic PTSD who enter the Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center's (TVAMC)
      vocational rehabilitation program.

      Methodology: Occupational functioning is determined primarily by whether the veteran can
      obtain and maintain competitive employment, and, secondarily, by time worked and wages earned
      for those employed. Veterans who meet inclusion criteria will be randomized to either IPS-SE
      or VRP. Outcomes will be assessed over a fixed 12-month observation period (beginning at
      randomization and computed for the entire 12-month observation period) as percent subjects
      employed at least one week (employed rate), and monthly employment rates (maintained employed
      rate). In addition, PTSD symptoms and other health-related quality of life measures will be
      evaluated. This strategy uses all available data during the 1-year period.

    <description>The primary outcome: competitive employment (Yes or No). Competitive employment was defined as a job for regular wages in a setting that was not set aside, or sheltered, that is, the job could be held by people without a mental illness or disability and was not a set-aside job in the VRP. Day labor (babysitting, manual labor by the day, drill, temporary work for family or friends) was not considered competitive employment.</description>

      <recruitment_details>From 2006 to 2010 Veterans with PTSD at the Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center were enrolled in a 12-month, prospective randomized comparison of IPS Supported Employment and treatment-as-usual Vocational Rehabilitation Program (VRP).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>100 Veterans were enrolled; 85 were randomized to IPS-SE (n=42) or VRP (n=43) and followed 12-months. 15 participants were excluded: 2 did not have PTSD, 2 lived &gt;100 miles away, 3 withdrew consent, 4 had exclusionary diagnosis, and 4 were not eligible to be enrolled in the VRP. Participants were allowed to continue all other treatments for PTSD.</pre_assignment_details>
