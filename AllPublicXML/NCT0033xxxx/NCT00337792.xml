      The main objective of this study is to determine the equivalency of oral conscious sedation
      and intravenous conscious sedation for first trimester surgical abortion. We hypothesize that
      oral conscious sedation will be equivalent to intravenous conscious sedation for pain
      control. Additional objectives include describing subject satisfaction with each method of
      pain control and characteristics of each method such as side effect profile, recovery room
      time, and postoperative pain.

      The main objective of this study is to determine the equivalency of oral conscious sedation
      (oxycodone 10mg PO plus lorazepam 1mg SL) and intravenous conscious sedation (fentanyl 100 µg
      plus midazolam 2mg) for first trimester surgical abortion. We hypothesize that oral conscious
      sedation will be equivalent to intravenous conscious sedation as defined by ± 1 point on a
      21-point pain scale. Subsidiary objectives include describing subject satisfaction with each
      method of pain control and characteristics of each method such as side effect profile,
      recovery room time, and postoperative pain.
