  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether IPL512,602 is safe and effective for the
      treatment of asthma symptoms in patients who remain symptomatic on a background therapy of
      inhaled corticosteroids.

      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study will
      include subjects with persistent moderate to severe asthma who require inhaled
      corticosteroids and inhaled short-acting β2-agonists (SABAs). Subjects who pass screening at
      Visit 1 will enter a 2-3 week baseline period to confirm stable asthma symptoms and collect
      baseline data. Subjects will continue with ongoing prescribed treatment during this period,
      or as modified by the investigator based on clinical judgment. Subjects will use the SABA
      prescribed for them to alleviate asthma symptoms on an as needed basis throughout the study.
      If eligible, at Visit 2 subjects will be randomized to treatment with either IPL512,602 (20
      mg) daily or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization in each treatment group will be stratified
      into two subgroups: those receiving low to medium doses of inhaled corticosteroids (≤500 µg
      per day fluticasone or equivalent) and those receiving high doses of inhaled corticosteroids
      (&gt;500 µg per day fluticasone or equivalent). During the 8-week treatment period, subjects
      will return to the clinic after 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of treatment (Visits 3-7). Adverse
      event data will be collected for 14 days following the last dose administration (Visit 8).

          -  a history of persistent asthma for at least the 4 months prior to entry

          -  require daily inhaled corticosteroids (220-1000 µg fluticasone equivalent per day) for
             at least 4 weeks prior to randomization and short-acting beta-2-agonist (SABA)

          -  FEV1 at randomization (without exposure to a SABA for at least 6 hours) must be
             between 50% and 80% of predicted normal

          -  reversibility of FEV1 by at least 12% and at least 250 mL following two to four
             inhalations of a SABA must be demonstrated prior to randomization

          -  AQLQ(S) score of 4.5 or less at both the screening (Visit 1) and randomization (Visit
             2) visits

          -  patients must meet at least two out of three of the following criteria:

               -  overall score minimum of 2 on Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)

               -  require rescue SABA use of 2 or more inhalations per day for symptom relief on at
                  least 4 of 7 days during each week of the baseline period

               -  nighttime awakenings due to asthma, an average of at least once a week during the
