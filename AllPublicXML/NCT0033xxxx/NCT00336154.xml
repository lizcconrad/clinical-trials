  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidermolysis Bullosa(EB) is an inherited bullous disease. Tetracycline is believed to have
      anti inflammatory properties. 20 patients with EB older than 13 years will be treated for 4
      months with tetracycline or placebo. After one month of wash out they will be treated for
      additional 4 m with placebo or tetracycline. The patients will be examined each month to
      estimate bulla formation,rate of healing .
