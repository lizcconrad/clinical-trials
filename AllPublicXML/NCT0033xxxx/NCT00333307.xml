  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether different doses of recombinant human
      relaxin is safe when given to women with severe preeclampsia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effects of relaxin may be beneficial in the treatment of women with preeclampsia. This
      study will preliminarily evaluate the maternal, fetal and neonatal safety and tolerability of
      an IV infusion of relaxin compared with placebo given to women with severe preeclampsia.
