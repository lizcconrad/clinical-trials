      Objectives:

      The primary objective will be to determine whether patients receiving the combination of
      dendritic cells and high dose IL-2 have sustained persistence of infused T cells compared to
      patients treated with T cells and high dose IL-2 alone.

      Secondary endpoints will include evaluations for tumor response and studies to determine
      whether dendritic cells enhance the infused T cells in anti-tumor activity and their ability
      to migrate to the tumor site. In addition, we will evaluate the characteristics of the
      infused T cells that correspond with effectiveness in vivo.

      Leptomeningeal Disease: (Cohort D):

      Study Visits:

      You are expected to stay in the Houston area for at least 21 days in order to take part in
      this study.

      During this study, you will have the following tests and procedures:

        -  You will have an MRI of the complete spine and brain within 1 week before starting the
           therapy, at Week 4 (+/- 3 days), and at 8 weeks (+/- 3 days) after the Day 1 IT TIL
           infusion. You will also have MRIs of the brain and entire spine every 2 months (+/- 1
           week)

        -  At baseline, before starting maintenance therapy with IL-2, and then every 2 months
           after that, you will have a CT CAP and/or PET/CT to evaluate the status of the disease.

        -  You will have a neurological exam (tests to check the functioning of your nerves,
           including tests of your balance and reflexes) within 1 week before the Day 1 IT TIL
           infusion and before starting maintenance therapy with IL-2.

        -  Blood (about 4 1/2 tablespoons each time) will be taken before surgery to remove your
           tumor or tumor biopsy, before the treatment starts and again on Days 4, 8, 11, 15, 18,
           21, 28, 35, 42 (+7 days), and at each follow-up visit (+/- 7 days). These blood samples
           will be collected to evaluate the activity of the T-cells and their ability to attack
           the tumor.

        -  On days that you receive TIL, CSF will be collected through the Ommaya reservoir before
           the infusion of IT TIL to match the amount of TIL that is being infused.

        -  You will have a neurocognitive exam (tests to check your memory and thinking abilities,
           for example) within 1 week before Day 1 of IT TIL infusion and before starting
           maintenance therapy.

        -  You will complete a questionnaire about your symptoms within 1 week before Day 1 and
           before starting maintenance therapy. The questionnaire and visit should not take more
           than 3 hours.

      CSF will be collected for routine tests through either the Ommaya reservoir or a spinal tap
      within 4 weeks before Day 1 and then 1 time a week for 8 weeks.

      Â°Blood (about 4.5 tablespoons) will be drawn to monitor and track the TIL presence in the
      blood as compared to the CSF 1 week before the first IT TIL infusion and on Day 15 and in
      Week 5.

      During your inpatient stay/observation on Days 1-21:

        -  You will have a physical exam within 24 hours before Day 1 and Day 15 IT TIL infusion

        -  Vital signs will be checked every 4 hours for the first 24 hours after each TIL
           infusion, and then every 8 hours on all other days.

        -  You will have a neurological exam before IT TIL infusion, at 60-120 minutes after the
           infusion, and again at 24 (+/- 3 hour) hours after the infusion.

        -  If possible, 14 teaspoons of blood will be collected 1 week before the first IT TIL
           infusion on Day 15 and in Week 5 to monitor and track the presence of TIL in the blood
           as compared to the CSF.

        -  If possible, 10 teaspoons of blood will be collected Week 4 and every 4 weeks after for
           a total of 16 weeks to monitor and track the TIL presence in the blood as compared to
           the CSF.

      Length of Treatment:

      Depending on what your doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you might be asked to come
      back on a monthly or bi-monthly basis for IL-2 treatment. You will no longer be able to take
      the IT IL or IL-2 study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or
      if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      Follow-up visits will be scheduled depending on your treatment schedule. Each time you come
      for follow-up, up to 2 tablespoons of spinal fluid and up to 10 teaspoons of blood will be
      collected for research purposes. As standard of care for all patients with LMD, you will have
      an MRI of the brain and the spine, as well as either CT or PET/CT of your body to also
      monitor the rest of your disease.

      This is an investigational study. The medications being used in this study are FDA approved.
      IL-2 is a commercially available drug. However, its use together with T-cells in this study
      is experimental. The T-cells are authorized for use only in research. A total of 30 patients
      will take part in this portion of the study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Tissue Harvest and Screening: (Turnstile I):

      Tissue Harvest:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, a biopsy procedure of the tumor
      will be performed. A whole or part of your tumor will be cut and removed using high enough
      pain medication. This biopsy is being done to help attempt to grow the T-cells necessary for
      the treatment. Your T-cells will be grown in the laboratory with the help of
      radiation-exposed cells from other blood donors. These donor cells are tested to be negative
      for currently screened infectious diseases. If researchers are unable to grow enough cells or
      if your tumor does not have enough of the necessary components, you will not continue on
      study and other treatment options will be discussed with you.

      If the growth of these cells is successful, you will be able to continue on the study. There
      is up to a 6-week waiting period between the biopsy and continuing to the next phase of this
      study. You will be allowed to participate in other treatment plans during this time period.

      If there are any abnormal results, the study doctor or a research staff member will discuss
      this with you.

      This is an investigational study. The T-cell and vaccine therapy are authorized for use only
      in research.

      A total of up to 189 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD
      Anderson

      Treatment Consent: (Turnstile II):

      Study Visits:

      You will have blood samples collected to evaluate the activity of the T-cells and their
      ability to attack the tumor. Blood samples (about 4-1/2 tablespoons each time) will be taken
      before surgery to remove your tumor. If you are not scheduled to have surgery, you may have a
      biopsy of you tumor. Blood ( 4-1/2 tablespoons) will also be drawn before chemotherapy starts
      and again on Days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 (+7 days), and at each follow-up visit (+/- 7 days).
      This blood will be collected to evaluate the activity of your T-cells.

      You will return in 8 weeks for follow-up assessments, as part of the Melanoma Department's
      standard of care.

      If your blood tests show that you had Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the past, you will have an
      additional blood (about 2 teaspoons) sample drawn after the T-cell infusion to check for the
      presence of CMV. The study staff will check your CMV levels at Day 3 (+/- 24 hours) and Day
      21 (+/- 7 days) after TIL infusion as an added precaution.

      Some of the T-cells that you receive may come from donors who have tested positive for CMV in
      the past. However, these donors will be treated for CMV before their cells are collected, and
      the cells will also be tested to check for CMV before they are given to you.

      At about 6 weeks (+ 7 days) and at 12 weeks (+ 7 days) after you receive the T-cell and/or
      vaccine infusion (for each cycle), you will return to the clinic for a physical exam and for
      repeat scans to evaluate the size of your tumors.

      If possible, you will also have blood samples (about 4 1/2 tablespoons) drawn on all
      follow-up visits to check the effects of the T-cells on your blood cells.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will receive pentamidine by vein over 1 hour every 21
      days for 6 months after lymphodepletion. If you cannot receive pentamidine, you will take
      atovaquone by mouth.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      You will return in 8 weeks for follow-up evaluations per the Melanoma Department's standard
      of care.

      Re-Treatment:

      If you have stable disease or a partial response to treatment, you may be re-treated on the
      same schedule that you received before. Before this occurs, you will need to be evaluated
      again. A maximum of 1 re-treatment course may be given for each participant.

      This is an investigational study. IL-2 was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of
      metastatic melanoma. IL-2 is a hormone naturally found in the body that boosts the immune
      system. It is made in the lab, but from a normal human gene.

      The T-cell and vaccine therapy are authorized for use only in research. A total of up to 189
      patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
