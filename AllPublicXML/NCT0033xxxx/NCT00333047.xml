    <textblock>
      Therapeutic interventions for patients with metastatic breast cancer are aimed at prolonging
      survival and improving the quality of life. The objective of this trial is to assess if an
      initial chemotherapy followed by an endocrine therapy leads to a longer disease-free interval
      as compared to chemotherapy alone.
