      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of Saredutant in
      patients with depression. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      Saredutant 100 mg once daily compared to placebo in the prevention of relapse of depressive
      symptoms in outpatients with major depressive disorder who achieved an initial response to 12
      weeks of open-label treatment with Saredutant.
