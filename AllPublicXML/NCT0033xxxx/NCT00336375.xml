  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this explorative clinical trial is to study parasite population dynamics,
      diversity and clearance kinetics of Plasmodium falciparum as well as determination of the
      molecular mechanisms associated with drug resistance during the early phase of
      artemether-lumefantrine treatment when the drug intake is either accompanied with or without
      intake of fatty food. The hypothesis is that intake of fatty food together with
      artemether-lumefantrine will enhance parasite clearance and thereby decrease the risk of
      early selection of genetic markers related to drug resistance. The study population is
      children aged 1-10 years with uncomplicated malaria in Bagamoyo District, Tanzania. Enrolled
      children will be randomly allocated to either intake of a fatty meal or not together with the
      study drug. Artemether-lumefantrine will be given twice daily for 3 days in standard doses
      according to bodyweight. Study participants will be admitted during the study period (3
      days)to allow close supervision and detailed blood sampling.
