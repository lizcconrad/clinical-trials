  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cochlear implants require programming on an individual basis to provide appropriate levels of
      electrical stimulation. This program, or &quot;map&quot;, is placed in the speech processor of the
      cochlear implant. Success of implantation largely depends on the adequacy of this map.
      Cochlear implant fitting remains a difficult challenge in congenitally or pre-linguistically
      deafened children. It requires competence of experienced audiologists with expertise in
      behavioral techniques for hearing function assessment.Our goal is to establish the offset
      correlation between objective measurements (NRT and ESRT) and the behavioral measurements of
      T &amp; Cs in different stimulation rates in the Freedom SP System.

      An open trail. The implantees will go through their routine programming sessions after
      implantation, the specified data will be collected and analyzed in order to establish the
      offset correlation which we seek for.
