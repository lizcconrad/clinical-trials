    <measure>Time to Treatment Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until the end of study; median time on study was 31 weeks and 41 weeks in each treatment group respectively with a maximum time on study of 97 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Time-to-treatment failure is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first date of any of the following events: discontinuation of study therapy due to any reason (except for complete response and curative surgery), progression of disease, or death due to any cause. Participants who did not discontinue, who were still alive, and who did not have disease progression were censored at the date of last contact. Time to treatment failure was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until the end of study; median time on study was 31 weeks and 41 weeks in each treatment group respectively with a maximum time on study of 97 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Time from the date of randomization to the date of observed disease progression or death due to disease progression. Participants who did not have documented disease progression were censored at the date of last tumor assessment; participants who died for reasons other than disease progression while on study were censored at the date of death. PD: At least a 20% increase in the size of target lesions, recorded since the treatment started, or at least a 25% increase in size of non-target lesions and the lesion(s) measure &gt; 10 mm in one dimension, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.
Time to progression was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. This analysis excludes any data collected during follow-up for participants who began third-line treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Overall Dermatologic Quality of Life Index (DLQI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7</time_frame>
    <description>Skin-related quality of life was assessed using the DLQI. The DLQI questionnaire asks participants to evaluate the degree that their skin condition has affected their quality of life in the last week. Participants answer 10 questions on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); The DLQI score is calculated by summing the scores for all questions, resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0; higher scores indicate a more impaired quality of life.</description>

          <description>The time to the first occurrence of specific grade 2 or higher skin toxicities of interest was defined as the time from the first dose of panitumumab to the date of first occurrence of specific ≥ grade 2 skin toxicities of interest. Participants who did not experience specific skin-related toxicities were censored at their last skin toxicity assessment during the skin toxicity assessment period. Skin toxicities were assessed by the study clinician and graded according to the modified CTCAE v.3.0 Dermatology Toxicity Grading criteria, on a scale from Grade 1 (mild) to 4 (life-threatening). The specific skin toxicities of interest were pruritus, acneiform dermatitis, skin desquamation (also described as skin exfoliation), exfoliative dermatitis, paronychia, nail disorder, skin fissures, skin laceration, pruritic rash, pustular rash, skin infection, skin ulceration, and local infection.</description>

        <title>Best Overall Response Rate</title>
        <description>Best overall response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) while on study. Tumor response was assessed by CT scan or MRI of the abdomen, pelvis, and all other sites of disease. Disease assessments were performed by central review according to the modified RECIST criteria. CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. PR: Either the disappearance of all target lesions with persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) not qualifying for either CR or PD (≥ 25% increase in lesion size) and no new lesions, or, at least a 30% decrease in the size of target lesions with no progression of existing non-target lesions, and no new lesions.</description>
        <time_frame>Response was assessed at Weeks 9 and 13 and then every 8 weeks for the Q2W regimen, or at Weeks 10, 14, 22 and then every 9 weeks for the Q3W regimen until the end of treatment; median treatment duration was 13 and 17 weeks in each group respectively.</time_frame>

        <description>Skin-related quality of life was assessed using the DLQI. The DLQI questionnaire asks participants to evaluate the degree that their skin condition has affected their quality of life in the last week. Participants answer 10 questions on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); The DLQI score is calculated by summing the scores for all questions, resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0; higher scores indicate a more impaired quality of life.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
