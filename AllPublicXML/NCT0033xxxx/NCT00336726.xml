  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a neurologic disorder cuased by physical trauma to the brain.
      Neuroendocrine abnormalities in these patients have been reported, including central
      hypogonadism within hours of the insult and eventual recovery of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis with recovery of cognitive function to baseline. This
      pilot study will measure hormonal level of neuroendocine function at the time of TBI and
      various time points during recovery.
