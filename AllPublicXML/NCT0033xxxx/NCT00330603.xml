  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will seek to determine the amount of acids a person with a chronic cough that is
      suspected to be related to acid reflux breathes out after coughing. The study will also seek
      to determine if this measurement can predict the best treatment for the cough.

      Subjects with a chronic cough which is suspected to be related to acid reflux for which their
      doctor has prescribed a proton pump inhibitor medication will be enrolled in this study.

    <textblock>
      Acid reflux has been considered to be a key contributor to cough, particularly in patients
      with obstructive lung diseases. However, diagnosis has relied upon either responsiveness to
      high dose twice daily administration of proton pump inhibitor therapy or by 24 hour
      esophageal pH probes. This study is designed to provide information for the development of a
      clinically useful diagnostic (exhaled breath condensate pH) to identify the contribution of
      acid reflux to cough.

      Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) pH has been well documented to reflect airway acidification.
      Acid reflux to the level of the hypopharynx, which is a key common trigger of acid reflux
      induced cough, acidifies the airway sufficiently to be identified with EBC pH assays. The
      association of low EBC pH with an immediately preceding cough strongly suggests an
      association of the cough with an airway acid event, and even if the acidity is not prolonged,
      acid reflux becomes highly suspect.

      This study will examine the ability of EBC pH measurements to prognose the likelihood of a
      positive response to acid blockade with proton pump inhibitor therapy in subjects with
      chronic cough.
