  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This booster study will assess the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of a booster
      dose of GSK Biologicals' DTPw-HBV/Hib Kft. vaccine versus DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccine, in healthy
      children, 18 to 24 months of age, who received the same vaccine for primary vaccination.
      Prior to the booster dose, this study will also assess the persistence of antibodies to the
      vaccine antigen components administered in the primary vaccination course. The Protocol
      Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.
