  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to check the safety and efficacy of a pde5 inhibitor, tadalafil,
      is a special group of patients: Renal chronic patients in hemodialysis treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In our country, the number of patients in hemodialysis for the treatment of renal chronic
      dysfunction is very huge. As we know this group has a greater prevalence of sexual
      dysfunction than the general population, and among these dysfunctions erectile
      disfunction(ED) occupies maybe the most important position.

      With the advent of the increase aging of the nation´s population and the small number of
      organ donations, the number of men suffering from ED in hemodialysis surely will be very
      significant causing a very important problem for our health system.

      Up to now there´s little indexed publications supporting the use of tadalafil in this special
      group of men. Another PDE 5 inhibitor, sildenafil, was used in this patients with success and
      safety but obviously we need other options with the same efficacy.

      We intend this study to give us more background to treat ED in this already unfortunate ones.
