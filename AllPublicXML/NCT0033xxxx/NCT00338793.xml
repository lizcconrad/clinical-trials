  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculous pleurisy is associated with inflammation and fibrosis. Adjunctive corticosteroids
      are used for tuberculous pleurisy because their anti-inflammatory effect is thought to
      minimise pleural reactivity and thereby reduce residual pleural thickening. The purpose is to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral prednisolone for treatment of adult patients with
      tuberculous pleurisy.
