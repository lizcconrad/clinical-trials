  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe traumatic brain injury is associated with an increased production of free radicals
      causing brain damage. First line treatment of these patients aims to maintain cerebral
      perfusion and includes deep anaesthesia. Propofol has recently shown anti oxidant properties
      that need to be confirmed when used in these patients. The main objective of this study is to
      evaluate the effect of propofol compared to midazolam on intra cerebral oxidative stress
      following severe traumatic brain injury.
