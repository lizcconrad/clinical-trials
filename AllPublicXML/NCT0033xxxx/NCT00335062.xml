    <textblock>
      Graves' disease, the most common form of hyperthyroidism in children, is caused by
      Thyrotropin (TSH) Receptor Antibodies (TRAbs) that mimic the action of TSH. The disease leads
      to significant morbidity in children both due to the prolonged course of antithyroid
      medication often required for sustained immunological remission and the high risk of relapse
      when medication is withdrawn. The ability to predict which patients are most likely to fail
      medical management would greatly improve the choice of therapy. In the past, large goiter
      size, age at diagnosis, increased biochemical severity, and decreased body mass index have
      all been associated with a poorer prognosis, but these clinical indicators lack sensitivity
      and specificity. Preliminary data suggest that the new TRAb assays are both sensitive and
      specific for the measurement of TRAbs in children with Graves' disease. In addition,
      variation in these antibodies over time is not the same in all patients. The goal of this
      proposal will be to prospectively follow children with newly diagnosed Graves' disease and
      use microarray technology to determine if there are genes whose expression differ in patients
      who respond to medical therapy versus those who will need more definitive therapy earlier in
      their disease.

      In the present grant proposal, we plan to utilize two new assays (binding and bioassay) in
      order to identify additional predictors of Graves' disease and apply them to a well
      characterized group of patients with Graves' disease followed prospectively. More
      specifically, we plan to further investigate the antibodies by measuring lambda: kappa light
      chain antibody ratios in pediatric patients. We will assess epitope heterogeneity by using
      novel chimeric proteins in which specific portions of the TSH receptor have been replaced
      with the closely related LH receptor. We will utilize microarray technology to determine if
      there are differences in gene expression profiles in responders versus non responders. It is
      hoped that these methods will lead to an improved ability to follow disease progression and
      to monitor efficacy of therapy.
