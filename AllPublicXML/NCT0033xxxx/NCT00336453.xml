      The purpose of this study was to evaluate dose-related safety, reactogenicity and
      immunogenicity of FluBlok trivalent recombinant baculovirus-expressed hemagglutinin influenza
      vaccine, administered to healthy children aged 6 to 59 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza has been identified as a major health problem in young children. Influenza related
      hospitalizations are very high in children less than 24 months of age and children age 24-59
      months have a high rate of medical care utilization due to influenza. Recently, it has been
      noted that there are deaths attributable to influenza even in previously healthy children.
      Recent CDC recommendations reflect this growing awareness of the impact of influenza in
      children and state that virtually all children less than 18 years of age should receive
      annual influenza vaccination.

      Currently available licensed trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs) are prepared from viruses
      that are grown in embryonated hens' eggs. Alternative substrates for vaccine production are
      desirable in order to reduce the vulnerability of and to expand influenza vaccine supply.
      Recombinant DNA techniques allow for expression of the influenza hemagglutinin (rHA) by
      baculovirus vectors in insect cell cultures. Advantages of this technique include speed of
      production, absence of egg protein, and a highly purified product.

         13. any condition that would, in the opinion of the investigator, place them at an
             unacceptable risk of injury or render the subject unable to meet the requirements of
