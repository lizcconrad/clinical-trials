      The proposed protocol aims to characterize the infectious episodes in pancreas transplant
      recipients under the current medical care. Knowing these patients infectious risks, the types
      of infections that commonly affect them and the morbidity and mortality associated with it
      will provide valuable information in the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the current
      practices. The information generated by this study will also serve as the basis for
      development of strategies targeting prophylaxis of infectious episodes.

      The objectives of the study are:

        1. To determine what is the frequency of infectious complications following pancreas
           transplantation

        2. Characterize the clinical and microbiological aspects of the infectious complications
           following pancreas transplantation

        3. Identify predictors for infection following pancreas transplantation

        4. Determine the frequency of graft loss and associated mortality of infectious
           complications following pancreas transplantation

      No genetic testing will be performed on any of the samples being obtained. The biologic
      samples will be under the control of the principal investigator of this research project. To
      protect confidentiality, all personal identifiers (i.e., name, social security number, and
      birth date) will be removed (de-identified) and replaced with a specific code number. The
      information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subjects' identities will be kept
      in a separate, secure location. The investigators on this study will keep the samples
      indefinitely. If a subject withdraws and provides the request in writing, samples collected
      and not already processed will be destroyed. All samples will be kept in the investigator's
      laboratory located in Scaife Hall, Room 812, 3550 Terrace Street.
