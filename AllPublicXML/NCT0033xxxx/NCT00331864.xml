  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ranibizumab is a humanised recombinant monoclonal antibody fragment targeted against human
      vascular endothelial growth factor A. This study will assess the safety and efficacy of
      ranibizumab administered on an as-needed dosing regimen in patients with subfoveal choroidal
      neovascularization (CNV) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

    <description>Grade 3 targeted AEs included:
4+ ocular inflammation or 2-3+ ocular inflammation failing to decrease to ≤ 1+ within 30 days
≥ 30 letter decrease in BCVA that developed within 14 days of ranibizumab injection
sustained (&gt;15 minutes) loss of light perception due to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) or a &gt;20 mm Hg change in IOP persisting longer than 14 days
new retinal tear or detachment involving the macula

    <measure>Mean Change in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) of the Study Eye From Baseline to Month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>BCVA was assessed using best correction determined from protocol refraction. BCVA measurements were taken in a sitting position using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like visual acuity testing charts at an initial testing distance of 4 meters.
BCVA is measured by the number of letters a patient could correctly read on an eye chart; hence an increased score indicates improvement in acuity.</description>

    <description>Ranibizumab-naïve (Non-ANCHOR) patients received up to 12 intravitreal injections (Month 0 through Month 11). The dose of 0.3 mg ranibizumab was administered monthly for three consecutive months. From Month 3 through Month 11, either 0.3 mg ranibizumab or, after implementation of an amendment to the protocol, 0.5 mg ranibizumab were injected as individually needed based on re-treatment criteria described in the protocol. For patients who had participated in the ANCHOR study, either 0.3 mg ranibizumab or, after implementation of an amendment to the protocol, 0.5 mg ranibizumab was injected if the patient met re-treatment criteria described in the protocol. Ranibizumab was administered no sooner than 14 days after the previous treatment.</description>
