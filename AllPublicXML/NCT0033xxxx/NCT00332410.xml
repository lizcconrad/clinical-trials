    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients with compromised renal function
      (CrCl &lt; 50mL/min) receiving intravenous voriconazole experienced any adverse effects related
      to serum chemistries or other imaging studies of the kidney due to the potential accumulation
      of the vehicle cyclodextran.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients with compromised renal function
      (CrCl &lt; 50mL/min) receiving intravenous voriconazole experienced any adverse effects related
      to serum chemistries or other imaging studies of the kidney due to the potential accumulation
      of the vehicle cyclodextran. t has been previously shown by a large multi-centered,
      prospective, randomized study that voriconazole is superior to the then gold standard
      amphotericin B in the treatment of patients with invasive aspergillosis - a disease with
      significant morbidity and mortality. In patients with these infections who have severe renal
      insufficiency may be denied the best therapy due to the accumulation of a diluent with
      unknown clinical consequences. Qualifying and or quantifying these consequences are important
      to these patients so that potentially life-threatening therapy should not be unduly denied.

      No genetic testing will be performed on any of the samples being obtained. The biologic
      samples will be under the control of the principal investigator of this research project. To
      protect confidentiality, all personal identifiers (i.e., name, social security number, and
      birth date) will be removed (de-identified) and replaced with a specific code number. The
      information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subjects' identities will be kept
      in a separate, secure location. The investigators on this study will keep the samples
      indefinitely. If a subject withdraws and provides the request in writing, samples collected
      and not already processed will be destroyed. All samples will be kept in the investigator's
      laboratory located in Scaife Hall, Room 812, 3550 Terrace Street.
