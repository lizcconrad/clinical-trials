      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a rapid bedside diagnosis of group B strep
      (GBS) growing in the vagina and rectum can be performed with similar success to the routine
      culture in women who are in labor.

    <textblock>
      Group B Strep neonatal infections is one of the leading infections in newborns, most of which
      are acquired by vertical transmission at the time of childbirth. Most cases can be prevented
      by identifying women who are colonized with GBS in the vaginal-rectal area and giving
      colonized women prophylactic antibiotics in labor. About 15-20% of women are colonized and
      nearly all of these women are asymptomatic. Because it takes up to 48 hours to obtain culture
      results, it is currently recommended to perform cultures in the clinic about 5 weeks prior to
      their due date and then treat those with GBS when they come in for labor. There are several
      downsides to this strategy. All women who present with preterm labor are treated until
      culture results become available (overtreatment); women who go into labor while waiting for
      culture results are all treated (overtreatment); prior studies have shown 33% of women are
      positive at 35 weeks, but negative at birth (overtreatment) and 10% are negative at 35 weeks
      and positive at birth (undertreatment); lost or missing culture results (over- or
      undertreatment). Using microfluidics and fluorescent PCR, a new test can identify GBS
      reliably in 30 to 45 minutes in vitro. This study proposes to evaluate the clinical
      performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value) of the
      microfluidic rapid GBS technique in un-selected sequential women presenting to labor and
      delivery, comparing them to cultures taken at the same time and the 35-37 week cultures in
      these same women. We will also evaluate the identification of GBS before and after rupture of
      membranes (amniotomy) using both standard GBS culture and rapid PCR (HandyLab technology).
