    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of non-needle electro-acupuncture on
      mild to moderate anxiety. The hypothesis is that this style of treatment will reduce state
      anxiety and not trait anxiety as measured by the Spielberger STAI test.

    <textblock>
      Persistent and unrelenting stress is defined as anxiety. Anxiety disorders are among the most
      common mental disorders in society. The NIH estimates that nearly 200 million Americans
      suffer from anxiety. Anxiety disorders are associated with a lower quality of life,
      functional impairment and disability, and are also associated with co-morbid physical
      illness.

      Acupuncture, one form of complementary and alternative medicine, has been used to treat
      anxiety. Non-needle acupuncture is one of the safest methods, with none to rare side effects.
      This method has been studied in China (Han 1986) and America (Ulett 1998) Pre-intervention
      testing, then three treatments within one week, will be followed by post intervention
      testing.
