  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of a single dose regimen of human butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE) in healthy
      adults at 3 ascending dosage levels administered IV. HuBChE, which occurs naturally in human
      plasma, is being evaluated for prophylaxis and treatment in the event of exposure to chemical
      nerve agents (as employed during chemical warfare or as an act of terrorism). Volunteers in
      each dosage cohort will be randomized to treatment with HuBChE active drug or normal saline
      placebo in a 3:1 ratio. The volunteers will remain in the study for 90 (+/- 7) days. For the
      first 3 days following dose administration, they will remain at the clinical trial site as
      inpatients and will be closely monitored for patient safety. Afterwards, they will return to
      the trial site (at pre-determined intervals) as outpatients for 8 further visits, where
      patient safety will be assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The volunteer is between 18 and 55 years of age (inclusive) at the time of
             administration of HuBChE.

             a medical history and physical examination.

          -  The volunteer has clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis
             laboratory values within acceptable ranges or deemed clinically insignificant by the
             Principal Investigator (PI) and Project Medical Monitor.

          -  The volunteer has a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) or one with clinically
             insignificant findings as deemed by the PI.

          -  The volunteer is willing to have his or her blood samples stored for future HuBChE
             research studies.

          -  The volunteer has signed the Informed Consent form (ICF) and has signed the Health
             Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization form.

          -  The volunteer agrees not to donate blood during the trial or for at least 2 months
             following the 90 day study visit.

          -  The volunteer is willing to comply with the requirements of the protocol through the
             post-infusion Day 90 (± 7 days) visit.

          -  Female volunteers must be of non-childbearing potential (i.e., surgically sterilized
             or postmenopausal), or must not be pregnant (as indicated by a negative urine
             pregnancy test within 1 day prior to HuBChE administration) or nursing, and must use
             two types of acceptable forms of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved birth
             control methods, including:

               -  Progesterone only hormonal types of birth control (such as implants or birth
                  control pills) or an intrauterine device (IUD) and

             Day 45 (± 1 day) study visit.

          -  Current use, receipt within the previous 14 days, or intent to use during the 14 days
