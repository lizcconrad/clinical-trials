      General Information

      Antibodies are a specific response to any &quot;foreign&quot; antigen, and they are usually detectable
      in the serum within 5-7 days after the initial exposure to it. However, there are some cases
      where there is a suppression of the specific immune response, such as in the case of a tumor.
      To date, there are no reports on serum antibodies that are associated to cancer. Some tumors,
      when surgically removed and studied have been found to have both infiltrates of T lymphocytes
      and antibodies bound to the tumor cells. These antibodies (and other specific immune
      responses) are assumed to be formed at later stages of the tumor growth, however, even in
      those cases, serum antibodies have not been reported (probably due to them being mostly
      &quot;absorbed&quot; by the tumor mass).

      Since the mutations of a normal cell that lead to a malignant cell mass involves changes in
      the structure and function of the cells, it could be assumed that the immune system has
      recognized some of these changes as antigenic determinates that should be responded against;
      if so, than the suppression caused by the tumor would be the reason for the lack of
      antibodies.

      If this immune suppression could be overcome, in vitro, it could lead to the formation of
      antibodies that are not detectable in the serum (We call this process Cimmunology).
      Identifying the structures that the antibodies bind to, and looking for a correlation between
      the tumor pathology and the antibodies' specificity – could provide additional information
      about the tumor – via a blood test.

      1.2 Future CAAb Test

      The Cimmunology based test is comprised of an in-vitro stimulation step and an antibody
      detection step.

      The assay will be used to find cancer associated antibodies in Breast cancer patients.

      Identification of Breast cancer associated antibodies could provide the clinician with
      additional immunological and antigenic information regarding the patient's condition or
      medical status.

      The Cimmunology process is comprised of a blood collection and processing step and an
      incubation (in a special stimulation &quot;tube&quot; called CimTube) period in a humid, 37oC incubator
      with 5% CO2.

      The test for the detection of specific antibodies is ELISA based, and includes different
      potentially interesting antigens.

      The relevant medical and pathological information, to be collected form the patient's file,
      will enable a more detailed analysis of the test results.

      STUDY DESIGN

      4.1 Overall Description

      The current study is a comparative observational two-arm study, involving all consecutive
      Breast cancer patients during the study duration, and age matched control subjects. The
      purpose of the study is to assess the effectiveness of the CAAb test in detecting Breast
      cancer associated antibodies.

      Subjects will be screened for potential participation in the study, according to the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients recruited will be asked to sign an informed
      consent form.

      The data on the patients will include parameters of the clinical and pathological state of
      the patients, results of CimTube culture step and the experimental kits. The effectiveness of
      the CAAb test will be assessed by evaluating the statistical significance of the CAAb test
      used.

      The study will utilize a three step group-sequential design with two interim and one final
      analysis using the O'Brian-Fleming' boundaries. The data collection may be stopped after the
      first or second interim analysis if the bounds are reached. This could substantially decrease
      the number of patients and the time of the study, while just slightly increasing the maximum
      number of patients. (See Sample size considerations below).

      We will use 1:2 ratio between cancer and control patients to decrease the necessary number of
      cancer patients which is the main limiting factor.

      The sponsor will conduct interim analysis, following the first third and second third of
      Breast cancer cases and the sample size will be recalculated accordingly to the obtained
      estimates of the mean and variance of the test in the two groups.

      Therefore, at least 100 patients will be enrolled in the study. The control group will be of
      200 patients.

      4.2 Study Procedure

      In the hospital,

      First, an identified study patient has to sign an informed consent form, and her Eligibility
      Form filled (see appendix B), both should be bar-coded.

      Patient demographic and clinical information acquired from the patient’s medical file,
      including age, country of origin, medical history and results of tests done leading to the
      diagnostic evaluation of Breast cancer (not relevant in the control group) will be recorded
      on the appropriate, bar-coded, pre-study case report forms (see appendix C, CRF-BC and
      CRF-BC-Control). The reports will be either electronic (a dedicated and secured internet
      site) or via a hard copy. A hard copy of the records will be kept in the department. The
      study is anonymous and the Department will keep the name of the patient without reveling it
      to investigators and to the study sponsor.

      The Study Sponsor will provide the tubes and the barcode labels for monitoring. The doctor/
      nurse/ phlebotomist will collect three heparin vacuum tubes (20-24 ml), label (bar-code)
      them, and fill up the initial step in the &quot;Sample follow-up form&quot; (SFF) (see appendix D). The
      tubes with the blood will be packaged in double sealed containers (will be provided by the
      sponsor). The department will notify the designated shipper to collect the blood up to 1 hour
      from the time that it has been sampled.

      For each BC sample two age matched controls (+/- 3 years) will be recruited too.

      Transportation from the Hospital to the Handling Lab

      The blood will be transported at room temperature (18-250C), according to the relevant
      regulations, to the laboratory. Transportation time will be not more than 6 hours. Times to
      be recorded in SFF.

      In the blood handling laboratory:

      The blood handling laboratory (to be located no further than 200km from the collection site)
      will isolate PBMC (Peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and put them into Cimmunology culture
      within 20 hours form the sampling time (fill up time in SFF).

      The detailed protocol and the Cimmunology media will be provided by Lab Discoveries to the
      participating laboratories (where applicable). All hospitals in Israel will send the blood
      samples to the laboratory at Lab Discoveries. After the culture step, the culture fluid will
      be collected and frozen at -80, in properly labeled aliquots. The frozen samples will be sent
      to the diagnostic laboratory for antibody tests.

      In the diagnostic laboratory:

      Antibody tests, such as ELISA, will be prepared using different antigens. The samples will be
      tested for response to the two antigens that have been identified in the past, and for
      additional new ones. All the data will be permanently recorded directly into a dedicated
      computer. For each sample all antibody results will be put into the coded patient file. The
      results will be analyzed by a statistician with expertise in cancer population studies.

      At the Hospital, post surgery:

      2-3 weeks after the surgery, the CRO will collect from the patient's file the results from
      the pathology lab and any other relevant information as to the nature and state of the tumor
      that was removed during surgery. These results will be recorded on the dedicated and secured
      internet site and a printed bar-coded CRFs will be kept in the Department.

      9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

      The present study is a comparative observational two-arm study, involving all consecutive
      Breast cancer patients during the study duration, and age matched control subjects. The main
      purpose of the study is to assess the effectiveness of the CAAb tests. This effectiveness
      will be measured by the Fisher' distance (often called “effect size”) d defined as

      Where m1 is the mean value of the test in the controls, m2 is the mean value in the Breast
      cancer patients, |m1-m2| denotes the absolute value of the difference (m1-m2), and s is the
      common estimate of the standard deviation of the distribution of the test in one group
      (control or Breast cancer).

      9.1 Statistical Hypothesis

      Null Hypothesis: There is no relationship between the presence or absence of BC and the CAAb
      i.e. d=0

      Alternative hypothesis: The expectation of the CAAb in the cancer population differ from that
      of the control population…. i.e. m1 not equal to m2 Since the sign of the difference is not
      important the test will be two-sided.

      9.2 General Considerations

      According to our previous results, we assume that

        1. The distributions of the test results in each group are close to Normal or may be
           transformed to the Normal by log-transformation.

        2. The variance of the distributions in the two groups are approximately equal

        3. Having in mind that this is a pilot study we will consider the results as significant if
           the two-sided p-value is 0.1 or less. The bound 0.1 instead of 0.05 was chosen to
           decrease the chances of random exclusion of some potentially informative tests.

      When deciding the continuation of the study no correction for multiple comparisons is
      assumed. However, the results will be presented without and with the correction using the FDR
      of Benjamini&amp;Hochberg approach (Benjamini, Hochberg 1995).

      Where confidence limits are appropriate, the confidence level will be 95% .

      9.3 Sample Size The sample size was calculated using relevant information from our previous
      study on Peptides P3 and P1 and Breast cancer. There is no information in the literature
      regarding cancer associated antibodies.

      The sample size is calculated for a three step sequential group design with two sided
      significance 0.1 and 0.05, power 0.8, for cancer : control ratio 1:2, for D of 0.5. The
      calculations used the standard formulas for sample size necessary for comparison mean values
      in two independent groups by t-test. The correction for a group-sequential procedure with
      O’Bien and Fleming’s test increases the numbers by 1.017 and 1.027 for significance values
      0.05 and 0.1, that is negligible for our sample sizes. (see C. Jennison, B.W.Turnbill Group
      Sequential Methods with Applications to Clinical Trials Chapmann&amp;Hall(2000) Boca Raton FL US
      pp30 table 2.4).

      The calculations were done using NCSS-PASS software.

      9.4 Endpoints Evaluation

      9.4.1 Effectiveness Analysis

      A calculated D between 0.3 and 0.5 will mark a test as non effective to be used alone.
      However, it may be important in combination with other tests as a part of the multivariate
      test procedure. Tests with d&lt;0.3 will be considered as non-effective. A test, or a
      combination of tests, with d&gt;0.5 will mark the CAAb test as effective.
