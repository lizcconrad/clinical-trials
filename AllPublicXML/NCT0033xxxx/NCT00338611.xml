      The purposes of the CITT are:

        -  To determine whether Home-based Pencil Push-up therapy, Home-based Pencil Push-ups with
           Computer Vision Therapy/Orthoptics or Office-based VT/Orthoptics more effective than
           placebo treatment, and whether there are differences between the three treatments in
           improving subject symptoms and signs.

        -  To evaluate whether improvements in outcome measures are still present after one year of
           observation.

      Convergence insufficiency is a prevalent and distinct binocular vision disorder. Typical
      symptoms include double vision, eyestrain, headaches, and blurred vision while reading. It
      affects approximately 5% of children in the United States, and may have a serious impact on
      an individual's performance in school, choice of jobs, and quality of life.

      There is no consensus regarding the most effective treatment for convergence insufficiency.
      Two commonly prescribed treatments are home-based pencil push-up therapy and office-based
      vision therapy/orthoptics. Significant differences exist between these two treatment
      modalities in cost and number of office visits required, with pencil push-up therapy being
      less expensive and less time intensive. There have been no well-designed studies that have
      compared the effectiveness of these two treatments.

      The Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial (CITT) is a prospective, masked,
      placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trial in which 208 subjects between the ages of 9
      to &lt; 18 years will be randomly assigned to: 1) Home-based Pencil Push-Up Therapy, 2)
      Home-based Pencil Push-ups with Computer Vision Therapy/Orthoptics, 3) Office-based Vision
      Therapy/Orthoptics, or 4) Placebo Office-based Vision Therapy/Orthoptics. The primary outcome
      measure is a measure of symptoms using a 15-item survey, the CI Symptom Survey. Secondary
      outcome measures are two common clinical tests of the eyes' ability to converge when
      performing close work. Patients will be tested at the eligibility examination, and by masked
      examiners after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment have been completed during the 12-week
      treatment phase. Long term follow-up will be assessed at 6 and 12 months after the completion
      of active treatment.
