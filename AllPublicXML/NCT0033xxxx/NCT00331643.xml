  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well ixabepilone works in treating young patients with
      refractory solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ixabepilone, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate to ixabepilone in various strata of recurrent solid malignant
      tumors of childhood and young adulthood, including all of the following: Embryonal or
      alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal tumor,
      synovial sarcoma or malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, Wilms' tumor, and neuroblastoma.

      II. Determine the time to progression for each tumor stratum. III. Prospectively evaluate the
      feasibility and utility of automated volumetric tumor measurement in patients with measurable
      pulmonary metastases, and descriptively compare volumetric measurements to 1-dimensional
      (RECIST criteria) and 2-dimensional (WHO criteria) measurements.

      IV. Define and describe the toxicities of ixabepilone.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease (Ewing's
      sarcoma/ peripheral neuroectodermal tumor vs osteosarcoma vs alveolar or embryonal
      rhabdomyosarcoma vs Wilms' tumor vs neuroblastoma vs synovial sarcoma/malignant peripheral
      nerve sheath tumor).

      Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every year for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study.
