  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an intratympanic
      continuous two-week application of dexamethasone compared to placebo using a temporarily
      implanted catheter in patients with severe to profound sudden sensorineural hearing loss and
      insufficient recovery after initial systemic prednisolone therapy.

      Patients suffering from unilateral severe to profound sudden sensorineural hearing loss
      (ISSNHL) or anacusis with no or insufficient recovery after 12-21 days after onset will be
      treated for 14 days with Dexamethasone or placebo delivered intratympanically via a
      micro-catheter temporarily implanted into the round window niche and an external mini-pump.

      Due to the relatively unknown risks of intratympanic treatment by catheter implantation, a
      significant spontaneous recovery rate and an existing standard therapy for ISSNHL in Germany
      (systemic glucocorticoids), patients will only be enrolled into the study if no or
      insufficient recovery of hearing threshold could be observed after initial systemic therapy.

      The study will be carried out until 10 patients per group have been randomized regardless in
      which study center they have been randomized. After the last patient of these 10 patients per
      group has reached the endpoint an interim analysis will be done. The statistical estimation
      of the total number of subjects to be randomized will be completed after this interim
      analysis by the responsible statistician.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent form

          -  Age is greater than 18 years old and less than 75 years old.

          -  Diagnosis of unilateral Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (i.e. sudden
             sensorineural hearing loss of unknown etiology

          -  Sensorineural hearing loss is at least 50 dB or more for three or more frequencies in
             standard pure tone, bone-conducted audiogram within the range of 500 Hz to 4000 Hz
             (500, 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000), 60 dB or more for two of these frequencies or 70 dB
             or more for any frequency within this range, or a decrease in the SRT to 70 dB or
             greater (not accounted for by conductive hearing loss) or a drop in speech
             discrimination score to less than or equal to 30%

          -  hearing loss occurred within 72 hours

          -  Hearing loss occurred at least 12 days ago but less than or equal to 21 days ago

          -  Insufficient recovery of the ISSNHL at least 12 days after onset whether or not the
             patient received Local Standard Therapy (i.e. Hearing in the contralateral ear is at
             least 20 dB better than the affected ear in at least three frequencies (any three of
             500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hz))

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of any conditions or symptoms which indicate that the hearing loss is not
             ISSNHL, for example, acoustic trauma, Meniere's disease, fluctuating hearing loss,
             endolymphatic hydrops, suspected retro-cochlear lesion, hearing loss due to ear
             surgery, perilymph fistula or barotrauma.

          -  Pulse synchronic tinnitus (potentially due to glomus jugulare tumor)
