  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to directly compare the safety and efficacy of intra-thrombus
      alfimeprase 0.3 mg/kg with placebo in acute peripheral arterial occlusion (PAO) as measured
      by a 30 day open vascular free surgery rate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an unmet medical need to improve thrombolytic therapy in acute peripheral arterial
      occlusion (PAO). Currently used plasminogen activators can result in increased circulating
      levels of plasmin that result in a systemic &quot;lytic state&quot; that does not distinguish between
      physiologic and pathologic thrombosis. In general, mean plasminogen activator infusion
      durations of greater than 24 hours in order to achieve successful thrombolysis are
      problematic in a disease where delayed restoration of arterial flow can lead to irreversible
      ischemic damage. A direct thrombolytic agent like alfimeprase, with a rapid mechanism of
      action and a potentially safer bleeding risk profile, could facilitate a rapid restoration of
      arterial flow and avoidance of open vascular surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 or older

          -  Arteriographically confirmed acute PAO of the lower extremity with onset of symptoms
             within 14 days prior to randomization

          -  Acute index limb ischemia classified as SVS/ISCVS Class I or IIa caused by occlusion
             of a native artery and/or bypass graft (vein or prosthetic). Only Class I subjects
             with abrupt onset of ischemic rest pain or abrupt onset/progression of
             lifestyle-limiting claudication are eligible

          -  Acute PAO with a need for urgent surgical intervention to restore arterial blood flow
             in the event of unsuccessful thrombolytic therapy

          -  Available for follow-up assessments

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindication to systemic anticoagulation

          -  History of endovascular procedure or open vascular surgery on the index limb within
             the past 30 days

          -  History of significant acute or chronic kidney disease that would preclude contrast
             angiography

          -  Known allergy to contrast agents

          -  History of heparin induced thrombocytopenia

          -  Participation in any study of an investigational device, medication, biologic, or
             other agent within 30 days prior to randomization

          -  Any thrombolytic therapy within 5 days prior to randomization

          -  Past participation in any alfimeprase trial

          -  Pregnant, lactating, or actively menstruating women or women of childbearing potential
             who are not using adequate contraceptive precautions

          -  Investigator inability to advance guidewire through index occlusion

          -  Any other subject feature that in the opinion of the investigator should preclude
             study participation
