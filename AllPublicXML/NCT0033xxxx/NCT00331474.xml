  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Each year, more than half a million babies are infected with HIV by mother-to child
      transmission in developing countries. Many of these babies get sick and develop HIV disease
      (AIDS) at a very young age. Exposure to other infectious diseases may influence this early
      progression to AIDS. BCG is a live tuberculosis vaccine made from cow tuberculosis. It is
      routinely given at birth to most babies, also to babies born to HIV-positive mothers. BCG can
      cause disease (BCGosis) in HIV-infected babies. More importantly, BCG may also trigger immune
      responses in the body that lead to the spread of the HIV virus and early progression to AIDS.

      Objective(s) and Hypothesis:

      The researchers will investigate whether BCG causes progression of HIV by doing a clinical
      trial: babies born to HIV-positive mothers will be randomly allocated to get the BCG vaccine
      at birth or at 14 weeks of age. In these 2 groups of babies, the researchers will compare:

        -  The percentage of babies who progress to HIV disease

        -  Blood markers of HIV disease (the amount of virus and protective white blood cells in
           the body)

        -  The body's immune response to BCG vaccine and other childhood vaccines

        -  The percentage of children who develop BCG scarring, BCG vaccine complications and
           tuberculosis.

      Potential Impact:

      BCG is the most widely given vaccine worldwide and is routinely given to babies born to
      HIV-positive mothers in developing countries. Any effect that BCG has on HIV progression in
      babies will have a significant public health impact in settings with a high burden of HIV
      disease.
