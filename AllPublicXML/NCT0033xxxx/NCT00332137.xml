  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The muscarinic antagonist tolterodine is widely used treat urinary urge incontinence. Though
      acteylcholine is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the gastrointestinal tract, the
      phase III trials suggest that tolterodine infrequently causes constipation. Therefore, the
      objectives of this study are to assess if tolterodine affects the speed at which food travels
      through the stomach, intestines and colon (i.e., gastrointestinal and colonic transit) in
      healthy subjects.

      The specific aims of this study are to test the hypotheses that the non-specific muscarinic
      antagonist tolterodine will not:- i) delay colonic transit and the proximal colonic emptying
      rate; ii) delay gastric emptying; nor iii) delay small intestinal transit compared to placebo
      in healthy subjects.
