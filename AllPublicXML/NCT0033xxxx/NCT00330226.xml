      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of long-term
      psychopharmacotherapy in schizophrenia or bipolar disorder in terms of psychopathology and
      side effects.

      Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are renowned for chronic and deteriorating course.
      Although atypical antipsychotics and mood stabilizers are widely used as treatment of choice
      for these illness based on acute efficacy and safety, long-term efficacy and safety of these
      agents are still open to debate. Prospective follow-up study in naturalistic condition may be
      a useful way of elucidating cons and pros of long-term psychopharmacotherapy.In this study,
      efficacy and various side effects of drugs will be measured, and the possibility of
      neurophysiological markers will be tested by serial measurements of electroencephalographic
      changes.
