  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and clinical outcome of
      Epoetin alfa with dosing regime in accordance with Summary of Product Characteristics in the
      treatment of anemia in predialysis.

      Open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study for anemic patients with hemoglobin &lt;or=11
      g/dl. The dose of epoetin alfa is the routine dosage regimen and is in accordance of the
      approved SmPC. That's why the study had in general two phases - first period: subcutaneous
      administration and second period:intravenous administration. The evaluation is made in 4
      visits:baseline, 2 month (Visit 1), 4 month (Visit 2), 6 month (Visit 3), 9 month (Visit 4).
      Echographic evaluation - on baseline visit, Visit 3 and Visit 4.Baseline visit - weight,
      arterial pressure, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Erythrocytes, Middle Cells Volume, Middle Cells
      Hemoglobin, Middle Cells Hemoglobin Concentration, Transferrin, Creatinine, Clerans, Visit1,
      Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 4 - Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Erythrocytes, Middle Cells Volume, Middle
      Cells Hemoglobin, Middle Cells Hemoglobin Concentration. The dosage is in routine dosing
      regimen, the starting dose of epoetin alfa is 50 Units/kg body weight. The maintaining dose
      depends on hematological results. Administration - subcutaneous (during the first period),
      intravenous (second period). Duration of the study - 9 months.
