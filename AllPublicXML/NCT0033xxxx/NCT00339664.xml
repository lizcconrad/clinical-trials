  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients in clinical trials donate various human samples (e.g., serum, plasma, blood,
      urine, feces, bile, saliva) for research purposes.

      The purpose of this study is to conduct further analyses on these existing samples from
      clinical trials that are being performed outside of, but in collaboration with, the National
      Cancer Institute.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Various human samples (e.g., serum, plasma, whole blood, erythrocytes, urine, feces, bile,
      and/or saliva) will be collected from cancer patients enrolled on approved clinical trials,
      in accordance with the local protocol. These trials are being conducted at outside
      institutions, in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the samples will
      be sent to the NCI for pharmacological analysis, involving determination of parent drug
      and/or metabolite concentrations and subsequent pharmacokinetics and statistical data
      analysis. This study aims to further characterize the clinical pharmacokinetic behavior of
      select cancer therapeutics. Future collaborators will be added via the protocol amendment
      procedure.
