  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gliomas are one of the most challenging tumors to treat, because areas of the apparently
      normal brain contain microscopic deposits of glioma cells; indeed, these occult cells are
      known to infiltrate several centimeters beyond the clinically apparent lesion visualized on
      standard computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MR). Since it is not feasible to
      remove or radiate large volumes of the brain, it is important to target only the visible
      tumor and the infiltrated regions of the brain. However, due to the limited ability to detect
      occult glioma cells, clinicians currently add a uniform margin of 2 cm or more beyond the
      visible abnormality, and irradiate that volume. Evidence, however, suggests that glioma
      growth is not uniform - growth is favored in certain directions and impeded in others. This
      means it is important to determine, for each patient, which areas are at high risk of
      harboring occult cells. We propose to address this task by learning how gliomas grown, by
      applying Machine Learning algorithms to a database of images (obtained using various advanced
      imaging technologies: MRI, MRS, DTI, and MET-PET) from previous glioma patients. Advances
      will directly translate to improvements for patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in adults; most are high-grade and have a
      high level of mortality. The standard treatment is to kill or remove the cancer cells. Of
      course, this can only work if the surgeon or radiologist can find these cells. Unfortunately,
      there are inevitably so-called &quot;occult&quot; cancer cells, which are not found even by today's
      sophisticated imaging techniques.

      This proposal proposes a technology to predict the locations of these occult cells, by
      learning the growth patterns exhibited by gliomas in previous patients. We will also develop
      software tools that help both practitioners and researchers find gliomas similar to a current
      one, and that can autonomously find the tumor region within a brain image, which can save
      radiologists time, and perhaps help during surgery.
