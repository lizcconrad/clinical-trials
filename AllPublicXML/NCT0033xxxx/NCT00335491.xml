      RATIONALE: Exercise may help improve mobility and relieve fatigue and/or weakness in cancer
      survivors. It is not yet known whether exercise is more effective than standard therapy in
      improving mobility and reducing fatigue and/or weakness in older cancer survivors.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying exercise to see how well it works
      compared to standard therapy in improving mobility and reducing fatigue and/or weakness in
      older cancer survivors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the perception of, and the patterns of change in fatigue, weakness, physical
           activity level, and functional status in elderly cancer survivors who undergo Resistance
           Exercise via Negative-Eccentric Work (RENEW) vs standard care.

        -  Compare changes in muscle structure, function (strength + power production and metabolic
           function) and mobility.

        -  Evaluate the patient's adherence to and satisfaction with the RENEW intervention.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, longitudinal study. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo resistance exercise via negative-eccentric work (RENEW), using a
           special seated stationary leg exercise machine, 3 times a week for up to 12 weeks.
           Exercise exertion and duration is gradually increased weekly for the first 4-5 weeks of
           RENEW.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive standard care. In both arms, fatigue, weakness, physical
           activity, functional status, muscle structure and function, and mobility are assessed at
           baseline and then at 12 weeks after completion of study intervention. Fatigue and
           weakness are also assessed weekly during study intervention. Patients in arm I also
           undergo isometric strength assessment weekly during RENEW and assessment of adherence to
           and satisfaction with RENEW at 12 weeks after completion of RENEW.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
