      The purpose of the study is to assess the usefulness of high Frequency mid-QRS analysis in
      identifying the ischemic origin of patients presenting to the Emergency Room (ER)with Chest
      pain.

      Introduction:

      Chest pain is the leading cause of urgent admission to the Emergency Department (ED) in
      western countries.Acute Coronary Syndrome(ACS) continues to be among the most difficult to
      predict or diagnose. Misdiagnoses may lead to discharge of patients with ACS, who should have
      been admitted as well as costly unnecessary hospitalizations of patients who do not have ACS.

      Objectives:

      To evaluate the usefulness of High Frequency mid-QRS analysis in identifying the ischemic
      patients out of all patients presenting to the Emergency Room (ER) with chest pain.

      Comparisons:

      A continuous High Frequency Mid-QRS recording will be performed using the HyperQ System (BSP
      Ltd.) and compared to clinical, electrophysiologic and laboratory results. The golden
      standards used to compare the methods will be either CT-Angio, Echocardiography or Cardiac
      SPECT. A follow-up inquiry will be performed after 3 months and Coronary Angiography results
      will be sought and compared as well.
