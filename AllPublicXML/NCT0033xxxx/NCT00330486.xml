  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether acamprosate (Campral) is safe and effective
      in treating alcohol dependence in individuals with bipolar disorder. All subjects in the
      study must be currently stabilized on mood-stabilizing medication. Half of the subjects will
      receive acamprosate in addition to their mood-stabilizing medication; control subjects will
      be maintained on their mood-stabilizing medication alone. Measures of alcohol use as well as
      mood stability will be obtained weekly throughout the active phase of the study.
