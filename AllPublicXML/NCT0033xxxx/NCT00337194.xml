  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies the side effects and how well giving monoclonal
      antibody SGN-30 together with combination chemotherapy works in treating patients with
      Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned after a period of improvement or did not respond to
      previous treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as SGN-30, may interfere with the ability of
      cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine
      hydrochloride, vinorelbine tartrate, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving monoclonal antibody SGN-30 together with combination
      chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells and shrink tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the complete and partial response rates following treatment with the
      anti-cluster of differentiation (CD) 30 antibody, SGN-30 (monoclonal antibody SGN-30), and
      gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride), vinorelbine (vinorelbine tartrate), and pegylated
      liposomal doxorubicin (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride) (GVD) in patients with
      relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).

      II. To assess time to progression and overall survival in patients treated with SGN-30 and
      GVD in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).

      III. To evaluate the toxicity of SGN-30 in combination with GVD in patients with relapsed and
      refractory HL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of SGN-30 when combined with GVD chemotherapy.

      II. To correlate soluble (s) CD30 levels with response to treatment. III. To determine the
      incidence of human anti-chimeric antibodies (HACA) formation following repetitive SGN-30
      dosing.

      IV. To correlate Fc gamma receptor polymorphisms with response to treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Part 1 (closed to accrual as of 5/18/2007): Patients receive monoclonal antibody SGN-30
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours, vinorelbine tartrate IV over 6-10 minutes, gemcitabine
      hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes, and pegylated doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome IV over 90
      minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days until 10 out of 16 patients complete
      1 course in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Subsequent patients receive treatment on
      part 2.

      Part 2: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive monoclonal antibody SGN-30 IV over 2 hours, vinorelbine tartrate IV
      over 6-10 minutes, gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes, and pegylated doxorubicin
      hydrochloride liposome IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8.

      Arm II (closed to accrual as of 12/4/07): Patients receive placebo IV over 2 hours,
      vinorelbine tartrate IV over 6-10 minutes, gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes, and
      pegylated doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8.

      Treatment in both arms repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: Treatment with SGN-30/placebo was stopped on 4/12/2007 due to pulmonary toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 10
      years.

    <description>The number of participants who respond (complete or partial) to treatment. Response was defined using the revised criteria for malignant lymphoma.

    <measure>Event Free Survival (EFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Event free survival is the time from trial entry until progression, death, or termination of treatment due to nonresponse. Patients who went on to receive a stem cell transplant (SCT) were not censored from the EFS survival at the time of transplant and were only considered failures at the time of relapse or death from any cause. The median EFS with 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method.</description>

        <description>Event free survival is the time from trial entry until progression, death, or termination of treatment due to nonresponse. Patients who went on to receive a stem cell transplant (SCT) were not censored from the EFS survival at the time of transplant and were only considered failures at the time of relapse or death from any cause. The median EFS with 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method.</description>
