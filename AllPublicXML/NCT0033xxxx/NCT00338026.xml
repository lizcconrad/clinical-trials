    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the
      recommended dose for future studies of ECO-4601 administered as a continuous IV infusion for
      14 days with 7 days recovery (21 day cycle) in patients with histologically confirmed solid
      tumors (high grade glioma, colorectal, lung, breast, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate). This
      study was also designed to determine the clinical pharmacokinetic profile, safety of multiple
      cycles of administration, and document the antitumor activity of ECO-4601.

             ECO-4601 (day 1, cycle 1)

          -  No other anticancer treatment during the study

          -  Patients can be receiving stable or decreasing dose of steroids within 2 weeks prior
             to patient's signature of the informed consent

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Patients registered on this
             trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre

          -  Previous Therapy

               -  Hormonal therapy: Patients may have had prior hormonal therapy provided it is
                  discontinued upon ICF signature

               -  Radiation: Patients may have had prior radiation therapy. Patients must have
                  recovered from the acute toxic effects of radiotherapy

               -  Previous surgery: Previous surgery is permitted provided that at least 2 weeks
                  have elapsed between major surgery (non-biopsy) and ICF signature
