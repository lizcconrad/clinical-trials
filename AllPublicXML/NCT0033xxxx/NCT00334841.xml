  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leptin, a circulating hormone expressed abundantly in adipose tissue, has been reported to be
      a satiety factor. In addition, it has been shown to increase during pregnancy in maternal
      blood, parallel to increase in body fat mass, to correlate with fetal body weight gain and to
      fall down to basal levels after delivery.

      Little is known about leptin levels in pregnant women with preexisting or gestational
      diabetes and their relationship with fetal and postnatal growth and perinatal complications.

      Therefore, the proposed study aims to understand and characterize the role of leptin in
      gestational diabetes mellitus as well as the relationship between leptin, cytokines and the
      pathophysiological complications during diabetic pregnancy. Specifically, we will evaluate 60
      pregnant women both in Germany and in Israel and evaluate serum levels and mRNA of leptin,
      cytokines (inflammatory as well as Th1 and Th2) and correlate them to maternal changes of
      body weight and birth weight in women of various degrees of glucose tolerance and with
      various degrees of metabolic control during pregnancy; relationship between serum and
      umbilical cord vein concentrations of leptin, cytokines and metabolic variables; placental
      expression of leptin, leptin receptor, selected cytokines, GLUT1 and 4 and relationship to
      leptin in serum and umbilical cord plasma; comparison between all above parameters of German
      and Israeli pregnant women.

      The results of this new and systematic study will shed light on the role of leptin and
      cytokines in the development of glucose disturbances during pregnancy and the perinatal
      outcome of women with gestational or preexisting diabetes mellitus.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        random glucose challenge test (GCT): 50 g of glucose are orally given at any time of the
        day. The results are considered as positive if the capillary blood glucose concentrations 1
        hour after the load are &gt;130 mg/dl. Those with normal results serve as control group
