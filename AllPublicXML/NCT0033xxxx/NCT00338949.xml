      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of ziprasidone treatment versus treatment with a
      standard atypical antipsychotic drug in improving insulin sensitivity and reducing excess
      abdominal fat storage in people with schizophrenia who are at risk for diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with schizophrenia often lead more sedentary lifestyles than people without the
      disease, and they are frequently treated with antipsychotic medications that cause weight
      gain. Combined, these factors produce an increased risk for metabolic syndrome, which can
      lead to heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Characteristics of metabolic syndrome include
      carrying excess weight around the abdominal region; high blood pressure; high blood sugar
      levels; high levels of fat in the blood; and low levels of HDL cholesterol. Recent studies
      have shown that certain atypical antipsychotic drugs are relatively weight-neutral. Switching
      from a drug that promotes weight gain to a weight-neutral medication, such as ziprasidone,
      may result in significant weight loss. There is insufficient evidence, however, demonstrating
      the extent of improvement in insulin sensitivity after switching medications. This study will
      evaluate the effectiveness of ziprasidone treatment versus treatment with a standard atypical
      antipsychotic drug in improving insulin sensitivity and reducing excess abdominal fat storage
      in people with schizophrenia who are at risk for diabetes.

      Participants in this open label study will currently be undergoing treatment with risperidone
      or olanzapine at the time of study entry. Upon study entry, they will be randomly assigned to
      either switch to ziprasidone treatment or remain on their current medications. Both groups
      will be treated for 26 weeks. Participants will report to the study site for evaluations
      biweekly until week 10 and then monthly for the duration of the study. The following outcomes
      will be assessed at study entry and Week 26: insulin sensitivity, using an intravenous
      glucose tolerance test; visceral fat mass, using a CT scan; and total adiposity, using a
      dexascan.
