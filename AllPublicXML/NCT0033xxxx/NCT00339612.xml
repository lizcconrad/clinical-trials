  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, prospective cohort study to describe the demographic, clinical,
      immunologic, and virologic characteristics of HIV-infected children at participating clinical
      sites in Latin American countries. Enrollment in this study will consist of approximately 500
      HIV-infected children in two cohorts who acquired HIV infection through mother-to-child
      transmission (MTCT). The first group will be a static cohort consisting of HIV-infected
      children who were five years of age or younger when previously enrolled into the NISDI
      Pediatric Protocol. The second cohort will be a dynamic cohort of prospectively enrolled,
      HIV-infected children who are five years of age or younger. We will characterize
      complications from both the disease and its treatments. Subjects will be evaluated every six
      months for approximately five years and assessments of growth, morbidity, disease progression
      and mortality will be made.
