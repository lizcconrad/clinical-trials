  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare the drug levels of artesunate and
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine found in pregnant women with malaria to those drug levels found in
      non-pregnant women from other studies. In addition the efficacy and safety of the study drugs
      will be determined for pregnant women and their babies.

    <textblock>
      The resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to anti-malarial drugs is a serious impediment to the
      control of malaria, and this poses a particular problem for the treatment of pregnant women,
      a group especially vulnerable to malaria; pregnancy increases the risk of disease progression
      and complications with up to a 10-fold increase in the malaria case fatality rate in areas of
      low transmission. As falciparum parasites can sequester in the placenta, pregnant women have
      been shown to develop recrudescence up to 85 days after quinine treatment, and are at
      increased risk of gametocyte carriage. Artemisinin-based combination therapies have been
      shown to improve cure rates and to delay antimalarial resistance. In humans the efficacy and
      safety of artesunate in the treatment of malaria in pregnancy has been studied in over 1000
      women in which no evidence of foetal harm was demonstrated. Quinine is the only alternative
      currently available in Mozambique for treating malaria in pregnancy however there is
      relatively little data available on its efficacy or safety. There is no published information
      on the pharmacokinetics of SP in pregnancy, however data show a marked reduction in
      bioavailability of artesunate and its active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin. Thus, we cannot
      be confident that the standard dosage regimens of SP and of artesunate are optimal for the
      treatment of acute uncomplicated malaria in pregnancy or whether altered pharmacokinetics is
      contributing to the SP-treatment failures observed in pregnancy. This study creates the
      opportunity to study whether the pharmacokinetic properties of SP and artesunate are altered
      by physiological changes that occur during pregnancy.
