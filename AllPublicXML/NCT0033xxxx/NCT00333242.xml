      In the proposed study, we will build upon our previous studies validating and characterizing
      hyperalgesia in MM samples to explore it's underlying mechanism from a pharmacological
      perspective. Utilizing a double-blind, placebo-controlled designs, the proposed work will
      evaluate the ability of dextromethorphan , an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-antagonists to
      diminish or reverse the opioid-induced hyperalgesia complicating the pain states suffered by
      MM patients. Specifically, in a sample of MM patients, dextromethorphan, theorized to
      interfere with the development of opioid-induced hyperalgesia will be evaluated for its
      ability to ameliorate or diminish the opioid-induced hyperalgesia in these patients as
      reflected by changes on pain threshold and tolerance to both cold-pressor and electrical
      pain, at peak and trough methadone blood levels. The results of this work will not only
      provide pharmacologic insight into the mechanisms underlying poor pain tolerance in this
      at-risk population, but also direction for the medical management of pain complicated by
      opioid-induced hyperalgesia.

      Addressing the undertreatment of clinical pain has become a national priority, with a central
      goal being to identify effective interventions for those subgroups of patients most at risk
      for suffering unrelieved pain (NIH Program Announcement PA-01-115). In fact, the
      undertreatment of pain was recently ruled a form of patient abuse with a California court
      awarding one million dollars in damages to the family of such a patient. Novel data
      accumulated by our investigative group has shown that patients maintained on the mu-opioid
      agonist, methadone, for the treatment of addiction, are significantly hyperalgesic to
      cold-pressor experimental pain as compared to normal controls. This diminished pain
      tolerance, in addition to the contextual prohibitions associated with providing known opioid
      addicts with opioid analgesics, makes them a population uniquely vulnerable to the
      undertreatment of pain. Unfortunately, little is known about how to best manage the pain
      suffered by the over 120,000 methadone-maintained (MM) patients in this country, in part
      because the hyperalgesia they suffer appears to be akin to neuropathic pain and
      opioid-induced.

      In the proposed series of studies, the Principal Investigator (a first-time R01 applicant)
      will build upon her previous studies validating and characterizing hyperalgesia in MM samples
      to explore it's underlying mechanism from a pharmacological perspective. Utilizing slightly
      different double-blind, placebo-controlled designs, the proposed work will evaluate the
      ability of three classes of medication (N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-antagonists, adjuvant
      anticonvulsant analgesics, and novel opioid analgesics) to diminish or reverse the
      opioid-induced hyperalgesia complicating the pain states suffered by MM patients.
      Specifically, in a sample of MM patients, (1) dextromethorphan, which interferes with the
      development of opioid-induced hyperalgesia, (2) gabapentin, which has proven efficacy in
      treating neuropathic pain, and (3) oxycodone, which has novel opioid activity, will each be
      evaluated for its ability to ameliorate or diminish the opioid-induced hyperalgesia in these
      patients as reflected by changes on pain threshold and tolerance to both cold-pressor and
      electrical pain, at peak and trough methadone blood levels. The results of this work will not
      only provide pharmacologic insight into the mechanisms underlying poor pain tolerance in this
      at-risk population, but also direction for the medical management of pain complicated by
      opioid-induced hyperalgesia.
