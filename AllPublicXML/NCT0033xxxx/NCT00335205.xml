  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that depressed patients who have not responded to their current antidepressant
      medication will respond to the addition of ropinirole to their current regimen at a rate
      better than placebo.

    <textblock>
      Most pharmacologic treatments of depression rely on serotonergic and/or noradrenergic
      mechanisms. Yet, evidence both from animal studies and from human trials suggests a role for
      dopaminergic pathways and particularly for dopamine D2-like receptors in the treatment of
      depression. In recent years, two new selective agonists of dopamine D2-like receptors have
      come into clinical use for the treatment of parkinsonism. Preliminary evidence suggests that
      these drugs might be useful as antidepressants. We are testing whether one of these agonists,
      ropinirole, is an effective augmentation strategy in depressed patients in a double-blind,
      randomized, controlled trial. We are recruiting unipolar and bipolar patients who remained
      depressed (modified Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score greater than 16) despite at least
      4 weeks of treatment with an adequate dose of antidepressant medication. Patients receive
      either 2mg of oral ropinirole or placebo twice daily added on to their current medication and
      are evaluated weekly over 7 weeks and are assessed weekly using two depression rating scales.
