  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prepare the eye for cataract surgery, drugs must be given to the eye to allow for surgery
      to take place. Traditionally, dilating drops and drops containing NSAIDs (to control
      inflammation) are given to the patient well in advance of surgery at repeated time intervals.
      As well, a gel containing lidocaine is applied to the eye just prior to surgery to
      anesthetize (reduce pain and feeling) in the area of the eye. Although effective, the
      procedure is time-consuming and costly for nursing staff. Recently, a few hospitals have
      reported success in mixing the pupil-dilating and NSAID drops with the lidocaine gel,
      creating an &quot;anesthetic dilating gel&quot;. Although success has been reported, there have been no
      studies to clearly demonstrate that the &quot;anesthetic dilating gel&quot; is as effective at dilating
      the pupil and reducing sensitivity of the cornea during surgery than the traditional methods
      of drops and gel. It is possible that the dilating gel is less effective due to slower
      diffusion of drugs into the eye. The study will compare the effectiveness of the anesthetic
      dilating gel with the standard pre-operative pharmacologic regimen for cataract surgery.
      Stability (maintaining effectiveness over time) and contamination of the study gel will also
      be assessed. If the dilating gel is shown to be as effective in regards to pupil dilation and
      corneal anesthesia, while maintaining stability and sterility over time, hospitals can be
      encouraged to use such a anesthetic dilating gel routinely during pre-operative procedures
      before cataract surgery.
