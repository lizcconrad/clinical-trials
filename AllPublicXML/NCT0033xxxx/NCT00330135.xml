      To demonstrate the difference in terms of symptomatic efficacy between ADANT® sodium
      hyaluronate and placebo following an intra-articular injection in patients with symptomatic
      osteoarthritis of the hip.

      Each patient will receive an injection of sodium hyaluronate or placebo in the symptomatic
      hip and will be followed up for three months.

      At the third month, if the score for overall pain is still &gt; 40 mm on the VAS, a second
      injection of ADANT® can be given irrespective of which treatment was received previously. The
      patient will be followed up for a further 3 months in an open-label fashion (monthly visits).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Primary osteoarthritis of the hip defined according to the ACR criteria;
             symptomatic, 2. Osteoarthritis of radiological grade II to III according to the
             Kellgren-Lawrence classification, using X-rays performed during the last three months,
             3. Overall pain intensity between 40 and 80 mm on a VAS of 100 mm at the pre-screening
             examination, 4. The patients experienced pain at least one in two days during the last
             30 days, it was resistant to paracetamol treatment at a dose of 4 g/day and a step 2
             analgesic or a NSAID taken for at least 10 days, 5. A prosthesis is not planned in the
             next six months.

          -  Major dysplasia (defined using Lequesne's criteria as dislocation of the hip),

          -  Treatment by intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid in the symptomatic hip
             during the 6 months prior to pre-screening,

          -  Another muscular or skeletal condition that could interfere with the evaluation of the

             handicap),

          -  Systemic corticosteroid therapy or intra-articular injection of corticosteroids into
             the ipsilateral hip or knee within the last month,
