    <textblock>
      Marginal zone lymphoma, one of the indolent lymphoma, is believed to be incurable with
      chemotherapy. Thus the investigators need a novel agent for marginal zone lymphoma.
      Gemcitabine has been tried as one of salvage chemotherapy regimen and has been shown to have
      anti-lymphoma activity. To the investigators' knowledge, there has been no trial of
      gemcitabine for marginal zone lymphoma. Thus the investigators made a plan to investigate the
      role of gemcitabine in marginal zone lymphoma.

      We designed a multi-center phase II trial of gemcitabine for advanced stage marginal zone
      B-cell lymphoma. Marginal zone lymphoma needs novel agent to improve clinical course by
      chemotherapy. Recent trials with new agents for indolent lymphoma shows promising results.
      Gemcitabine is known to have activity to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and has less adverse effects
      than other new agents. With this background gemcitabine will be tried as a single agent for
      advanced marginal zone lymphoma.

      Gemcitabine will be administered with 1,250mg/sq.m on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks. Response
      will be assessed by IWC criteria.
