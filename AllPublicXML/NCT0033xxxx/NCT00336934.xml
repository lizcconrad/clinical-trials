      RATIONALE: Pomegranate extract may keep prostate cancer from growing in patients with rising
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels after surgery or radiation therapy for localized
      prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized trial is studying how well pomegranate extract works in treating
      patients with rising PSA levels after surgery or radiation therapy for localized prostate
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the effects of pomegranate extract in patients with and rising
           prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels after surgery or radiotherapy for localized
           prostate cancer.

        -  Determine the effect of a daily oral dose of pomegranate extract on the absolute value
           of PSA and on the change in PSA doubling time in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Assess toxicities associated with daily oral dosing of pomegranate extract in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the effect of pomegranate extract on positive PSA doubling-time outcome,
           defined as greater than 150% baseline or a negative post-treatment PSA doubling time
           (i.e., declining PSA).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Patients
      are stratified according to participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral pomegranate extract daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo daily. Treatment in both arms continues for up to
           1 year in the absence of disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients will be accrued for this study.
