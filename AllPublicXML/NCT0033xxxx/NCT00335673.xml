      -  To evaluate control rate of Blood Pressure ≤ 140/90 mm Hg in non-diabetic patients, and
           ≤ 130/80 mm Hg in diabetic patients.

        -  To determine percentage of patients achieving blood pressure control according to their
           profile (naïve, switch, patient history, etc…) at the end of the trial.

          -  Patients who were receiving antihypertensive agents (maximum two - one of them is
             diuretic) and who in the investigator's opinion would benefit more from switching to

             7 days prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe hypertension (Systolic Blood Pressure ≥ 180 mm Hg or Diastolic Blood Pressure ≥
             110 mm Hg).

          -  Patients with secondary hypertension (for another cause other than type 2 diabetes
             mellitus).

          -  Patients with HbA1c &gt; 10%.

          -  Significant chronic renal impairment (Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL).

          -  Significant liver disease as shown by SGPT/SGOT (ALAT/ASAT) &gt; 2.5 times the upper
             limit of the normal range.

          -  Currently pregnant or lactating females.

          -  Women of childbearing potential not protected by effective contraceptive method of

          -  Any patient who is in need for a combination antihypertensive therapy from the start
             (from the medical point of view of his physician).

          -  Known hypersensitivity to irbesartan, other ARBs (Angiotensin Receptor Blockers),
             hydrochlorothiazide, or other thiazide diuretics.

          -  Patients with malignancy during the past 5 years, known collagen disease or severe
             cardiac, cerebrovascular or gastric disease.
