    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Endoscopic surgery is a less invasive type of surgery for laryngeal cancer and may
      have fewer side effects and improve recovery. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to
      kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether endoscopic surgery is more effective than
      radiation therapy in treating laryngeal cancer of the glottis.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying endoscopic surgery to see how well it
      works compared with radiation therapy in treating patients with stage 0, stage I, or stage II
      laryngeal cancer of the glottis.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the feasibility of conducting a large phase III randomized study in the
           future, comparing radiotherapy vs endoscopic excision in patients with stage 0-II
           laryngeal cancer of the glottis.

        -  Determine patient acceptability of the proposed trial design.

        -  Compare the effect of using dedicated head and neck research nurses vs general nurses on
           patient recruitment.

        -  Refine outcome measures, including voice analysis and quality of life.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter, pilot study. Patients are stratified
      according to participating center and T stage (Tis or T1 vs T2a). Patients are randomized to
      1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo endoscopic excision via CO_2 laser or cold steel.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 3-4 weeks. Patients
           undergo vocal analysis at baseline and at 6 months and 1 and 2 years after
           randomization.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at 1 year, and then annually for 5 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.

      Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
