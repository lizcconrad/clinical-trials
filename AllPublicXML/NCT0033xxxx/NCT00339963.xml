  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use genomics-based technology, such as DNA microarrays, to more precisely
      diagnose subsets of lymphoma, leukemia and multiple myeloma patients. There have been many
      attempts to classify lymphoid cancers in ways that will be useful for clinical diagnosis and
      treatment. Although broad diagnostic categories have been reliably defined, patients within
      each category have distinct clinical courses, suggesting that these classifications could be
      further divided into molecular (genetic) subtypes. For example, 40 percent of patients with
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma achieve long-term disease remissions following combination
      chemotherapy and are apparently cured, whereas the remaining 60 percent die from the disease.
      Similarly, some patients with follicular lymphoma develop aggressive disease within a few
      years of diagnosis, while others have stable disease over 10 to 20 years. Although the
      distinctions in clinical course of these diseases are recognized, there are no studies to
      determine the molecular (genetic) basis for this variability. This study will try to define
      new molecular diagnostic categories in these diseases and correlate them with clinical
      features, including treatment response, disease remission and overall survival following
      chemotherapy.

      This retrospective study will use clinical data and tissue samples from participating centers
      in the Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project LLMPP). New patients will not be
      recruited for this study.

      Biopsy materials, including fresh frozen or OTC-embedded lymphoma biopsy material, viably
      frozen samples of peripheral blood cells from leukemia patients, and viably frozen samples of
      bone marrow aspirates from multiple myeloma patients will be collected from pathologists
      participating in the LLMPP. RNA and genomic DNA will be extracted from the tumor samples. A
      variety of technologies will be used to characterize the genome of the cancer cells,
      including lymphochip microarrays for array-based comparative genomic hybridization; Southern
      blotting and PCR for translocation of genes previously implicated in these malignancies; and
      PCR and DNA sequencing methods for analyzing base changes in the genome of the cancer cells.
      Clinical information from the initial diagnosis to disease relapse will be taken from
      existing databases and/or patient charts. Gene expression will be correlated with the
      clinical data. If a small number of genes is found to strongly predict clinical outcome,
      quantitative RT-PCR assays using the Taqman technology may be developed as an alternative to
      DNA microarray analysis.

    <textblock>
      Current diagnosis of the lymphoid malignancies relies upon the morphological appearance of
      the cancer cells supplemented by a few molecular markers. Within a diagnostic category, the
      clinical courses and responses of patients to therapy are variable, suggesting that the
      existing diagnostic categories may harbor more than one disease entity. Recent genomic
      technologies allow a comprehensive molecular analysis of the expression of the genome in
      cancer cells. DNA microarray analysis of gene expression in lymphomas revealed distinct
      molecular subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and these new molecularly-defined
      lymphoma subtypes had divergent clinical outcomes. To extend our genomic analysis to all
      lymphoid malignancies, we have formed a consortium of cooperating institutions termed the
      Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project (LLMPP). The clinical centers participating in
      the LLMPP will send de-identified lymphoma, leukemia and multiple myeloma samples to the NCI
      for gene expression profiling, array-based comparative genomic hybridization and cancer gene
      resequencing. An additional site, The National Cancer Center Singapore, will send
      de-identified samples of tumor tissue from patients with lymphoma.

      Objective:

      Assess gene expression on a genomic scale in lymphoma, leukemia and multiple myeloma samples
      and its relationship to somatic genetic alterations.

      Eligibility:

      Diagnosis of lymphoid malignancy at one of the LLMPP participating institutions, including
      specimens originating at other clinical sites and submitted to LLMPP participating sites or
      The National Cancer Center Singapore.

      Design:

      This is an entirely retrospective study. All tumor biopsies containing malignant cells to be
      analyzed were obtained previously from patients diagnosed and/or treated at one of the
      institutions participating in the LLMPP or at The National Cancer Center Singapore.

      Clinical data will also be sent for the patients in this study for the purpose of correlating
      gene expression measurements with clinical outcome. The goals of this effort are to define
      new molecular diagnostic categories in these diseases that are clinically relevant and to
      gain new insight into the molecular pathways that are active in these malignancies.

      The home institutions providing clinical data and tissue samples have obtained local approval
      by their clinical research committees for this study.
