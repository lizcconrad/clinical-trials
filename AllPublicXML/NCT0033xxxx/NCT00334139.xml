  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bisphosphonates have been used extensively in the treatment and the prevention of skeletal
      complications associated with bone metastases in patients with breast cancer and prostate
      cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of zoledronic acid patients with prostate
      cancer or breast cancer and bone metastasis.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Prostate cancer with at least one cancer-related bone lesion with or without hormonal
             treatment.

          -  Breast cancer with at least one cancer-related bone lesion

          -  Negative pregnancy test at screening in case of child-bearing potential and
             Performance status ECOG 0-2

          -  Normal liver and kidney function

          -  Prior surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy is allowed. At least 4 weeks must have
             elapsed since the completion of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy to breast or
             bone.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with bisphosphonates within 6 months before study start, and during
             treatment with zoledronic acid. Known hypersensitivity to zoledronic acid or other
             bisphosphonates. Corrected (adjusted for serum albumin) serum calcium concentration &lt;
             8.0 mg/dl (2.00 mmol/L) or ≥12.0mg/dl (3.00 mmol/L)

          -  Current/active dental problems including

          -  infection of the teeth or jawbone

          -  dental or fixture trauma

          -  current or previous osteonecrosis of the jaw

          -  exposed bone in the mouth

          -  slow healing after dental procedures

          -  recent (within 6 weeks) or planned dental or jaw surgery (extraction, implants)

          -  Patients with clinically symptomatic brain metastases. Severe physical or
             psychological concomitant diseases expected to impair compliance with the provisions
             of the study protocol or impair the assessment of drug of patient safety

          -  Clinically significant ascites, NYHA III or IV, cardiac failure, clinically relevant
             pathologic findings in ECG

          -  History of diseases with influence on bone metabolism such as Paget´s disease and
             primary hyperparathyroidism and with need of treatment for osteoporosis (defined
             according to DVO, T-Score ≤2.5).

          -  Previous radiation therapy to bone (including therapeutic radioisotopes such as
             strontium 89) within 1 month

        Additional protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply
