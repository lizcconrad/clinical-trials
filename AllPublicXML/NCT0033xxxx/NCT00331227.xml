  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flavonoids are one of the many classes of natural chemicals found in a variety of foods.
      People with the highest flavonoid blood levels have the lowest rates of coronary heart
      disease. This is considered one of the reasons why high fruit and vegetable consumption is
      associated with lower rates of heart disease, although it is not known if taking a flavonoid
      supplement provides the same protection as eating fruits and vegetables.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if a particular flavonoid supplement, called
      Isotonix OPC-3, taken on a daily basis, will improve the function of arterial vessels.
      Arteries normally constrict after eating a high-fat meal. This study will examine the
      potential of the OPC-3 to lessen this constriction response. Approximately 25 people will be
      involved in this research project and participation will last for 10 weeks.

      We propose to use a supplement made by NutraMetrix (called OPC-3), consisting of oligomeric
      proanthocyanidins derived from grape seed, pine bark, bilberry, citrus and red wine extracts,
      to determine effects on endothelial function, lipoproteins and inflammation. The primary
      outcome measure will be endothelial function as assessed by digital response to hyperemia
      using peripheral arterial tonometry, measured both in the fasting state and after a single
      standardized high-fat meal, when transient dysfunction is expected to occur. Secondary
      outcome measures will be the lipid profile, hs-CRP, and Lp-PLA2. The recruitment population
      will be healthy volunteers. The design will be a randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind, cross-over trial lasting 10 weeks.
