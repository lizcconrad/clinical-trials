  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify changes in brain functioning which are related to
      reduced frequency and/or intensity of impulsive aggressive actions after treatment of
      PTSD-related impulsive aggression with either phenytoin or cognitive behavioral therapy.

      Objective One: One study objective is to evaluate potential effect sizes of phenytoin and
      cognitive behavioral therapy for PTSD-related impulsive aggression.

      Hypothesis: Phenytoin and cognitive behavioral therapy are hypothesized to be effective in
      the treatment of PTSD-related impulsive aggression based on studies previously outlined.

      Plan: Patients enrolled in this pilot study will be randomized to receive an eight-week
      course of treatment with phenytoin or cognitive behavioral therapy in the Trauma Recovery
      Program at the Veteransâ€™s Affairs Medical Center in Houston, Texas.

      Objective Two: Another study objective is to begin to attempt to delineate potential neural
      correlates of treatment-related reductions in PTSD-related impulsive aggression.

      Hypothesis: Potential neural correlates of treatment-related reduction in intensity and/or
      severity of impulsive-aggressive acts are hypothesized to include changes in: 1) thalamic
      activation reflecting more effective thalamic sensory gating, with anticipation of increased
      activation of the thalamus post-treatment 2) activation of brain regions associated with
      verbal information processing, with the anticipation of increased activation of these regions
      post-treatment 3) activation of prefrontal regions, including the anticipation of increased
      activation of the medial and/or orbital prefrontal cortex post-treatment, 4) amygdalar
      activation, with the anticipation of decreased activation of the amygdala post-treatment 5)
      hippocampal activation, with the anticipation of increased activation of the hippocampus
      post-treatment, and/or, 6) right-left hemispheric dissociation of brain processing of
      stimuli, with the anticipation of greater degrees of bilaterality of brain processing of
      stimuli post-treatment. Specifically, greater degrees of activation of left hemispheric brain
      structures are anticipated in post-treatment fMRI scans.

      Plan: Patients with PTSD-associated impulsive aggression will undergo an eight-week course of
      treatment with phenytoin or CBT. Treatment-related changes in impulsive-aggressive acts will
      be correlated with changes in brain activation comparing pre- and post-treatment fMRI scans
      utilizing a standardized Go-No Go task which has been used in the study of impulsive
      aggressive individuals.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Inclusion Criteria for both groups will be right-handed adult combat veterans over the
        age of 18 who meet criteria for PTSD via Structured Clinical Interview (SCID-I, First,
        2002) and Impulsive Aggression as the primary diagnoses. To be included in the study with a
        designation of Impulsive Aggression, patients must have committed at least three aggressive
        acts over the preceding three months meeting criteria for impulsive aggressive acts by
        Impulsive/Premeditated Aggression Scales (IPAS) criteria (Stanford et al 2003) based on a
        semi-structured interview of the patient and his/her significant other. An impulsive
        aggressive act is defined as a hair-trigger, non-premeditated response to a stimulus that
        results in an immediate aggressive act or an agitated state that culminates in an
        aggressive act, which is clearly disproportionate to the triggering stimulus. Inclusion
        criteria for both groups also includes the availability for participation of a significant
        other who can participate in the study. The significant other will need to accompany the
        study participant to the initial assessment interview and complete measures of aggressive
        acts which have been committed by the study participants in the three months prior to the
        start of the study, and aggressive acts during the previous two weeks at two-week interval
        follow-up visits throughout the eight-week treatment period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion Criteria for both groups will include exclusion criteria for MRI scanning,
             and known claustrophobia requiring sedation in the past during MRI scanning. MRI
             exclusion criteria will include metallic implants, implanted devices of any kind, such
             as a cardiac pacemaker, cardiac defibrillator, insulin pump, vagal nerve stimulator,
             cochlear implant, metallic splinters in the eye, ferromagnetic clips or metal in the
             head or brain (as from previous injury or head/brain surgery including brain aneurysm
             clipping), lead wires of any kind, clips or stints anywhere in the body, such as clips
             for arterial aneurysm clipping, stints in cardiac arteries or other arteries anywhere
             in the body, prosthetic heart valves, stapedial implants of any kind (implants in the
             inner ear).
