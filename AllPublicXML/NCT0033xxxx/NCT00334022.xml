  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to better understand the source(s) and the mechanism(s) of HIV persistence and to
      potentially lead to further suppression of HIV from viral reservoirs, we propose to examine
      the effect of co-administration of enfuvirtide, an entry inhibitor of HIV, on diminution of
      the size of the viral reservoir in infected individuals who are receiving effective antiviral
      therapy for extended periods of time (&gt; 5 years).
