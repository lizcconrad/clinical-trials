  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial was to examine the efficacy of a splinting
      (fabricated versus off-the-shelf splint)and exercise (nerve and tendon gliding versus no
      exercise) interventions to alter the clinical course of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS). We
      hypothesized that the fabricated splint with nerve and tendon gliding exercises condition
      would yield the best functional outcomes at 4 and 8 weeks posttesting.

      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to examine the efficacy of a splinting and
      exercise intervention to alter the clinical course of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS).
      Specifically, the aims of the study are to test the efficacy of: (1) a splint, positioning
      the wrist and metacarpal phalange (MCP) joints at 0 degrees in conjunction with tendon and
      nerve gliding exercises, (2) a splint positioning the wrist and MCP joints at 0 degrees with
      no exercise (3) a prefabricated wrist cock up splint positioning the wrist at 20 degrees of
      extension with tendon and nerve gliding exercises, and (4) usual care, a prefabricated wrist
      cock-up splint positioning the wrist at 20 degrees of extension with no exercise for
      decreasing symptoms and increasing function in people with clinically diagnosed CTS. The
      specific hypotheses of the study are:

      (1) Subjects randomized to Experimental Condition 1 will perform better than Subjects
      randomized to Experimental Condition 2; who will perform better than those randomized to
      Experimental Condition 3, who in turn will perform better than those Subjects randomized to
      Usual Care. In that order, Subjects will demonstrate a:

        1. Significant decrease in CTS symptoms as measured by the Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Symptom
           Severity Scale at the 4 week Posttest compared to baseline and further decrease at the 8
           week Post-Posttest.

        2. Significant decrease in upper extremity disability as measured by the Disability of Arm,
           Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire at the 4 week Posttest compared to baseline and
           further decrease at the 8 week Post-Posttest.

        3. Significant increase in functional ability as measured by functional sensibility (Moberg
           Pick-Up Test), grip strength (dynamometer) and pinch strength (pinch meter) at the 4
           week Posttest compared to baseline.

        Inclusion Criteria: (1) be at least 18 years of age; (2) have positive Tinels, Phalens, and
        complaints of nocturnal numbness and tingling. (3) English speaking. The exclusion criteria
        are; (1) have been diagnosed with a neuropathy other than CTS in the past year (2) pregnant
        (3) have had a steroid injection into the carpal canal in the past 3 months (4) have thenar
        atrophy (5) have had a prior carpal tunnel release.

        Exclusion Criteria: Pregnant women will be excluded from the study. There is an increased
        incidence of CTS in pregnant women; however symptoms usually decrease after pregnancy.
        Thus, it would be difficult to determine if the intervention was effective or if the
        symptoms resolved after the birth of the child. The physician will rule out pregnancy by
        patient report. Also, no minors will be included in this study because CTS is not a
        diagnosis common to minors.
