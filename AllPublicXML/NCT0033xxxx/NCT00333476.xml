  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a degenerative eye disease of the retina that
      causes a progressive loss of central vision. AMD is the leading cause of legal blindness
      among adults age 50 or older in the Western world. AMD presents in two different types -
      &quot;dry&quot; and the more severe &quot;wet&quot; form. Wet AMD is caused by the growth of abnormal blood
      vessels in the macula. Squalamine lactate is an investigational drug that may prevent the
      growth of these abnormal blood vessels. This study will test the safety and efficacy of
      Squalamine in the treatment of AMD.
