  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The large number of thyroid tumors that have occurred in areas exposed to high levels of
      fallout from the Chernobyl accident raise problems of public health importance, or regulatory
      importance, and of scientific importance. The over-riding priority must go to matters such as
      diagnosis, treatment of those affected and prevention, and International Agencies are giving
      financial and material help in these areas. However providing the needs of the patient are
      not compromised, it is very important to ensure that information that may be of value to the
      health of future generations is not lost. International agencies are again providing
      financial support for a variety of joint studies, some of which are based on studies of
      tissues from thyroid operations carried out as part of treatment, and not required for the
      initial diagnosis on which treatment is based. An international coordinated approach to this
      problem is not in place to help Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine to establish
      their own comprehensive thyroid tissue and data banks and to ensure that tissue and nucleic
      acids are used to contribute to the understanding of the consequences of the Chernobyl
      accident. This project has the support of the Governments of Belarus, the Russian Federation
      and Ukraine and the National Cancer Institute of the USA, (NCI), the European Commission
      (EC), the Sasakawa Memorial Health Foundation of Japan (SMHF) and the World Health
      Organization (WHO) have agreed to cooperate in supporting this project.
