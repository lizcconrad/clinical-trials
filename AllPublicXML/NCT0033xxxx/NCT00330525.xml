  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Control of food intake, size and frequency of meals are critical to the development of
      obesity. The stomach signals feelings of fullness after a meal and therefore plays a role in
      control of calorie intake. It is unclear whether the approved appetite reducing drug
      sibutramine changes the function of the stomach. Differences in the way individuals respond
      to treatment with the appetite suppressant sibutramine may also explain why some people lose
      weight while others do not.

      This single center clinical study aims to compare functions of the stomach in healthy,
      overweight and obese individuals, and to evaluate the effects of the FDA-approved appetite
      suppressing medication sibutramine on weight loss and stomach functions in patients who are
      overweight or obese. The effect of individual differences in inherited genes on weight
      reduction with sibutramine will be tested.

      Background: Control of food intake, size and frequency of meals are critical to the
      development of obesity. The stomach signals satiation in response to calories and volume
      ingested, playing a role in control of calorie intake. It is unclear whether the approved
      appetite reducing drug sibutramine alters gastric physiology. Genetic variations are
      potentially key to inter-individual differences in responses to treatment with the appetite
      suppressant sibutramine.

      Aims: 1. To compare gastric functions in healthy, overweight and obese individuals. 2. To
      evaluate effects of sibutramine on gastric functions and weight in patients who are
      overweight or obese. 3. To obtain preliminary data on the effect of genetic variation on
      responses to sibutramine.

      Methods: We shall measure gastric emptying, fasting and postprandial gastric volumes (using
      validated, non-invasive imaging methods), postprandial satiation and satiety, and integrated
      plasma ghrelin, leptin, insulin, GLP-1 and peptide YY levels before and after 12 weeks of
      sibutramine 15mg vs. placebo. We shall also collect DNA, to eventually study effects of
      candidate genes on response to sibutramine.

      Significance: Our study will provide the first evidence of the effects of sibutramine on
      gastric function.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Normal weight, overweight and obese subjects with BMI&gt; 18 Kg/m2 residing in Olmsted
             County, MN: Otherwise healthy individuals who are not currently on treatment for
             cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, hematological, neurological,
             endocrine (other than hyperglycemia not requiring medical therapy) and unstable
             psychiatric disease.

          2. Age: 18-65 years

          3. Gender: Men or women. Women of childbearing potential will have negative pregnancy
             test within 48 h of enrollment and before each radiation exposure.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Weight exceeding 300 pounds or 137 kilograms (due to limitations regarding SPECT
             imaging studies).

          2. Abdominal surgery other than appendectomy, Caesarian section or tubal ligation.

          3. Positive history of chronic gastrointestinal diseases, systemic disease that could
             affect gastrointestinal motility or use of medications that may alter gastrointestinal
             motility, appetite or absorption e.g., orlistat (Xenical&amp;#61650;).

          4. Significant psychiatric dysfunction based upon screening with the Hospital Anxiety and
             Depression Scale [HADS] self-administered alcoholism screening test (substance abuse)
             and the questionnaire on eating and weight patterns (binge eating disorders and
             bulimia). If such a dysfunction is identified by a HADS score &gt;8 or difficulties with
             substance or eating disorders, the participant will be excluded and given a referral
             letter to his/her primary care doctor for further appraisal and follow-up.

          5. Intake of medication, whether prescribed or OTC medication (except multivitamins)
             within 7 days of the study. Exceptions are birth control pill, estrogen replacement
             therapy, and thyroxine replacement.

          6. Concomitant use of MAOI inhibitors and other centrally acting appetite suppressants
             (since this would make them ineligible for sibutramine treatment).

          7. Hypersensitivity to sibutramine (since this would make them ineligible for sibutramine
             treatment).
