    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will carry out to assess the efficacy
      of GB-0998 in the treatment of the steroid-resistant polymyositis and dermatomyositis based
      on the changes in manual muscle strength (MMT) scores as primary endpoint, and in addition,
      to assess the safety of GB-0998.
