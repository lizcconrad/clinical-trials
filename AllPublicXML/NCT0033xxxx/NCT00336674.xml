    <textblock>
      In people with type 1 diabetes the beta cells of the pancreas no longer make insulin because
      the body's immune system has attacked and destroyed the beta cells. It is thought that
      exposure of the mucous membranes to insulin may cause act like a vaccine effect whereby
      protective immune cells are stimulated and these then counteract the &quot;bad&quot; immune cells that
      damage the beta cells. This study aims to determine if intranasal insulin can protect beta
      cells and stop progression to diabetes in individuals who are at risk.

    <textblock>
      Autoimmune diseases are the outcome of dysregulated immune responses to self-antigens. Type 1
      diabetes (T1D), previously known as insulin-dependent or juvenile diabetes, is an autoimmune
      disease in which the body's immune system reacts against and destroys the insulin-producing β
      cells in the islets of the pancreas. T1D classically affects children and young adults.
      Approximately 15% of people with diabetes have this form of the disease and no treatment is
      currently available to prevent it. Asymptomatic individuals in the pre-clinical stage of T1D
      can be identified by the presence of circulating antibodies to the islet autoantigens
      (pro)insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and tyrosine phosphatase-like insulinoma
      antigen 2 (IA2). (Pro)insulin is the only autoantigen that is specific for β cells and
      several lines of evidence demonstrate that it plays a key role in driving autoimmune β-cell
      destruction.

      The ability to use self-antigens as tools to induce protective immunity, free from the side
      effects of conventional non-specific immunosuppression, is the 'Holy Grail' of autoimmune
      disease therapy. Animal models provide proof-of-concept for such antigen-specific therapy.
      For example, in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse, a model of spontaneous T1D, transgenic
      over-expression of proinsulin in antigen-presenting cells in the immune system during
      development or in transferred bone marrow stem cells completely prevented diabetes. On a more
      practical and translatable level, immune tolerance to an antigen can be achieved by
      administering antigen to the mucosal immune system. Thus, immune responses to antigen are
      suppressed by feeding antigen ('oral tolerance') or by administering antigen to the
      naso-respiratory mucosa .

    <description>Recombinant human intranasal insulin formulation in a buffered solution of benzalkonium chloride and glycerol presented in multi-dose nasal spray devices with actuators (Pfeiffer) designed to deliver 100ul spray doses to nasal mucosa. The product is formulated at a dose strength of 1100 IU / mL (40mg/mL) manufacturing formulation. The product will be self administered by eligible participants as two 100 microlitre spray doses per nostril. Treatment will be administered daily for 7 consecutive days then on one day each week for 12 months. Participants will be followed until they develop diabetes or until 5 years after the last participant has been randomised (maximum period of follow up is expected to be 10 years.</description>
