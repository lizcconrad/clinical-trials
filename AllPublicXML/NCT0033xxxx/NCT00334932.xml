      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome and
      melphalan, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving doxorubicin hydrochloride
      liposome and melphalan together with bortezomib may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of doxorubicin
      hydrochloride liposome , melphalan, and bortezomib and to see how well they work in treating
      patients with relapsed or refractory stage I, stage II, or stage III multiple myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of doxorubicin HCl liposome, melphalan, and
           bortezomib in patients with relapsed or refractory stage I-III multiple myeloma.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall response rate, including complete, near-complete, partial, and
           minimal response rate, in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to response, progression-free survival, and overall survival of
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen at the MTD in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 30-60 minutes and melphalan
           IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats
           every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of doxorubicin HCl liposome, melphalan, and
      bortezomib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 4 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity
      after 2 courses of therapy.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome, melphalan, and bortezomib at the
           MTD as in phase I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 32 patients will be accrued for this study.
