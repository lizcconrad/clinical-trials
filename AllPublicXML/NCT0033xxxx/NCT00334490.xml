  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative pulmonary hypertension is a risk factor for right ventricular failure and an
      increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing high-risk cardiac surgery.
      Several treatments have been used to treat and reduce post operative pulmonary hypertension.
      Unfortunately none of these treatments are approved for use in this condition and only one
      (inhaled nitric oxide) is specific enough to pulmonary hypertension to not cause dangerous
      low blood pressure in the rest of the body. Sadly, inhaled nitric oxide is difficult and
      expensive to use, and can cause lung damage. Sildenafil citrate is quite specific to the lung
      vessels, is easy to administer and does not easily cause low blood pressure in other areas of
      the body. We hypothesize that oral sildenafil 12.5mg will decrease the baseline (pre-dose)
      mPAP by at least 20% compared with a placebo.

      Sildenafil citarte is a selective pulmonary vasodilator without profound effects on systemic
      hemodynamics making it an attractive option for treating post operative pulmonary
      hypertension in the cardiac surgical patients. It is inexpensive and feasible to administer.
      Intravenous as well as oral doses have been shown to reduce the mean pulmonary arterial
      pressure (mPAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in animal models as well as in
      clinical trials with adults with primary pulmonary hypertension and children after cardiac
      surgery . However, no data exists to support the safety and efficacy of Sildenafil citrate in
      the adult cardiac surgical population. The purpose of this study is to further investigate
      the potential role of Sildenafil citrate to treat post operative pulmonary hypertension in
      the cardiac population.

             including coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), heart valve replacement or
