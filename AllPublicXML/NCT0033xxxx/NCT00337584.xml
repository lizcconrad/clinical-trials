  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are studying whether providing patients undergoing day surgery the opportunity to have
      their medical history reviewed by an hospital internist before surgery leads to better
      results after surgery. These doctors are internal medicine specialists who are experienced in
      assessing patients going to surgery, making sure they are &quot;fine-tuned&quot; before their
      operation. We believe this will ensure the safest and best surgical outcomes. The study
      involves the patient filling out a 3 page questionnaire for review by the internist prior to
      surgery. Additionally, patients will receive a follow-up phone call one week after surgery
      asking about the experience at the hospital and a questionnaire in the mail three months
      later to see if the patient had any medical problems after leaving the hospital.
