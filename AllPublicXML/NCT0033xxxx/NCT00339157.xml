      1. Main objective: To test the efficacy of anakinra treatment in children or young adults
           with corticosteroid-resistant or -dependent Systemic-Onset Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis
           (SO-JIA)

        2. Design: Double blind, randomized trial testing the efficacy of one month Anakinra
           treatment versus placebo (2 groups of 12 patients each). All the patients will be
           treated with anakinra during the following 11 months and the dose of corticosteroids
           will be gradually tapered (= descriptive part of the trial to assess the tolerance and
           efficacy over 12 months).

        3. Hypothesis: 70% significant improvement after 1 month in Anakinra-treated patients
           versus no more than 10% in the placebo group.

        4. Main inclusion criteria : diagnosis of SO-JIA (Durban consensus conference criteria),
           age: 2 to 20 years at inclusion, active, corticosteroid-resistant or -dependent disease,
           no previous IL-1ra treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  SO-JIA (Edmonton's revision of Durban's consensus conference criteria)

          -  Age: at least 2 years and less than 20 years at treatment initiation

          -  Disease duration of at least 6 months

          -  Failure of corticosteroid treatment or requirement for corticosteroid treatment at a
             daily dose equal to or over 0.3 mg/kg (10 mg in patients whose weight is over 34 kg)

          -  Active and severe systemic symptoms and/or arthritis as assessed by an experienced
             pediatric Rheumatologists, with at least 3 of the following criteria when assessing
             Giannini's core-set items: 1) physician global assessment of disease activity of at
             least 20/100; 2) parent/patient assessment of disease effect on overall well-being of
             at least 20/100; 3) functional disability with a Children Health Assessment
             Questionnaire (CHAQ, Ref [9]) score equal to or higher than 0.375/3; 4) 2 joints or
