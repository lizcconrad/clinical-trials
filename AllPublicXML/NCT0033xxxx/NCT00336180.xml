      The purpose of this trial is to test the effectiveness of a classroom-based prevention
      program (HealthWise: Learning Life Skills for Young Adults) to reduce the risk of HIV/AIDS
      and STIs, as well as substance use, among adolescents in one area of South Africa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent estimates of the incidence of HIV among South African youth reveal rates to be among
      the highest in the world. Research shows that the sexual behaviors that put youth at
      increased risk for HIV often occur in the context of substance use. Consequently, effective
      prevention programs will most likely target both types of risk behavior. Research and theory
      also suggest that a positive youth development approach may be an useful way to reduce risk
      behavior. Therefore, our study involves the implementation of a classroom-based leisure,
      life-skill, and sexuality education curriculum, HealthWise: Learning Life Skills for Young
      Adults. This program is designed to reduce substance use and sexual risk behavior and to
      increase healthy leisure behavior and intra- and interpersonal skills.

      Students from 4 high schools are currently receiving the HealthWise lessons in the 8th and
      9th grades; students from 5 other schools serve as controls. Participants complete survey
      assessments on PalmPilots twice per year, until they leave school. Three cohorts of students
      are participating in this trial.

      Our hypothesis is that HealthWise participants will engage in less risk behavior than
      controls. This will be tested using various statistical methodologies, including multiple
      regression, structural equation modeling, and growth modeling.
