  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective for establishing the Rebif® Pregnancy Registry is to collect prospective
      outcomes data on women in the United States and Canada who have been exposed to Rebif® during
      their pregnancies. The primary end point will be the rate of spontaneous abortions in exposed
      pregnancies. This rate will be compared with the rate of spontaneous abortions in patients
      with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) whose pregnancies were not exposed to any interferon-beta in a
      manner consistent with the FDA August 2002 Guidance for Industry: Establishing Pregnancy
      Exposure Registries

      This study is a post-approval commitment to follow Rebif®-exposed pregnancies and compare
      them to non-Rebif® exposed pregnancies to evaluate rate of spontaneous abortion, fetal
      abnormality or pregnancy related health outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Rebif®-Exposed Group

        For prospective follow-up, women in the United States and Canada shall be eligible for
        enrollment in the Rebif® Pregnancy Registry as subjects if:

          -  They are pregnant.

          -  They received Rebif® for treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) within one week before
             or at any time after conception.

          -  The outcome of pregnancy has not been previously evaluated by any diagnostic method
             such as ultrasound. However, since ultrasound techniques are often used at early
             stages to confirm pregnancy, patients who have been evaluated by ultrasound for the
             purpose of confirming the pregnancy shall be eligible for enrollment in the Registry.
             The use of ultrasound and any inferences that could be made about the outcome of the
             patient's pregnancy will be reported on the case report form. Following enrollment in
             the Registry, diagnostic tests may be performed at any time during the pregnancy.

          -  They have not used Copaxone® for treatment of MS within the previous three months and
             have not been exposed to Novantrone®, Imuran®, Cytoxan®, Tysabri® or methotrexate at
             any time.

        Patients who have been exposed to an investigational product or procedure within the
        previous year may be enrolled at the discretion of the Medical Director. The enrolling
        physician should contact Serono's authorized agent, a company called Registrat, at
        866-997-3243 to request a review of each patient's situation.

        Interferon-beta -Not Exposed Comparison Group

        Women with MS who live in the United States or Canada will be eligible for the comparison
        group if:

          -  They are pregnant.

          -  The outcome of pregnancy has not been previously evaluated by any diagnostic method
             such as ultrasound. However, since ultrasound techniques are often used at early
             stages to confirm pregnancy, patients who have been evaluated by ultrasound for the
             purpose of confirming the pregnancy shall be eligible for enrollment in the Registry.
             The use of ultrasound and any inferences that could be made about the outcome of the
             patient's pregnancy will be reported on the case report form. Following enrollment in
             the Registry, diagnostic tests may be performed at any time during the pregnancy.

          -  They have not received any interferon-beta within 90 days of conception.

          -  They have not used Copaxone® for treatment of MS within the previous three months and
             have not been exposed to Novantrone®, Imuran®, Cytoxan®, Tysabri® or methotrexate at
             any time.

        Patients who have been exposed to an investigational product or procedure within the
        previous year may be enrolled at the discretion of the Medical Director. The enrolling
        physician should contact Serono's authorized agent, a company called Registrat, at
        866-997-3243 to request a review of each patient's situation.
