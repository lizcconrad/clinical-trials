    <textblock>
      Fruits and vegetables are rich in a variety of flavonoids with antioxidant properties. These
      compounds may be partially responsible for some of the positive links found between fruits
      and vegetables intake and higher bone mineral density in adults and children. Several animal
      studies have shown that consumption of onions (which are rich in quercetin), rutin (a
      quercetin glycoside) and resvatrol (found in red wine) inhibits ovariectomy induced bone loss
      in rats. One of the most studied flavonoids with respect to bone health is the soy
      isoflavones. However, consumption of soy products is relatively low in Western countries. One
      the other hand, a flavonoid such as hesperidin, found mostly in oranges is much more abundant
      in the Western diet. Citrus juice consumption has been demonstrated to prevent bone loss in
      male orchidectomized rats while specifically feeding hesperidin has been shown to prevent
      bone loss in ovariectomized mice and rats. However, to date no clinical prove has been
      obtained for these benefits.Therefore the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of
      hesperidin in preventing bone loss in postmenopausal women. This study is designed as a
      2-year, double blind, placebo-controlled, two arm, and parallel group study. The primary
      outcome measure is change in bone mineral density (BMD) while the secondary outcome measures
      are changes in bone resorption and formation markers as well as body composition. The women
      are randomised to consume 2 servings of hesperidin-rich food or food without hesperidin but
      with the same taste &amp; appearance (placebo). Subjects will undergo medical screening,
      anthropometry, physical activity, dietary assessments and BMD before randomisation into
      placebo or active group. Follow-up measurements are made at 3-month intervals (for blood and
      urine collection) and 6-month intervals for bone mineral density. Side effects are also being
      monitored during each visit.
