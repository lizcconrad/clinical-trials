          <description>Participants were administered an oral dose of 100 mg dasatinib tablet once daily for a period of 4 weeks. Initially, 3 participants were treated at one dose level. If no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed, the dose was escalated to next higher level. If a DLT was observed among 1 of 3 treated participants in the first course at a dose level, 3 participants were additionally enrolled and treated at the same dose level. If no further DLT was observed during the first course in these additional participants, the dose was escalated to next higher dose level. Dose was not escalated above 200 mg daily.</description>

DLT: any of the following considered related to dasatinib during course 1:Grade 3(dose reduction by 1 dose level)/Grade 4:recurring nausea, vomiting or diarrhea; any other Grade &gt;=3 non-hematologic toxicity except alopecia or fatigue;any grade toxicity requiring two dose reductions or participant's discontinuation; Grade 4 neutropenia &lt;500 cells/mm^3 for &gt;=5 consecutive days or febrile neutropenia; Grade 4 thrombocytopenia &lt;25,000 cells/mm^3 or Grade 3 bleeding requiring platelet transfusion.</description>

If a DLT was observed among one of three treated participants in the first course at a dose level, 3 participants would be additionally enrolled and treated at the same dose level. If no further DLT was observed during the first course in these additional participants, the dose might be escalated to next higher dose level.</description>
