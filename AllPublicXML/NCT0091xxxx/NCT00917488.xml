      The objective of this study is to determine the biologic activity of a Glycyphagus domesticus
      allergen extract in histamine equivalent prick (HEP) units, in order to be used as in-house
      reference preparation (IHRP).

      The skin testing procedure, based on the Nordic Guidelines is the reference method for the
      biological calibration of in-House Reference Preparations (IHRP). The method is not intended
      for routine testing of allergen extracts. The use of this procedure is the basis for the
      definition of biological activity units: &quot;the activity of an allergen extract is 10,000
      Biological Units (BU) per ml (10 HEP per ml), when the extract provokes an specific skin
      reaction in the median sensitive patient with a wheal of the same size as a wheal provoked by
      a positive reference solution consisting of histamine 54.3 mmol/l (for example histamine
      dihydrochloride 10 mg/ml), when both solutions are administrated using the same technique
      (prick testing) on at least 20 individuals who are clinically allergic and cutaneously
      reactive to the allergen concerned&quot;.

        Subject inclusion criteria:

          1. A documented positive case history with inhalation allergy (rhinitis and/or
             rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma) related to Glycyphagus domesticus.

          2. Positive skin prick test with an available preparation of the same allergen extract (a
             wheal major diameter of at least 3 mm) and/or a positive test for specific IgE.

          3. Mean of the areas of the wheals provoked by histamine dihydrochloride (10 mg/ml) ≥ 7
             mm2.

          4. Age ≥ 18 years and ≤ 50 years

          5. Subject can be male or female

          6. Subject must be capable of providing written informed consent

        Subject exclusion criteria:

          1. Subjects should not be excluded due to low or high sensitivity to Glycyphagus
             domesticus.

          2. Immunotherapy in the past 2 years with an allergen preparation known to interfere with
             the allergens to be tested.

          3. Use of drugs that may interfere with the skin reactions.

          4. Pregnancy, dermographism, atopic dermatitis (locally at the test site), urticaria.

          5. Any disease which prohibits the use of adrenaline (hyperthyroidism, arterial
             hypertension, cardiopathy, etc.)

          6. Lack of cooperation which may interfere with the study, or subjects with severe
             psychiatric, psychological or neurological disorders.
