  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive inflammation, production of free radicals and vascular injury are considered the
      main contributors to the development of organ dysfunction in patients with severe infections
      and sepsis. The endogenously produced unconjugated bilirubin is one of the most powerful
      anti-oxidants of the human body and the administration of bilirubin in animal experiments has
      been shown to protect from inflammation-induced death. However, bilirubin for human
      administration is not yet available. Therefore, we wish to exploit one of the side effects of
      atazanavir, a registered drug currently used as a protease inhibitor in HIV infected
      patients. Atazanavir inhibits the enzyme UPD glucuronosyl transferase enzyme (UGT1A1) and
      therefore increases endogenously produced bilirubin levels moderately. To study the effect of
      hyperbilirubinemia during inflammation we will apply the human endotoxemia model. The human
      endotoxemia model permits elucidation of key players in the immune response to a gram
      negative stimulus in vivo, therefore serving as a useful tool to investigate potential novel
      therapeutic strategies in a standardized setting. We hypothesize that atazanavir-induced
      hyperbilirubinemia has beneficial anti-inflammatory and vascular effects during human
      endotoxemia.
