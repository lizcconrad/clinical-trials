    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the effect of continuous levodopa infusion on autonomic
      nervous system in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD), blood pressure regulation and
      sweating. The investigators' hypothesis is that levodopa infusion may alleviate hyperhidrosis
      and orthostatic hypotension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders with
      increasing prevalence because of aging population. The main symptoms include rigidity,
      hypokinesia, tremor and impaired balance, but the disease also causes autonomic dysfunction.
      Motor fluctuations are common treatment related problems in PD, around 50-70% of patients
      treated with levodopa finally develop motor fluctuations. Continuous duodenal levodopa
      infusion has been effective in the treatment of motor dysfunction in advanced PD. However,
      little is known of its effects on autonomic nervous system.

    <description>Naso-duodenal infusion line is inserted in fluoroscopy control. Levodopa infusion is then tested approximately 5 days. If patient responds favorably to the treatment, PEG-infusion line is inserted in gastroscopy control and patient is followed in hospital for 2 to 4 days to ensure stability of the infusion line. The dosage is individually adjusted, starting dose is estimated from earlier oral levodopa dose.</description>
