  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to compare plasma protein profiles for SCI patients with/without
      chronic neuropathic pain in order identify biomarker(s) that are associated with this medical
      condition. Secondly, the investigators propose to identify a temporal relationship to initial
      SCI at which these biomarkers manifest.

      Our working hypothesis is that sustained alterations in specific inflammatory molecules are
      associated with chronic neuropathic pain following SCI, and that their plasma levels can
      serve as biomarkers to identify patients at risk for the development of neuropathic pain.

      Additionally the investigators are collecting skin tissue biopsy samples from patients
      following acute and chronic spinal cord injury to create vector-free human iPS cells from
      fibroblasts by direct delivery of reprogramming proteins.

          9. Diagnosis or treatment of cancer in the last 5 years

        B. Longitudinal, Prospective Cohort Patients:

        Inclusion:

        1. Initial traumatic SCI with deficit

        Exclusion:
