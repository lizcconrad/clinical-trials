  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Genetic research has implications for drug development and marketing. Race-based
           medicine may be able to provide specific treatment for populations with increased
           disease-specific morbidity and mortality. However, contemporary genetic research refutes
           the idea that races are genetically distinct populations, even as drugs designed for use
           in specific races are being promoted.

        -  Studies have shown high levels of public suspicion for race-based and personalized
           genetic medicine. Concerns related to not only the potential performance of race-based
           drugs, but also the motives of those offering these drugs. Many participants have
           suggested conspiracy theories in which race-based medicine was disguising an attempt to
           provide inferior medications or deliberately harm certain populations. Concerns about
           personalized medicine often have to do with privacy and other personal concerns.

        -  Public suspicions of race-based medicine, and to a lesser extent, personalized genetic
           medicine, make it important to examine and understand the theoretical and empirical
           literature on trust and health care.

      Objective:

      - To describe the perspective of participants evaluating the medicine offer.

      Eligibility:

        -  Males and females ages 18 and older who are visiting the John Hopkins clinics (primarily
           the adult care clinics).

        -  Participants must be able to take a literacy screen and respond to a short survey.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be asked to take a researcher-administrated literacy screen, read one
           of three randomly assigned vignettes, and fill out a survey. The first page of the
           survey will provide information about the study.

        -  Participants will respond to initial questions about demographics, experiences with
           discrimination, and trust in the medical profession and institutions.

        -  Each participant will receive a random vignette in which he/she will imagine him/herself
           being diagnosed with a common, chronic condition and offered a conventional drug, a
           race-based drug, or a genetically personalized drug.

        -  After being presented with the vignette, participants will be asked to respond to a
           survey that asks about their levels of trust in the vignette doctor, perceived respect
           given to the patient by the vignette physician, emotional response to the vignette,
           their belief in the effectiveness and safety of the drug prescribed in the vignette,
           information sufficiency, and their hypothetical behavioral intention to take the drug.

        -  Participants will be debriefed after completing the survey, and will be offered a small
           amount of compensation for participating.

      This study proposes to describe participants' attitudinal, emotional, cognitive, and
      hypothetical behavioral responses to randomized hypothetical vignettes illustrating the
      prescription of conventional, race-based, and genetically personalized medicine for a common
      chronic condition. This study is theoretically guided by conceptualizations of
      relationship-centered care and the risk information seeking and processing model. These
      theories recognize the importance of interpersonal influence within health care interactions,
      underscore the moral dimensions of patient-physician relationships, and describe the
      predictors of how information is attended to and processed. An experimental, mixed methods
      design will be used to randomly assign 357 patients at the Johns Hopkins clinics to one of
      three vignettes illustrating conventional, race-based, and genetically personalized
      medication offers. This study aims to examine the effects of the type of medication offer
      (conventional, race-based, and genetically personalized) and certain participant
      characteristics (race, literacy, background healthcare trust/experience with discrimination)
      on attitudinal, emotional, cognitive, and hypothetical behavioral responses; to determine if
      the relationships among the type of medication offer and the four categories of outcomes are
      moderated by race and mediated by trust; and to describe the participants' perspective on the
      vignette, through targeted open-ended questions.
