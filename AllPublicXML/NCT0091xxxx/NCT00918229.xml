      Primary Goal

      The study's primary goal is to assess the safety of the BioProtect biodegradable balloon
      implant and implantation procedure, in prostate cancer subjects undergoing routine radiation
      therapy (XRT) treatment. Safety of the BioProtect device will be assessed by reporting
      adverse events.

      Secondary Goal

      The study's secondary goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of the BioProtect biodegradable
      balloon implant in prostate cancer subjects undergoing routine XRT treatment. Effectiveness
      will be assessed in terms of increased distance between anterior rectal wall and prostate and
      noticeable reduction of isodose to the rectum.

      Primary Endpoint Parameters

      The incidence of unexpected serious adverse events related to BioProtect's SpaceGuard balloon
      implant and/or implantation procedure:

        1. Serious Adverse Events related to the BioProtect balloon and/or implantation procedure.
           Serious adverse event are defined as adverse requiring operation and/or associated with
           prolongation of hospital stay. Serious Adverse Events will be documented in Serious
           Adverse Event Form.

        2. Adverse Events related to the BioProtect balloon and/or implantation procedure. Adverse
           Events will be documented in Adverse Event Form.

        3. Subjective discomfort related to the balloon and implantation procedure will be assessed
           by pain analogue scale.

      Secondary Endpoint Parameters A 10% decrease or greater of the average rectal doses at V50 in
      at least 75% of the subjects after balloon implantation as compared to the doses at V50
      before the balloon implantation. This will be measured by routine Dose Volume Histogram (DVH)
      per local hospital practice and according to the instruction regarding anatomical landmarks
      delineated in this protocol.
