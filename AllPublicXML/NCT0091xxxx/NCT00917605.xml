  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project consists of two parts: Robotic Rehabilitation Trials, and Study of Outcome
      Predictors and Clinimetric Attributes. In the first part of study, the investigators aim to
      (1) investigate the treatment effects of robot-assisted therapy (RAT) in patients with stroke
      on various outcomes, (2) test the dose-response relations by using two different intensities
      (higher versus lower intensity RAT), and (3) investigate the effects of the training
      intensity on a biomarker of oxidative stress. Treatment outcomes will encompass the spectrum
      of functioning including motor ability, motor control strategies, basic/extended daily
      functions, mobility, community reintegration, quality of life, and biomarker (8-OHdG). In the
      second part of study, the purposes are to define the appropriate populations for RAT and to
      examine the clinimetric properties of clinical measures relevant for use in robotic
      rehabilitation research. the investigators will identify the clinical predictors that will
      potentially influence the functional outcomes after interventions. Finally, the investigators
      will examine and compare the clinimetric properties (e.g., validity and responsiveness) of
      the clinical measures of rehabilitation outcome to inform selection of test instruments that
      may detect clinically meaningful change after rehabilitation therapy.

    <description>Patients will receive an intervention for 20 training sessions (1.5 hours/day, 5 days/week for 4 consecutive weeks). The Robot-assisted arm trainer, Bi-Manu-Track (Reha-Stim Co., Berlin, Germany), will be used in this project. The Bi-Manu-Track enables the symmetrical practice of 2 movement patterns: forearm pronation-supination and wrist flexion-extension (Hesse et al., 2003; Hesse et al., 2005). Each movement has three computer-controlled modes: (1) passive-passive, with both arms being moved by the machine with speed and range of motion individually adjustable; (2) active-passive, with the nonaffected arm driving the affected arm in a mirror-like fashion; and (3) active-active, with both arms actively moving against resistance. Mode 3 is an active mode as in 2, but the paretic arm had to overcome an individually set, initially isometric resistance to allow the bilateral movement. The speed of movement, the amount of resistance, and the range of movement can be adjusted individually.</description>
