  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Venous thromboembolism (VTE) disease is very frequent, mainly as complications of medical
      diseases and surgical procedures. It has high prevalence and can lead to severe complications
      such as pulmonary embolism and postthrombotic syndrome. Although its incidence has been
      decreasing in recent years, the EP and DVT is still a major public health problem, especially
      in advanced age.

      The tracking of this disease through imaging tests in asymptomatic patients does not seem to
      be a cost-effective, further treatment of complications is expensive and subject to no
      satisfactory answers are not completely effective in regard to late complications. Therefore,
      according CAIAFA &amp; BASTOS (2002), effective prophylaxis is the best strategy.

      The type of prevention to be used should be based on the risk of developing VTE, ie low,
      medium or high. Framework for a category of risk for the indication of prophylaxis, each
      patient should be evaluated individually and carefully to the risk of developing VTE. Maffei
      et al. (2005) describe the &quot;Standards for Clinical Guideline for the prevention, diagnosis
      and treatment of deep vein thrombosis.&quot; According to the guide, the concentration of heparin
      in 5.000UI is indicated for cases of moderate-risk surgeries. Are classified as &quot;moderate
      risk&quot; to more surgery (general, gynecological and urological) in patients 40 to 60 years
      without additional risk factors, and the magnitude of any surgery in patients under 40 years
      of age who use estrogen ( Annex 01). The dosing schedule chosen in this study also follows
      the recommendation of the guide and is universally used .

      According to Maffei et al. (2005), the diagnosis of VTE must be initiated by the history and
      physical examination, and then must be performed ultrasound Doppler of lower limbs. Thus, the
      ultra-sonography/doppler examination will be done at the beginning and end of treatment and
      physical examination will be done periodically throughout the period of monitoring.

      Following the guidelines proposed by the literature consulted, was established to test this
      methodology, which aims to demonstrate the non inferiority clinical heparin sodium 5.000UI /
      0.25 mL sodium heparin on 5.000UI / 1.0 mL, both produced by Blausiegel Industry and Trade
      Ltda. in reducing the incidence of VTE. The two formulations are produced from the same
      material, but have different drug concentrations. Thus, there is a need to scientifically
      prove that the therapeutic activity and safety of the product test is non-inferior to the
      comparator drug (APP heparina - 5.000 USP/mL), allowing the sponsoring company to obtain the
      registration of the product in the concentration of 5000UI /0.25 mL in ANVISA at the proposed
      therapeutic indication in the study.
