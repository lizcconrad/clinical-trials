      This study will investigate the additive effect of montelukast (MK0476) taken along with
      inhaled beclomethasone versus inhaled beclomethasone alone.

    <measure>Mean Percent Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) in Patients With Chronic Asthma</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline &amp; over 16 weeks for the Beclomethasone (Beclo) and Montelukast (MK) + Beclo groups and over last 10 weeks for the Placebo and MK groups</time_frame>
    <description>Mean percent change from baseline in FEV1 in patients with chronic asthma averaged over 16 weeks for the Beclo and MK+ Beclo groups and averaged over last 10 weeks for the Placebo and MK groups</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Daytime Symptom Score on the Daytime Asthma Symptoms Diary in Patients With Chronic Asthma</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline &amp; over 16 weeks for the Beclo and MK + Beclo groups and over last 10 weeks for the Placebo and MK groups</time_frame>
    <description>The daily daytime symptom score was determined by averaging the daily scores (the patient scored his/her symptoms [from 0 (best) to 6 (worst)] on a daily basis.) for the four questions on the Daytime Asthma Symptoms Diary.
The average daytime symptom score for the visit was determined by averaging the daily symptom scores over all days between two consecutive visits.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Percent Change From Baseline in Total Daily Beta-agonist Medication Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline &amp; over 16 weeks for the Beclo and MK + Beclo groups and over last 10 weeks for the Placebo and MK groups</time_frame>
    <description>Beta-agonist medication use from the daytime and overnight asthma symptoms diaries for each 24-hour period was added to determine the daily total number of puffs used. The average daily number of puffs for the visit was determined as the average daily number of puffs over all days between consecutive visits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Morning Peak Flow Rate (PEFR) in Patients With Chronic Asthma</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline &amp; over 16 weeks for the Beclo and MK + Beclo groups and over last 10 weeks for the Placebo and MK groups</time_frame>
    <description>Morning PEFR was measured in triplicate immediately upon arising before taking any medication and the best value recorded on the overnight asthma symptoms diary. The mean morning PEFR for the visit was determined by averaging all valid PEFR measurements for the days between consecutive visits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Nocturnal Asthma Score on the Overnight Asthma Symptoms Diary in Nocturnal Asthmatic Patients Only</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline &amp; over 16 weeks for the Beclo and MK + Beclo groups and over last 10 weeks for the Placebo and MK groups</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline in Nocturnal asthma score; the patient scored his/her symptoms [from 0 (best) to 3 (worst)] on a daily basis. Responses to the question, &quot;Did you wake up with asthma symptoms?&quot; (no, once, more than once, awake &quot;all night&quot;), were assigned numerical values (0, 1, 2, 3, respectively).
The average score for the visit was determined by averaging the daily scores over all days between consecutive visits.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Patients were recruited at 22 sites in the United States (US) and 48 sites in 16 other countries in North America, Europe, Africa, Australia, and Southeast Asia.
Publication incorrectly listed 18 participating countries. Results posting is correct with 17 countries.
Prime therapy period: March 1995 to April 1996.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Patients received inhaled beclomethasone (200 μg twice daily) starting at the Prestudy Visit and continuing through the single-blind run-in period. Patients who experienced worsening asthma requiring more than albuterol therapy (inhaled or nebulized) did not qualify for randomization.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>The daily daytime symptom score was determined by averaging the daily scores (the patient scored his/her symptoms [from 0 (best) to 6 (worst)] on a daily basis.) for the four questions on the Daytime Asthma Symptoms Diary.
The average daytime symptom score for the visit was determined by averaging the daily symptom scores over all days between two consecutive visits.</description>
