      Endotracheal Intubation (ETI) is done to place a plastic tube in a patient's trachea
      (windpipe) to assist with breathing. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are
      the sickest of patients and the majority of them require this life saving procedure. A
      critical illness can be sudden and ETI required urgently. The doctors performing ETI in these
      situations may not be experts at ETI. Studies have shown that if it takes more than one
      attempt to get the tube in the right position patients can have severe complications such as:
      decrease level of oxygen in the body, decrease blood pressure, and cardiac arrest. These
      complications can be life threatening and increase the length of time spent in an ICU.

      To perform ETI the doctor uses a metal tool called a laryngoscope that is placed through the
      patient's mouth to open the throat and then pass the tube into the trachea. The type of
      procedure that has been used for many years is called Direct Laryngoscopy (DL) which means
      that the doctor looks through the mouth directly into the throat. Newer technology is
      available and can be used at VGH called Video Laryngoscopy (VL). With VL there is a camera on
      the end of the laryngoscope and a video image is displayed on a monitor making it easier to
      see the entrance to the trachea. VL is not available for all cases at VGH and is unavailable
      in many other hospitals.

      In this study we will compare DL to VL. Patients will be randomly placed in one of two
      groups: first attempt at ETI done with DL or first attempt of ETI done with DL. Patients will
      only be considered eligible for this study if the doctor feels that either DL or VL would be
      appropriate for the patient. In this pilot study we hope show that conducting a larger study
      would be feasible. If a larger study were to show that VL decreases complications and
      shortens length of ICU stay we would be able to recommend this procedure for all ETI at VGH
      as well as other hospitals where it currently may not be available.

      Hypothesis: In this study, we hypothesize that videolaryngoscopy (VL) is associated with a
      decreased risk of intubation failure compared to direct laryngoscopy in the critically ill.
      We also hypothesize that VL is associated with fewer number of intubation attempts and
      decreased risk of complications compared to DL.

      Background: In the critically ill, endotracheal intubation is a high-risk procedure with
      complications occurring in up to 54% of patients. Our own published work has demonstrated
      that more than one attempt at intubation occurred in 33% of patients and was associated with
      a three-fold increased risk of severe complications. VL provides a superior laryngeal view
      when compared to DL which may translate into less failed intubations, and resultant decreased
      complications.

      Specific objectives:

        1. Determine point estimates for failure to intubate on the first attempt, which can then
           be used to power a larger efficacy trial examining VL vs. DL in the critically ill.

        2. Compare VL vs. DL on risk of intubation failure (as defined by one than more attempt)

        3. Compare VL vs. DL on number of attempts at endotracheal intubation, time-to-intubate,
           and risk of complications.

      Methods:

        1. Design: Single center, randomized-controlled pilot study

        2. Patients: Forty critically ill patients requiring urgent endotracheal intubation (within
           30 minutes) by the intensive care team.

        3. Intervention: Patients will be randomized to initial attempt at intubation by VL vs DL.

        4. Power Calculation: Given this is a pilot study to generate point estimates, power
           calculations have not been performed. However, 20 patients in each arm will provide a
           robust point estimate that can be used to power a future efficacy study.

        5. Analysis: Data will be analyzed in an intention-to-treat fashion. Our primary objective,
           failure to intubate on the first attempt, will be analyzed using Fisher's exact test.
           This test will also be used to analyze the risk of complications comparing VL to DL.
           Number of attempts at intubation and time-to-intubation will be analyzed using a
           Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

        6. Potential Pitfalls: As slow recruitment is always a concern, we conservatively estimate
           that 5 patients will be enrolled per month, thus requiring a total of 8 months for
           patient accrual.

      Significance: If VL results in fewer complications during endotracheal intubation, then this
      technique may become widely adopted for this high risk procedure. Furthermore, in many
      centers, anesthesiology support for airway management of the critically ill may be limited,
      if at all present. Thus, the impact of this research may be even more applicable outside of
      the tertiary teaching centers where airway management expertise is readily available.
