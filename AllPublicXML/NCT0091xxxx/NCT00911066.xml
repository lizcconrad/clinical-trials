    <textblock>
      An open-label, multicenter, phase 1, dose escalation study of MLN4924 in adult patients with
      acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), high-grade myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The patient
      population will consist of adults previously diagnosed with AML including high-grade MDS for
      which standard curative, life-prolonging treatment does not exist or is no longer effective.
