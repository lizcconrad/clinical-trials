          <description>Frequency-urgency sum is total USS ratings recorded for all micturitions in 24-hour day. Number of USS ratings per 24 hours is sum of all USS ratings divided by the total diary days collected at that visit. USS scale: 1=No feeling of urgency to 5=Unable to hold: leak urine. Numerical decrease indicates improvement.</description>

Each item rated by participant on Likert scale 1 (least symptom bother) to 6 (most symptom bother). Symptom bother score derived as sum of scores for questions 1-8; lowest possible raw score: 8; highest possible score: 48. Data analyzed based on transformation of the score to a 0 to 100 scale [(Actual total raw score – lowest possible value of raw score)/range]*100.
