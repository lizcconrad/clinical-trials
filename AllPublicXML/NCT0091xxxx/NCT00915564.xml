  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of steady-state (constant concentration
      of medication in the blood) TMC435 (150 mg, once a day) on the steady state pharmacokinetics
      (what the body does to the medication) of R- and S-methadone.

    <textblock>
      This is an open label (all people know the identity of the intervention) drug-drug
      interaction (TMC435 versus methadone) study. Approximately 12 hepatitis C virus-negative
      opioid-dependent participants on stable maintenance therapy (for at least 30 days before
      screening) will be enrolled in the study. The study will consist of 3 phases: 1) Run-in
      phase: during this phase, participants will take individualized (dose of methadone will be
      adjusted for each participant between a range of 30 and 150 mg daily) dose of methadone from
      Day -14 (14 days before the first intake of TMC435) till Day -1 (1 day before the first
      intake of TMC435), which will be supervised by the medical staff. 2) 7 days treatment phase:
      during this phase, the participants will take 150 mg dose of TMC435 once daily from Day 1 to
      Day 7 orally (by mouth) plus the individualized dose of methadone which will be supervised by
      the medical staff. 3) Follow-up phase: during this phase, the participants will continue to
      take only the individualized dose of methadone for 30-32 days. Safety evaluations will
      include assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, cardiovascular safety,
      physical examination and alcohol breath test. The total study duration will be of 22 days
      excluding screening and follow-up phase.
