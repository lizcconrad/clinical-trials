      This is a randomised, controlled, open, two-armed, two-period cross-over, multi-centre phase
      II/III study to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of once-daily oral
      modified-release hydrocortisone in comparison to conventional thrice-daily oral
      hydrocortisone tablets in patients with adrenal insufficiency
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adrenal insufficiency is a disease with more than 80% 1-year mortality before the
      availability of synthetic glucocorticoids. Current replacement therapy has improved this
      dramatically, but recent data suggest that outcome is still compromised. Patient receiving
      replacement therapy with hydrocortisone or cortisone acetate have compromised quality of
      life, reduced bone mass, increased risk factors for cardiovascular disease and premature
      mortality that is more than twice the mortality rate in the background population.

      Circulating cortisol levels follow a distinct diurnal pattern with high levels in the early
      morning and low trough values around midnight. Using available formulations for replacement
      therapy this circadian rhythm is had to mimic and also during the active time of the day high
      peaks and low troughs occur.

      In this trial a newly developed novel dual-, controlled release formulation of hydrocortisone
      that has in healthy volunteers been able to mimic the circadian pattern of circulating
      cortisol was studied in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease).

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FIS is a subject-reported scale that qualifies the impact of fatigue on daily life in participants. It consisted of 40 statements that measure fatigue in 3 areas: physical, cognitive, and psychosocial. This 40-item scale evaluates the construct of perceived impact of fatigue on everyday life. Respondents rated each statement using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (no problem) to 4 (extreme problem). A total score ranged from 0 to 160. A lower value corresponds to better well-being.</description>

        <description>AUC can be used as a measure of drug exposure. It is derived from drug concentration and time so it gives a measure how much and how long a drug stays in a body. Participants in Arm 1 underwent standardised in-house PK sampling during 24 hours in order to assess single-dose PK of OD or TID regimen at the start of each study treatment period while participants in Arm 2 had a reduced PK sampling scheme of single dose PK on Days 1-2 and returned for multiple-dose PK sampling on Days 7-8. The data for combined arm 1+2 after multiple doses were reported.</description>

          <description>Css,av was calculated as the area under the S-cortisol concentration versus time curve during a dosing interval at steady state (AUCtau) divided by dosing interval (tau). Participants in Arm 1 underwent standardised in-house PK sampling during 24 hours in order to assess single-dose PK of OD or TID regimen at the start of each study treatment period while participants in Arm 2 had a reduced PK sampling scheme of single dose PK on Days 1-2 and returned for multiple-dose PK sampling on Days 7-8. The average of single and multiple dosing for combined arm 1+2 was reported.</description>

        <description>Tmax is the time after administration of a drug when the maximum plasma concentration in the body is reached. Tmax2 is the Tmax after second dose of study drug. Participants in Arm 1 underwent standardised in-house PK sampling during 24 hours in order to assess single-dose PK of OD or TID regimen at the start of each study treatment period while participants in Arm 2 had a reduced PK sampling scheme of single dose PK on Days 1-2 and returned for multiple-dose PK sampling on Days 7-8. The average of single and multiple dosing for combined arm 1+2 was reported.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Concentration Time Curve (AUC) Between Specified Timepoints of Total S-cortisol in Plasma After Single and Multiple Dosing During Part A</title>
        <description>AUC can be used as a measure of drug exposure. It is derived from drug concentration and time so it gives a measure how much and how long a drug stays in a body. AUC between specified timepoints included AUC0-4h, AUC4-12h, AUC6-12h, AUC12-24h, AUC0-10h, AUC4-10h, AUC6-10h, AUC10-24h, AUC(0-inf), AUC(24h-inf). Participants in Arm 1 underwent standardised in-house PK sampling during 24 hours in order to assess single-dose PK of OD or TID regimen at the start of each study treatment period while participants in Arm 2 had a reduced PK sampling scheme of single dose PK on Days 1-2 and returned for multiple-dose PK sampling on Days 7-8. The average of single and multiple dosing for combined arm 1+2 was reported. Here, &quot;N&quot;signifies the number of participants evaluable for this outcome.</description>

        <description>AUC can be used as a measure of drug exposure. It is derived from drug concentration and time so it gives a measure how much and how long a drug stays in a body. AUCtau is defined as AUC during a dosing interval at steady state. Participants in Arm 1 underwent standardised in-house PK sampling during 24 hours in order to assess single-dose PK of OD or TID regimen at the start of each study treatment period while participants in Arm 2 had a reduced PK sampling scheme of single dose PK on Days 1-2 and returned for multiple-dose PK sampling on Days 7-8. The average of single and multiple dosing for combined arm 1+2 was reported.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Concentration Time Curve From Zero to 4 Hours Adjusted by Dose (AUC0-4h/Dose) of S-cortisol in Plasma After Single and Multiple Dosing During Part A</title>
        <description>AUC can be used as a measure of drug exposure. It is derived from drug concentration and time so it gives a measure how much and how long a drug stays in a body. Participants in Arm 1 underwent standardised in-house PK sampling during 24 hours in order to assess single-dose PK of OD or TID regimen at the start of each study treatment period while participants in Arm 2 had a reduced PK sampling scheme of single dose PK on Days 1-2 and returned for multiple-dose PK sampling on Days 7-8. The average of single and multiple dosing for combined arm 1+2 was reported.</description>

        <description>The percentage of AUC0-inf that is due to extrapolation from Tlast to infinity (AUC%Extrapolation) was calculated by using the formula AUC%extrapolation = 100*(AUC0-inf minus AUC0-t)/AUC0-inf. The function of this parameter was to provide information about what percentage of the theoretical curve (AUC0-inf) was possible to determine experimentally (AUC0-t). Therefore, on average, it is expected that the residual area (AUCextrapolation) is not greater than 20%.

        <description>The SF-36 was a questionnaire used to assess physical functioning and is made up of eight domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and mental health. Transforming and standardizing these domains lead to the calculation of the physical and mental component summary measures. Scores ranging from 0 to 100, with 0=worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. A higher value corresponds to better well-being.</description>

        <description>FIS is a subject-reported scale that qualifies the impact of fatigue on daily life in participants. It consisted of 40 statements that measure fatigue in 3 areas: physical, cognitive, and psychosocial. This 40-item scale evaluates the construct of perceived impact of fatigue on everyday life. Respondents rated each statement using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (no problem) to 4 (extreme problem). A total score ranged from 0 to 160. A lower value corresponds to better well-being.</description>
