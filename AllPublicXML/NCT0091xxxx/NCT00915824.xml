    <textblock>
      Potentially inappropriate prescribing is common in older patients and encompasses overuse,
      misuse and underuse of medications. Potentially inappropriate prescribing is associated with
      negative outcomes including adverse drug events and hospitalization.

      STOPP (Screening Tool of Older Person's potentially inappropriate Prescriptions) and START
      (Screening Tool to Alert doctors to Right Treatment) is a new screening tool designed to
      detect instances of potentially inappropriate medication use and under-prescribing of
      clinically indicated medications in older patients. The purpose of this study is to determine
      whether clinical implementation of STOPP/START criteria in hospitalized older patients is
      effective in improving prescribing quality.
