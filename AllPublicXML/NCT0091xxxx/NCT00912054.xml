          3. Must be willing and able to discontinue use of any topical ocular medication other

             dosing regimen for at least 30 days prior to Visit 1, or an anticipated change in
             dosing regimen of medications during the course of the study.

         19. Use of ocular medications other than XALACOM® within 7 days

         20. Use of corticosteroids within 30 days of Visit 1, or any anticipated use of
