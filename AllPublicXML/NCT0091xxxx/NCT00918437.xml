      The aim of this study is to determine the postoperative course including effects on the
      quality of life following soft palate surgery with radiofrequency knife (RAUP).

      For the treatment of social snoring one common treatment modality is the surgical
      reconstruction of the soft palate. The procedure is a routine operation performed at nearly
      all Ear-Nose- and Throat departments in Norway. The surgery is done with local anaesthesia in
      an out-patient setting where the patients' postoperative observation at the hospital is
      limited to 1-2 hours. As the surgery is done in the sensitive mucosa and palatopharyngeal
      musculature the postoperative course might be unpleasant. The patients are therefore in the
      need of regular postoperative pain treatment extending into the 2 first weeks after surgery.

      At hospitals the uvulopalatoplasty is performed using a radiofrequency knife (RAUP) after the
      soft palate has been infiltrated with local anaesthesia (1% xylocain/adrenaline). The
      incision is done paramedialy to the uvular base and up into the musculature of the soft
      palate then making a smooth arch toward the pharyngeal tonsil upper limit. The then elongated
      uvula is amputated to about ½ cm. Occasionally, a suture is placed laterally and medially to
      lift the palate and prevent postoperative scaring. Coagulation is done if necessary with
      light bipolar diathermy.

      As the postoperative course might be unpleasant after RAUP it is of interest to study the
      time course and intensity of pain after surgery when using the standardised postoperative
      pain treatment at OmniaSykehuset. The result will be useful in future studies looking at ways
      to improve the pain treatment after uvulopalatoplasty.
