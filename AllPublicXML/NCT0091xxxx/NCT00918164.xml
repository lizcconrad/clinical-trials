      The purpose of this study is to estimate the bioavailability of PF-04457845 tablets relative
      to solution and evaluate the effect of food (fasted vs. high fat meal) on the
      pharmacokinetics of an oral tablet formulation of PF-04457845

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects or healthy female subjects of non-child bearing potential.
             (Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed
             medical history, complete physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse
             rate measurement, 12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests);

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs);

          -  Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject (or a legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all
             pertinent aspects of the trial;

          -  Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests,
             and other trial procedures;

          -  Willing and able to consume a non-vegetarian high-fat meal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing);

          -  History of febrile illness within 5 days prior to the first dose;

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy);

          -  A positive urine drug screen;

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for females or 14
             drinks/week for men (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer
             or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor) within 6 months of screening;

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives (or determined
             by the local requirement, whichever is longer) preceding the first dose of trial
             medication;

          -  12-lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 msec at screening. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, the ECG
             should be repeated two more times and the average of the three QTc values should be
             used to determine the subject's eligibility;

          -  Pregnant or nursing females and females of child-bearing potential;

          -  Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, vitamins and dietary supplements within
             7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of trial
             medication;

          -  Herbal supplements and hormone replacement therapy must be discontinued 28 days prior
             to the first dose of trial medication. Other exceptions may be granted by a qualified
             member of Pfizer study management;

          -  Unwillingness to refrain from consumption of grapefruit/pomelo or
             grapefruit/pomelocontaining products from 7 days prior to the first dose of study
             medication until the completion of the follow-up visit.

          -  Blood donation of approximately 1 unit (~500 mL) within 56 days prior to dosing;

          -  Unwillingness or inability to comply with the Lifestyle guidelines;

          -  Subject is the Investigator or sub-Investigator, research assistant, pharmacist, study
             coordinator, other staff, or a relative of study personnel directly involved with the
             conduct of the study;

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with trial participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             trial results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this trial.
