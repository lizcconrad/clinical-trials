  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is:

        -  To determine the efficacy of modafinil in the reduction of fatigue in patients with
           metastatic breast or prostate cancer undergoing docetaxel-based chemotherapy

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To determine the effect of modafinil on quality of life (QoL) during docetaxel-based
           chemotherapy

        -  To determine the effect of modafinil on patients physical activity level, functional
           status, number of chemotherapy cycles tolerated, sleep disturbance and depression,
           during docetaxel-based chemotherapy

        -  To investigate the impact of tumour type, patient physical activity level, functional
           status, sleep disturbance and depression on the efficacy of modafinil at improving
           fatigue and quality of life during docetaxel-based chemotherapy.

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of modafinil during docetaxel-based
           chemotherapy
