      The main purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of tigecycline versus
      clindamycin (including subjects treated with vancomycin) in pediatric subjects (aged 8 to 17
      years) with complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI), including those caused by
      methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects 8 to 17 years old. Children with bone maturation less than 8
             years old should be enrolled with caution due to potential risk of tooth
             discoloration.

          -  Have a diagnosis of a serious infection requiring hospitalization and administration
             of IV antibiotic therapy.

          -  complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) requiring significant surgical
             intervention or involving deeper soft tissue with the presence of at least one sign of
             systemic infection

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject with any concomitant illness/condition that, in the investigator's judgment,
             will substantially increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in
             and/or completion of the study, or could preclude the evaluation of the subject's
             response (e.g., life expectancy &lt; 30 days).
