  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A vibrating cold pack placed proximal to the site of immunization will decrease the pain of
      routine preschool immunizations when compared to standard care.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Needle pain is the most common and the most feared source of childhood pain, resulting in
      needle phobia for 10% of adults. Current standard of care for immunizations in the us
      provides analgesia 6% of the time. An inexpensive, immediately acting form of needle pain
      control could reduce needle phobia or vaccine refusal in the long term if demonstrated to be
      effective for immunization pain.

      This study will evaluate pain responses using video-coded FLACC scores for patients
      undergoing routine pre-school immunizations. Parent and patient pain assessments, as well as
      demographic information and pre-procedural anxiety coded from videos will be included.
