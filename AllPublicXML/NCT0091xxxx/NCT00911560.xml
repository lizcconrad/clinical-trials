  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and what effects, good and/or bad, treatment
      with a vaccine against neuroblastoma has on the patient and the cancer. In the first part of
      this study we found the highest dose of the vaccine that did not have too many side effects.
      We are now trying to find out what effects the vaccine has when given at the same dose to all
      patients.

      The main treatment in this protocol is a vaccine. It is called a &quot; bivalent vaccine&quot; which
      means it has 2 antigens. An antigen is a specific protein on the surface of a cell. The
      antigens are called GD2L and GD3L.

      We want the vaccine to cause the patient's immune system to make antibodies against the
      antigens. Antibodies are made by the body to attack cancer (and to fight infections). If the
      patient can make antibodies against the 2 antigens in the vaccine, those antibodies might
      also attach to neuroblastoma cells because a lot of each antigen is on neuroblastoma (and
      very little on other parts of the body). Then, the attached antibodies would attract the
      patient's white blood cells to kill the neuroblastoma. This protocol also uses β-glucan which
      is a kind of sugar from yeast. β-glucan is taken by mouth and can help white blood cells kill
      cancer. The best way to get the body to make antibodies against the 3 antigens is to link
      each antigen to a protein called KLH (which stands for: keyhole limpet hemocyanin) and to mix
      them with a substance called QS-21. But it is hard to get enough QS-21 so we are using an
      identical substance called OPT-821, which we can get easily in large amounts for use in
      patients.

    <description>This phase I/II trial in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) will in phase I assess the toxicity of escalating doses and in phase II the anti-NB activity of, and immune responses to, a vaccine comprised of the immunological adjuvant OPT-821 plus GD2L and GD3L covalently attached to the immunological carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and each abundantly expressed on NB. The patients will take oral β-glucan, which augments neutrophil cytotoxicity</description>

    <intervention_name>adjuvant OPT-821 in a vaccine containing two antigens (GD2L and GD3L) covalently linked to KLH</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients receive a total of 7 subcutaneous injections, at weeks 1, 2, 3, 8, 20, 32, and 52. Minor schedule adjustments are permitted, as needed, provided that there is a minimum of 6 days between injections. Induction of antibody response against the target antigens will be assessed. A fixed dose of oral β-glucan (40 mg/kg/day) is started at week 6 or 7(to allow time for generation of antibodies), and continued as approximately 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off, up to 1 cycle after the last vaccination. Neutrophils will be tested for glucan effects on cytotoxicity. Antineuroblastoma activity will be monitored using standard radiographic and bone marrow studies, as well as RT-PCR for measurement of minimal residual disease in blood and bone marrow. The treatment schedule may require minor adjustment as clinically indicated or due to unforeseen circumstance (e.g., due to PDH closure for holidays or due to inclement weather).</description>
