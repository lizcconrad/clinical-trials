  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, case-control study of 75 patients having undergone a
      robotic-assisted laparoscopic myomectomy were compared to patients having undergone
      myomectomy via laparotomy. Both groups had 3 or fewer fibroids confirmed by pre-operative MRI
      or on final pathology report. Charts were reviewed for surgical and post-operative variables
