  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents are at great risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) including the human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (CDC, 2000a; DiLorenzo &amp; Whaley, 1999). Though the CDC (2000b)
      reports that overall AIDS incidence is on the decline, there has been no comparable decline
      in the number of newly diagnosed HIV cases among young people aged 13-19, and young people of
      color are particularly at risk. Compared to the general adolescent population, adolescents
      involved with the criminal justice system are younger at first intercourse, have a greater
      number of sex partners, and lower rates of condom use, resulting in higher rates of
      unintended pregnancy and STDs (e.g., St. Lawrence et al., 1999). Alcohol use is commonly
      cited as a reason for lack of condom use among high-risk adolescents such as those involved
      in the criminal justice system (e.g., Morris et al., 1998) and recent data from our research
      suggests that it is heavy alcohol use in concert with sexual activity that is most strongly
      related to lack of condom use (Bryan, Rocheleau, &amp; Robbins, 2002a). The goal of this research
      is to design, implement, evaluation, and disseminate a successful HIV/STD risk reduction
      intervention that is theory-based, empirically targeted to adolescents, and articulated to a
      criminal justice setting. The study compares a sexual risk reduction intervention with a
      group motivational interviewing alcohol component to a standard sexual risk reduction
      intervention and a no treatment control condition. The investigators hope to show that: 1) A
      three-hour one-time intervention has the capacity to reduce sexual risk behavior up to one
      year post-release among high risk adolescents in detention, 2) A combined sexual and alcohol
      risk reduction intervention will result in larger decreases in sexual risk behavior than a
      sexual risk reduction alone, 3) The interventions will exert their effects through changes in
      mediators derived from a theoretically-based model of condom use intentions and behaviors,
      and 4) A sexual risk reduction intervention including an alcohol component will be especially
      effective for those adolescents with higher levels of existing alcohol problems. Finally,
      given proven efficacy, the intervention curricula and materials will be disseminated for use
      in adolescent detention facilities throughout the state.
