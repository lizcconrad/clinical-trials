  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of
      Interleukin-1-Receptor Antagonist eye drops for the treatment of corneal blood vessels.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Normally avascular, under many pathologic conditions, vessels may invade the cornea from the
      limbal vascular plexus. Infection, inflammation, ischemia, degeneration, or trauma, and the
      loss of the limbal stem cell barrier can cause corneal neovascularization. Growth of new
      vessels may result in corneal scarring, edema, lipid deposition, and inflammation that may
      alter visual acuity and is a leading cause of monocular visual impairment and blindness.
      Additionally, it results in the loss of immune response across the cornea, thereby worsening
      the prognosis of a subsequent penetrating keratoplasty (PK). Growth of new blood and
      lymphatic vessels from preexisting vessels are mediated by members of the vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family. This study is designed to investigate whether
      Interleukin-1-Receptor Antagonist is a drug that is both safe and effective in blocking VEGF
      pathways, stopping new growth, and reducing old vessel growth.
