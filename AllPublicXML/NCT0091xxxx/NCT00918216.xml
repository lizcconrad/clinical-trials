      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as laser spectroscopy, may help find and diagnose
      breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying laser spectroscopy to see how well it works in
      diagnosing breast cancer in women with breast lesions.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine whether laser spectroscopy of breast tissue performed ex vivo can
           effectively distinguish between benign and malignant breast tumors in women undergoing
           needle biopsy or surgical excision of a breast lesion identified clinically.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo tissue sample collection via needle biopsy or surgical excision of
      a breast lesion. A radiogram of the sample may be obtained to identify target areas for
      spectroscopic evaluation. The freshly excised breast tissue samples are analyzed ex vivo by
      fluorescence, reflectance, and/or Raman spectroscopy. After completion of the spectroscopic
      examination, the tissue samples are submitted for diagnostic pathologic evaluation.
      Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of the tissue samples are examined by light microscopy
      for histopathological analysis. The results of the pathological examination are then compared
      with the spectroscopic findings and radiological findings (if the biopsy was performed for a
      suspect lesion on mammography) to determine if any correlation can be established and which
      spectroscopic technique provides the most useful diagnostic information. Additional
      histochemical, immunohistochemical, and fluorescence in situ stains may be performed to
      support the diagnosis or to better understand the spectroscopy results.

      Patients' medical charts are reviewed to obtain clinical information (e.g., age, sex, and
      race; results of pathology reports and reports of ancillary studies, including estrogen
      receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER-2 receptor testing, for the surgical specimen being
      studied and for any other related surgical specimens; menstrual status and date of last
      menstrual period; clinical history of breast mass or abnormal mammogram and related
      mammography report; clinical history of hormone replacement therapy, birth control pills, or
      oophorectomy; and clinical history of chemotherapy or other adjuvant therapy for breast
      cancer).
