      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the
      medication), safety and antiviral activity to support dose recommendations by body weight of
      darunavir with low-dose ritonavir (DRV/rtv), in combination with other antiretroviral drugs
      (ARVs), in treatment-experienced Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 1) infected children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), study to evaluate
      the pharmacokinetics, safety and antiviral activity. Approximately 24 HIV-1 infected children
      will be enrolled in this study. The study consists of a 4-week screening period, a 48-week
      treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up period. Participants will receive DRV/rtv according
      to their body weight. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events,
      laboratory tests, physical Examination, neurologic examination, vital signs, and
      electrocardiogram. The total duration of the study will be 56 weeks.

    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The TLOVR algorithm was used to derive response, ie, response and loss of response needed to be confirmed at 2 consecutive visits and participants who permanently discontinued were considered nonresponders after discontinuation. Participants with intermittent missing viral load values were considered responders if the preceeding and succeeding visits indicated response. In all other cases, intermittent values were imputed with nonresponse. Resuppression after confirmed virologic failure was considered as failure in this algorithm.</description>

             screening of medical history or physical examination that, in the investigator's
             opinion, would compromise the subject's safety or outcome of the study

        <title>Number of Participants With Virological Response (Viral Load Less Than 50 Copies/mL) at Week 24 - Time to Loss of Virologic Response (TLOVR)</title>
        <description>The TLOVR algorithm was used to derive response, ie, response and loss of response needed to be confirmed at 2 consecutive visits and participants who permanently discontinued were considered nonresponders after discontinuation. Participants with intermittent missing viral load values were considered responders if the preceeding and succeeding visits indicated response. In all other cases, intermittent values were imputed with nonresponse. Resuppression after confirmed virologic failure was considered as failure in this algorithm.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
        <population>27 participants were recruited and received at least 1 dose of study medication; as Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements were not consistently adhered to at one site (involving 6 participant), analyses were performed excluding the participants from this site, resulting in 21 participants used for analyses.</population>
