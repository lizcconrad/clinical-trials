    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if participants with untreated locally advanced or
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer have a better outcome when treated with olaratumab in
      combination with paclitaxel/carboplatin then when treated with paclitaxel/carboplatin alone.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) in
      previously untreated participants with Stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      treated with olaratumab plus paclitaxel and carboplatin versus paclitaxel and carboplatin in
      the first-line metastatic setting.

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Measured PD or Death From Any Cause (Up to 31 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the day of randomization to the first evidence of progression by RECIST version 1.1, or death from any cause. Participants who died without a reported prior progression were considered to have progressed on the day of their death. Participants who did not progress and were subsequently lost to follow-up had their data censored at the day of their last tumor assessment. If there was no radiologic assessment at baseline or post baseline, participants were censored at the date of randomization. If death or progressive disease (PD) occurred after 2 or more consecutive missing radiographic visits, censoring occurred at the date of the last radiographic visit prior to the missed visits.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Death From Any Cause (Up to 31 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. If the participant is alive at the end of the follow-up period or is lost to follow-up, OS was censored on the last date the participants is known to be alive.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Measured PD or Study Discontinuation (Up to 31 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>The ORR is equal to the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response of partial response or complete response (PR + CR), according to RECIST version 1.1 criteria. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 millimeter (mm) and normalization of tumor marker level of non-target lesions; PR was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; PD was defined as having at least 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and minimum 5 mm increase above nadir; Stable Disease (SD) was defined as small changes that did not meet above criteria. Participants who had no post baseline tumor assessments were considered non-responders and included in the denominator when calculating response rate. Percentage of participants=(number of participants with CR+PR/total number of participants)*100.</description>

    <measure>Median Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>First Criteria Met for CR or PR to Measured PD Start of Other Antitumor Therapy or Death From Any Cause (Up to 31 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for Complete Response (CR)/Partial Response (PR) (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that the criteria for PD are met (taking as a reference for PD the smallest measurement recorded since the treatment started), initiation of other/additional antitumor therapy is first reported, or death, is objectively documented.</description>

        <title>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>PFS is defined as the time from the day of randomization to the first evidence of progression by RECIST version 1.1, or death from any cause. Participants who died without a reported prior progression were considered to have progressed on the day of their death. Participants who did not progress and were subsequently lost to follow-up had their data censored at the day of their last tumor assessment. If there was no radiologic assessment at baseline or post baseline, participants were censored at the date of randomization. If death or progressive disease (PD) occurred after 2 or more consecutive missing radiographic visits, censoring occurred at the date of the last radiographic visit prior to the missed visits.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Best Overall Tumor Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) Objective Tumor Response Rate (ORR)</title>
        <description>The ORR is equal to the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response of partial response or complete response (PR + CR), according to RECIST version 1.1 criteria. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 millimeter (mm) and normalization of tumor marker level of non-target lesions; PR was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; PD was defined as having at least 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and minimum 5 mm increase above nadir; Stable Disease (SD) was defined as small changes that did not meet above criteria. Participants who had no post baseline tumor assessments were considered non-responders and included in the denominator when calculating response rate. Percentage of participants=(number of participants with CR+PR/total number of participants)*100.</description>
