      OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the utility of the 6 telephone sessions (low intensity: LiTx) and
      8 telephone sessions (high intensity: HiTx) plus Survivorship Booklet designed to educate and
      improve awareness of the physical and psychological impact of cancer and increase knowledge
      of appropriate medical and psychosocial resources for women with cervical cancer. II. To
      evaluate the utility of the telephone sessions (LiTx and HiTx) designed to improve
      psychological functioning (decrease depression and anxiety) of women with cervical cancer.
      III. To evaluate the utility of the telephone sessions (LiTx and HiTx) designed to improve
      social functioning (family support and communication).

      OUTLINE: Patients are clinically assigned to 1 of 2 groups. GROUP I: Patients receive a
      survivorship booklet in the mail that contains information about cervical cancer. Patients
      then receive a follow-up telephone call at 3 months to clarify any issues relevant to the
      survivorship booklet. GROUP II: Patients are randomly assigned to receive either 6 or 8
      weekly telephone sessions that address managing medical issues, health education, and cancer
      resources; balancing emotions and managing stress; coping skills and problem solving; family
      and social concerns; relational, intimacy, and sexual concerns; and financial and employment
      concerns. Patients also receive a survivorship booklet as in group I.
