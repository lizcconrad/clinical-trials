    <measure>Change From Study Baseline in the Daily Average Number of Urinary Incontinence Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Study Baseline, Week 12 Treatment Cycle 1</time_frame>
    <description>Urinary incontinence is defined as involuntary loss of urine as recorded in a patient bladder diary in the 3 consecutive days prior to each study visit for study 191622-096 (or 3 days prior to each visit in study 191622-095 or 191622-520). The number of incontinence episodes are averaged daily during this period. The initial study baseline is obtained from the patient bladder diary in the 3 consecutive days prior to the first treatment in either study 191622-095 or 191622-520. A negative number change from baseline indicates a reduction in incontinence episodes (improvement) and a positive number change from baseline indicates an increase in the number of incontinence episodes (worsening).</description>

    <time_frame>Study Baseline, Week 12 Treatment Cycle 1</time_frame>
    <description>The I-QOL questionnaire is a validated, disease-specific quality of life (QOL) questionnaire containing 22 questions designed to measure the impact of urinary incontinence on patients' lives. Each question is answered on a 5-point scale (1 = worst QOL and 5 = best QOL). The scores are totaled over the 22 questions and normalized to a score of 0-100 (0 = worst QOL and 100= best QOL). The I-QOL total score is calculated by combining the 22-item subscores from the 3 I-QOL domains: Avoidance Limiting Behavior, Psychological Impact, and Social Embarrassment. The initial study baseline is obtained from data collected prior to the first treatment in Study 191622-095 or 191622-520. Positive number changes from baseline indicate improved QOL and negative changes from baseline indicate worsened QOL.</description>

The initial study baseline is obtained from data collected prior to the first treatment in Study 191622-095 or 191622-520. Positive number changes from baseline indicate a worsening in role limitations and negative number changes from baseline indicate an improvement in role limitations.</description>

    <description>The number of urgency episodes are recorded in a patient bladder diary in the 3 consecutive days prior to each study visit for study 191622-096 (or 3 days prior to each visit in study 191622-095 or 191622-520). The number of urgency episodes are averaged daily during this period. The initial study baseline is obtained from the patient bladder diary in the 3 consecutive days prior to the first treatment in either study 191622-095 or 191622-520. A negative number change from baseline indicates a reduction in urgency episodes (improvement) and a positive number change from baseline indicates an increase in the number of urgency episodes (worsening).</description>

A total of 829 patients received at least 1 BOTOX treatment in Study 191622-096 or in the preceding studies.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Following a planned interim analysis, the protocol was amended to remove the option to escalate to the 150U dose. The dose groups reflect the highest dose received (i.e. 100U BOTOX includes patients who only received 100U throughout the study and 150U BOTOX includes patients who received at least 1 dose of 150U at any time during the study).</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Study Baseline in the Daily Average Number of Urinary Incontinence Episodes</title>
        <description>Urinary incontinence is defined as involuntary loss of urine as recorded in a patient bladder diary in the 3 consecutive days prior to each study visit for study 191622-096 (or 3 days prior to each visit in study 191622-095 or 191622-520). The number of incontinence episodes are averaged daily during this period. The initial study baseline is obtained from the patient bladder diary in the 3 consecutive days prior to the first treatment in either study 191622-095 or 191622-520. A negative number change from baseline indicates a reduction in incontinence episodes (improvement) and a positive number change from baseline indicates an increase in the number of incontinence episodes (worsening).</description>

        <title>Change From Study Baseline in the Daily Average Number of Urinary Incontinence Episodes</title>
        <description>Urinary incontinence is defined as involuntary loss of urine as recorded in a patient bladder diary in the 3 consecutive days prior to each study visit for study 191622-096 (or 3 days prior to each visit in study 191622-095 or 191622-520). The number of incontinence episodes are averaged daily during this period. The initial study baseline is obtained from the patient bladder diary in the 3 consecutive days prior to the first treatment in either study 191622-095 or 191622-520. A negative number change from baseline indicates a reduction in incontinence episodes (improvement) and a positive number change from baseline indicates an increase in the number of incontinence episodes (worsening).</description>

        <description>The TBS is a single-item scale in which the patient considers his/her current condition (urinary problems, urinary incontinence) compared with his/her condition before receiving any study treatment in study 191622-095 or 191622-520. Response options are: 1 = greatly improved; 2 = improved; 3 = not changed; and 4 = worsened.

        <title>Change From Study Baseline in the Urinary Incontinence-Specific Quality of Life (I-QOL) Questionnaire Total Summary Score</title>
        <description>The I-QOL questionnaire is a validated, disease-specific quality of life (QOL) questionnaire containing 22 questions designed to measure the impact of urinary incontinence on patients' lives. Each question is answered on a 5-point scale (1 = worst QOL and 5 = best QOL). The scores are totaled over the 22 questions and normalized to a score of 0-100 (0 = worst QOL and 100= best QOL). The I-QOL total score is calculated by combining the 22-item subscores from the 3 I-QOL domains: Avoidance Limiting Behavior, Psychological Impact, and Social Embarrassment. The initial study baseline is obtained from data collected prior to the first treatment in Study 191622-095 or 191622-520. Positive number changes from baseline indicate improved QOL and negative changes from baseline indicate worsened QOL.</description>

        <title>Change From Study Baseline in the I-QOL Questionnaire Total Summary Score</title>
        <description>The I-QOL questionnaire is a validated, disease-specific quality of life (QOL) questionnaire containing 22 questions designed to measure the impact of urinary incontinence on patients' lives. Each question is answered on a 5-point scale (1 = worst QOL and 5 = best QOL). The scores are totaled over the 22 questions and normalized to a score of 0-100 (0 = worst QOL and 100= best QOL). The I-QOL total score is calculated by combining the 22-item subscores from the 3 I-QOL domains: Avoidance Limiting Behavior, Psychological Impact, and Social Embarrassment. The initial study baseline is obtained from data collected prior to the first treatment in Study 191622-095 or 191622-520. Positive number changes from baseline indicate improved QOL and negative changes from baseline indicate worsened QOL</description>

        <description>The KHQ is a disease-specific health-related QOL questionnaire that measures urinary incontinence. The role limitations domain consists of 2 questions answered on a 4-point scale (not at all, slightly, moderate, a lot). The initial study baseline is obtained from data collected prior to the first treatment in Study 191622-095 or 191622-520. Positive number changes from baseline indicate a worsening in role limitations and negative number changes from baseline indicate an improvement in role limitations.</description>

        <title>Change From Study Baseline in Daily Frequency of Urgency Episodes</title>
        <description>The number of urgency episodes are recorded in a patient bladder diary in the 3 consecutive days prior to each study visit for study 191622-096 (or 3 days prior to each visit in study 191622-095 or 191622-520). The number of urgency episodes are averaged daily during this period. The initial study baseline is obtained from the patient bladder diary in the 3 consecutive days prior to the first treatment in either study 191622-095 or 191622-520. A negative number change from baseline indicates a reduction in urgency episodes (improvement) and a positive number change from baseline indicates an increase in the number of urgency episodes (worsening).</description>
