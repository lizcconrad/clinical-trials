  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will examine whether an educational video increases patient knowledge about
      heart failure and the risk of sudden cardiac arrest and leads to greater satisfaction with
      information provided as compared to usual care. Additionally, the investigators will look at
      whether racial concordance (physician and patient being of the same race) improves
      satisfaction with the patient's treatment decision and disease knowledge. Our hypothesis is
      that a video in which participants are of the same race as the patient will provide better
      education and more satisfaction with the treatment decision and may lead to more patients
      choosing ICD therapy.

    <measure>Decision to Receive an ICD</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>At one week post-intervention, patients were asked what treatment option they preferred: ICD placement with medications; No ICD, continue with medications only; or unsure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional Conflict Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>one week post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>At one week post-intervention, patients were asked 9 questions from a modified decisional conflict scale to assess overall decisional conflict and three subscales (decision uncertainty; factors contributing to uncertainty; and perceived effective decision making). Overall scores range from 9 (no decisional conflict) to 45 (high decisional conflict).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Receipt of an ICD</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were asked (or medical records reviewed) to determine if patients did receive an ICD within approximately 3 months post intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Knowledge Scores About ICD Therapy One Week Post Intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>one week post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We assessed knowledge of ICD therapy prior to the educational intervention, directly after the educational intervention and one week later. The tool used was a 13 question tool on key aspects of ICDs, risks and benefits, and health conditions eligible for an ICD. Scores could range from 0-13, with higher score indicating greater levels of knowledge.</description>

        <title>Mean Knowledge Scores About ICD Therapy One Week Post Intervention.</title>
        <description>We assessed knowledge of ICD therapy prior to the educational intervention, directly after the educational intervention and one week later. The tool used was a 13 question tool on key aspects of ICDs, risks and benefits, and health conditions eligible for an ICD. Scores could range from 0-13, with higher score indicating greater levels of knowledge.</description>
