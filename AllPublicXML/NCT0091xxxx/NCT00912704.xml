  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a healthy, social and economic threat worldwide. In the
      past ten years, the incidence and prevalence of ESRD patients have tremendously increased,
      ranking at the top in the world. The reasons for such high incidence and prevalence are
      multifactor. Early diagnosis and closed monitor of the patients with chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) may be beneficial, but not confirmed yet.The advising mechanisms for non-doing or
      withdraw long-term dialysis. All these studies will be performed in a multicentered project.
      Three medical centers in which CKD researches have been conducted for many years will provide
      a large cohort and share the data collected from their own hospitals. We expect that the
      results will provide an excellent guideline for CKD care, achieve cost-effectiveness of
      dialysis therapy and better life quality of ESRD patients.
