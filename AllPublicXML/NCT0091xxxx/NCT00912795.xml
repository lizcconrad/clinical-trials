    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and test a text messaging-based smoking cessation
      program for adults who are currently smoking and want to quit, living in Turkey.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking has long been recognized as a significant public health concern associated with great
      morbidity and mortality. Although smoking rates have decreased in high income countries,
      these trends have not been noted for tow and middle income countries. This is especially true
      in Turkey, which was ranked 6th in the world in smoking consumption. Between 51-63% of
      Turkish men and 24-26% of Turkish women 15 years of age and older are smokers. With lung
      cancer the leading cancer-related cause of death for both men and women, effective and
      accessible smoking cessation interventions are needed. Cell phone technology represents a
      unique opportunity to deliver evidenced-based smoking cessation behavioral treatments through
      a delivery mechanism already widely adopted by adults. An estimated 35 million Turks were
      using cell phones, making them 1.8 times more common than land lines. Cell phone
      interventions are a unique delivery method because of their 'always on' capability. The rapid
      uptake of cell phones allows us to potentially reach those who might otherwise not utilize
      smoking cessation services.

      We designed and evaluated SMS Turkey, an evidenced-based smoking intervention that takes
      advantage of technologies adopted by adult smokers in Turkey. The primary outcome measure is
      sustained abstinence 12 weeks after quit day, confirmed with a carbon monoxide (CO) reading
      of 8 ppm or less. Sustained abstinence was defined as 5 or fewer cigarettes smoked since the
      quit date, per West et al. Secondary outcome measures included: 7-day and 30-day point
      prevalence of smoking behavior at 3 months; CO-verified 7-day point prevalence at 4 weeks;
      and reduction in cigarettes per day for those who are smoking at 3 months.

    <description>6-week smoking cessation program delivered via daily text messages
SMS Turkey: 6-week smoking cessation program delivered via text messaging. SMS Turkey content is guided by the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) theory.
Content was tailored based on participant's stage in quitting (i.e., pre-quit, quit day, early-quit, late-quit, relapse). Based on the typical relapse trajectory, content paths were created for participants based on whether or not they were smoking 2 days after quit day; and again at 7 days after quit day.
Depending on the participant's content path, the total number of messages received ranged from 91 (for those assigned to the encouragement arm) to 146 (for those who relapsed and then were assigned to the late quit messages).</description>

      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited in Ankara, Turkey between December 2010 &amp; June 2011, through in-person outreach at local shopping malls and local newspapers advertisements. Flyers were also posted at Hacettepe University. Smokers indicated their interest by calling the study office or speaking directly with the research assistant at the shopping mall.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 247 people who expressed interest in participating, 230 were eligible for the study. A total of 151 adults (66% of those eligible) attended the enrollment meeting, where they consented to take part in the research study and were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group.</pre_assignment_details>

Content was tailored based on participant's stage in quitting (i.e., pre-quit, quit day, early-quit, late-quit, relapse). Based on the typical relapse trajectory, content paths were created for participants based on whether or not they were smoking 2 days after quit day; and again at 7 days after quit day.
Depending on the participant’s content path, the total number of messages received ranged from 91 (for those assigned to the encouragement arm) to 146 (for those who relapsed and then were assigned to the late quit messages).</description>

SMS Turkey: 6-week smoking cessation program delivered via text messaging. SMS Turkey content is guided by the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) theory.
Content was tailored based on participant's stage in quitting (i.e., pre-quit, quit day, early-quit, late-quit, relapse). Based on the typical relapse trajectory, content paths were created for participants based on whether or not they were smoking 2 days after quit day; and again at 7 days after quit day.
Depending on the participant’s content path, the total number of messages received ranged from 91 (for those assigned to the encouragement arm) to 146 (for those who relapsed and then were assigned to the late quit messages).</description>
