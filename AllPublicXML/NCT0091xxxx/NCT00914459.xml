    <measure>Number of On-Demand ReFacto AF Infusions to Treat a New Bleed: All Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The infusion log diary case report form (CRF) was used to determine the number of on-demand (administration of an unscheduled bolus infusion of Refacto-AF to stop bleeding) ReFacto AF infusions administered to treat a new bleed. This was calculated by adding the initial for a new bleed (on-demand) infusion to any subsequent (on-demand) infusions for the same &quot;previously treated bleed&quot; (same bleed with same start date/time).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Breakthrough Bleeds Within 48 Hours of a Prophylaxis Dose of ReFacto AF: All Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The number of breakthrough bleeds within 48 hours following a prophylaxis dose of ReFacto AF was summarized.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Less-Than-Expected-Therapeutic Effect (LETE) Bleeds in the On-Demand Setting: All Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>LETE in on-demand setting was based on response to treatment of a bleeding episode. LETE in the on-demand setting occurred if participant recorded 2 successive &quot;no response&quot; ratings after 2 successive ReFacto AF infusions. Both infusions were to be administered at an interval of 24 hours for treatment of same bleeding event in absence of confounding factor which included: known presence or subsequent identification of a FVIII inhibitor, known inadequate dose for type and/or severity of bleed in opinion of investigator, delay of greater than 4 hours between onset of bleed to infusion, delay of greater than 24 hours before administration of a follow-up infusion, known compromised ReFacto AF, faulty administration of ReFacto AF, participant had an underlying, predisposing condition responsible for bleed in opinion of investigator (e.g., kidney stones or use of medications known to impair platelet function, such as aspirin or NSAIDs),or ongoing trauma responsible for continued bleeding.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Less-Than-Expected-Therapeutic Effect (LETE) Bleeds in the Prophylaxis Setting: All Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>LETE in the prophylaxis setting occurred if there was a spontaneous bleed within 48 hours (&lt;=48 hours) after a regularly scheduled prophylactic dose of ReFacto AF (which was not used to treat a bleed) in the absence of confounding factors. Therefore, LETE in the prophylaxis setting is the occurrence of a bleed. Confounding factors include: Known presence or subsequent identification of a FVIII inhibitor, known inadequate prophylactic dose, known lack of adherence to the prescribed prophylaxis regimen, bleed occurs in a target joint identified at the start of the study, known compromised ReFacto AF, faulty administration of ReFacto AF, an underlying, predisposing condition responsible for the bleed in the opinion of the investigator (e.g., kidney stones or use of medications known to impair platelet function, such as aspirin or NSAIDs) or traumatic injury responsible for bleeding.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Occurrences of Less-Than-Expected-Therapeutic Effect (LETE) in the Low Recovery Setting: All Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>LETE in the low recovery setting was defined as lower than expected recovery of FVIII (in the opinion of investigator), following the infusion of ReFacto AF in the absence of confounding factors for the low recovery. The only confounding factors for low recovery are as follows: known presence or subsequent identification of a FVIII inhibitor, known compromised ReFacto AF, faulty administration of ReFacto AF, including inadequate dosing.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs): All Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 30 days after last study visit (Month 25)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study treatment without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying), persistent or significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly.
