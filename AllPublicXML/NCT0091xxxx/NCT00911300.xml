  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether Fondaparinux is effective and safe to prevent
      thromboembolic events (like for example strokes) and bleeding events in patients who undergo
      a normalisation of their heart rhythm disturbance. Fondaparinux will be compared with Heparin
      and tablets containing Vitamin-K-Antagonists (Phenprocoumon, Fluindione, or Warfarin).

    <measure>Number of Participants With at Least One Event of Cerebral Neurologic Event, Systemic Thromboembolism, Death From Any Cause, and/or Major Bleeding Until the End of Treatment (EOT) Plus 4 Days</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) until Day 64 (4 days after the EOT [i.e., last administration of study drug]) for CP participants; Baseline until Day 36 (4 days after the EOT) for CN participants</time_frame>
    <description>Cerebral neurologic events are defined as any new neurologic disorders caused by cerebrovascular embolization, e.g., Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), cerebral infarction. The cerebrovascular origin of the event has to be confirmed by objective procedures. Systemic thromboembolism comprises any arterial thromboembolic event (e.g., peripheral vascular embolism, mesenteric infarct, or myocardial infarction). All cerebral neurologic events were adjudicated by a Central Adjudication Committee (CAC), members of which were unaware of the participants' treatment assignment.</description>

    <measure>Number of Thrombus-negative and Thrombus-positive Participants (Par.) With at Least One Cerebral Neurologic Event</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) until Day 64 (4 days after the EOT [i.e., last administration of study drug]) for CP participants; Baseline until Day 36 (4 days after the EOT) for CN participants; and from Baseline until the follow-up visit (FU) (Day 90+/-7)</time_frame>
    <description>Cerebral neurologic events are defined as any new neurologic disorders caused by cerebrovascular embolisation, e.g., TIA, cerebral infarction. All cerebral neurologic events were adjudicated by a CAC, members of which were unaware of the participants' treatment assignment.The cerebrovascular origin of the event was confirmed by objective procedures. A thrombus or blood clot is the final product of the blood coagulation step in hemostasis. It is achieved via the aggregation of platelets that form a platelet plug, and the activation of the humoral coagulation system (i.e., clotting factors).</description>

    <measure>Number of Thrombus-negative and Thrombus-positive Participants Who Died From Any Cause</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) until Day 64 (4 days after the EOT [i.e., last administration of study drug]) for CP participants; Baseline until Day 36 (4 days after the EOT) for CN participants; and from Baseline until the follow-up visit (FU) (Day 90+/-7)</time_frame>
    <description>The cause of death was classified as due to a thromboembolic event (like cerebral infarction), bleeding, or other established diagnosis, or as unexplained. All deaths were adjudicated by an independent CAC, the members of which were unaware of the participants' treatment assignment. A thrombus or blood clot is the final product of the blood coagulation step in hemostasis. It is achieved via the aggregation of platelets that form a platelet plug, and the activation of the humoral coagulation system (i.e., clotting factors).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Thrombus-negative and Thrombus-positive Participants With at Least One Major Bleeding Event</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) until Day 64 (4 days after the EOT [i.e., last administration of study drug]) for CP participants; Baseline until Day 36 (4 days after the EOT) for CN participants; and from Baseline until the follow-up visit (FU) (Day 90+/-7)</time_frame>
    <description>Major bleeding: fatal, and/or symptomatic in a critical area/ organ, causes a fall in hemoglobin of &gt;=3 grams/deciliter compared with the pre-randomization level, or leads to the transfusion of &gt;=2 units of whole blood/red blood cells. All bleeding events were adjudicated by a CAC, the members of which were unaware of the participants' treatment assignment. A thrombus/ blood clot is the final product of the blood coagulation step in hemostasis. It is achieved via the aggregation of platelets, and the activation of the humoral coagulation system (i.e., clotting factors).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Thrombus-negative and Thrombus-positive Participants With at Least One Minor Bleeding Event</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) until Day 64 (4 days after the EOT [i.e., last administration of study drug]) for CP participants; Baseline until Day 36 (4 days after the EOT) for CN participants; and from Baseline until the follow-up visit (FU) (Day 90+/-7)</time_frame>
    <description>Minor bleeding is defined as clinically overt bleeding events that do not meet the criteria for major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding. All episodes of bleeding were adjudicated by an independent CAC, the members of which were unaware of the participants' treatment assignment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Primary Successful Electrical Cardioversion (CV) in Sinus Rhythm</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 until Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>CV may be performed electively to restore sinus rhythm in patients with persistent AF. The primary successful electric CV was assessed by a 12- lead electrocardiogram (ECG) directly after the CV. Results of the last cardioversion were used in cases for which more than one CV was performed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With a Thrombus in the Left Atrium (LA) or in the Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) at the Time of the Second TEE</measure>
    <time_frame>At second TEE (at Day 28+/-4)</time_frame>
    <description>Atrial fibrillation (AF) causes stagnant blood in the LA or LAA and can lead to a thromboembolism. Stasis in the LAA represents the principal mechanism of thrombus formation in AF.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Thrombus-negative and Thrombus-positive Participants With Conversion to Sinus Rhythm</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) until Day 64 (4 days after the EOT [i.e., last administration of study drug]) for CP participants; Baseline until Day 36 (4 days after the EOT) for CN participants; and from Day 64 until the follow-up visit (FU) (Day 90+/-7)</time_frame>
    <description>Sinus rhythm is the normal beating of the heart, as measured by an ECG. Normal sinus rhythm not only indicates that the rhythm is normally generated by the sinus node and is traveling in a normal fashion in the heart, but it also indicates that the heart rate (the rate at which the sinus node is generating impulses) is within normal limits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Were Re-hospitalized</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) until Day 64 (4 days after the EOT [i.e., last administration of study drug]) for CP participants; Baseline until Day 36 (4 days after the EOT) for CN participants; and from Baseline until the follow-up visit (FU) (Day 90+/-7)</time_frame>
    <description>Hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or out-patient setting. Re-hospitalization refers to an event of hospitalization after discharge for the initial hospitilization for the cardioversion.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants (par.) were required to undergo transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to guide cardioversion (CV). TEEs were recorded and archived to allow for later central adjudication and possible evaluation of details. At randomization (Day 1, immediately after TEE), par. were stratified to thrombus (clot)-positive and thrombus (clot)-negative.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Fondaparinux</title>
          <description>For clot-negative (CN) participants (par.), 7.5 milligrams (mg) fondaparinux was injected once daily (OD) subcutaneously (for par. with body weight [BW] 50-100 kilograms [kg]); for par. with BW &gt;100 kg, 10 mg fondaparinux was administered using a disposable prefilled syringe for the first 7-10 days after randomization, followed by 3 weeks of 2.5 mg fondaparinux OD (until Day 28+/-4). For clot-positive (CP) par. with creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;= 50 milliliters (mL)/minute (min), 7.5 mg fondaparinux was injected OD (for par. with BW 50-100 kg); for par. with BW &gt;100 kg, 10 mg fondaparinux was administered OD. For CP par. with CrCl 30 to &lt;50 mL/min, 5 mg fondaparinux was injected OD (for par. with BW 50-100 kg); for par. with BW &gt;100 kg, 7.5 mg fondaparinux was injected for 28+/-4 days. If the second TEE showed thrombus disappearance, treatment continued until 7-10 days after the second TEE followed by 3 weeks of 2.5 mg fondaparinux OD (total treatment duration: 56+/-4 days).</description>

          <title>Unfractioned Heparin (UFH)/Vitamin K Antagonist (VKA)</title>
          <description>Both CN and CP participants received an initial intravenous (i.v.) bolus injection of 70 international units (IU)/kg (at least 5000 IU) UFH, followed by continuous infusion at an initial rate of 15 IU/kg/hour (h) (at least 1250 IU per hour). The infusion dose was adjusted to maintain an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) at 1.5 to 2 times the reference control value. Infusion continued for at least 72 h. In parallel to UFH, treatment with VKA was started as soon as possible (preferably on Day 1). The dose of VKA was adjusted to reach a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0-3.0. UFH was continued until INR &gt;2.0. Total treatment duration: 28+/-4 days. For CP participants for whom the second TEE showed thrombus disappearance, VKA was continued during cardioversion and up to a total treatment duration of 56+/-4 days.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With at Least One Event of Cerebral Neurologic Event, Systemic Thromboembolism, Death From Any Cause, and/or Major Bleeding Until the End of Treatment (EOT) Plus 4 Days</title>
        <description>Cerebral neurologic events are defined as any new neurologic disorders caused by cerebrovascular embolization, e.g., Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), cerebral infarction. The cerebrovascular origin of the event has to be confirmed by objective procedures. Systemic thromboembolism comprises any arterial thromboembolic event (e.g., peripheral vascular embolism, mesenteric infarct, or myocardial infarction). All cerebral neurologic events were adjudicated by a Central Adjudication Committee (CAC), members of which were unaware of the participants' treatment assignment.</description>

        <description>The cause of death was classified as due to a thromboembolic event (like cerebral infarction), bleeding, or other established diagnosis, or as unexplained. All deaths were adjudicated by an independent CAC, the members of which were unaware of the participants' treatment assignment. A thrombus or blood clot is the final product of the blood coagulation step in hemostasis. It is achieved via the aggregation of platelets that form a platelet plug, and the activation of the humoral coagulation system (i.e., clotting factors).</description>
