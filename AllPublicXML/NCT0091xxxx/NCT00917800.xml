      The purpose of the investigation is to verify the efficiency of the HyperQ™ system in
      detecting exercise induced ischemia, with higher specificity and sensitivity than
      conventional ECG Stress testing. The study will be carried out by applying the HyperQ™ system
      during cycle ergometer stress testing in patients who are referred for angiography at the
      Department of Cardiology, Essen University Hospital, Essen, Germany. The HyperQ™ results will
      then be compared to the standard ECG stress test results using the angiography results as the
      gold standard. The study will be considered successful if analysis of the HyperQ provides a
      statistically significant improvement over the diagnostic accuracy of conventional ECG stress
      testing analysis.
