  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 80% of the worldwide population is positive on HSV antibodies. In the United States the
      lifetime prevalence of recurrent herpes labialis is estimated at 20% to 40%, with
      approximately 100 million episodes occurring in the country every year. In Switzerland about
      70% of the adult population is positive on HSV-1 and about 20% is positive on HSV-2.

      The Herpes simplex virus has a lipid bilayer (virus-envelope), which causes the
      sensitiveness, to any kind of detergents. Within this bilayer cholesterol molecules are
      integrated and play a crucial role in virus entry into host cells. In vitro experiments have
      clearly shown that the depletion of cholesterol in HSV-envelope with 2- HPßCD has inhibited
      the ability of the virus to infect host cells.

      The aim of this clinical trial is to reduce the number of Herpes labialis relapse and to
      provide patients with recurrent Herpes labialis a real benefit, concerning the simple
      mechanism of action and the negligible side effects. Patients having problems in swallowing
      the antiviral pills of standard treatment, will find with 2- HPßCD a drug, that just has to
      be applied on the lips, which increases patient's quality of life tremendously.
