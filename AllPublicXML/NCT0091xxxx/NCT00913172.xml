    <textblock>
      Evidences for policy making and decision related to the cost of delivering tuberculosis (TB)
      control is lacking in Ethiopia. The investigators aimed to determine the cost and
      cost-effectiveness of involving health extension workers (HEWs) in TB treatment under the
      community-based initiative in Ethiopia.

    <textblock>
      Two treatment options were compared - health facility and community DOT. In 1995, Ethiopia
      adopted World Health Organization (WHO) recommended DOTS strategy for TB control. The
      treatment regimen for new smear-positive patients includes two months of ethambutol,
      rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide followed by six months of ethambutol and isoniazid.
      For children the continuation phase treatment was replaced by four months of rifampicin and
      isoniazid. Follow up sputum examinations were conducted at the end of 2, 5 and 7 months
      treatment.

        This study was conducted along a CRT to find out if involving HEWs improves the treatment
        success rate of smear-positive patients. For both treatment alternatives, smear-positive
        patients who were diagnosed (from September 2006 to September 2007) and started treatment
        were prospectively enrolled until the end of treatment. The detail of the study are given
        elsewhere
