    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the response rate in patients with taxane-pretreated
      recurrent breast cancer receiving paclitaxel loaded polymeric micelle (Genexol-PM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Genexol-PM is a novel Cremophor EL-free polymeric micelle formulation of paclitaxel. This
      single arm, multicenter phase IV study was designed to evaluate the response rate, toxicity,
      progression free survival and tumor control rate of Genexol-PM in patients with
      Taxane-pretreated recurrence breast cancer.
