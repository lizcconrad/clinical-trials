  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the nature and extent of the disturbance in hepatic function and
      biliary hepatic clearance in chronic viral hepatitis, while the course of this disease, the
      functional implications and response to treatment are difficult to predict. This study aims
      to assess this in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B (CHB) and chronic viral hepatitis C
      (CHC) who are eligible for treatment in accordance with the established consensus guidelines
      in the involved countries. The pharmacokinetics of NRL972 will be determined at baseline
      (within one month of starting treatment), at 3-monthly intervals during treatment, for up to
      12 months (or at the end of treatment), and at 3 and 6 months after the end on treatment.
      This will provide a clearer understanding regarding the use of the pharmacokinetics of NRL972
      in detecting changes in biliary clearance during and after treatment for CHB and CHC.
