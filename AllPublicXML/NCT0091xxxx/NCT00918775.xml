    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the surgical removal of your primary
      tumor or the parts of the cancer that has spread to other parts of the body is a good method
      for treating patients who have kidney cancer. Only the parts of the cancer that has spread
      will be removed during the surgery.

      This research study is designed to follow your progress after the surgery is complete. You
      will not receive any drugs or treatment as part of this research study. You may however
      receive non-study treatment after your surgery.

      Study Visits:

      Every 6 months for 5 years after surgery, the following tests and procedures will be
      performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will have CT scans or MRI scans of your chest, stomach area, and brain to check the
           status of the disease.

        -  If the study doctor thinks it is necessary, you will have a bone scan to check the
           status of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      You will have study visits for up to 5 years after the surgery is complete. You will be taken
      off study early if the disease gets worse, or if the study doctor thinks that it is no longer
      in your best interest to continue.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      About every 6 months after your last study visit, the study staff will either review your
      medical records or contact you by phone or email to collect information about your health, to
      see how you are doing, and what anti-cancer treatments you may have received. If you are
      contacted by phone, the call should only last about 5 minutes each time.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 120 patients will take part in this study. All will
      be enrolled at MD Anderson.

        Patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) and will be undergoing a surgical
        resection of tumor.

    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

          2. 2. Patients have clinical reasons for undergoing a surgical resection of tumor. There
             are two main categories of patients: a)Patients with fully resectable disease as
             defined by lesions accessible by a surgeon during no more than two separate surgical
             sessions, and are expected to be rendered surgically no evidence of disease (NED). b)
             Patients undergoing a noncurative procedure for relief of symptoms or for management
             of threatening lesions.

          3. Patients have been deemed resectable by the subspecialty surgeon involved in the
             patient's care

          4. Patients must give written informed consent prior to initiation of therapy, in keeping
             with the policies of the institution. Patients with a history of major psychiatric
             illness must be judged able to fully understand the investigational nature of the
             study and the risks associated with the therapy. The only approved consent is attached
             to this protocol

          5. Patients must have ability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures.

          6. Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this
             trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must not have active acute infections that could be worsened by surgery or
             interfere with this study.

          2. Patients must not have clinically significant cardiovascular disease, or peripheral
             vascular disease that creates an unacceptably high operative risk.

          3. Patients must not have history of other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical
             examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a
             disease or condition that contraindicates surgical resection, or render the subject at
             high risk from treatment complications.

          4. Patients must not have a history of uncontrolled severe depression.
