  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The broad aim is to determine efficacy of a weight loss diet higher in protein and lower in
      carbohydrate combined with low intensity exercise to favorably impact body composition, bone
      health, physical function, metabolic disease and quality of life compared to a conventional
      higher carbohydrate diet in overweight women over age 60.
