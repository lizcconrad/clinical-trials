  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ciprofloxacin PulmoSphere Inhalation Powder appears to be an effective and adequate
      antibiotic treatment for cystic fibrosis patients with P. aeruginosa colonisation. This
      planned study is the first study on the use of this new Ciprofloxacin PulmoSphere Inhalation
      Powder in the pediatric population of 6 to 12 years of age.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients with cystic fibrosis confirmed by genetic testing and / or by
             sweat test

          -  Colonization with P. aeruginosa confirmed in sputum in the past 12 months

          -  Cohort 1: greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

          -  Cohort 2: 6 - 12 years of age (inclusive)

          -  Normal Body Mass Index: BMI between 14.5 and 30 kg/m2, but in no case lower than the
             30th percentile for age. Because CF patients are typically smaller than
             non-CF-patients, the normal body mass index will be based on standard CF foundation
             normal values for weight and sex.

          -  Patients who are able to understand and follow instructions and who are able to
             participate in the study for the entire period.

          -  Patients and legal representatives must have given their written informed consent to
             participate in the study after receiving adequate previous information and prior to
             any study specific procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with FEV1 &lt; 35% of predicted. FEV1 (forced expiratory volume) is a measure of
             lung function. This exclusion will prohibit enrollment of patients with severely
             impaired lung function.

          -  Patients with Burkholderia cepacia colonization of their respiratory tract

          -  Patients with acute bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)

          -  Patients on a lung transplant list

          -  Patients with acute pulmonary exacerbations

          -  Patients with severe liver cirrhosis

          -  Massive hemoptysis in the preceding 4 weeks

          -  A history of relevant diseases of vital organs, of the central nervous system, or
             other organs not related to the underlying disease

          -  Patients with a history of severe allergies, non-allergic drug reactions, or multiple
             drug allergies

          -  Patients with hypersensitivity to the investigational drug or to other quinolones and/
             or to inactive constituents

          -  Patients with known intolerance to hypertonic saline or bronchodilators

          -  Concomitant inhalation therapy with antibiotics and / or concomitant systemic therapy
             with fluoroquinolones

          -  Women who are pregnant
