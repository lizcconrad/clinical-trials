      The aims of this prospective, randomized study are:

        -  To assess the effect of clean intermittent catheterization (CIC)

        -  To investigate if MS patients will have symptom reduction (urgency, frequency, nocturia
           and incontinence) when using CIC in combination with anticholinergic drugs

        -  To identify at what volume of Postvoid Residual (PVR) urine, starting CIC improves
           bladder control and QoL

        -  To increase the evidence of CIC, and support clinical guidelines of bladder management
           in MS patients

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Frequency of Micturition Per Day at 8 Weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks after randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>Number of micturitions per day was assessed using a patient diary during three days at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment. The relative change in mean number of micturitions was compared between the groups. The change was calculated as percent change = ((measure at 8 weeks - measure at baseline)/measure at baseline)*100%.</description>

Plan was to have 44 evaluable subjects (90% power) but power of the study was reduced by early termination. It cannot be concluded that there is no difference between the treatment groups due to insufficient power.</groups_desc>
