      The purpose of this phase 2 study is to find the best way to give this new experimental
      regimen and determine if it can treat metastatic melanoma in humans. In this phase 2 study,
      the experimental products are given initially to a group of 8 people. If safe and found to
      have significant anti-tumor activity, it will be given to up to 14 other people, for a total
      of 22 people in this study. Physicians watch subjects carefully for any harmful side effects.
      Although the experimental regimen has been well tested in laboratory and animal studies, and
      a similar regimen has been given to a group of patients at the National Cancer Institute in
      Bethesda, MD, the side effects in people cannot be completely known ahead of time. This
      protocol is offered only to people whose condition cannot be helped by other known
      treatments.

      The study procedures will start with the collection of white blood cells through apheresis (a
      procedure in which blood is drawn from a patient and separated into its components, some of
      which are retained, such as white blood cells, and the remainder returned by transfusion to
      the patient).

      Subjects will be asked to undergo two aphereses, one to make the gene-modified MART-1 TCR
      CTLs and the dendritic cell vaccines, and a second one after the subject receives the gene
      modified cells to later study them in the blood.

      On the day of the first apheresis, subjects will be admitted to the hospital and will receive
      chemotherapy over the next five days which decreases the risk of rejection of the transferred
      cells by the subject's immune system and facilitates their expansion and attack of the
      melanoma lesions. During this time, the gene-modified MART-1 TCR CTLs and the dendritic cells
      will be manufactured in the laboratory from the apheresis product and will be extensively
      tested to assure that they express the appropriate TCR and that they do not contain any
      contaminating bacteria or virus. Then the gene-modified MART-1 TCR CTLs will be given back to
      the subject through a vein in the arm. It will be followed by vaccination with the dendritic
      cells under the skin. During the next fourteen days, subjects will also receive interleukin 2
      (IL-2), which is a standard treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma. During the next
      2 to 3 weeks, subjects will stay in the hospital until the study investigators determine that
      the subject has fully recovered from all of the procedures, and it is safe for the subject to
      go home. Chemotherapy frequently causes a decrease in the platelet or red blood cells, and
      therefore subjects may require platelet and/or red blood cell transfusions.

      This is a two-stage phase II clinical trial with the combined primary endpoints to determine
      the safety, feasibility and anti-tumor activity of adoptive transfer of peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) genetically engineered to express the alpha and beta chains of a
      high affinity T cell receptor (TCR) specific for the HLA-A*0201-restricted MART-1 melanoma
      tumor antigen to patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma. This gene transfer
      will be facilitated by a retroviral vector pseudotyped with a gibbon ape leukemia virus
      (GaLV) envelope. The two transgenes are linked by a picornavirus 2A sequence. Their
      expression is driven by the retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR).

      Patients with MART-1-positive locally advanced or metastatic melanoma who are
      HLA-A*0201-positive, and HIV, hepatitis B and C seronegative, will receive a
      non-myeloablative but lymphocyte depleting chemotherapy conditioning regimen consisting of
      cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, and then receive the adoptive transfer of autologous PBMC
      transduced with the MSGV1-F5AfT2AB retroviral vector, which expresses a high affinity TCR for
      the MART-1 melanoma antigen (MART-1 F5 TCR). The cell dose will be up to 10^9 autologous PBMC
      transduced with the MSGV1-F5AfT2AB retroviral vector. The transgenic T cells will be infused
      fresh on the day of harvest as done in the last three patients within this protocol, prior to
      which, thawed cryopreserved cells were infused. Following adoptive cell transfer, patients
      will receive MART-1.26-35 peptide-pulsed dendritic cell (DC) vaccines and low dose
      interleukin-2 (IL-2).

      The MART-1 F5 TCR was provided by Dr. Stephen A. Rosenberg from the Surgery Branch, National
      Cancer Institute (NCI). The MART-1 F5 TCR is derived from the DMF5 tumor infiltrating
      lymphocyte (TIL) clone, and was selected from several MART-1-specific TCRs because of its
      high affinity and biological activity. This TCR delivered by the same retroviral vector is
      currently in clinical testing at the Surgery Branch/NCI. Both the NCI clinical trial and the
      trial at UCLA are based on the same retrovirus expressing the MART-1 F5 TCR used to transduce
      whole PBMC and re-infused to patients after a non-myeloablative but lymphodepleting
      chemotherapy conditioning regimen. Major differences between both clinical trials include the
      shorter ex vivo expansion of TCR transduced PBMC, the use of MART-126-35 peptide pulsed DC
      and the use of positron imaging tomography (PET) for non-invasive imaging of adoptively
      transferred TCR transgenic cells in the UCLA clinical trial.

      The primary endpoints will be safety, feasibility and objective tumor response. The phase II
      clinical trial design will have two treatment stages following a Simon optimal two-stage
      clinical phase II clinical trial design 1. The clinical trial will have an initial stage with
      8 patients followed by a second stage with up to 22 patients.

      Safety will be determined in stage one, and if 3 out of 8 patients have MART-1 F5 TCR-induced
      dose limiting toxicities (DLT), then further accrual will not be warranted. Feasibility will
      be also determined in the first stage, and if 3 out of 8 patients cannot receive the intended
      cellular therapies, or if they result in suboptimal TCR transgenic cell in vivo persistence,
      further accrual will not be warranted to the protocol as currently designed. Objective tumor
      responses will be determined by RECIST objective response criteria with a design to rule out
      a 10% response rate as the null hypothesis, and a 35% response rate as the alternative
      hypothesis. With this statistical design, if 2 or more of 8 patients in stage one have an
      objective response, the study will proceed to stage two and accrue a total of 22 patients. If
      5 or more patients in the overall study have a complete response (CR) or partial response
      (PR), which combined result in the objective response rate, the study will be declared
      positive.

      Secondary study endpoints are transgenic T cell persistence in humans and their ability to
      home to MART-1 positive melanoma metastasis. Analysis will be performed by sampling of
      peripheral blood and tumor deposits for T cell persistence and by non-invasive metabolic
      imaging using PET scans.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Previously known hypersensitivity to any of the agents used in this study.

          -  Received systemic treatment for cancer, including immunotherapy, within one month
             prior to initiation of dosing within this protocol. However, cell harvesting by
             leukapheresis may be performed before one month from prior therapy if the study
             investigators consider that it will not have a detrimental impact on the generation of
             the two cell therapies in this protocol.

          -  History of, or significant evidence of risk for, chronic inflammatory or autoimmune
             disease (eg, Addison's disease, multiple sclerosis, Graves disease, Hashimoto's
             thyroiditis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic
             lupus erythematosus, hypophysitis, pituitary disorders, etc.). Patients will be
             eligible if prior autoimmune disease is not deemed to be active (e.g. fibrotic damage
             of the thyroid after thyroiditis or its treatment, with stable thyroid hormone
             replacement therapy). Vitiligo will not be a basis for exclusion.

          -  History of inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or other chronic
             gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea or bleeding, or current acute
             colitis of any origin.

          -  Potential requirement for systemic corticosteroids or concurrent immunosuppressive
             drugs based on prior history or received systemic steroids within the last 4 weeks
             prior to enrollment (inhaled or topical steroids at standard doses are allowed).

          -  HIV seropositivity or other congenital or acquired immune deficiency state, which
             would increase the risk of opportunistic infections and other complications during
             chemotherapy-induced lymphodepletion. If there is a positive result in the infectious
             disease testing that was not previously known, the patient will be referred to their
             primary physician and/or infectious disease specialist.

          -  Hepatitis B or C seropositivity with evidence of ongoing liver damage, which would
             increase the likelihood of hepatic toxicities from the chemotherapy conditioning
             regimen and supportive treatments. If there is a positive result in the infectious
             disease testing that was not previously known, the patient will be referred to their
             primary physician and/or infectious disease specialist.

          -  Dementia or significantly altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding
             or rendering of informed consent and compliance with the requirements of this
             protocol.

          -  Clinically active brain metastases. Radiological documentation of absence of active
             brain metastases at screening is required for all patients. Prior evidence of brain
             metastasis successfully treated with surgery or radiation therapy will not be
             exclusion for participation as long as they are deemed under control at the time of
             study enrollment.

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding. Female patients must be surgically sterile or be
             postmenopausal for two years, or must agree to use effective contraception during the
             period of treatment and 6 months after. All female patients with reproductive
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum/urine) within 14 days from
             starting the conditioning chemotherapy. The definition of effective contraception will
             be based on the judgment of the study investigators.

          -  Since IL-2 is administered following cell infusion:

               -  Patients will be excluded if they have a history of clinically significant ECG
                  abnormalities, symptoms of cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias and have a left
                  ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 45% on a cardiac stress test (stress
                  thallium, stress MUGA, dobutamine echocardiogram, or other stress test).

               -  Similarly, patients who are 50 years old with a baseline LVEF &lt; 45% will be
                  excluded.

               -  Patients with ECG results of any conduction delays (PR interval &gt;200ms, QTC &gt;
                  480ms), sinus bradycardia (resting heart rate &lt;50 beats per minute), sinus
                  tachycardia (HR&gt;120 beats per minute) will be evaluated by a cardiologist prior
                  to starting the trial. Patients with any arrhythmias, including atrial
                  fibrillation/atrila flutter, excessive ectopy (defined as &gt;20 PVCs per minute),
                  ventricular tachycardia, 3rd degree heart block will be excluded from the study
                  unless cleared by a cardiologist.

               -  Patients with pulmonary function test abnormalities as evidenced by a FEV1/FVC&lt;
                  70% of predicted for normality will be excluded.
