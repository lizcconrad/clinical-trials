  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence of complications with the isolated
      Roux-en-Y reconstruction after pancreaticoduodenectomy in pancreatic tumor and periampullary
      tumor patients. A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare the
      incidence of complications with isolated Roux-en-Y reconstruction with those of
      Billroth-II-type reconstruction after pancreaticoduodenectomy.

      The purpose of this study is to clarify whether isolated Roux-en-Y reconstruction declines
      the incidence of postoperative complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy compared with
      Billroth-II-type reconstruction. Especially, it is important to decline the incidence of
      pancreatic fistula, because pancreatic fistula affects a postoperative course. However, there
      is no report that demonstrated postoperative complications of isolated Roux-en-Y compared
      with those of Billroth-II-type reconstruction. We conducted a prospective randomized trial on
      patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy.

      Patients with pancreatico-biliary disease who were performed pancreaticoduodenectomy at
      Wakayama Medical University Hospital.

      The primary endpoint was defined as the incidence of pancreatic fistula. The secondary
      endpoints were the incidence of other postoperative complications, mortality, delayed gastric
      emptying, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and intra-abdominal abscess. Patients were recruited
      into this study before surgery, on the basis of whether pancreatic head resection was
      anticipated at Wakayama Medical University Hospital (WMUH) for pancreatic head and
      periampullary disease, and appropriate informed consent was obtained. Exclusion criteria was
      1) young patients (less than 20-year-old), 2) patients with severe complications which were
      possible to prolong hospital stay, 3) patients undergone hemodialysis, 4) patients combined
      resection of other organs, 5) patients who were diagnosed inadequacy for this study by a
      physician, and 6) patients without an informed consent.
