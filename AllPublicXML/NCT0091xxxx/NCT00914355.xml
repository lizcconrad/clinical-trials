  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to see whether stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) can reduce
      tumour size, slow progression of the disease, prolong life and improve quality of life of
      patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, a cancer of the liver, that cannot be removed
      surgically (unresectable) and cannot be treated with ablative therapy (e.g. radio-frequency
      ablation) or trans-arterial chemo-embolization (TACE) therapy (delivery of chemotherapy
      through an artery that feeds into the liver). SBRT is concentrated focused radiation therapy
      delivered very precisely to the liver tumour. It is hoped that knowledge obtained from this
      study will improve our ability to treat patients with liver tumours that cannot be treated
      with surgery and other methods, and that SBRT may prove to be a treatment that can lead to
      long-term and permanent control of liver tumours for some patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From July 2003 to May 2007, over 40 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma participated in
      two studies at Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) designed to determine the safety of treating
      hepatocellular carcinoma with SBRT. These studies have shown that SBRT can be delivered
      safely to the majority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The treated tumour was
      controlled (shrank or remained the same size) in 78% of patients at one year following
      treatment.The median survival of patients was 11 months (i.e. half of patients survived
      longer and half shorter than 11 months). This survival rate is better than that expected in
      patients treated with supportive care only (no treatment other than care to make you feel
      better). Supportive care patients have a median survival rate of 3-9 months. We expect that
      the benefits of SBRT in this study will be similar to those observed in our initial studies.

    <description>Radiation therapy will be delivered on six occasions, over two weeks. Each treatment will take approximately 30 minutes to deliver.You may be asked to swallow 250 cc of oral contrast before each radiation therapy treatment.Pepto Bismol (a liquid that coats the stomach and is used to treat heartburn) and/or water may be combined with the contrast to improve the quality of the stomach's image.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed pathologically, 2)diagnosed by showing vascular enhancement of the lesion on
             at least two imaging techniques, or 3) diagnosed by showing vascular enhancement on a
             single technique if the AFP is greater than 200, in the setting of cirrhosis or
             chronic hepatitis B without cirrhosis (EASL consensus conference guidelines).

          -  Either 1) the tumour must be unresectable, based on the opinion of an experienced
             surgeon specializing in hepatic resection, or 2) the patient Phase II SBRT HCC 13 must
             be medically inoperable, or 3) extra-hepatic metastases must be present (making
             hepatic surgery an inappropriate treatment option).

          -  Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &gt; 60 (Appendix II)

          -  Age: 18 years or older. Both male &amp; female patients of all races can be included in
             this study. Female patients within reproductive years may not be, nor become, pregnant
             during participation in this study

          -  Patients must have recovered from the effects of previous therapy.

          -  Maximal tumor size of 15 cm.

          -  Adequate organ function as assessed as follows:

               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 90 g/L

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1.0 bil/L

               -  Platelets &gt; 50 bil/L

               -  INR &lt; 1.5 or correctable with vitamin K (unless patient is on coumadin in which
                  case higher levels are acceptable)

               -  AST or ALT &lt; 6.0 times upper range of normal

          -  Child's A 5-6 liver score or Child B 7-8 liver score, which is only permitted if the
             maximal tumor size is 10 cm

          -  Previous liver resection or ablative therapy is permitted.

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 3 months

          -  The volume of uninvolved must be at least 700 cc

          -  Up to five discrete liver tumors

          -  Patients must have signed a study-specific informed consent form. If the patient's
             mental status precludes this, written informed consent may be given by the patient's
             legal representative.

             liver. That is, any previous radiation therapy in which a mean dose to the liver of 15
             Gy in conventional fractionation was delivered, or previous doses to critical normal
             structures that would make re-irradiation unsafe. The PI should be called if there is
             any question of safety of re-irradiation.

          -  Eligible for RFA or alcohol ablation

          -  Eligible for TACE

          -  Prior uncontrolled, life threatening malignancy within the six months.

          -  Pregnancy is not permitted, and in women of child bearing age, a pregnancy test and
             acceptable methods of contraception are warranted.

          -  Previous gastric, duodenal or variceal bleed within the past 2 months.

          -  Commencement of coumadin use within the past 3 months.
