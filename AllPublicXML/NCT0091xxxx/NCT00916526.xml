  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic cough is defined by its persistence beyond 8 weeks. Many conditions can explain the
      existence of a bronchial inflammation. In the management of chronic cough, the search for
      bronchial hyperreactivity (HRB) is recommended. The treatment relies primarily on the
      prescription of inhaled corticosteroids. It has been shown recently that the existence of an
      HRB with Methacholine (bronchial provocation test used in routine) does predict the
      effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroid treatment in no more than 50% of cases.

      It is now possible to assess the bronchial inflammation by rapid, non-invasive and
      reproducible tests such that the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and bronchial
      provocation test with mannitol. In a retrospective study, it was shown that an increased
      value of FeNO (cut-off &gt; 35 ppb) predicts a positive response to treatment with a sensitivity
      of 90% and a specificity of 80%.

      The purpose of this study is to show that the use of the prospective value of exhaled NO can
      predict response to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids in adult with chronic cough. In
      addition we will assess the interest of the prognosis of bronchial provocation test with
      mannitol in this indication.

    <description>Patients referred for evaluation of a chronic cough (without treatment or after stopping inhaled corticosteroids for 2 weeks) will perform a measure of FeNO, a bronchial provocation test with mannitol, will fill out a questionnaire of quality of life for the cough (Leicester Cough Questionnaire) and the intensity of coughing on a 10-cm visual scale.
After 6 weeks after treatment with inhaled corticosteroids patients will perform the same tests.</description>

    <intervention_name>bronchial provocation test with mannitol</intervention_name>
    <description>Bronchial provocation test with mannitol: Aridol is supplied in kit form containing sufficient capsules to complete one complete challenge, and the inhalation device.
Apply nose clip and subject should be directed to breathe through the mouth
Insert 0 mg capsule into inhalation device. Puncture capsule by depressing buttons on side of device slowly, and once only (a second puncture may fragment the capsules)
The patient should exhale completely, before inhaling from device in a controlled rapid deep inspiration
At the end of deep inspiration, start 60 second timer, subject should hold breath for 5 seconds and exhale through mouth before removal of nose clip
At the end of 60 seconds, measure the FEV1 in duplicate (this becomes baseline FEV1)
Insert 5 mg capsule into inhalation device, and proceed as above
Repeat steps 1 - 4 following the dose steps in the table below until the patient has a positive response or 635 mg has been administered.</description>
