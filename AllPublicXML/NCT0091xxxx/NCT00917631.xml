  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A rising number of preterm twins, at high risk of undergoing repeated medical procedures
      often without adequate pain relief, are being admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Units.
      Skin-to-skin contact between mothers and their infants during painful procedures has been
      shown to decrease pain and help them stabilize more quickly afterwards. The main question of
      this study is whether the contact of a twin could provide a similar form of comfort.
      Sixty-four twin pairs will have an equal chance of undergoing a medically necessary heel
      stick while being cared for together (co-bedding) or separately. Primary outcome will be
      physiologic and behavioral pain response. If found to be beneficial, changes to neonatal care
      practices to include co-bedding may help twins tolerate and recover from painful procedures.
      Findings will help care providers make recommendations for at risk twins experiencing
      procedural pain and add to existing theoretical models with respect to the exact mechanism of
      comfort through touch.

    <description>Twin infants will be placed together in a Incubator or crib lying side-by-side. Twins will be diaper clad and nested together in boundaries consistent with neonatal care practices. All infants will have cardio-respiratory monitoring while co-bedding.
Infants in the co-bedding group be co-bedded for no less than 24 hours prior to heelstick to allow for stabilization following transfer. The heelstick being studied will occur no greater than 10 days following initiation of co-bedding. Duration of co-bedding will be recorded and controlled for in the analysis if necessary.
Monitoring and video-tape recording will take approximately 20-30 minutes per participant - a baseline period (5-10 minutes prior to heel stick), warming (3 minutes), heel stick (2-5 minutes), and recovery phase (approximately 10 minutes).</description>

    <description>For infants who are randomized to receive standard care, the twin pair will remain in separate incubators as per current NICU policy. The infant will be nested in boundaries consistent with neonatal care practices. The heelstick may occur at any time following randomization (within 10 days) to maintain consistency between groups.</description>
