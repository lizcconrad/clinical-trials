  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is collecting tissue specimens (blood, urine and saliva) from up to 1000 patients,
      with and without cognitive disorders, to store in the Bio Bank for future research. The
      specimens could be used in future research projects that could help improve the accuracy of
      diagnosis of a disease, predict who might develop a disease, help monitor the disease, or
      improve the understanding of the disease. Patients are only being recruited from Beaumont
      Hospitals Geriatric Clinic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 1000 patients, with or without diagnosed cognitive disorders, are asked to participate
      by providing the investigators with blood, urine and saliva specimens to be stored in a Bio
      Bank for future research. Patients will be asked to participate on a yearly basis for up to 5
      to 10 years by providing the investigators with the above-mentioned specimens, and also
      having a physical exam and having some cognitive testing performed at the initial visit and
      yearly visits.

      Examples of the types of research are: new methods for improving the diagnosis and treatment
      of age-related cognitive disorders, new areas of biology, new areas of biotechnology, and
      possibly genetic research. If you do not want your specimens used for any specific type of
      research, you may specify that on the consent form.

             examinations.

          3. Individuals identified as having some form of cognitive impairment require a study
             partner with 1-2 times per week contact (can be in person and/or telephone), who will
             accompany them to study visits(s).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of significant sensory deficits (e.g., visual or hearing), motor deficits
             (e.g., paralysis), or medical conditions that would preclude the completion of the
             neuropsychological or other study instruments.

          2. DMS-IV diagnosis of substance abuse disorder.

          3. Presence of a major medical or terminal illness that may affect the participation of
             the patient in the study.
