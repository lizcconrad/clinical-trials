      Primary:

      To assess the effects of repeated dose of Neramexane on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of
      Drospirenone [DRSP] and Ethinyl Estradiol [EE]

      Secondary:

      To assess safety and tolerability of concomitant repeated dose treatments of Neramexane and a
      fixed-combinational DRSP- and EE-containing oral contraceptive [OC] (Yasmin®)

             disturbance;

          -  known or suspected genetic or acquired predisposition for venous or arterial
             thromboses like APC resistance,
