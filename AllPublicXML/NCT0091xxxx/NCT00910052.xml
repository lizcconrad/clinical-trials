      Background: Post-operative wound complications arise in as many as 50% of kidney transplant
      recipients. Fibrin sealants have been used in many areas of surgery in attempt to reduce the
      accumulation of post-operative fluid collections with varying success. The use of fibrin
      products has been proposed as a means of reducing local wound complications in the
      immunocompromised renal transplant recipient but as yet has not been studied.

      Methods: 145 patients were enrolled and 141 patients were randomized (74 Tisseelä fibrin
      sealant, 67 No Tisseelä fibrin sealant) in a prospective manner to receive fibrin sealant or
      not at the time of their renal transplant. Patients were analyzed per the randomization
      assignment. The operating team was blinded to the decision until after the iliac fossa
      dissection was complete. The sealant was applied via aerosol to the iliac fossa and renal
      allograft hilum after completion of the neoureterocystostomy in 5 ml quantity. Clinical and
      radiographic data were reviewed through the usual 8-week follow-up transplant ultrasound.
      Patients in whom the peritoneum was entered were excluded from data analysis. The incidence
      of lymphocele, wound infection, dehiscence, clinically significant hematoma as defined by
      necessitating incision and drainage, and urine leak was recorded.
