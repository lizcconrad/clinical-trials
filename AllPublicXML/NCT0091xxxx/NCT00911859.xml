  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and effectiveness of CNTO 328 (siltuximab)
      when it is administered together with velcade-melphalan-prednisone (VMP) in comparison with
      VMP alone in participants with multiple myeloma (a type of cancer that affects the blood and
      bone marrow).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts (Part 1 and Part 2) and will consist of screening
      period up to 2 weeks; treatment period; maintenance period (CNTO 328 hereafter referred to as
      siltuximab) for a maximum of 18 months and follow up period until the study ends. Part 1 is
      an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single group safety lead-in
      part to evaluate the safety of siltuximab. Approximately 12 patients will be treated with
      siltuximab in combination with VMP. If the safety profile of the combination is acceptable,
      the study will proceed to Part 2. Part 2 is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by
      chance), open-label, 2-arm (Arm A: siltuximab + VMP; Arm B: VMP alone) study. Approximately
      104 patients will be equally randomized, followed by a maintenance period with siltuximab in
      particiants in Arm A who achieve a partial response (PR) or better. Particiants in both parts
      of the study will be treated up to a maximum of nine 6-week cycles provided there is no
      evidence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal from treatment. Study
      medication will be continued for at least 2 additional cycles after confirmation of complete
      response, and preferably for the full 9 cycles of the treatment period. Participants who will
      be receiving maintenance treatment after the 12-month effectiveness analysis may continue to
      receive treatment with siltuximab only after careful consideration by the treating physician
      and on evidence of clinical benefit and in the absence of unwarranted toxicities. Safety
      assessments will include evaluation of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, eastern
      cooperative oncology group performance status, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical
      examination which will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>Global health status/quality of life is a subscale of the EORTC QOL C30, which comprises two questions related to overall health/quality of life during the past week. The raw score to each question ranged from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent). The raw mean score of health status/quality of life subscale is calculated for each participant and a linear transformation applied to standardize the raw score, so that scores range from 0 to 100; a higher score represents a higher (&quot;better&quot;) health and quality of life.</description>

        <description>Global health status/quality of life is a subscale of the EORTC QOL C30, which comprises two questions related to overall health/quality of life during the past week. The raw score to each question ranged from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent). The raw mean score of health status/quality of life subscale is calculated for each participant and a linear transformation applied to standardize the raw score, so that scores range from 0 to 100; a higher score represents a higher (&quot;better&quot;) health and quality of life.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Cycle 9 in Global Health Status/Quality of Life Subscale of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ C30)</title>
          <description>Global health status/quality of life is a subscale of the EORTC QOL C30, which comprises two questions related to overall health/quality of life during the past week. The raw score to each question ranged from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent). The raw mean score of health status/quality of life subscale is calculated for each participant and a linear transformation applied to standardize the raw score, so that scores range from 0 to 100; a higher score represents a higher (&quot;better&quot;) health and quality of life.</description>
