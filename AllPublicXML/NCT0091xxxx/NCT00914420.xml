  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting with ACS (Acute Coronary Syndrome) in the emergency department will be
      screened for clinical eligibility and asked to sign informed consent to the study.

      A total of 40 patients will be randomized. 20 of them will receive a Trapidil eluting stent
      (Intrepide™ stent), 20 will receive a Paclitaxel eluting stent (Taxus™ stent). After 90 days
      the patients who were treated with the INTREPIDE stent in the first lesion will be treated
      with the Taxus stent in the second lesion. After 90 days the patients who were treated with
      the Taxus stent in the first lesion will be treated with the INTREPIDE stent in the second
      lesion.

      Coronary angiography will be performed through the femoral (groin) or radial (wrist) artery
      with the use of standard techniques. The doctor will determine if the patient is qualified
      for enrolment at the end of the diagnostic coronary angiogram

    <description>The INTREPIDE coronary stent system consists of a balloon expandable stent coated with two layers of Trapidil and parylene. The Trapidil eluting stent is pre-mounted on a Nimbus PCTA balloon and is intended for use in the treatment of CAD.
The controlled release of Trapidil is achieved through the parylene barrier, locally delivering the drug to the target lesion, inhibiting smooth muscle cell proliferation and hence neointimal hyperplasia.</description>
