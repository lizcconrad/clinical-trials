      The purposes of this study are to:

        -  Determine the effect of the study drug on sperm and semen of healthy young male
           subjects.

        -  Determine the effect of age on the amount of study drug in the blood of healthy subjects

        -  Learn about the safety of the study drug.

        -  Learn how subjects tolerate the study drug.

      This single-center, open-label, non-randomized, two-cohort, single-dose pharmacokinetic study
      will be conducted at a single site in the United States, in which at least 18 young (18-45
      years, inclusive) male subjects in Cohort A and 14 elderly (65 years or older) males in
      Cohort B will be enrolled and dosed to achieve a total of at least 14 completed young
      subjects and 12 elderly subjects. Seminal fluid and plasma will be collected from Cohort A,
      whereas only plasma samples will be collected from Cohort B.
