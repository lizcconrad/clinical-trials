      This study aims to compare two different follow up regimens with different test intensity in
      endometrial cancer treated patients.

      If eligibility criteria are satisfied and the written informed consensus is obtained,
      patients are stratified inside the centre according to their risk level:

        -  Group 1 : patients at low risk of recurrence [stage IA G1 and stage IA G2]

        -  Group 2 : patients at high-risk of recurrence [≥ stage IA G3] (Ethics Committee
           amendment of 14th September 2010, use new 2010 FIGO classification for endometrial
           cancer!)

      In each group patients will be randomized in two regimens of follow up:

        1. Minimalist (Arm 1)

        2. Intensive (Arm 2)

      Features of each arm are listed in &quot;Arms&quot; item.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The procedure for centralized randomization, with blocks of variable length, will take place
      within each layer with 1:1 ratio and will be implemented within the centralized database,
      with sequences generated by dedicated software. The recruitment and randomization has to be
      registered on the website (www.epiclin.cpo.it) no later than 20 days after histological
      examination has been received. If patients do not need any kind of adjuvant therapy they will
      start follow-up program according to the regimen chosen for them at randomization, if
      adjuvant therapy is needed the patient at first will be registered and the randomization will
      be deferred at the end of treatment.

      In presence of symptoms or signs detected during the clinical visit which may suppose a
      recurrence or in presence of abnormal tests, the clinician has to prescribe all medical tests
      and examinations required. The tests carried out in addition to follow-up scheduled program
      must be reported in the database. Nevertheless patients continue to be followed for the
      assessment of the performance status at 5 years, but the follow-up schedule is up to the
      clinician. An interim analysis is scheduled in 3.5 years starting from the beginning of
      recruitment (based on approximately 1 / 3 of the total expected events, when about 4 / 5
      cases have already been enrolled). Patients will be stratified by recruitment Center, by
      level of risk (calculated according to the stage of the disease, the histotype and the
      grading) and by type of treatment performed.

      The focus of the study is to:

        -  Compare the effect of two FU regimens on 5-years OS

        -  Evaluate the difference in diagnosis anticipation

        -  Evaluate the difference in terms of recurrences

        -  Describe the compliance and QoL of patients

        -  Evaluate the cost-effectiveness and the cost-utility
