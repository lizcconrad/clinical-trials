  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with heroin and prescription opioid dependence are at increased risk for adverse
      health consequences and often utilize the Emergency Department (ED) as their source of
      medical care. Screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment has been effective in
      decreasing high risk behaviors such as alcohol and tobacco use, and unsafe sexual practices.
      The data on the effectiveness of brief interventions with opioid dependence is limited. This
      prospective, randomized controlled trial of opioid dependent subjects (N=360) will compare
      two models of brief intervention with a control condition. ED patients with opioid dependence
      will be randomized to either: (1)Screening, Brief Intervention with a Facilitated Referral to
      Treatment (SBIRT); (2) Screening, Brief Intervention with ED initiated Buprenorphine
      Treatment (SBI+Bup); or (3) standard care (SC) which includes a handout detailing substance
      abuse treatment centers in the area. The primary outcome will be self-reported engagement in
      formal substance abuse treatment at 30 days, verified by contact with the treatment program.
      Other outcomes measured at 30 days, 2, 6 and 12 months include changes in opioid use
      (self-report and urine toxicology analysis), HIV risk behaviors, and health care service
      utilization. The three interventions will also be compared on their cost-effectiveness. We
      will test the hypotheses that SBI+Bup will be superior to SBIRT and SC, and SBIRT will be
      superior to SC in (1)increasing the proportion of patients engaged in formal substance abuse
      treatment at 30 days; (2) reducing illicit opioid use; (3) reducing HIV risk behaviors; and
      (4) reducing health care service utilization. In addition, we hypothesize that the societal
      costs of SBI+Bup, per number of days of opioid abstinence, will be cost effective relative to
      SBIRT or SC; and that SBIRT will be cost effective relative to SC. Data analyses will be
      conducted on the intention to treat sample of randomized patients. This study, conducted by a
      research team with extensive experience evaluating brief interventions and treatments for
      opioid dependence, will be unique in its: (1) comparison of two models of brief intervention
      with standard care; (2) inclusion of an ED initiated treatment arm; (3) use of manual-guided
      interventions with systematic assessment of adherence and competence; and (4)collection of
      detailed cost data to help guide future healthcare policy.

Brief Intervention with Buprenorphine initiation: Brief Negotiated Intervention is a manual-guided therapy designed for ED setting. Purpose- to assist patients recognize/change drug use and HIV risks. It combines techniques based on motivational interviewing and a stage-model of change. Goal- to decrease subject's ambivalence about accepting ED initiated buprenorphine treatment. Patients inducted onto buprenorphine in ED or home, based on level of withdrawal. ED induction goal- 8 mg first day. Home induction goal- 8 mg first day. Subjects receive supportive counseling and education by trained nurses in the PCC (seen within 24-72 hours of their ED visit). Following an initial 45-minute evaluation, the physician will administer Primary Care Management (PCM) weekly for 2 weeks, then every 2 weeks for 4 weeks and then monthly.</description>

Brief Intervention: Brief Negotiated Intervention (BNI) is a manual-guided therapy that is designed to be feasible in the ED setting. The purpose of the BNI is to assist patients in recognizing and changing their drug use and HIV risk behaviors. It combines techniques based on motivational interviewing and a stage-model of change. The main goal of the interview is to decrease the subject's ambivalence about signing up for a formal drug treatment program.</description>

Brief Intervention with Buprenorphine initiation: Brief Negotiated Intervention is a manual-guided therapy designed for ED setting. Purpose- to assist patients recognize/change drug use and HIV risks. It combines techniques based on motivational interviewing and a stage-model of change. Goal- to decrease subject's ambivalence about accepting ED initiated buprenorphine treatment. Patients inducted onto buprenorphine in ED or home, based on level of withdrawal. ED induction goal- 8 mg first day. Home induction goal- 8 mg first day. Subjects receive supportive counseling and education by trained nurses in the PCC (seen within 24-72 hours of their ED visit). Following an initial 45-minute evaluation, the physician will administer Primary Care Management (PCM) weekly for 2 weeks, then every 2 weeks for 4 weeks and then monthly.</description>
