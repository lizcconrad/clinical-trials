    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the correlation of vascular parameters, including
      genetic factors as well as ocular blood flow parameters against the progression rate of
      glaucomatous damage in patients with progressive OAG.

    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is one of the most common causes of blindness in the industrialized nations. For a
      long time glaucoma has been defined as a disease in which high intraocular pressure (IOP)
      leads to irreversible optic disc damage and subsequent visual field loss. However, recent
      investigations show that IOP is not the only factor that is involved in the glaucomatous
      process leading to retinal ganglion cell death. The role of vascular factors in the
      pathogenesis of glaucoma has recently received much attention based on animal experiments and
      epidemiological studies. Genes with products that are involved in the regulation of blood
      flow to ocular tissues may also be considered plausible candidates as a contributory factor
      in the development of glaucoma. Little is, however, known about a potential association
      between glaucomatous optic neuropathy and glaucomatous visual field defects and optic nerve
      head blood flow in patients with progressive open angle glaucoma (OAG). The current study
      seeks to gain insight into this association by assessing ocular blood flow parameters with a
      number of noninvasive technologies.
