  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) is important for tumor growth in
      neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). It is known that tumors make a protein called vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and there are higher levels of VEGF in the tumors and blood
      of many patients with NF2. VEGF stimulates the formation of blood vessels that supply the
      tumor with nutrients and oxygen. PTC299 is an oral drug that has been shown to decrease
      production of VEGF in animal models of human cancer. In these animal models, oral PTC299
      administration decreases VEGF levels in the tumor and in the bloodstream, decreases blood
      vessel numbers in the tumor, and significantly slows or halts tumor growth. Safety studies in
      research animals indicate good tolerability at doses and drug levels that are higher than
      those planned for the clinical studies. Results from Phase 1a studies in healthy volunteers
      indicate that PTC299 achieves levels of PTC299 in the bloodstream that are known to be active
      in animal models of human tumor. This Phase 2 study is designed to test the hypothesis that
      PTC299 will be tolerable and will show evidence of VEGF reduction, antitumor activity, and
      hearing improvement when administered orally to patients with NF2.

      The study will be conducted in 2 stages. In Stage 1 of the study, 11 patients will receive
      daily treatment with PTC299 administered at 100 mg/dose twice per day for up to 1 year or
      until tumor progression. If no subject responds with tumor shrinkage or an improvement in
      hearing, then the study will be stopped. If ≥1 out of 11 subjects respond, then the study
      will proceed to Stage 2 to enroll an additional 14 subjects for a total of 25 subjects.
