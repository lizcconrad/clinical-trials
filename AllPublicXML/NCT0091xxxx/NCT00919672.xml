  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) has become a well-established treatment for patients with
      fecal incontinence since 1995. The mechanism of action of SNS is still not fully understood
      but recent studies have shown that the motility of the whole colon is modulated during the
      stimulation. This modulation of the colonic motility could be a potential mechanism of an
      action to relieve the symptoms in patients with IBS.

      Twenty eight patients with IBS will be enrolled in the study. They have to meet the ROME III
      criteria, and also satisfy the criteria for implantation of a neurostimulator.

      After a post implantation period where the programming of the neurostimulator is optimised,
      the patient is randomized in a double blinded design to receive either ON-OFF or OFF-ON
      stimulation in a 2-month period.

      At the end of each period (ON/OFF) the patient will be examined with Magnet Tracking System
      (MTS) for motility and with impedance planimetry including thermal stimulation (circulating
      water)for multimodal sensory testing of the rectum.

      This is based on the study hypothesis that the motility of the small intestine and the colon
      is changed in IBS patients according to their subtype (Diarrhoea-IBS, Constipation-IBS and
      Disordered bowel habit-IBS) compared to healthy persons. And that SNS will affect the
      motility of the small intestine and the colon in IBS patients as well as SNS will affect the
      perception of pain/discomfort in the rectum in IBS patients.

      The effect of ON-OFF-sacral nerve stimulation on the IBS patients and thereby their IBS
      symptoms will also be evaluated by an IBS score (GSRS-IBS)and on quality of life by an IBS
      Impact Scale (IBS-IS) as well as the significance of placebo effect in the treatment of
      patients with IBS with SNS will be evaluated.
