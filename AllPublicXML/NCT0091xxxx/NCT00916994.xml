      Title: One-arm, international, multi-center with competitive recruitment, prospective study
      to assess the safety and efficacy of OrthoSpace's InSpace™ in rotator cuff tear subjects
      scheduled for surgery of the rotator cuff - A pivotal study

      Device: OrthoSpace's Biodegradable Implanted Balloon (InSpace)

      Study population: Rotator Cuff tear subjects scheduled for arthroscopy.

      Number of subjects: Up to 70 subject for data analysis.

      Number of sites: At least 4 sites in Israel.

      Main Inclusion criteria: Informed consent, diagnosed with Rotator Cuff tear.

      Main Exclusion criteria: Former surgery on affected shoulder, sever illness, significant
      shoulder co morbidities.

      Follow up period: 12 months. Visits at hospital before discharge at 1-2 days post
      implantation, 7-10 days post implantation, 3 weeks post implantation, 6 weeks post
      implantation, 3,6 and 12 months post implantation.

      Primary goal: To assess the safety of the SpaceGuard in Rotator Cuff tear subjects.

      Secondary goals: To assess the effectiveness of the SpaceGuard in the study population. The
      effectiveness will be assessed by terms of good positioning of the SpaceGuard and subsequent
      follow-up non migration, surgeon satisfaction, pain relief and time to pain relief, Range of
      Motion (ROM) and time to ROM with the SpaceGuard.

      Primary end point: Serious Adverse Event rate related to the device and/or system
      complication.

      Secondary end points: Surgeon dissatisfaction following the deployment of SpaceGuard,
      migration of the balloon shown by ultrasound/ X-ray/MRI at relevant follow-up visits, lost of
      ROM and pain enhancement.
