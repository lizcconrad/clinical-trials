    <textblock>
      Primary objective of the study is to investigate the efficacy of vorinostat in patients
      suffering from selected histological types of soft tissue sarcoma. Further evaluations relate
      to the safety and tolerability of vorinostat, its pharmacokinetics (course of plasma
      concentration over time) and pharmacodynamics (mode of action). Only subjects with advanced,
      metastatic disease will be included in this trail.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment with vorinostat will be administered daily over 28 days. This period will be
      referred to as a therapy cycle. Two consecutive therapy cycles will be separated by a 7-days
      therapy break. In case of a good response and no relevant side effects, the treatment with
      vorinostat can be continued for up to 1 year after begin of the treatment. If any relevant
      side effects or intolerability occur, the dose and/or schedule of administration will be
      modified according to the pre-defined criteria.
