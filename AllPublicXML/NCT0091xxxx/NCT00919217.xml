  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' overall hypothesis is that appearance or worsening of relapsing-remitting
      multiple sclerosis (RR-MS) symptoms are affected by various factors including stress,
      hormonal cycles, illness and missed medications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluctuations in MS symptoms in women with RR-MS might be affected by a variety of factors. To
      determine which factors are important, we are asking subjects to fill out a diary and
      calendar on a daily basis for 90 days. After an initial instructional meeting over the phone,
      the materials are filled out at home and returned monthly via postage-paid envelopes provided
      by the study. Compensation ($10 gift card) is sent after each monthly diary is received. The
      diary includes a list of symptoms and a rank scale for the women to show subtle changes in MS
      symptoms. The calendar allows the subject to denote additional factors such as stress,
      hormonal cycles, illnesses or immunizations and changed or missed medications. We anticipate
      that statistical analysis will reveal which of these factors affect women with
      relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.
