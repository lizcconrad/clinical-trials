      The objectives of this study are to assess the effect of salbutamol in comparison with
      ipratropium bromide on the geometry of central and peripheral airways and to correlate
      spirometric indices with the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based calculated airway
      volumes and resistances for both compounds.

      Salbutamol (VentolinTM) is a short acting beta agonist (SABA) which is used to treat
      wheezing, dyspnea and breathing difficulties caused by asthma and COPD. Further, it is also
      used to prevent bronchospasm during exercise.

      Ipratropium bromide (Atrovent® HFA) is a short acting anticholinergic bronchodilator (short
      acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA)) that improves lung function, dyspnea, exercise tolerance
      and health-related quality of life in patients with COPD. Studies have also shown that
      ipratropium bromide might reduce COPD exacerbations and related hospitalisations because the
      extended bronchodilatation might reduce infection rates by improving clearance of respiratory
      secretions.

      In this open, randomized, two-way crossover, pilot study the effect of salbutamol in patients
      with moderate and severe COPD will be examined in comparison with the effects of ipratropium
      bromide. These patients will receive 400 µg salbutamol and 80 µg ipratropium bromide in a
      randomized crossover design.

      The objectives of this study are to assess the effect of salbutamol in comparison with
      ipratropium bromide on the geometry of central and peripheral airways and to correlate
      spirometric indices (as Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) and Tiffeneau index)
      with the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based calculated airway volumes and resistances
      for both compounds.
