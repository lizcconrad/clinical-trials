  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label multi-center to evaluate the tolerability of treatment with
      NGX-4010 use with pre-patch topical application of a topical anesthetic cream. This is an
      open-label study. No hypothesis testing will be performed.

      Eligible subjects will have PHN and a level of pain at an intensity level deemed appropriate
      for open-label treatment with NGX-4010, as judged by the Investigator. Painful areas of up to
      a maximum of 1000 cm2 will be pre-treated with lidocaine (2.5%)/prilocaine (2.5%) cream for
      60 minutes followed by a single, 60-minute application of NGX-4010. Subjects may be on
      chronic pain medication regimens, but currently will not be using any topical pain
      medications on the affected areas, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, menthol,
      methyl salicylate, local anesthetics including Lidoderm® (lidocaine patch 5%), steroids or
      capsaicin.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Between 18 and 90 years of age, inclusive.

          2. Be in good health.

          3. Prior diagnosis of PHN with pain persisting at least 3 months following shingles
             vesicle crusting.

          4. Pain due to PHN that, in the opinion of the investigator, is of appropriate severity
             for treatment with NGX-4010. The subject should have completed at least 3 NPRS scores.

          5. Intact, unbroken skin over the painful area(s) to be treated.

          6. Female subjects with child-bearing potential must have a negative serum beta hCG
             pregnancy test, to be performed at the Screening Visit.

          7. All subjects must be willing to use effective methods of birth control and/or refrain
             from participating in a conception process during the study and for 30 days following
             study termination.

          8. Be willing and able to comply with protocol requirements for the duration of study
             participation. (Such requirements include, but are not limited to: attending all study
             visits, refraining from elective surgery or extensive travel during study
             participation.)

          9. Subjects must sign an informed consent form for this study approved by the IRB. -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Receipt of NGX-4010 open label or blinded study patches within 12 weeks of the Study
             Patch Application Visit (Day 0).

          2. Concomitant opioid medication, unless orally or transdermally administered and not
             exceeding a total daily dose of morphine 60 mg/day, or equivalent. Parenteral opioid
             use is excluded, regardless of dose.

          3. Unavailability of an effective pain medication strategy for the subject, such as
             unwillingness to use opioid analgesics during study treatment, or high tolerance to
             opioids precluding the ability to relieve treatment-associated discomfort with
             oxycodone or other analgesic, as judged by the Investigator.

          4. Active substance abuse or history of chronic substance abuse within the past year, or
             prior chronic substance abuse (including alcoholism) judged likely to recur during the
             study period by the investigator.

          5. Recent use (within 7 days preceding the Study Patch Application Visit [Day 0]) of any
             topically applied pain medication, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
             menthol, methyl salicylate, local anesthetics (including Lidoderm®), steroids or
             capsaicin products on the painful areas.

             anti-arrhythmic drugs.

          8. Significant pain of an etiology other than PHN, for example, compression-related
             neuropathies (e.g., spinal stenosis), fibromyalgia or arthritis. Subjects must not
             have significant ongoing pain from other cause(s) that may interfere with judging PHN
             related pain.

          9. Neuropathic pain areas located only on the face, above the hairline of the scalp,
             and/or in proximity to mucous membranes

         10. Patients with congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia

         11. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiencies

         12. Uncontrolled (systolic blood pressure ≥ 175 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥105
             mmHg) or unstable hypertension

         13. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease defined as cerebrovascular accident,
             transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stable angina,
             current arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, any heart surgery including coronary
             artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous coronary angioplasty/stent placement, or
             valvular heart disease within the past 6 months

         14. Clinically significant abnormal ECG at screening.

         15. Clinically significant abnormal labs at screening.

             pulmonary function.

         17. Active malignancy or past history of malignancy during the past 5 years (history of
             squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma of the skin are exempted from the
             exclusion criteria except if they occurred in the area of treatment).

         18. Any implanted medical device (spinal cord stimulator, intrathecal pump or peripheral
             nerve stimulator) for the treatment of neuropathic pain.

         19. Hypersensitivity to capsaicin (i.e., chili peppers or Over-the-Counter (OTC) capsaicin
             products), or any components of the capsaicin patch, Cleansing Gel, oxycodone,
             hydrocodone, or adhesives.

             ability to complete daily pain diaries requiring recall of average pain level in the
             past 24 hours.
