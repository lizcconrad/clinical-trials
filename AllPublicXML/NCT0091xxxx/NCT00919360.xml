      The purpose of this study is to figure out some of the differences in bodily function between
      women who have preeclampsia and those who do not.

        -  This may eventually lead to an understanding of its cause. At this time, there is no
           known way to prevent preeclampsia, and the cause is not known.

        -  The only treatment is delivery of the baby, even if it is premature, in order to
           decrease the risk to the mother.

      -  Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-related disorder that occurs in about 6% of all pregnancies.

        -  In its mild for, preeclampsia involves high blood pressure. More severe forms of
           preeclampsia can lead to more serious pregnancy complications.

        -  At this time, there is no known way to prevent preeclampsia, and the cause is not known.
           The only treatment is delivery of the baby, even if it is premature, in order to
           decrease the risk to the mother.
