      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to
      fatigue.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at biological markers of fatigue in women with
      residual invasive breast cancer enrolled on clinical trial NSABP-B-45.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To collect serial blood specimens at each time point that quality of life and
           patient-reported outcome assessments are performed in women with residual invasive
           breast cancer concurrently enrolled on and participating in the Behavioral and Health
           Outcomes component of clinical trial NSABP-B-45.

        -  To prepare, separate, and store the blood specimens at the NSABP Serum Bank at Baylor
           College of Medicine Breast Center into components for future DNA, RNA, and plasma
           analysis.

        -  To analyze specific proinflammatory cytokines, genetic polymorphisms, and RNA expression
           arrays in collaborating laboratories at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

        -  To examine the association between markers of inflammation and symptoms of fatigue among
           patients treated with sunitinib malate or placebo on clinical trial NSABP-B-45.

        -  To examine the relationship between single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter
           regions of IL-1 and IL-6 and symptoms of fatigue in these patients.

        -  To examine the relationship between RNA expression profiles and fatigue and compare the
           pattern of expression in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection* at baseline and then at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months
      for analysis of plasma concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers (IL-1ra, sTNFRII, sIL-6R,
      and C-reactive protein) by ELISA; DNA polymorphisms in the promoter regions of IL-6 and IL-1
      by TaqMan PCR; and RNA gene expression signaling pathways by RT-PCR assays and microarray.

      NOTE: *Blood samples are collected at the same time points that the Behavioral and Health
      Outcomes quality of life and patient-reported outcomes questionnaires are completed on
      clinical trial NSABP-B-45.
