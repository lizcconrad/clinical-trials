      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as MRI, may help doctors predict a patient's response
      to treatment and help plan the best treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying MRI in predicting response to sunitinib malate in
      patients with stage IV kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Correlate tumor vascular permeability by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE MRI) with
           clinical outcome in patients with stage IV renal cell carcinoma treated with sunitinib
           malate.

        -  Correlate genetic and histologic characteristics of the primary tumor with vascular
           permeability by DCE-MRI.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate genetic and histologic characteristics of the primary tumor with clinical
           outcome in patients treated with sunitinib malate.

        -  Collect tissue samples for potential future exploratory analyses of pharmacokinetic and
           pharmacogenomic parameters.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI at baseline and after the first 4 weeks of
      sunitinib malate.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study for pharmacokinetic
      analysis and for analysis of angiogenic growth factor levels. Tumor tissue samples are
      collected at baseline for mutation analysis and for assessment of angiogenesis histology by
      IHC.
