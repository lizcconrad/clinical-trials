    <textblock>
      The objectives of this post-surveillance study are to continue to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of the H.E.L.P. System. The safety and effectiveness will be assessed by
      evaluating the occurrence of death, cardiovascular events or interventions, angina, and
      serious unanticipated adverse effects. Laboratory assessments will be made to document
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction and any effects on other blood
      components. Quality of life assessments will also be made.

      The study will also assess the modifications to the H.E.L.P. System, including:

        -  use of a single heparin adsorber, instead of two smaller adsorbers;

        -  change in the supplier of the ultrafilter (from Secon to Toray);

        -  reduction in the number of blood lines from eleven to nine;

        -  change from a single-layer to a two-layer precipitate filter.

      The safety and efficacy of the device specific to these modifications will be evaluated by
      comparing the safety and efficacy data from the patient registry to the data from the initial
      clinical study on the device as originally designed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      H.E.L.P. therapy is indicated for use in treating patients with familial hypercholesterolemia
      (FH) who have undergone six months of optimal diet and drug therapy and whose LDL-C level
      remains &gt; 300 mg/dl in the absence of CHD or &gt; 200 mg/dl with documented CHD. These patients
      are divided into three subgroups of interest:

        -  Group A: functional hypercholesterolemic homozygotes with LDL-C &gt; 500mg/dl;

        -  Group B: functional hypercholesterolemic heterozygotes with LDL-C &gt; 300mg/dl;

        -  Group C: functional hypercholesterolemic heterozygotes with LDL-C &gt; 200mg/dl and
           documented CHD.

      Optimal diet therapy is defined as having received instruction by a trained dietitian in the
      use of a diet meeting the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Step 2 criteria (&lt;
      30% of calories as fat, &lt; 7% of calories as saturated fat, and &lt; 200 mg of dietary
      cholesterol per day). Optimal drug therapy is defined as having been tried on at least two
      separate classes of effective serum LDL-C lowering agents (&gt;15% reduction) as currently
      available for at least six months. These drugs include hydroxy methyl glutaryl (HMG) CoA
      reductase inhibitors, fibric acid derivatives, niacin, and anion exchange resins. These
      agents should be used in combination at maximal doses as tolerated by the patient under the
      supervision of their treating physician to monitor side effects.

      Documented coronary heart disease (CHD) includes documentation of coronary heart disease by
      coronary angiography or a history of myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass
      surgery (CABG), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or alternative
      revascularization procedure (e.g., atherectomy or stent), or progressive angina documented by
      exercise or non-exercise stress test.

      The primary criteria for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the device will be:

        -  Occurrence of Death

             -  cardiovascular deaths

             -  non-cardiovascular deaths

            <description>The H.E.L.P. System is a device composed of multiple modules and their associated disposables which can selectively and continuously remove LDL-cholesterol from plasma by precipitating the LDL-cholesterol with high concentrations of heparin in an acidic buffer and returning the plasma to the patient. Procedure steps:
Flushing the system with normal saline.
Filtering whole blood through a 0.2 micron plasma filter for continuous plasma removal.
Mixing the plasma with an equal volume of acetate buffer containing heparin.
Precipitation of LDL as a complex with heparin.
Removing the LDL-heparin precipitate by continuous circulation through a filter.
Removing heparin with use of a heparin adsorber.
Bicarbonate dialysis and ultrafiltration to produce an LDL-free plasma without excess heparin.
Re-mixing the LDL-free plasma with blood coming from the plasma filter and returning the reconstituted blood to the patient.</description>
