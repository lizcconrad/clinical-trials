      The purpose of this study is to compare 5-year disease free survival rate (DFS rate) between
      the hormone receptor positive breast cancer patients who were added Goserelin to Tamoxifen
      for ovarian function suppression after neo-/adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy and the hormone
      receptor positive breast cancer patients who were treated with Tamoxifen.

      -  To compare overall Survival(OS) between the patients added Goserelin(ZOLADEXTM) to
           Tamoxifen and the patients treated with Tamoxifen alone in premenopausal status

        -  To compare 5-year disease free survival rate (DFS rate) between the patients who took
           tamoxifen only in postmenopause and the patients added Goserelin(ZOLADEXTM) to Tamoxifen
           for inducing ovarian function suppression in premenopause

        -  To determine the tolerability and safety of Tamoxifen with or without concomitant
           Zoladex

    <description>Patients should be premenopausal women ,prior to the start of chemotherapy, less than or equal to 45 years of age with oestrogen receptor positive ± progesterone receptor positive who have undergone a primary mass excision, received an neo-/adjuvant chemotherapy ± radiotherapy for their stage I, II or III breast cancer. This arm is ovarian suppression group which have a various starting time of ovarian function suppression after neo-/adjuvant chemotherapy.
Ovarian function suppression will be done by administration of LHRH agonist (ZOLADEXTM) for 2 years. After that, the patients will complete taking tamoxifen 20mg/day for 5 years.</description>

    <description>Patients, less than or equal to 45 years of age with hormone receptor positive breast cancer will be enrolled. Included All the patients have already treated by surgery, neo- or adjuvant chemotherapy ±and/or radiotherapy before enrolment. At 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months since the baseline asTsessment(0), the ovarian function status will be evaluated by menstruation status or serum FSH level. If the patients are regarded as the premenopausal women, they will be randomized into the additional ovarian function suppression group or tamoxifen only group. The latter will complete taking tamoxifen 20mg/day for 5 years.</description>

    <description>Patients, less than or equal to 45 years of age with hormone receptor positive breast cancer will be enrolled. Included All the patients have already treated by surgery, neo- or adjuvant chemotherapy ±and/or radiotherapy before enrolment. Eligible patients except for premenopausal status at the baseline will be followed up until 2 years after the baseline assessment for evaluating the menopausal status. This group still remains to postmenopausal status and will taking tamoxifen 20mg/day for 5 years if they remain in the study.</description>
