  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to determine if the concentration of local anesthetic through a
      catheter next to the nerves that go to the hip that is undergoing surgery, affects muscle
      strength and sense of touch experienced after surgery. This study is looking at the varying
      concentrations of local anesthetic placed through the catheter.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      These results will help define the optimal concentration of local anesthetic used for
      continuous peripheral nerve blocks and help guide future research in this clinically-relevant
      area.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quadriceps femoris muscle strength, by measuring the maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC). The difference in MVIC on POD1 compared with the preoperative MVIC, expressed as a percentage of the preoperative MVIC.</measure>

    <measure>Hip adductor strength, evaluated in sitting position using the same technique as described for the primary outcome measure.</measure>

    <measure>Hip flexor strength, evaluated in the supine position using the same technique as described for the primary outcome measure.</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sensory level, evaluated in the seated position, the current through TES is increased from 0mV until the patient describes mild discomfort and the current is then recorded.</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ambulatory ability, evaluated using the 100-foot walk test and the six minute walk test. Afer patients walk 100 feet, they will continue to walk for six minutes and the total distance will be recorded.</measure>

    <measure>Weight bearing, evaluated using a standard scale to demonstrate the correct amount of weight to place on an operative extremity.</measure>
