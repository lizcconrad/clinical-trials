  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial will evaluate the impact of adding
      everolimus to the combination of weekly paclitaxel plus bevacizumab in the first-line
      treatment of women with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Patients will be randomized
      (1:1) to receive either paclitaxel/bevacizumab/everolimus (Treatment Arm 1) or paclitaxel/
      bevacizumab/placebo (Treatment Arm 2). Patients will be evaluated for response to treatment
      every 8 weeks; responding and/or stable patients will continue treatment, with re-evaluations
      every 8 weeks, until tumor progression or

      intolerable toxicity occurs. Outcomes will be assessed for each treatment arm

      separately. This trial is not intended to compare treatment arms primarily. Any such analyses
      are exploratory and will be conducted without adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing.
