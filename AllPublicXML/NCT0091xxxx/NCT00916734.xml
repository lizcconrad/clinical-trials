  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients who meet the criteria of the
      clinical prediction rule for spinal manipulation may respond more favorably to repeated
      exercises according to a direction of preference (what makes the symptoms decrease). The
      investigators do not know which of these two commonly-used treatments (manipulation or
      specific exercise) is better to treat low back pain.

      With the trends in health care focusing on treatment effectiveness, it is important for
      physical therapists to select the most appropriate intervention according to patient
      classification. Physical therapy interventions for management of LBP include therapeutic
      exercises and spinal manipulation.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients who fit the Clinical Prediction
      Rule (CPR) for spinal manipulation may respond instead to exercise according to repeated
      lumbar movements in the direction of preference.

      The subjects for this study will be comprised of individuals referred for treatment of low
      back pain and data will be collected by physical therapists with certification in MDT who had
      experience treating patients through the use of spinal manipulation. Patient functional
      questionnaires and impairment measures will be used to analyze the patient's perceived level
      of function and outcome.

      Following the completion of an informed consent, subjects will undergo a physical therapy
      examination by a licensed physical therapist. Patients will be included in the study if they
      meet the CPR for spinal manipulation as describe in earlier research 6,11. Following the
      examination, all qualified subjects will be randomly assigned to either the (1) spinal
      manipulation group or (2) the McKenzie (MDT) group and will receive treatment in accordance
      with their assigned group. The assessment tools administered at the initial examination will
      be readministered for follow-up analysis.
