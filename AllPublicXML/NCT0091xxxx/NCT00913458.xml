    <measure>Number of Participants That Met Sustained Remission at Week 76 and Week 91 Based on DAS28 Score</measure>
    <time_frame>76 and 91 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sustained remission was defined as a DAS28 &lt;2.6 at the Week 76 and Week 91 visits without requiring a corticosteroid boost between the Week 52 and Week 64 visits, where the requirement for a corticosteroid boost was defined as a value of DAS28 &gt;3.2 at either the Week 56 or Week 64 visit.
DAS28 calculated from the number of swollen joints (SJC) and painful joints (PJC) using the 28 joints count, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (millimeters per hour [mm/hour]) and patient's global assessment (PGA) of disease activity.
The participants who met sustained remission in both Week 76 and 91 are presented here.</description>

Four scores are derived:percentage of absenteeism, percentage of presenteeism (reduced productivity while at work),overall work impairment score that combined absenteeism and presenteeism and percentage of impairment in activities performed outside of work. Scores scaled as 0 (not affected/no impairment) to 10 (completely affected/impaired). Higher scores indicated greater impairment and less productivity. The raw scores (0-10) are converted to percents (the variable is named &quot;Percent impairment While Working&quot;) and as such range from 0 to 100.</description>

    <description>WPAI: 6 question participant rated questionnaire determined the degree to which rheumatoid arthritis affected work productivity while at work and affected activities outside of work. Scores scaled as 0 (not affected/no impairment) to 10 (completely affected/impaired). Higher scores = greater impairment and less productivity. The raw (0-10) scores were converted to percent (the variable is named &quot;Percent impairment While Working&quot;) and as such range from 0 to 100.</description>

    <description>WPAI: 6 question participant rated questionnaire to determine the degree to which rheumatoid arthritis affected work productivity while at work and affected activities outside of work. Four scores are derived: percentage of absenteeism, percentage of presenteeism (reduced productivity while at work), an overall work impairment score that combined absenteeism and presenteeism and percentage of impairment in activities performed outside of work. Scores scaled as 0 (not affected/no impairment) to 10 (completely affected/impaired). Higher scores indicated greater impairment and less productivity. The raw (0-10) scores are converted to percents (the variable is named &quot;Percent impairment While Working&quot;) and as such range from 0 to 100.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This report presents the results of open-label 52-week treatment period (Phase 1), 39 week, double blind randomized (Phase 2) and 26 week observational period (Phase 3) part of a 121 week Phase 4 study program. Responders in Phase 1 were randomized to 3 arms (1:1:1 ratio) in Phase 2. Responders in Phase 2, continued to Phase 3 observational period</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Phase 1 responders, defined as subjects with Disease Activity Score based on 28-joints count (DAS28) ≤ 3.2 at Week 39 and DAS28 &lt;2.6 at Week 52, were randomized to Phase 2. The responders of Phase 2 were observed for 26-weeks in Phase 3 study that include 2 to 4 week period of double blind treatment taper of MTX followed by observational period</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>ETN 50 QW + MTX (Phase 1)</title>
          <description>Phase 1 was a 52-week open-label, single-arm period in which all subjects were treated with etanercept (ETN) 50 mg once weekly plus methotrexate (MTX). MTX starting dose was 10 mg per week and could increase by 5 mg per week increments up to Week 8, and up to a maximum of 25 mg per week. Participants with Disease Activity Score based on 28-joints count [DAS28] ≤3.2 at Week 39 and DAS28 &lt;2.6 at Week 52 classified as a phase 1 responder, and will continue to Phase 2 study.</description>

          <title>E25 + MTX (Phase 2)</title>
          <description>In Phase 2 E25 + MTX arm, Etanercept 25 milligram (mg) was administered once weekly as a subcutaneous injection using the 25 mg pre filled syringe. Methotrexate was administered once weekly as oral capsules. All subjects received a dose of methotrexate during this Phase 2 study that was equal to their optimal methotrexate dose in earlier Phase 1 study. The subjects received the study treatment for 39 weeks, unless the subject was evaluated as non-responder at Week 64 or Week 76 and discontinued the study. Participants in sustained remission (Disease Activity Score based on 28-joints count [DAS28] &lt;2.6) or with low disease activity (2.6 ≤ DAS28 ≤ 3.2) at Week 91 were classified as Phase 2 responder, and will continue to Phase 3 study.</description>

          <title>MTX + PBO (Phase 2)</title>
          <description>In Phase 2 MTX + PBO arm, the weekly dose of etanercept was tapered from the 50 mg dosage. At Week 52, subjects assigned to this arm received a double blinded 25 mg dose of etanercept as a subcutaneous injection using a pre filled syringe. All weekly doses thereafter (ie, Weeks 53 to 90) were administered as an etanercept matching placebo injection using a pre-filled syringe. Methotrexate was administered once weekly as oral capsules. All subjects received a dose of methotrexate during this Phase 2 study that was equal to their optimal methotrexate dose in earlier Phase 1 study. The subjects received the study treatment for 39 weeks, unless the subject was evaluated as non-responder at Week 64 or Week 76 and discontinued the study. Participants in sustained remission (Disease Activity Score based on 28-joints count [DAS28] &lt;2.6) or with low disease activity (2.6 ≤ DAS28 ≤ 3.2) at Week 91 were classified as Phase 2 responder, and will continue to Phase 3 study.</description>

          <description>In Phase 2 Placebo (PBO) arm, the weekly dose of etanercept was tapered from the 50 mg dosage to a placebo injection. At Week 52, subjects assigned to this arm received a double blinded 25 mg dose of etanercept as a subcutaneous injection using a pre filled syringe. All weekly doses thereafter (ie, Weeks 53 to 90) were administered as an etanercept-matching placebo injection using a pre-filled syringe.
Methotrexate-matching placebo was administered once weekly as oral capsules. The subjects received the study treatment for 39 weeks, unless the subject was evaluated as non-responder at Week 64 or Week 76 and discontinued the study. Participants in sustained remission (Disease Activity Score based on 28-joints count [DAS28] &lt;2.6) or with low disease activity (2.6 ≤ DAS28 ≤ 3.2) at Week 91 were classified as Phase 2 responder, and will continue to Phase 3 study.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants That Met Sustained Remission at Week 76 and Week 91 Based on DAS28 Score</title>
        <description>Sustained remission was defined as a DAS28 &lt;2.6 at the Week 76 and Week 91 visits without requiring a corticosteroid boost between the Week 52 and Week 64 visits, where the requirement for a corticosteroid boost was defined as a value of DAS28 &gt;3.2 at either the Week 56 or Week 64 visit.
DAS28 calculated from the number of swollen joints (SJC) and painful joints (PJC) using the 28 joints count, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (millimeters per hour [mm/hour]) and patient's global assessment (PGA) of disease activity.
The participants who met sustained remission in both Week 76 and 91 are presented here.</description>

            <description>In Phase 2 E25 + MTX arm, Etanercept 25 milligram (mg) was administered once weekly as a subcutaneous injection using the 25 mg pre filled syringe. Methotrexate was administered once weekly as oral capsules. All subjects received a dose of methotrexate during this Phase 2 study that was equal to their optimal methotrexate dose in earlier Phase 1 study. The subjects received the study treatment for 39 weeks, unless the subject was evaluated as non-responder at Week 64 or Week 76 and discontinued the study. Participants in sustained remission (Disease Activity Score based on 28-joints count [DAS28] &lt;2.6) or with low disease activity (2.6 ≤ DAS28 ≤ 3.2) at Week 91 were classified as Phase 2 responder, and will continue to Phase 3 study.</description>

At Week 52, subjects assigned to this arm received a double blinded 25 mg dose of etanercept as a subcutaneous injection using a pre filled syringe. All weekly doses thereafter (ie, Weeks 53 to 90) were administered as an etanercept matching placebo injection using a pre-filled syringe. Methotrexate was administered once weekly as oral capsules.

        <description>WPAI:6 question participant rated questionnaire to determine the degree to which rheumatoid arthritis affected work productivity while at work and affected activities outside of work. Four scores are derived:percentage of absenteeism, percentage of presenteeism (reduced productivity while at work),overall work impairment score that combined absenteeism and presenteeism and percentage of impairment in activities performed outside of work. Scores scaled as 0 (not affected/no impairment) to 10 (completely affected/impaired). Higher scores indicated greater impairment and less productivity. The raw scores (0-10) are converted to percents (the variable is named &quot;Percent impairment While Working&quot;) and as such range from 0 to 100.</description>

Four scores are derived:percentage of absenteeism, percentage of presenteeism (reduced productivity while at work),overall work impairment score that combined absenteeism and presenteeism and percentage of impairment in activities performed outside of work. Scores scaled as 0 (not affected/no impairment) to 10 (completely affected/impaired). Higher scores indicated greater impairment and less productivity. The raw scores (0-10) are converted to percents (the variable is named &quot;Percent impairment While Working&quot;) and as such range from 0 to 100.</description>

The subjects received the study treatment for 39 weeks, unless the subject was evaluated as non-responder at Week 64 or Week 76 and discontinued the study. Participants in sustained remission (Disease Activity Score based on 28-joints count [DAS28] &lt;2.6) or with low disease activity (2.6 ≤ DAS28 ≤ 3.2) at Week 91 were classified as Phase 2 responder, and will continue to Phase 3 study</description>

        <description>DAS44 calculated from the number of swollen joints (SJC) and painful joints (PJC) using the 44 joints count, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (millimeters per hour [mm/hour]) and patient's global assessment (PGA) of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity assessment with transformed scores ranging 0 to 10; higher scores indicated greater affectation due to disease activity). DAS44 &lt;1.6 = clinical remission, DAS44 ≤2.4 = low disease activity.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline mTSS at Week 91 and Final on Therapy</title>
          <description>mTSS = sum of erosion and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) scores for 44 joints (16 per hand and 6 per foot). mTSS scores ranged from 0 (normal) to 448 (worst possible total score). Change: scores at observation minus score at baseline. An increase in mTSS from baseline represented disease progression and/or joint worsening, no change represented halting of disease progression, and a decrease represented improvement.</description>

        <description>WPAI: 6 question participant rated questionnaire to determine the degree to which rheumatoid arthritis affected work productivity while at work and affected activities outside of work. Four scores are derived: percentage of absenteeism, percentage of presenteeism (reduced productivity while at work), an overall work impairment score that combined absenteeism and presenteeism and percentage of impairment in activities performed outside of work. Scores scaled as 0 (not affected/no impairment) to 10 (completely affected/impaired). Higher scores indicated greater impairment and less productivity. The raw (0-10) scores are converted to percents (the variable is named &quot;Percent impairment While Working&quot;) and as such range from 0 to 100.</description>

        <title>WPAI Questionnaire: Percent Impairment While Working in the Past 7 Days Due to Problem</title>
        <description>WPAI: 6 question participant rated questionnaire to determine the degree to which rheumatoid arthritis affected work productivity while at work and affected activities outside of work. Four scores are derived: percentage of absenteeism, percentage of presenteeism (reduced productivity while at work), an overall work impairment score that combined absenteeism and presenteeism and percentage of impairment in activities performed outside of work. Scores scaled as 0 (not affected/no impairment) to 10 (completely affected/impaired). Higher scores indicated greater impairment and less productivity. The raw (0-10) scores are converted to percents (the variable is named “Percent impairment While Working”) and as such range from 0 to 100.</description>

        <title>WPAI Questionnaire: Percent Overall Work Impairment in the Past 7 Days Due to Problem</title>
        <description>WPAI: 6 question participant rated questionnaire to determine the degree to which rheumatoid arthritis affected work productivity while at work and affected activities outside of work. Four scores are derived: percentage of absenteeism, percentage of presenteeism (reduced productivity while at work), an overall work impairment score that combined absenteeism and presenteeism and percentage of impairment in activities performed outside of work. Scores scaled as 0 (not affected/no impairment) to 10 (completely affected/impaired). Higher scores indicated greater impairment and less productivity. The raw (0-10) scores are converted to percents (the variable is named “Percent impairment While Working”) and as such range from 0 to 100.</description>

          <title>WPAI Questionnaire: Percent Activity Impairment in the Past 7 Days Due to Problem</title>
          <description>WPAI: 6 question participant rated questionnaire to determine the degree to which rheumatoid arthritis affected work productivity while at work and affected activities outside of work. Four scores are derived: percentage of absenteeism, percentage of presenteeism (reduced productivity while at work), an overall work impairment score that combined absenteeism and presenteeism and percentage of impairment in activities performed outside of work. Scores scaled as 0 (not affected/no impairment) to 10 (completely affected/impaired). Higher scores indicated greater impairment and less productivity. The raw (0-10) scores are converted to percents (the variable is named “Percent impairment While Working”) and as such range from 0 to 100.</description>
