  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Growth hormone (GH) and Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) secretion are altered in
      acromegaly and type 2 Diabetes Mellitis (DM). The secretion of GH is mediated by central
      hypothalamic hormones (GH Releasing Hormone and somatostatin) as well as peripheral factors
      providing feedback inhibition (IGF-I and glucose, among others). The purpose of this study is
      to compare growth hormone suppression after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to growth
      hormone suppression after recombinant human IGF-I (rhIGF-I) administration. This study will
      recruit participants with active acromegaly, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and healthy control
      subjects. Each participant will undergo a screening evaluation, and three subsequent visits.
      Each participant will receive a placebo subcutaneous injection, OGTT, and administration of
      rhIGF-I, on separate visit days. Glucose, insulin, GH, bioactive IGF-I and IGF-I binding
      proteins will be measured after each intervention. Results will be compared between the three
      groups. It is predicted that the administration of rhIGF-I will demonstrate GH suppression in
      all healthy subjects and subjects with type 2DM. Some acromegaly subjects may demonstrate GH
      suppression in response to IGF-I administration, but not to the degree seen in healthy
      subjects or type 2 DM. OGTT will demonstrate suppression of GH in normal subjects, and will
      show attenuated suppression in type 2 DM and a failure of suppression in acromegaly.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Active acromegaly due to excess GH produced by a pituitary adenoma.

          -  Patients must have an elevated IGF-I compared to age and gender matched controls (as
             supplied by the laboratory) and fail to suppress GH to below 1 ng/ml after a standard
             75g oral glucose tolerance test.

          -  Type 2 diabetes mellitus, defined by elevated fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl (verified by
             two historical measurements), or plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl two hours after a 75 g
             oral glucose load, or a random glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Acromegaly Group

               -  Current medical therapy for acromegaly including dopamine agonists, somatostatin
                  analogues, or growth hormone antagonists.

               -  For subjects on current therapy the following washout periods may be used:

                    -  Cabergoline: 4 weeks

                  verification of active disease with verified elevated IGF-I for the subjects' age
                  and gender compared to healthy controls (as supplied by the laboratory) (two
