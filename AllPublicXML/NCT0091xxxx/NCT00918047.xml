      Study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of OXC XR as adjunctive

      This was an open-label, multiple dose, multicenter study consisting of a Screening Period (up
      to 14 days), a Dosing Period (7 days), and a Follow-up Period (7 days). In-clinic visits
      occurred at screening, Visit 1 (Day 0), and Visit 2 (Day 7)/Early Discontinuation. All
      subjects received open-label SPN 804O as adjunctive therapy during the Dosing Period. At
      Visit 1, eligible subjects were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups (150, 300, 450, or
      600mg/day) based on weight (15-&lt;30, 30-&lt;45, 45-&lt;60, &gt;=60kg). The Dosing Period consisted of
      six consecutive days of a daily dose, taken at home, followed by a final day with the dose
      taken on-site and including blood draws for PK analysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Able to provide written informed assent (IAF), as appropriate, with written informed

             parameters unchanged for at least one month prior to Visit 1 is allowed and not
             considered to be an AED. Magnet use is allowed.
