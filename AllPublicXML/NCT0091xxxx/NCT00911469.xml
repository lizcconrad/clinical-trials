  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common diseases affecting the joints, usually those
      that are weight bearing such as the knees. OA is considered to be a disease of the cartilage
      in the joints even though it involves the whole joint, including the bone and synovium (thin
      lining of the joints which produces synovial fluid). With time, more and more of the
      cartilage is destroyed by the disease with inflammation commonly occurring.

      AS902330 is expected to increase the production and development of specific bone cells:
      chondrocytes and osteoblasts (cells that produce and maintain bone and cartilage). This is
      expected to lead to repair and regeneration of the cartilage, and a narrowing of the space
      width between the knee joints in a selected region of the knee.The purpose of this study is
      to see how safe treatment with AS902330 is, and to evaluate its effect on the knee cartilage.
      In addition, the study will also measure the effects of AS902330 in the blood.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Established diagnosis of knee primary femoro-tibial OA by standard American College of
             Rheumatology Criteria (ACR) for at least six months (clinical AND radiological
             criteria)

          2. Postmenopausal or surgically sterile female ≥ 40 years of age Post-menopausal status
             will be confirmed by no menstrual periods for 12 consecutive months and no other
             biological or physiological cause for amenorrhea can be identified or Male ≥ 40 years

             treatment until 2 months after the end of the treatment (3rd injection in Period 2)
             Even though systemic exposure of the drug is not foreseen at the doses used in this
             study, due to the absence of data on teratogenic potential of the drug, a very
             conservative approach on contraception is taken based on the spermatogenesis duration
             in humans.

          3. Candidate for Total Knee Replacement in the target knee, according to NIH consensus
             statement on Total Knee Replacement (2003)

          4. Date of planned Total Knee Replacement in the target knee ≥ 2 weeks after the
             anticipated last injection of study drug

          5. Subjects may be on treatment for symptomatic relief of OA, including NSAIDs (including
             Cox2 specific inhibitors); for NSAIDs, the dose should be stable for 4 weeks before
             baseline and during the study until day 4 after last injection.

             allowed as rescue medication

          6. Willingness to stay in hospital for 24h after injection for SAD regimens and after
             first injection for MAD regimens (and up to 4 hours after second and third injections
             for MAD regimens) for safety and PK evaluation

          7. Willingness to complete a diary card to evaluate local tolerability and adverse events
             throughout the study

          8. Subjects must have read and understood the informed consent form and must have signed
             it prior to any study related procedure

          9. Subjects must fully understand the requirements of the study and be willing to comply
             with all study visits and assessments

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any condition, including laboratory findings and findings in the medical history or in
             the pre-study assessments, that in the opinion of the Investigator constitutes a risk
             or contraindication for participation in the study or that could interfere with the
             study objectives, conduct or evaluation

          2. Clinically significant abnormal hematology or biochemistry values (platelets,
             hemoglobin, leucocytes, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, blood creatinine, bilirubin)

          3. Receipt of any investigational product or any experimental therapeutic procedure
             within the last 12 weeks preceding screening

          4. Intra-articular treatment with steroids or hyaluronic acid derivatives within the past
             3 months (systemic symptomatic treatments with NSAIDs are allowed when stable for 4
             weeks prior to first injection)

          5. Planned major surgery (e.g. joint replacement) within 2 weeks after last injection

          6. History of previous surgery (TKR or partial knee replacement) on the target knee

             Neuropathic arthropathy whatever the cause Patients with risk factors for knee OA
             (e.g. obesity, meniscectomy) are not considered as having secondary OA and can be
             included in this study.
