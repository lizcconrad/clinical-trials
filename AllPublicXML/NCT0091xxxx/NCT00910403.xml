      The Presbyopia Algorithm subject to this study has been specifically developed to
      prospectively generate a treatment file for the Technolas 217z100 laser that will provide
      Presbyopia correction among eyes with primary hyperopia or hyperopic astigmatism (distance
      correction). The treatment algorithm provides a bilateral, multifocal ablation with a center
      near addition, thereby allowing good focus over a range of object distances.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be at least 18 years old

          -  Subjects must read, understand, and sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF).

          -  Subjects must be willing and able to return for scheduled follow up visits.

          -  Subjects must be willing to have both eyes treated during the same visit.

          -  Subjects must have up to +4 diopters (D) of absolute spherical hyperopia (not
             spherical equivalent), with up to +2.5 D of refractive astigmatism (NOT corneal
             astigmatism) by manifest subjective refraction in both eyes. The spherical equivalent
             must be no more than +5.25 D.

          -  Subjects must have presbyopia as determined by an age-related need for optical aid (&gt;
             +1.50 D) for reading with their best distance correction.

          -  Subjects who are contact lens wearers must have gas permeable (GP) lenses discontinued
             for at least 3 weeks and soft lenses discontinued for at least 1 week prior to the
             preoperative evaluation in the eye to be treated. Contact lens wearers who wear their
             contact lenses for any amount of time between the preoperative baseline examination
             and the operative visit must not be treated.

          -  Corneal topography should be normal.

          -  Subjects who are contact lens wearers must have 2 central keratometry readings and 2
             manifest subjective refractions taken preoperatively at least one week apart. The
             refraction values must not differ by more than 0.50D as defined by manifest refraction
             spherical equivalent (MRSE). The keratometry values must not differ from the previous
             values by more than 0.50D in either meridian.

          -  High contrast, manifest, best spectacle-corrected logMAR distance visual acuity (VA)
             must be correctable to at least 0.1 (20/25 or 6/7.5) in both eyes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects for whom the combination of their baseline corneal thickness and the planned
             operative parameters for the LASIK procedure would result in less than 250 microns of
             remaining posterior corneal thickness below the flap postoperatively.

          -  Eyes for which the baseline manifest subjective refraction exhibits a difference of
             greater than 0.75D in sphere power, or a difference of greater than 0.50D in cylinder
             power, or a difference in cylinder axis of more than 15 degrees compared to the
             baseline cycloplegic subjective refraction. For manifest cylinder of less than 0.75D,
             the difference in cylinder axis will not be taken into consideration.

          -  Subjects for whom the preoperative assessment of the ocular topography indicates that
             one or both eyes are not suitable candidates for treatment based upon the suggested
             computer-simulated treatment plan.

          -  Any subject who is going to be co-managed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist who is
             not approved as a Technolas GmbH Excimer laser Investigator.

          -  Subjects with anterior segment pathology, including dry eye syndrome and cataracts
             which in the Investigator's opinion, would interfere with best spectacle-corrected VA
             (BSCVA) or a successful treatment.

          -  Subjects with evidence of retinal vascular disease.

          -  Subjects with any residual, recurrent, or active ocular disease, or corneal
             abnormality that in the Investigator's opinion would interfere with BSCVA or a
             successful treatment.

          -  Subjects with signs of keratoconus.

          -  Subjects with unstable central keratometry readings with irregular mires.

          -  Subjects who have undergone previous intraocular or corneal surgery of any kind,
             including any type of excimer laser surgery for either refractive or therapeutic
             purposes.

          -  Subjects who have a history of Herpes simplex or Herpes zoster keratitis.

          -  Subjects who have a history of glaucoma or glaucoma suspect.

          -  Subjects who are immunocompromised or carrying diagnosis of connective tissue disease,
             clinically significant atopic disease, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other acute
             or chronic illnesses that will increase the risk to the subject or confound the
             outcomes of this study.

          -  Subjects taking systemic medications likely to affect wound healing such as
             corticosteroids or antimetabolites.

          -  Subjects who are known to be pregnant, lactating, or who plan to become pregnant
             during the course of the study.

          -  Subjects with known sensitivity to medications used for standard LASIK.

          -  Subjects participating in any other ophthalmic clinical trials during this clinical
             trial.

          -  Subjects with an ocular muscle disorder including a strabismus or nystagmus, or other
             disorders affecting fixation.

          -  Subjects at risk for angle closure.

        Exclusion Criteria-For Fellow (Second) Eyes in Simultaneous Bilateral Treatment

        Procedures:

          -  Flap complications during the first eye's surgery such as a free cap, partial flap,
             thin flap, or irregular flap.

          -  Epithelial defect exceeding 2mm x 2mm in dimension, or clinically significant debris
             in the interface between the flap and underlying stroma for the first eye.

          -  Severe blepharospasm in the first eye that may have prevented or impeded the
             completion of the keratectomy and/or the laser ablation procedure.

          -  Poor subject cooperation with instructions for the first eye's surgery and/or poor
             subject fixation on the laser fixation target.

          -  Aborted LASIK procedure in the first eye or PRK or Epi-LASIK was performed in the
             first eye because LASIK was not possible.
