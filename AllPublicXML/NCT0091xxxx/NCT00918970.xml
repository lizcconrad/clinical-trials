  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context: A major lack of organ donors is a serious public health problem. It determines a
      prolonged delay before a transplant can be performed and thus a significant number of deaths
      of patients waiting for transplantation. The aim of this project is to reduce the delay of
      the diagnosis of brain death, and also to improve its diagnosis in the Intensive Care Unit.

      The diagnosis of brain death is strictly defined by the law and relies either on two
      consecutive flat electroencephalograms recorded at an interval of four hours, or on the lack
      of cerebral circulation during a brain angiography performed after suspecting brain death on
      the clinical exam. However, in usual practice, it is difficult to have all the needed
      clinical arguments, and their interpretation can be difficult in the pathological context.
      This may participate in the delay and the lack of patients potentially donors.

      Pre-study: In a pilot study, fifty subjects with severe cerebral lesions, had a continuous
      ECG recording. The investigators could find that a decrease in autonomic nervous system
      activity, as measured through the ECG, was correlated to the transition to brain death
      assessed by cerebral angiography. The loss of cardiac variability was always observed between
      two cerebral angiographies, one before and the second after brain death. This study allowed
      the investigators to calculate the threshold values of sympathetic and parasympathetic
      activities to confirm brain death.

      Aim: The aim of this second study is to validate prospectively the interest of the analysis
      in real-time of autonomic nervous system activity to detect brain death.

      Benefits expected: Increase the number of organ donors and the number of organs removal
      available for transplantation.
