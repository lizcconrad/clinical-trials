  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is not standardized and there is an
      enormous diversity in clinical practice. The investigators' aim was to demonstrate that
      uncomplicated diverticulitis can be managed with oral amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid with a
      short hospital admission.

      A prospective randomized trial was established to compare patients with uncomplicated
      diverticulitis who received oral antibiotic after a short course of intravenous antibiotic,
      with those who received intravenous antibiotic for a longer period. We included 50 patients,
      25 in each group. Patients in group 1 begun oral antibiotic as soon as they improved and were
      discharged the day after. Patients in group 2 received intravenous antibiotic for 7 days.
      Both groups received oral antibiotic at discharge. The endpoint of the study was &quot;failure of
      treatment&quot; which was defined as the impossibility of discharging on the expected day,
      emergency admission or hospital readmission.
