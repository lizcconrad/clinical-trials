  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoregulation is defined as the ability of a vascular bed to adapt its vascular resistance
      to changes in perfusion pressure. In the eye, several studies have reported that retinal
      blood flow is autoregulated over a wide range of ocular perfusion pressures. In the optic
      nerve head only few data are available. Large scale studies have shown that reduced ocular
      perfusion pressure is an important risk factor for the prevalence, the incidence and the
      progression of primary open angle glaucoma.

      Former studies that investigated ocular blood flow autoregulation only measured choroidal
      blood flow. For the optic nerve head only few data are available, although it seems likely
      that it underlies similar autoregulatory mechanisms.

      The primary goal of the present study is to gain more insight into these phenomena in humans.

      The present study aims to investigate the pressure/flow relationship as a measure for optic
      nerve head autoregulation during combined changes of intraocular pressure and arterial
      pressure. Intraocular pressure will be increased by the use of a suction cup technique, mean
      arterial pressure will be increased by squatting. During the whole procedure, optic nerve
      head blood flow will be measured continuously.
