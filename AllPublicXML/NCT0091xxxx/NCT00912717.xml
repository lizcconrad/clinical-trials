      After informed consent, participants will be asked to complete a medical/family history
      questionnaire and provide a blood sample. Some participants may also be asked to provide a
      urine sample. Individuals undergoing procedures that require collection of biological samples
      for clinical purposes may have these samples saved for research purposes. Participants will
      also be asked for their permission for study investigators to access medical records and/or
      recontact them for updates to their medical and family histories. Data and biospecimens will
      be stored for potential future research projects.
