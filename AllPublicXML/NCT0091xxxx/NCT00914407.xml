  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The inner retina is crucially dependent on an adequate retinal blood supply. When the retina
      becomes ischemic and hypoxic this results in severe vision loss due to retinal
      neovascularization. Measurement of retinal blood flow and retinal oxygenation is, however,
      still a difficult task. Information on retinal oxygenation is almost unavailable from human
      studies. In the present protocol the investigators propose a procedure allowing for the
      measurement of retinal blood flow, retinal oxygenation and retinal oxygen extraction by
      combining a number of innovative techniques. Specifically, retinal vessel diameters will be
      measured with a Retinal Vessel Analyzer, retinal blood velocities with bi-directional laser
      Doppler velocimetry and retinal oxygenation with spectroscopic evaluation of retinal fundus
      images. This will allow for the calculation of retinal oxygen extraction, a fundamental
      parameter of retinal function. Up to now, no data for retinal oxygen extraction are available
      in the literature.
