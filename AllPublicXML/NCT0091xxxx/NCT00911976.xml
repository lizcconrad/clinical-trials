      The specific aim of the SOS-Xience V study is to examine the 12-month incidence of binary
      angiographic in-stent restenosis after implantation of the Xience V stent in aortocoronary
      saphenous vein bypass graft lesions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Implantation of bare metal coronary stents (BMS) is currently the preferred percutaneous
      treatment for aortocoronary saphenous vein bypass graft (SVG) lesions, but is associated with
      high risk for in-stent restenosis. Although drug-eluting stents (DES) appear promising, there
      are limited and conflicting data on their efficacy and safety in SVGs. Our group recently
      completed and reported the results of the SOS (Stenting Of Saphenous vein grafts) trial that
      compared a paclitaxel-eluting stent with a similar BMS. There is currently no data on the use
      of the second generation DES in these challenging lesions. The SOS-Xience V study will
      examine the effects of the Xience V everolimus-eluting stent in SVG lesions.

      The specific aim of SOS-Xience V is to examine the 12-month incidence of binary angiographic
      in-stent restenosis (defined as a stenosis of &gt; 50% of the minimum lumen diameter of the
      target segment) after implantation of the Xience V stent in SVG lesions.

      The Xience V stent will be implanted in 40 consecutive patients who need stenting of a SVG
      lesion. Patients will undergo repeat follow-up angiography and intravascular ultrasonography
      at 12 months and will be followed clinically for 12 months to determine:

        1. the incidence of binary angiographic in-stent restenosis, as assessed by 12 month
           follow-up quantitative coronary angiography (primary study endpoint), and

        2. intra-stent intimal hyperplasia volume accumulation at 12 months, as measured by
           intravascular ultrasonography, and (b) 12-month incidence of ischemia-driven target
           vessel revascularization, stent thrombosis, and target vessel failure (composite of
           cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization) (secondary
           study endpoints), and (c) percent stent strut coverage by optical coherence tomography
