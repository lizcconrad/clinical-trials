    <textblock>
      Given the potential age-related differences in safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      differences in sleep architecture in young children versus adolescent versus adult, studies
      to identify the appropriate drug and dosage for children of all ages are essential in
      addressing this health problem that impacts the child and their family. The objective of this
      study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of eplivanserin.

      Primary objective: to assess the safety and tolerability after administration of single
      ascending oral doses of eplivanserin to children aged 6-17 years with insomnia of various
      origins.

      To assess the pharmacokinetics of eplivanserin (and active metabolite: SR141342) after
      administration of single ascending oral doses of eplivanserin to children aged 6-17 years
      with insomnia of various origins.

      Secondary objective: to assess the effect of single ascending oral doses of eplivanserin on
      global sleep parameters and sleep architecture measured via polysomnography recordings in
      children aged 6-17 years old with insomnia of various origins.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with a diagnosis of insomnia of various origins.

          -  Complaint of childhood insomnia as defined by repeated difficulty with sleep
             initiation or consolidation that occurs despite adequate age appropriate time and
             opportunity for sleep. The existence of sleep difficulty will be supported by
             statements from the child and/or the caregiver that sleep is not properly initiated or
             maintained.

          -  Written consent must be obtained from the parent/legal guardian.

             of giving assent as determined by parent/legal guardian.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The sleep disturbance must not be attributable to either the direct physiologic effect
             of a drug of abuse or misuse of a prescribed medication.

          -  Subject, if female of childbearing potential, which are unwilling to abstain from
             sexual intercourse or practice a double contraception method for the length of the

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Use of any hypnotics/psychotropics, antihistamines, melatonin, herbal products, or
             other sleep aids including clonidine for initiation or maintenance of sleep within one
             week or five half lives (whichever is longer), prior to screening and unwillingness to
             discontinue them at the screening visit.

          -  Subject tested positive at screening or at baseline or at Day 1, on urine drug screen
             for drugs known to alter sleep (amphetamine/methamphetamines, barbiturates,
             benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, opiates and alcohol).

          -  Inability to swallow a pill in similar size as the tablets to be administered for this
             study.

          -  Current or recent (&lt;60 days) participation in another clinical trial receiving an
             investigational drug.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
