  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the effect of food on typical blood levels obtained after
      oral dosing of AG-013736. Drug levels in blood will be compared after an overnight fast and a
      high-fat, high-calorie meal.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and/or female subjects between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive
             (Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed
             medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate
             measurement, 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests).

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs).

          -  An informed consent document signed and dated by the subject or a legally acceptable
             representative.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of history of clinically significant blood, kidney, endocrine,
             gastrointestinal, heart, liver, psychiatric, neurologic, or allergic (including drug
             allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of
             dosing) disease or clinical findings at Screening.

          -  Active smokers or users of other tobacco products as well as users of certain drugs.

          -  Pregnant or nursing females; females of childbearing potential, including those with
             tubal ligation. To be considered for enrollment, women of 45 to 55 years of age who
             are postmenopausal (defined as being amenorrheic for at least 2 years) must have
             confirmatory Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) test results at Screening.
