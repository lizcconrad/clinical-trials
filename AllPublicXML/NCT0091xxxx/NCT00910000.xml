    <textblock>
      This trial is a Phase Ib/II study of carboplatin/gemcitabine/vorinostat for the treatment of
      platinum sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. The carboplatin and gemcitabine combination is
      an FDA approved regimen for platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. Vorinostat is a type
      of drug called a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDAC inhibitor). HDAC inhibitors interact
      with chromosomes in the cancer cell and cause cancer cells to stop growing. Vorinostat has
      shown a decrease in the amount of ovarian cancer cells growing in the laboratory and also may
      enhance the anti-cancer effects of carboplatin.The purpose of the Phase Ib study is to
      determine the highest dose of the drug vorinostat that can be given safely in combination
      with carboplatin and gemcitabine. Not everyone who participates in this research study will
      receive the same dose of the study drug, vorinostat, but carboplatin and gemcitabine doses
      are held constant. Vorinostat doses depend on previous enrollment and tolerability. The
      expansion Phase II study uses the vorinostat dose found in the Phase Ib study in combination
      with carboplatin/gemcitabine and as a single agent maintenance therapy to better understand
      toxicity and efficacy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

      Phase Ib: Determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of vorinostat when used in combination
      with standard (fixed) doses of carboplatin/gemcitabine during a 21 day cycle in patients with
      recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer

      Phase II: Estimate the median progression-free survival (PFS) of patients treated with
      carboplatin/gemcitabine/vorinostat and vorinostat maintenance

      Secondary

        -  Estimate the response rate of carboplatin/gemcitabine/vorinostat

        -  Assess the toxicities of carboplatin/gemcitabine/vorinostat

        -  Assess the toxicities of maintenance vorinostat

        -  Measure overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS)

      STATISTICAL DESIGN:

      The Phase Ib study was originally design to follow a standard 3+3 dose escalation design and
      evaluate 4 vorinostat dose levels.The DLT observation period was the 21-day cycle 1 length.
      Note: Ultimately 6 dose levels were evaluated as the protocol was amended to add dose levels,
      de-escalating cumulative vorinostat dose per cycle when 2 of 3 participants in dose level
      cohorts 2A, 1B and 1C experienced DLTs.

      In the Phase II study, a median PFS of 13 months would be worthy of further study,
      representing a 66% improvement compared with the historical median of 8.6 months observed
      with carboplatin/gemcitabine. With 36 evaluable patients, there is 80% power to reject the
      null hypothesis in favor of the alternative at a 5% significance level.

    <time_frame>The DLT observation period in determining the MTD was the 21-day cycle 1 length.</time_frame>
    <description>The Vorinostat MTD is determined by the number of patients who experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). See subsequent primary outcome measure for the DLT definition. The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which fewer than one-third of patients experience a DLT. If no DLTs are observed, the MTD is not reached.</description>

    <measure>Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) [Phase Ib]</measure>
    <time_frame>The DLT observation period in determining the MTD was the 21-day cycle 1 length.</time_frame>
    <description>Dose-limiting toxicity was based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (CTCAE v3.0) and defined as any of the following:
Any CTCAE grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic event except manageable gastrointestinal toxicity and fatigue.
Any of the following hematologic events (excluding neutropenia lasting &lt; 5 days):
i) febrile neutropenia defined as grade 3-4 neutropenia with fever ≥ 38.5°C and/or infection.
ii) any grade 4 neutropenia lasting 5 days or more. iii) grade 4 thrombocytopenia (plt count &lt; 25x 109/L) iv) failure of ANC to recover to ≥ 1000/μL or platelets to recover to ≥ 50,000/μL within 14 days of therapy v) grade 4 anemia
Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory value that results in dose delay of &gt;14 days.
&lt;75% of vorinostat dosing taken by the patient during the first cycle due to any toxicity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was assessed radiographically (CT or MRI scan) every 2 cycles on treatment; Phase Ib participants received up to 8 cycles of treatment. The median number of cycles started was 2 (range 1-8).</time_frame>
    <description>Response was based on RECIST 1.0 criteria. Per RECIST 1.0 for target lesions, complete response (CR) is complete disappearance of all target lesions and partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in sum LD from the smallest LD recorded on treatment. Stable disease (SD) is neither sufficient increase to qualify as PD nor sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR. For CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed 4 weeks +/- 2 weeks after the response criteria are first met. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions. Participants who received therapy but did not have their disease re-evaluated were considered unevaluable.</description>

          <title>Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) [Phase Ib]</title>
          <description>Dose-limiting toxicity was based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (CTCAE v3.0) and defined as any of the following:
Any CTCAE grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic event except manageable gastrointestinal toxicity and fatigue.
Any of the following hematologic events (excluding neutropenia lasting &lt; 5 days):
i) febrile neutropenia defined as grade 3-4 neutropenia with fever ≥ 38.5°C and/or infection.
ii) any grade 4 neutropenia lasting 5 days or more. iii) grade 4 thrombocytopenia (plt count &lt; 25x 109/L) iv) failure of ANC to recover to ≥ 1000/μL or platelets to recover to ≥ 50,000/μL within 14 days of therapy v) grade 4 anemia
Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory value that results in dose delay of &gt;14 days.
&lt;75% of vorinostat dosing taken by the patient during the first cycle due to any toxicity.</description>
          <population>Per protocol, DLT evaluable participants received day 1 of treatment, were not taken off study during cycle 1 due to disease progression, showed proof via pill diary that all doses of vorinostat were taken or attempted to be taken and were compliant with study procedures. The final DLT dataset was comprised of all enrolled and treated participants.</population>

        <title>Response</title>
        <description>Response was based on RECIST 1.0 criteria. Per RECIST 1.0 for target lesions, complete response (CR) is complete disappearance of all target lesions and partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in sum LD from the smallest LD recorded on treatment. Stable disease (SD) is neither sufficient increase to qualify as PD nor sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR. For CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed 4 weeks +/- 2 weeks after the response criteria are first met. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions. Participants who received therapy but did not have their disease re-evaluated were considered unevaluable.</description>
        <time_frame>Disease was assessed radiographically (CT or MRI scan) every 2 cycles on treatment; Phase Ib participants received up to 8 cycles of treatment. The median number of cycles started was 2 (range 1-8).</time_frame>
