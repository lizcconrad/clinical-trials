  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been recognized as a common (5-8%),
      early-onset, long-term impairing, heterogeneous neuropsychiatric disorder with high
      heritability. Pharmacotherapy (methylphenidate and atomoxetine) has been proved to be the
      most effective treatment for ADHD. Gau (PI) has done extensive research on ADHD and published
      7 SCI papers in ADHD pharmacotherapy. The PI published the first paper in the effectiveness
      of atomoxetine in improving executive functions among 30 boys with ADHD in the world
      (International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology, 2009 Oct 23:1-14. [Epub]). Due to its
      lifelong impairments up to adulthood, adult ADHD has drawn much more attention in Western
      studies in the past decade; however, there is lack of such information in Asian population
      except the PI's three SCI papers on adult ADHD. Because little is known about atomoxetine
      effect in adults with ADHD except symptoms reduction, this proposal aims to investigate the
      efficacy of atomoxetine beyond symptoms improvement. The significance of this project is its
      novelty and research and clinical relevance because there is lack of information regarding
      long-term effect of atomoxetine on neuropsychological and brain imaging functions on adults
      with ADHD, a high-prevalent mental disorder with long-term impairment in adults.

      Specific Aims:

        1. To examine the efficacy of atomoxetine in improving neuropsychological functioning
           (CANTAB, Time Perception Tasks) and structural (DSI) and functional (resting fMRI) brain
           connectivity as the primary efficacy endpoints.

        2. To examine the efficacy of atomoxetine in reducing ADHD core symptoms and in improving
           family/social/academic/occupational adjustment and quality of life.

      The study design is a randomized open-label, methylphenidate control trial. The sample
      consists of 60 adults, aged 18-50, with clinical diagnosis of DSM-IV. All participants will
      be randomly assigned to atomoxetine (n= 30), methylphenidate (n= 15), and clinical visit with
      psychological counseling (n=15) in a 8-week randomized clinical trial with 3 treatment arms.

      The measures included psychiatric interviews (ADHD+SADS), the CGI-ADHD-S, the standardized
      self-reported questionnaires (the AAQoL, WFIRS-S, and WFIRS-P for social function; ASRS for
      ADHD symptoms), neuropsychological tests (CANTAB including attention tasks, visual memory,
      executive functioning, and gambling test; Time Perception Task), and brain imaging (DSI and
      resting fMRI).

      They will be reassessed with safety, ADHD symptoms and social functioning/quality of life at
      baseline, week 2 (± 5 days), week 4 (± 5 days), and week 8 (± 5 days); neuropsychological
      tests at baseline, week 4 (± 5 days), and week 8 (± 5 days); and brain imaging studies (DSI
      and resting-fMRI) at baseline and week 8 (± 5 days). Additionally, blood sample will be
      collected at baseline for future pharmacogenomic study.

      We anticipate that this study will be one of the first to investigate the efficacy of
      atomoxetine on neuropsychological functioning, and structural and functional brain
      connectivity in the world. If this research can be carried out, it will be the first project
      using brain images as assessment tools in a clinical trial among psychiatric patients in
      psychiatric field in Taiwan.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The inclusion criteria are (1) that subjects had typical ADHD symptoms before 7 years
             old which meet the DSM-IV-TR ADHD at childhood and currently based on Gau's clinic
             diagnosis and the ADHD supplement of the K-SADS for adults; (2) that their Clinical
             Global Impressions-ADHD-Severity (CGI-ADHD-S) score&gt;4 and psychotropic
             medication-naïve for the past year; (3) that their IQ greater than 80; and (4) that
