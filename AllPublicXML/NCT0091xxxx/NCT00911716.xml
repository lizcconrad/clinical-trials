      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      docetaxel and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug
      (combination chemotherapy) together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects of giving bevacizumab together with
      docetaxel and cyclophosphamide and to see how well it works in treating patients with
      early-stage high-risk breast cancer.

      This is a single arm, non randomised pilot study investigating the safety of the combination
      of Docetaxel + Cyclophosphamide+ Bevacizumab in the adjuvant treatment of patients with early
      stage, HER 2 negative, high risk breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the feasibility of the combination of adjuvant bevacizumab, docetaxel, and
           cyclophosphamide in patients with early-stage HER2-negative high-risk breast cancer.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen with regards to cardiac toxicity, hypertension, and
           bleeding complications in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of this regimen by measuring Topo II overexpression in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients will receive 4 cycles of Docetaxel 75mg/m2 + 4 cycles of Cyclophosphamide 600mg/m2
      (each cycle lasts 21 days) (+/- 3 days if a due date could not be met because of public
      holidays, etc) and concomitant Avastin (Bevacizumab) 15mg/kg q 3weeks for treatment duration
      of one year.

      Bevacizumab at a dose of 15mg/kg will be administered as an intravenous infusion every 3
      weeks for a treatment period of one year, regardless of missed doses.

      Patients will be followed up through 5 years (i.e. from the time of registration through to
      end of Year 5/ 1 year treatment and 4 years follow up).
