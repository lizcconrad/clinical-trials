      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and late toxicity of dose escalated
      radiation therapy to the pelvic lymph nodes and prostate and seminal vesicles in the
      treatment of high risk prostate cancer. All eligible patients with high risk prostate cancer
      who are going to have primary radiation therapy to the pelvic lymph nodes and prostate
      seminal vesicles with or without concurrent hormonal therapy will be approached regarding
      study entry.

    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is now the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Canadian men and is the third
      most common cause of cancer death.1 Locally advanced prostate cancer (clinical T3/T4) is
      uncommon in North America because of earlier diagnosis following widespread PSA testing and
      patient information campaigns. However, in the past decade the term high-risk prostate cancer
      has been developed to include the previous locally advanced disease and patient with T1/T2
      disease with poor prognostic features (either a high Prostate Specific Antigen or high
      Gleason score). The risk of involvement of pelvic lymph nodes by prostate cancer for certain
      subgroups of intermediate risk and most high risk prostate cancer may be substantial. The
      long term results of conventional dose (66-70 Gy) external beam radiation therapy for
      intermediate and locally advanced prostate cancer have been disappointing. The combination of
      hormonal therapy and radiation therapy or radiation therapy dose escalation are the two
      strategies which have been evaluated and are now used to improve these results.
