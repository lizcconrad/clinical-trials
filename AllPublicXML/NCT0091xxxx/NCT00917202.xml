      Design: Single-centre, controlled study in adults with uncomplicated falciparum malaria in
      the Nouna Health District, north-western Burkina Faso

      Phase: Phase II

      Objectives: The primary objective of this trial is to study the efficacy of different
      methylene blue regimens given to adults with uncomplicated falciparum malaria in an African
      area of high malaria transmission intensity.

      Population: Male adults with uncomplicated malaria from Nouna town.

      Sample size: N= 60 (n=20 for each group; three different dosing regimens of MB).

      Treatment: The participants in the three different MB regimens will receive orally twice
      daily 390 mg MB (total daily dose 780mg) over 7,5 or 3 days respectively. Treatment with the
      five (three) day regimen will only start after all patients of the seven (five) days regimen
      have been followed up until day 3.

      Endpoints: The primary endpoint is the adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR)
      rate on day 28. Secondary endpoints are the number of adverse events (AE) after drug intake
      until day 28, clinical and parasitological failure rates on day 14 and 28, changes in
      haemoglobin/haematocrit until day 28, and fever and parasite clearance time.
