    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to establish a cut off level of platelet inhibition
      that separates patients with or without previous stent occlusion with acute clinical onset
      while on aspirin and clopidogrel treatment within 6 months after coronary stenting for
      coronary artery disease.

      To establish cut off levels of platelet inhibition using ADP-induced P2Y12-receptor mediated
      platelet aggregation using Accumetrics VerifyNow P2Y12 assay (PRU) and Vasodilator-stimulated
      phosphoprotein (VASP, PRI %)for patients with experienced stent occlusion with acute clinical
      onset and/or myocardial infarction within 6 months after coronary stenting for coronary
      artery disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide signed written informed consent.

          -  Male or female patients above 18 years old.

          -  Previous PCI and coronary stenting for coronary artery disease

          -  Previous (after coronary stenting) or current dual antiplatelet treatment (aspirin 75
             mg once daily (o.d) and clopidogrel 75 mg o.d). All patients need to be on treatment
             with aspirin 75 mg once daily at least seven days prior to enrollment.

          -  Experienced one of the following alternatives:

               -  Stent thrombosis within 6 months of PCI while on dual antiplatelet treatment; OR

               -  Experienced MI within 6 month after coronary stenting while on dual antiplatelet
                  treatment; OR

               -  No experience of stent thrombosis or MI for at least 6 months and until visit 1
                  (matched control)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        General exclusion criteria:

             the patient unsuitable for inclusion

          3. Enrolled in either another investigational drug study or in another investigational
             study of an approved drug within 30 days prior to Visit 1 of the current study.

         11. Prior history or clinical suspicion of cerebral vascular malformations

         12. Prior history of abnormal bleeding tendency (i.e. prolonged bleeding on dental
             extraction, tonsillectomy, or previous surgical procedure).

         13. Personal or family history of coagulation or bleeding disorders.

         14. Thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3) or thrombocytosis (platelet count &gt;
             500,000/mm3).

         15. History of major surgery, severe trauma, organ biopsy within 3 months prior to
             enrollment.

         16. Any planned surgical procedure within 20 days following inclusion.

         17. The use (or planned use) of other antiplatelet agents (besides aspirin and
             clopidogrel), anticoagulant or fibrinolytic agents.
