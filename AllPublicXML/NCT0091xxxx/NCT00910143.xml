    <textblock>
      Total mesorectal excision (TME) is a rather new operation technique in the treatment of
      rectal cancer. It is known to reduce the rate of local recurrences. However, the influence on
      long-term survival is unclear.

      Background

      The TME technique for rectal cancer surgery was introduced in our department in summer 1995.
      TME is known to reduce the rate of local recurrences. However, its influence on long-term
      survival in unclear.

      All patients with rectal cancer from 1993 to 2001 are reviewed. The patients charts are
      reviewed and the following main characteristics are retrieved: age, gender, time of
      operation, operation technique, tumor stage, tumor localisation, tumor size, neoadjuvant or
      adjuvant treatment, complications, follow-up with respect to the appearance of local
      recurrences and distant metastases.

      Comparison of two groups of patients. Group 1: patients operated before summer 1995, that is
      before the introduction of TME. Group 2: patients operated after summer 1995, that is after
      the introduction of TME.

      Objective

      Study the influence of a new operation method (TME) on outcome (local recurrence, survival).

      Methods

      All patients with rectal cancer from 1993 to 2001 are reviewed. The patients charts are
      reviewed and the following main characteristics are retrieved: age, gender, time of
      operation, operation technique, tumor stage, tumor localisation, tumor size, neoadjuvant or
      adjuvant treatment, complications, follow-up with respect to the appearance of local
      recurrences and distant metastases.

      Comparison of two groups of patients. Group 1: patients operated before summer 1995, that is
      before the introduction of TME. Group 2: patients operated after summer 1995, that is after
      the introduction of TME.
