    <textblock>
      By applying short electric pulses to cells, the cell membranes can become permeabilised
      (electroporation). This can be used augment the effect of chemotherapy, by providing direct
      access to the cell cytosol. For the drug bleomycin, the enhancement of effect is several
      hundred fold, enabling once-only treatment. The investigators wish compare
      electrochemotherapy with radiotherapy when treating ulcerated cutaneous metastases up to 5 cm
      in diameter from any kind of histology.

    <textblock>
      About 5 % of all cancer patients experience cutaneous metastases. Ulcerating metastases can
      be of great psychological distress for the patients and may also be painful. Radiation
      therapy is standard treatment for ulcerating metastases, but there are no reports of response
      rate.

      With this study we wish to compare electrochemotherapy with radiotherapy when treating
      ulcerated cutaneous metastases up to 5 cm in diameter from any kind of histology.

      Patient recruitment: 98 patients are to be recruited, the patients will be randomized between
      electrochemothreapy or radiotherapy. 49 patients will be treated in each arm.

      Treatment: Patients will be treated in local or general anesthesia (inhaling max. 30 %
      oxygen) Bleomycin will be given either intratumoral or intravenous. Electric pulses will be
      administered using a square wave electroporator (IGEA, Carpi, Italy). Needle and plate
      electrodes are used in order to treat the affected area efficiently. Eight pulses at a
      frequency of 5000 Hz or 1 Hz will be used for each application of the electrodes. In this
      way, a large area can be treated within a short time. Post treatment, the area will be
      covered by dry dressings, as are standardly used.

      The patients will be seen at 8, 30, 60, 90 and 180 days post treatment. Chest X ray will be
      taken before and after treatment for the patients receiving electrochemotherapy.

      Evaluation: Evaluation is performed by measurement of lesion extension and digital
      photography using the RECIST criteria. The first 10 patients in each treatment arm will also
      be PET/CT-scanned before and one week after treatment.

      Safety: Safety will be reported both in terms of evaluation of adverse events and in terms of
      patient satisfaction determined by questionnaire, including the 'Derriford Appearance
      Questionaire'.
