    <textblock>
      Patients that are on total knee/hip replacement initiate prophylaxis treatment on the
      hospital ground. Once they leave the hospital, as outpatients they continue with the
      treatment at least during two consecutive weeks. Patients will be instructed to follow
      treatment recommendations (either LMWH or oral treatment, at physician discretion) and to
      come back to the surgeon after that period. At that visit, the Treatment Satisfaction
      Questionaire with Medication (TSQM) test as well as the Moriski-Green Questionaire (measures
      compliance with medication) will be answer by the patient. TSQM is an self administered
      validated scale (validated also in spanish) that measures in a generic way the treatment
      satisfaction to a treatment. Morinski-Green test will be used to measure the compliance
      degree on medication.
