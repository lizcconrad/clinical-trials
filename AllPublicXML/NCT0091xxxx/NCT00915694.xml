      RATIONALE: Nelfinavir mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor
      cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      nelfinavir mesylate together with radiation therapy and temozolomide may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of nelfinavir mesylate
      when given together with radiation therapy and temozolomide in treating patients with
      glioblastoma multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of nelfinavir mesylate when given concurrently with
           radiotherapy and temozolomide followed by temozolomide alone in patients with
           glioblastoma multiforme.

        -  Determine the safety and dose-limiting toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Compare the observed median values of PFS and OS obtained in this study to the
           historical median values of 6.9 months and 14.6 months, respectively.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of nelfinavir mesylate.

      Patients receive oral nelfinavir mesylate twice daily beginning 7-10 days before the
      initiation of chemoradiotherapy and continuing until the completion of chemoradiotherapy.
      Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week and receive concurrent oral
      temozolomide once daily for 6 weeks. Beginning 4 weeks after completion of nelfinavir
      mesylate and chemoradiotherapy, patients receive oral temozolomide alone once daily on days
      1-5. Treatment with temozolomide repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
