    <textblock>
      Interferon-based monotherapy has been considered effective to treat acute hepatitis C in
      ordinary patients. However, the efficacy of this treatment has not been evaluated in
      prospective interventional studies for dialysis patients. The aim of the study is the
      evaluate the efficacy of peginterferon alfa-2a monotherapy for 24 weeks in this special
      clinical setting, and concomitantly evaluate retrospectively the dialysis patients with acute
      hepatitis C who did not receive intervention as the reference.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic viral hepatitis is common in dialysis patients, with the reported prevalence and
      annual incidence of 3-80% and 2.9%, respectively. The high incidence and prevalence in thse
      patients are attributed to potential nosocomial exposure to hepatitis C virus during
      dialysis, resulting in high rates of acute hepatitis C virus infection. It is estimated that
      about 65-80% of the patients who have acute hepatitis C will evolve to chronic infection,
      leading to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC). Currently, interferon and pegylated interferon monotherapy remains effective to treat
      acute hepatitis C in ordinary patients, with the sustained virologic response (SVR) rates
      ranging from 65-90% after 12-24 weeks of therapy. However, few data regarding the efficacy
      and safety of interferon-based monotherapy is known till now. Treatment of weekly 135
      pegylated interferon alfa-2a has shown superior safety to thrice weekly 3 million unit (MU)
      standard interferon alfa-2a for dialysis patients with chronic hepatitis C. Under the
      excellent safety profiles of treating dialysis patients with low dose pegylated interferon
      alfa-2a, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of weekly 135 ug pegylated interferon alfa-2a for
      a total of 24 weeks for dialysis patients with acute hepatitis C, and also evaluate the SVR
      rate by retrospective chart review for dialysis patients with acute hepatitis C who did not
      receive interferon-based therapy to evaluate if early intervention for these patients will
      improve overall disease outcome.
