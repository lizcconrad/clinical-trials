      The purpose of the study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and safety
      of XP21279 sustained release (SR3) formulation [administered with Lodosyn® (carbidopa)] and
      Sinemet® tablets in subjects with Parkinson's disease with Motor Fluctuations.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, confirmed by the
             presence of at least two cardinal signs of the disease (resting tremor, bradykinesia,
             rigidity).

          2. Subjects must have predictable motor fluctuations of the wearing off type, defined by
             wearing off in at least 50% of inter-dose intervals between the first and the last
             daily doses as recorded on the on/off diary over 3 days (Days -4 to -2) in the
             Screening Period.

          3. Subjects must be on stable TID or QID Sinemet® or carbidopa/levodopa regimens from
             morning through early evening, with a total daily dose ranging from 400 mg to 1000 mg
             of levodopa, for at least 1 week prior to Screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History, signs, or symptoms suggesting the diagnosis of secondary or atypical
             Parkinsonism.

          2. Subject has greater than or equal to moderately disabling dyskinesias for greater than
             25% of the waking day as assessed by a score of 2 or more on item 32 and a score of 2
             or more on item 33 on the UPDRS at Screening.

          3. Subjects who are dosing with Sinemet® or carbidopa/levodopa during the night time.

          4. Subjects who have significant neurological symptoms not accounted for by Parkinson's
             disease.

          5. Subjects who are taking concomitantly COMT inhibitors (i.e., entacapone or tolcapone)
             or treated with Stalevo®, Sinemet® CR, or Madopar®/Prolopa® (levodopa/benserazide).
