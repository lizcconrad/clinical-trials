    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess skin tolerability, skin irritation, and adhesion of the 350
      mg Donepezil Transdermal Patch (DTP-system), following 3, 7-day applications to 3 specific
      areas of the body (upper back, upper middle arm, side of torso) of elderly Alzheimer's
      patients. The total application time for the DTP-system is 21 days.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate skin irritation, skin
      tolerability, and adhesion of the 350 mg DTP-system following 3 consecutive 7-day
      applications to 3 specific areas of the body (upper back, upper arm, side of torso) of
      elderly Alzheimer's patients. The total exposure time for the DTP-system is 21 days.

      All patients receive 1 Donepezil Transdermal Patch (DTP-system) and 1 placebo patch, each
      applied to opposite sides of the body (e.g., placebo patch to the left side of the upper
      back, and DTP-system to the right side of the upper back). Patients are randomized to receive
      the active patch to either the left or the right side of the body according to 1 of 6
      treatment sequences listed below. The treatment sequence is repeated for the opposite side of
      the body for a total of 12 treatment sequences (4 patients in each treatment sequence). The
      patches are applied to one of 3 body locations for 7 days, for a total exposure period of 21
      days, according to one of the following sequences:

        1. Upper Back, Upper Arm, Side of Torso (Right)

        2. Upper Arm, Side of Torso, Upper Back (Right)

        3. Side of Torso, Upper Back, Upper Arm (Right)

        4. Upper Back, Side of Torso, Upper Arm (Right)

        5. Upper Arm, Upper Back, Side of Torso (Right)

        6. Side of Torso, Upper Arm, Upper Back (Right)

        7. Upper Back, Upper Arm, Side of Torso (Left)

        8. Upper Arm, Side of Torso, Upper Back (Left)

        9. Side of Torso, Upper Back, Upper Arm (Left)

       10. Upper Back, Side of Torso, Upper Arm (Left)

       11. Upper Arm, Upper Back, Side of Torso (Left)

       12. Side of Torso, Upper Arm, Upper Back (Left)

      Patches are applied on Days 1, 8, and 15 according to the randomization schedule. Oral
      Aricept is taken daily through Day -1, and is re-started on Day 22 or at the time of early
      termination if before Day 22. Patients are seen in the clinic at Screening and on Days 1, 8,
      15, 22, and at the End of Study Visit; for all other daily visits, the patients may be seen
      either at the clinic or in their residence, provided the assessments are completed as
      described in the protocol. Skin irritation is assessed immediately upon patch removal and at
      1, 24, and 48 hours after removal.

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 7 clinical sites during May and June 2009. Patients received 1 placebo patch and 1 Donepezil Transdermal Patch, each applied to opposite sides of the body.

      <pre_assignment_details>Patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease who were on a stable course of oral Aricept (10 mg/day) were randomized into the study.

          <description>Patients were randomized to receive the active patch on the left or right side of the body, and the matching placebo patch on the same location on the opposite side of the body, and assigned to one of two sets (left and right of the body for placement of the active patch) of the following 6 treatment sequences. The treatment sequence was repeated for the opposite side of the body for a total of 12 treatment sequences. The 7-day patches were applied to one of 3 consecutive body locations, for a total exposure period of 21 days.

          <description>All patients received the same study treatment, consisting of 1 placebo patch and 1 Donepezil Transdermal Patch, and all patches were applied to the same body locations according to 1 of 6 treatment sequences. The active patch was applied to either the right or the left side of the body according to the randomization schedule. The treatment sequence was repeated for the opposite side of the body for a total of 12 treatment sequences. The 7-day patches were applied to one of 3 body locations (upper arm, upper back, side of torso) for a total treatment period of 21 days.</description>

Adhesion was assessed according to the following scoring criteria: Score 0 = approximately &gt; 90% adhered (essentially no lift off the skin); Score 1 = approximately 75% to &lt; 90% adhered (some edges only lifting off the skin); Score 2 = approximately 50% to &lt; 75% adhered (less than half of the system lifting off the skin); Score of 3 = approximately &lt; 50% adhered but not detached (more than half of the system lifting off the skin without falling off); Score of 4 = Patch-system detached (patch /overlay completely off the skin).</description>
        <time_frame>Safety was assessed throughout the study. Adhesion was assessed daily and immediately prior to patch removal on Days 8, 15, and 22.</time_frame>
