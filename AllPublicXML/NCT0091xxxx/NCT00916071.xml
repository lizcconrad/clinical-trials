    <textblock>
      To understand whether a relationship exists between eating disorders and ADHD, we seek to
      clarify the prevalence of ADHD in individuals with eating disorders. To this end, we will
      estimate the prevalence of ADHD, and other neuropsychiatric disorders, in outpatients with
      history of an eating disorder diagnosis. Secondarily, we will identify patterns of cognitive
      deficits in outpatients with history of an eating disorder diagnosis. We will also examine
      whether ADHD in this population is associated with functional and familial correlates
      associated with ADHD.
