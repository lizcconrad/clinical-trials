      The purpose of the study is to investigate inflammatory and other substances that may be
      elevated in the blood and blood cells following spinal cord injury (SCI). These substances
      will be evaluated in samples from people who have had a spinal cord injury due to trauma
      (e.g. car accident or a fall) within the first week (acute) or at least one year ago
      (chronic). Specifically, the study will evaluate the presence and levels of a protein,
      macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). MIF is released by cells and has a specific
      effect on the way cells behave, communicate and work together. In several other medical
      conditions, MIF is known to increase inflammation in the body. By comparing blood samples
      from individuals with spinal cord injury and uninjured (no spinal cord injury) individuals,
      the investigators will try to find out if MIF levels are increased in people with SCI.
      Investigators will also use these samples to measure other proteins that increase
      inflammation in the body and to see if the biological activities of MIF can be reduced in a
      test tube by adding other substances to the blood samples. It is hoped that this study of MIF
      and other proteins related to inflammation will help improve the treatment of SCI in the
      future.

      We hope to enroll a total of 312 subjects in this study (50 with acute spinal cord injury,
      125 with chronic spinal cord injury, and 137 uninjured individuals).

      During the study visit the investigator will collect basic biographical information and
      health information, including some questionnaires, from the subjects and their medical
      record.

      Acute SCI subjects will also have blood drawn once daily (First blood draw will approximately
      be 2 tablespoons and subsequent blood draws will approximately be 1 tablespoon) .

      Chronic SCI subjects will have blood drawn per study visit (approximately 2 tablespoons) and
      will be asked to participate in two study visits, to take place 6 months apart.
