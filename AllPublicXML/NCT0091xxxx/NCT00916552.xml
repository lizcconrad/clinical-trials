  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression and bipolar disorder (mania and depression) may be related to problems with nerve
      cells not being regenerated as fast as normal and are accompanied by cognitive difficulties
      including memory, attention and planning problems. There is thus a need for better, more
      efficient treatments with effects on cognitive function. Erythropoietin (Epo) is involved in
      brain repair and may be a candidate for future treatment strategies. The investigators have
      demonstrated that a single dose of Epo improves mood and reduces the processing of negative
      emotional information in healthy volunteers similar to effects seen with antidepressants.
      With the current study the investigators aim to build upon this discovery by investigating
      whether repeated Epo administration has antidepressant effects and is able to reverse
      cognitive difficulties in patients with depression or bipolar disorder. It is hypothesized
      that Epo will improve mood in treatment-resistant depression and improve cognitive function
      in this group and in patients with bipolar disorder in remission. If the study reveals
      beneficial effects of Epo, this would highlight Epo as a candidate compound for future
      treatment of depression and bipolar disorder, with the potential to directly promote brain
      repair mechanisms.
