  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to study the effects of stopping aromatase inhibitory
      (AI) therapy on breast cancer progression. Aromatase inhibitors are a class of drugs used to
      treat breast cancer in postmenopausal women. They work by decreasing the level of estrogen,
      which is believed to stimulate the growth of tumor tissue. Breast cancer that progresses
      despite therapy with an AI is thought to have been resistant to AI therapy. There is
      scientific evidence to suggest that resistant breast cancer cells learn to grow at the very
      low levels of estrogen present on AI therapy and that increasing estrogen levels even
      slightly by stopping AI therapy with inhibit the breast cancer cells. An improvement or
      stabilization of breast cancer has been observed after stopping therapy with tamoxifen, a
      different anti-estrogen therapy, and has been reported in the literature after stopping AI
      therapy. This research study will be the first study to formally test the rate of disease
      improvement (response) or stabilization after stopping AI therapy.

      -  Participants will have the following tests and procedures done at 8 weeks, 16 weeks, and
           24 weeks after stopping AI therapy: Physical examination; blood tests; tumor assessment
           by physical exam (if possible); chest x-ray or CT scan of chest; CT scans of abdomen and
           pelvis; and bone scan.

        -  After week 24, these procedures will be repeated every 12 weeks while the participant is
           on the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast with
             radiographically documented progressive or recurrent local-regional or metastatic
             disease. Disease must not be considered amenable to curative treatment

          -  Evidence of hormone sensitivity (ER +ve and/or PR +ve) of primary or secondary tumor
             tissue

          -  Measurable or nonmeasurable (but evaluable-defined as nontarget lesions) disease
             according to modified RECIST. Patients with bone disease are eligible. These patients
             will be evaluable only for the presence of stable or progressive disease and not a PR
             or CR. Patients wih bone-only metastatic disease will be considered to have stable
             disease if there is no evidence of new lesions and no clear progression of existing
             lesions

          -  Postmenopausal, defined as fulfilling any of the following criteria: If &gt; 50 year, no
             menses within past 12 months, OR if &lt; 50 years, no menses within past 12 months AND
             FSH within post menopausal range OR bilateral oophorectomy

          -  Current AI monotherapy at the time of documented disease progression

          -  AI therapy must be discontinued at time of study entry or no longer than two weeks
             prior to study entry

          -  Subjects receiving AI therapy for metastatic disease at the time of progression, must
             have had a prior radiographic documented response to AI therapy or have been on
             therapy for at least 6 months

          -  Subjects receiving AI as adjuvant therapy at the time of recurrence, must have been
             treated with AI therapy for at least 12 months

          -  Prior antiestrogen therapies including tamoxifen, steroidal AIs, nonsteroidal AIs, or
             faslodex in either the adjuvant or metastatic settings are allowed provided the
             patient is currently on AI monotherapy (or within two weeks of discontinuation) and
             has demonstrated a response or stable disease on the current AI

          -  Female

          -  Greater than 35 years of age

          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2

             documented liver metastases

          -  Any severe concomitant condition believed to render subject undesirable for
             participation

          -  Systemic anticancer therapy including trastuzumab, chemotherapy, or other biologic
             agents after discontinuation of AI therapy

          -  Hormone replacement therapy including topical or vaginal estrogen therapy within 3
             months prior to discontinuation of AI therapy
