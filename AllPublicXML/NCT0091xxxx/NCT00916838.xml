    <textblock>
      125 children with Type 1 Diabetes mellitis (T1DM) between 4 and 16 were recruited and 62
      healthy siblings also enrolled in the study.

      Children with T1DM and sibling controls ages 4 to 16 were assessed on memory and executive
      control skills at entry to the study (Test 1) and after two years of close monitoring for
      blood sugar events (Test 2). Diabetic children have their blood sugar tested directly before
      and after cognitive testing to ensure their blood sugar is within range during the testing.
      The 2-year follow-up period involves parents/child reporting any severe diabetic episode and
      periodically providing the results of the diabetic child's usual blood tests from their
      glucose monitoring device.

      Children 7 and older also underwent high resolution MRI scans.
