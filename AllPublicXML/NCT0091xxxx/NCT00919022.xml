    <textblock>
      Cyproterone acetate (CPA) is a steroidal antiandrogen which has affinity with progesterone
      and with glucocorticoid receptors. Cyproterone acetate is long-term proven effective
      treatment of inoperable carcinoma of the prostate.

      Sexual functions remain very important in men with prostate cancer. However sexual functions
      are deteriorating fast with course of the disease. The influence of CPA on sexual functions
      remains controversial. IIEF-5 erectile dysfunction questionnaire is currently widely used
      validated simple scoring system for diagnosing of erectile dysfunction and belongs to most
      used systems in Czech Republic. At present there are no data on CPA influence on IIEF-5
      scored erectile dysfunction within the use of its indication in prostate cancer.
