    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation in the elderly is a challenge since patient's co-morbidity and the
      decreased injury threshold of older grafts may limit the benefits of transplantation in these
      patients. To compare favourable effects between low dose tacrolimus (LD-Tac) and
      mycophenolate-mofetil (MMF) in this patient population the investigators conducted a one year
      prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial. 90 kidney transplant recipients &gt; 65
      years with cadaveric grafts (&gt; 65 years) from 5 centers were enrolled and received baseline
      immunosuppression with daclizumab induction (1 mg/kg) at day one and day 14, LD-Tac (trough
      level 5-8 Âµg/ml), MMF (1-2 g/d) and steroids. After three months, patients were centrally
      randomized either to MMF (1-2 g/d) and steroids (23 patients) or to LD-Tac and steroids.
      Follow-up visits were performed every 4 weeks up to one year. Protocol biopsies were
      performed after one year. The investigators' primary hypothesis is that the biopsy proven
      rejection rate in the MMF group is not significantly different compared to the LD-Tac group
      after one year. The investigators' secondary hypothesis is that graft function in the MMF
      group (reflected by the glomerular filtration rate and protocol biopsy result) is superior to
      the graft function in the LD-Tac group.
