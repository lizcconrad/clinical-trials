  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized, double-blind study is to verify the hypothesis that clozapine
      monotherapy is as efficient as a combination of clozapine and olanzapine therapy in
      treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

      A third of schizophrenia patients are non -responders to medications used nowadays. These
      patients are usually treated with clozapine, but a large proportion of patients don't recover
      sufficiently. Therefore, these patients are treated with combination of two or more drugs to
      achieve better treatment results. Until now the scientific evidence has been insufficient to
      assess the utility of polypharmacy.

      The aim is to study during 2009 with voluntary patients, if there is any benefit of
      olanzapine augmentation compared with pure clozapine monotherapy. During the study the
      patients are not exposed to any additional intervention. The intervention in this study is
      just to reduce the previously used polypharmacy.

      Methods: This study lasts for 24 weeks. Participants (30) are randomized in one of two
      alternative interventions (A or B) before the study. After 12 weeks the intervention arms
      cross over (from A to B and from B to A).

      Group B: In addition to clozapine, the participants receive their normal dosage of olanzapine
      (=the same as on the hospital ward) for 12 weeks, next the decreasing dosage of olanzapine
      for four weeks and subsequently placebo for 8 weeks

      Group A: : In addition to clozapine the participants receive the decreasing dosage of
      olanzapine for four weeks, next placebo for 8 weeks, after that the increasing dosage of
      olanzapine for four weeks and subsequently the normal dosage of olanzapine for 8 weeks

      The response for the medical treatment is assessed by Clinical Global Improvement Scale
      (CGIS) and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) -scale.

      The primary outcomes are GAF and modified CGIS during the parallel phase of the study (the
      first 12 weeks). The second phase (the last 12 weeks) of the cross-over study is used in the
      secondary analysis. The use of additional medication (such as benzodiazepines) is used as a
      secondary outcome measure.
