    <textblock>
      Looking at the use of home telehealth equipment and it's place in self management and
      education in patients who suffer moderate to severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
      (COPD). The patients in this group would be those patients who traditionally suffer from
      emphysema, and/or chronic bronchitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have been admitted to the hospital, or who have frequent urgent care visits, who
      also suffer from COPD exacerbations will be given a home monitoring system. Daily, the
      patient will respond to a series of questions. The results of the question answers will be
      remotely monitored by a nurse case manager.

      The objective is to measure compliance, resource use, and the ability for early recognition
      of an exacerbation of their COPD, and early implementation of therapy.
