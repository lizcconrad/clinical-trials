  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess whether a computer haptic peripheral device programmed to provide
      repetitive motion training is as effective as the same repetitive motion training provided by
      a human being.

    <textblock>
      This study builds on a large body of neurological research that uses robot-guided repetitive
      motion training to induce neuroplasticity and improvements in upper extremity motor skills in
      adults and children. This research study is looking at handwriting, a fine-motor task that is
      used daily.

      In our study, we want to see if 3-dimensional robotic-assisted repetitive motion training can
      be a safe and effective intervention for school-age children with fine motor deficits arising
      from several different impairment origins. Our research construct is: Legible handwriting =
      function of (tactile feedback, visual feedback, duration, and fine-motor control).

      Independent variables:

        -  Tactile feedback is a continuous variable of force-feedback measured in pounds of force.

        -  Duration is a continuous variable measured in seconds and number of repetitions.

        -  Visual feedback is the letter scribed on the paper.

      Dependent variable:

        -  Legible handwriting will be measured by scoring on the Test of Handwriting Skills and
           the Print Tool™ evaluation.

        -  Fine motor deficit/control will be measured directly and objectively by quantifying the
           error between the desired scribing task and the actual scribing task.

      The robotic device is an affordable (&lt;$200) computer haptic (the Falcon(R)) that currently is
      approved by the FCC for home and office. It is *not* approved for medical use. This is an
      investigational, nonsignificant risk device.
