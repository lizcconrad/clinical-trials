      This is a phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of using light-activated
      talaporfin sodium in patients with LUTS due to BPH who are candidates for interventional
      therapy.

      The eligible patient will undergo placement of a proprietary drug activator into the
      prostatic urethra. Following the placement of the drug activator, patients will receive
      talaporfin sodium at 1 mg/kg intravenously by slow push over 3-5 minutes. Fifteen minutes
      after injection a light dose of 100 Joules per centimeter (J/cm) will be delivered at 20
      mW/cm to each patient for a treatment duration of 1 hour 23 minutes.

      SAE reporting will occur from the day of treatment (Day 0) through end of study (month 12),
      inclusive. Any SAE that is still ongoing at the end of the study will be followed until
      assessed as chronic, stable or resolved.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males, aged 50 years or older with prior diagnosis of BPH;

          2. Patients may be eligible whether or not they are on medication for LUTS due to BPH.

          3. Patients who are candidates for interventional therapy;

          4. Patients who understand and have the ability to sign written informed consent prior to
             any study procedures and/or discontinuation of exclusionary medications;

          5. Patients with an International Prostate Symptom Score of ≥ 15 points;

          6. Patients with moderate to severe BPH (Bother Score ≥ 3);

          7. Maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) ≤ 15 mL/sec;

          8. Post void residual volume (PVR) ≤ 300 mL;

          9. Length of prostatic urethra ≥ 4.0 cm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with any previous minimally invasive or surgical intervention for BPH.

          2. Patients who are currently enrolled in or who have enrolled in another clinical trial
             for any disease within the past 30 days.
