  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxidative stress has been implicated in playing a pathogenic role in many disease processes,
      especially in age-related disorders. It has been hypothesized that antioxidative agents such
      as vitamins and minerals, which are capable of scavenging free radicals, may reduce oxidative
      stress and may, in turn, be beneficial for patients with age-related disorders. Based on this
      hypothesis, several different combinations of vitamins have been introduced, all targeting at
      reducing oxidative stress. However, the in-vivo determination of the antioxidative properties
      of a certain drug or vitamin combination are hard to determine. In the current study, the
      researchers propose to investigate the effect of VITAMAC®, a combination of vitamins and
      minerals, in a systemic in-vivo inflammation model.

      In the present study, the infusion of LPS, which is a cell wall component of Gram-negative
      bacteria and a major mediator in the pathogenesis of septic shock, will be used as a
      standardized experimental model of systemic inflammation in humans. Given that inflammation
      is associated with enhanced oxidative stress and widespread endothelial dysfunction, the LPS
      model is well suitable for determination of the antioxidative effects of VITAMAC®. As a main
      outcome parameter, the vascular reactivity of retinal vessels to systemic hyperoxia (induced
      by breathing 100% oxygen) will be tested in presence or absence of the antioxidant
      combination.
