  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current proposal is a randomized, controlled, clinical trial to evaluate the
      intergenerational impact of treating depressed mothers whose children suffer from psychiatric
      disorders.

      This study will compare a psychotherapy for mothers that targets factors known to be
      associated with the intergenerational transmission of psychiatric disorders to a nonspecific
      psychotherapeutic control condition. It will evaluate outcomes in both children and mothers.
      A modified form of interpersonal psychotherapy for depression, IPT-MOMS, specifically
      addresses maternal depressive symptoms, maternal interpersonal functioning, and mother-child
      communication, all factors that contribute to psychiatric illness in youth (Swartz et al.,
      2006). This application proposes to recruit mother-child dyads, both of whom suffer from
      psychiatric illness, randomly assign mothers to nine sessions over 3 months of either
      IPT-MOMS (N=105) or brief supportive psychotherapy (BSP; N=105), and evaluate the impact of
      acute maternal treatment on child and maternal outcomes at 3, 6, 9, and 12 month follow-up.

    <description>Interventions will be administered during the 3 Month Acute Randomized Phase and will consist of nine individual 45-minute sessions conducted over the course of three months. Treatment cannot exceed 9 sessions. Brief supportive therapy (BSP) is a manualized form of supportive psychotherapy which emphasizes reflective listening and elicitation of affect (Markowitz et al., 2008). Therapists are instructed to allow patients to determine the focus of each session, pulling for emotion, validating emotions when possible, and offering empathic comments.</description>

             defined by the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) and documented by the

             and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion Criteria (Mothers)

          1. If a mother subject IS NOT on antidepressants:

             Mothers must be off all antidepressant medications for at least 14 days (30 days for
             fluoxetine) prior to screening to ensure that pretreatment assessments are not
             distorted by drug withdrawal or rebound effects). Mother subjects cannot start taking
             antidepressant medications during the acute treatment phase. If they do start taking
             antidepressant medication during the acute treatment portion of the study, their
             participation in the acute phase of the study will be terminated. They will be
             continued to be followed in the follow-up phase.

             If a mother subject IS on antidepressants:

             Mothers must be on a stable dose of an antidepressant medication (4 consecutive weeks
             at the same dose) prior to signing consent. The mother subject must agree to stay on
             the same antidepressant at this current dose throughout the duration of the acute
             phase of the study. If a participant's dosage of an antidepressant medication is
             changed or if they cease taking their antidepressant medication during the acute
             treatment portion of the study, their participation in the acute phase of the study
             will be terminated. They will be continued to be followed in the follow-up phase.

          2. Active suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation that in the clinical opinion of the
             research team as headed by the PI, would require hospitalization

          3. At serious risk for child abuse or neglect which in the clinical opinion of the
             research team as headed by the PI, requires intervention

          4. Comorbid psychotic disorder, organic mental disorder, current (within prior six
             months) substance or alcohol abuse, borderline personality disorder, antisocial
             personality disorder, or history of a prior manic episode (bipolar disorder)

          5. Significant medical illness that might explain depressive symptoms such as epilepsy,
             autoimmune disorders, or unstable endocrine disease

          6. Not fluent in English. The intervention to be tested in this study is psychotherapy.
             The staff is only trained to deliver these interventions in English. Thus, all
             subjects must be fluent in English.

          7. Severe cognitive deficits that would preclude treatment with psychotherapy and/or
             prevent completion of study questionnaires

          8. Current receipt of another form of individual psychotherapy; concurrent participation
             in a support group (such as Alcoholics Anonymous), couples therapy, or family therapy
             will be permitted

             questionnaire and/or PI's judgment

         10. Unwilling or unable to comply with study requirements (i.e., complete forms, attend
             scheduled evaluations)

        Exclusion Criteria (Psychiatrically Ill Children)

             such as sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, or leukemia; children with moderate
             medical illnesses may be included in the study if the PI determines it is of no
             greater risk to the child's medical illness

          4. Unwilling or unable to comply with study requirements (i.e., complete forms, attend
