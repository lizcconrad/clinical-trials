      To determine if the Clarity 3DUS (3D Ultrasound) system can be used by multiple individuals
      to acquire 3DUS images and produce consistent TB (Tumor Bed) shifts for breast IGRT
      (Image-Guided Radiation Therapy).

      TB Contouring The CT1, CT2, and US1 tumor beds will be manually contoured on the RM
      workstation by one of the study radiation therapists. Contouring will be performed using
      previously defined contouring guidelines. Available automatic contouring tools, including the
      'interpolate' contouring function, may be utilized and contouring times will be recorded.

      IGRT Assessment The patient will be set up on the breast board in treatment position. The
      'ultra path' component of the Clarity system, which displays the path of the previous US
      acquired at CT simulation, will be used to guide the acquisition of US2. Although performed
      in the simulator room, the Clarity system will be used in 'treatment mode' thus simulating
      Clarity as it is used for IGRT. The study RT will first acquire the US2 scan. All steps
      following the acquisition of US2 will be performed off-line on the RM workstation without the
      need for further simulator or patient time.

    <description>Subjects will undergo a CT scan and an US of your breast for the planning of radiation therapy after a breast conserving operation.
About 1 week after the start of radiation treatment subjects will have a second CT and US. During this visit subjects will have one CT and three US's. These US's will be performed by 3 different radiation therapists. Part of the current study is to compare the similarity of the 3 US pictures taken by different individuals.</description>
