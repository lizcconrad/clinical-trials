  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heat Intolerance (HI) is a life threatening deficiency that can lead to heat exhaustion, heat
      stroke (and possibly death) in a large number of military and civilian occupational groups.
      We have demonstrated malfunction of transcriptional pathways in the heat stressed HI
      phenotype and an altered gene expression profile compared to Heat Tolerant (HT) individuals.
      Such differences are evident even under normothermic basal/comfort conditions. Heat and
      exercise challenges during the heat tolerance test (HTT) further emphasize the differences
      between the groups, particularly during recovery at comfort temperatures. Our results
      indicate that it may be possible to identify markers of heat intolerance. To achieve this
      goal, we plan to design a cellular (lymphocyte) HTT experimental model and detect gene
      expression profiles using customized DNA microarrays and bioinformatic tools (the genes
      selected will be based on our previous DNA microarray studies). Lymphocyte samples collected
      from HT and HI individuals under resting/comfort conditions will be examined. Treatments and
      analyses are designed to reveal HI-associated gene-expression profiles (constitutive or
      inducible), and thereby find lymphocyte markers to identify individuals predisposed to heat
      injury. The identification of such subjects could prevent unnecessary loss of life. Notably,
      the rapidly changing climate in our era increases the number of occupation/age groups in
      which manifestations of HI will appear.

        Blood samples of HT and HI subjects will be collected from volunteers who experienced heat
        exhaustion or heat stroke in their past and participating in heat tolerance test (HTT). The
        test, using conservative criteria discriminates between HI and HT groups. The distinction
        between HI and HT groups occurs only following analyses of the HTT.
