  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (Progeria) is a rare autosomal disease that results in
      premature death at a median age of 13 years due to cardiovascular and cerebralvascular
      compromise. The mutation for this disease has been identified and results in a mutant form of
      lamin A that cannot be de-farnesylated. This study evaluates the combination of pravastain (a
      statin), lonafarnib (a farnesyltransferase inhibitor) and zoledronic acid (a bisphosphonate)
      in an open label phase II efficacy trial in children with Progeria. These agents all target
      farnesylation pathways at different points. Patients with genetically confirmed progeria will
      be eligible for this protocol. Treatment will be initiated for 24 months duration. Clinical
      and biologic parameters will be examined to assess response.

    <description>Lonafarnib: Lonafarnib dosing will begin at 150 mg/m2 by mouth twice daily. Lonafarnib will be orally administered without planned breaks, approximately every 12 hours, for a period of 24 months. For patients unable to swallow capsules, the capsules can be opened and dissolved into Ora Blend SF or Ora-Plus.
Zoledronic Acid: Zoledronic acid will be administered intravenously at week one, and months 6, 12, 18 and 24 of this treatment trial. Treatment will consist of one infusion over a 30 minute period.
Pravastatin: Pravastatin will be orally administered once daily without planned breaks, approximately every 24 hours, for a period of 24 months. The drug may be taken with meals. For patients unable to swallow pills, pills can be crushed into food. Pravastatin will be dosed according to the patient weight. Patients less than 10 kg will receive 5 mg pravastatin orally, once daily. Patients weighing 10 kg or greater will receive 10 mg pravastatin daily.</description>
