  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common infection among women that is associated with
      considerable morbidity and health-care cost. 75% of women will suffer of Candida infection
      for at least one time in their life. 20% of women who suffer from VVC will have ≥ 4 episodes
      of VVC during the one year prior to the survey. 80% of these VVC are caused by Candida
      albicans. Current treatments, based on imidazoles, face many failures or recurrences. The
      type of probiotic Lactobacillus may participate in the prevention of recurrent
      vulvo-vaginitis in reducing the proliferation of intestinal Candida albicans, its adherence
      to the vaginal walls, the potentiation of its propagation. The primary objective of this
      study was to investigate if our supplementary treatment could improve the initial cure rate
      after vaginal econazole therapy.
