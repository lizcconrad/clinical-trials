      The purpose of the present study is to develop a biological prognostic index in patients with
      Binet stage A Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) who do not necessitate therapy according to
      NCI guidelines and to prospectively validate the proposed score system based on the
      absence/presence of 1, 2 or 3 unfavorable prognostic markers such as cluster of
      differentiation 38 (CD38) expression, Zap-70 expression and immunoglobulin heavy chain
      variable region (IgVH) configuration.

      Clinical data including information on disease localization and laboratory parameters will be
      collected at study entry, during follow up and at disease progression (or after 36 months
      after registration) Biological markers will be evaluated at centralized laboratory, at study
      entry and at time of disease progression (or after 24 months of follow-up for non progressed
      patients) Using the scoring system, patients can be separated into 3 risk groups: low-risk
      (score 0), intermediate-risk (score 1) and high-risk (score 2-3), with significantly
      different clinical courses.

             (Diagnosis will be confirmed by the biological review committee according to flow
             cytometry analysis (positive clusters of differentiation antigen 5 (CD5), 19 (CD19),23
             (CD23)).

          -  Diagnosis performed within 12 months before inclusion in the study.

          -  Patients who do not necessitate therapy by NCI guidelines (watch and wait policy).

          -  Shipment of peripheral blood sample to centralized laboratory for biological
             assessment.

          -  Clinical data including baseline information on disease localization and laboratory
             parameters at staging and assurance of follow up updating for at least 3 years are
             requested.

          -  Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with CLL whose diagnosis exceed 12 months before registration.

          -  Patients with leukemic phase of lymphoproliferative disorders of B origin CD5- and/or
             CD23- according to flow cytometry analysis.

          -  Clinical Binet stage B or C.

          -  Patients who necessitate therapy according to NCI guide-lines (no watch and wait
             policy).
