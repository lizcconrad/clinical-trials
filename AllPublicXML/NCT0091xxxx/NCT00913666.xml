        Inclusion Criteria:

        Healthy Control Subjects (Group 1)

          -  Must be in general good health.

          -  Must not have received interferons in the past.

        All MS Subjects

          -  Clinical or laboratory-supported diagnosis of relapsing remitting MS (McDonald et al,
             criteria numbers 1-4).

          -  Either on AVONEX® or treatment-naïve.

          -  Have an EDSS score between 0.0 and 5.5, inclusive.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reaction or hypersensitivity to human
             albumin, to any interferon, to other components of the drug formulation.

          -  History of intolerance to acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin that would
             preclude the use of at least one of these during the study.

          -  History of any clinically significant (as determined by the investigator) cardiac,
             endocrinologic, hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic, urologic, pulmonary,
             neurologic, dermatologic, psychiatric, renal, and/or other major disease.

          -  History of malignancy.

          -  The presence of any significant medical condition or psychiatric illness not due to MS
             that, in the investigator's opinion, would interfere with therapy

          -  History of uncontrolled seizures within the 3 months prior to enrollment.

          -  History of suicidal ideation or an episode of severe depression within the 3 months
             prior to enrollment.

          -  Serious local infection (e.g., cellulitis, abscess) or systemic infection (e.g.,
             pneumonia, septicemia) within 8 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C antibody (HCV) or
             positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) at screening.

        Other inclusion and exclusion criteria apply as per protocol
