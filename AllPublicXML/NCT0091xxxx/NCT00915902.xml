  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High triglyceride levels are increasingly recognized in children, particularly those who are
      overweight. There are no studies of treatment of high triglycerides in children and
      adolescents. Fish oil is attractive because it is considered safe and effective for treating
      high triglycerides in adults and has been used safely for other purposes in children. The
      investigators will conduct a randomized study of Lovaza (the only prescription omega-3 fish
      oil medication) in 44 children and adolescents to study efficacy in lowering triglycerides,
      safety, and possible mechanisms of beneficial effects.

      Participants (n = 42, age 14 + 2 yrs) with hypertriglyceridemia and LDL cholesterol &lt; 160
      mg/dl were enrolled in a randomized double blind cross over trial comparing 4 g fish oil
      daily with placebo. Treatment interval was 8 weeks with a 4 week wash out, between the two
      treatment intervals. Lipid profile, lipoprotein particle distribution and size, glucose,
      insulin, high sensitivity C reactive protien (CRP), interleukin-6, fibrinogen, plasminogen
      activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and thrombin generation were measured.

      Patients were evaluated at 6 time points: Visit 1/baseline (week 0), Visit 2/randomization
      (week 4), Visit 3/after treatment 1 (week 12) , Visit 4/after wash out (week 16), Visit
      5/after treatment 2 (week 24) and Visit 6/close out (week 28) . Patients were advised to
      maintain a stable diet and not alter baseline fish consumption . One participant took an oral
      contraceptive throughout the trial. Any fish oil supplements were discontinued. Advice on a
      heart healthy diet was provided. Blood pressure (right arm sitting with appropriate sized
      cuff, taken 3 times, last measurement used), height, and weight were measured at the
      beginning of the study, after the first wash out period, and close out. Participant phone
      contact was made during each treatment arm to assess diet stability. Fasting lipid profile
      was performed at every visit. Red blood cell fatty acid profile and secondary endpoints were
      performed at all visits except baseline.

    <description>This randomized, double-blind, placebo, crossover trial consisted of two 8-week treatment periods, separated by a 4-week washout. Eligible patients were randomized to receive either fish oil 4 g daily or corn oil placebo during the first 8-week treatment period; patients received the alternate treatment during the next treatment period. GlaxoSmithKline supplied the study drug and the placebo. The study drug, Omega-3-acid ethyl esters (Lovaza) was given to patients PO daily as two, 1 g capsules taken twice daily during the duration of their 8-week treatment period. The study drug contained minimally 1.5 g DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and 1.86 g EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid).</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Intrinsic variability of triglycerides is large and may have confounded analyses; 4-week washout between treatment periods may have been too short; a reduction of triglycerides in the corn oil placebo group may have compromised the results.</limitations_and_caveats>
