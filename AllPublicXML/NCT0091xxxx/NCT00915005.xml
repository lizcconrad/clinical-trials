    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if, compared with regular x-ray
      radiation, proton radiation reduces the risk of developing, treatment-related pneumonitis
      (TRP) or tumor recurrence (the tumor coming back in the irradiated area after treatment) in
      patients with lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are 2 types of radiation treatment being used in this study. One type of treatment is
      proton therapy. Proton therapy is a type of radiation therapy that uses a beam of proton
      particles (similar to getting an x-ray) to send radiation inside the body to the tumor. The
      other type of treatment is Image-Guided Adaptive Photon Therapy (IGAPT). IGAPT is a therapy
      that uses images to help guide the delivery of photon therapy to the tumor. Both of these
      types of radiation treatment are believed to help doctors to give a full dose of radiation
      treatment to the tumor while not damaging as much of the healthy tissue around it.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will go through the standard
      radiation treatment planning procedure, called the &quot;marking session.&quot; After the marking
      session, a standard photon therapy plan (called Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy, or
      IMRT) and a proton plan will be developed. If the radiation oncologist thinks that both the
      photon and proton plans are acceptable, you will then be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups.
      Participants in Group 1 will receive photon therapy. Participants in Group 2 will receive
      proton therapy.

      The first 20 participants will have an equal chance to be assigned to either group. After at
      least 20 participants have been enrolled and there has been at least 1 occurrence of
      pneumonitis and/or tumor recurrence in each treatment Group, the risk of pneumonitis and/or
      tumor recurrence in all previous participants will be evaluated for each treatment Group, and
      that information will be used to calculate the chances of being assigned to either Group 1 or
      Group 2. This calculation will be updated after each occurrence of pneumonitis and/or tumor
      recurrence and after each participant returns for a follow-up visit. Once these calculations
      are begun, everyone who joins the study from that point on will be more likely to be assigned
      to the treatment Group that appears to be better in terms of pneumonitis and/or tumor
      recurrence.

      If the tumor is too large and the standard radiation treatment plan created during the
      marking session is found not to be acceptable, and the radiation oncologist thinks radiation
      treatment it is necessary, you will still remain on study and be assigned to a third group.
      If you are assigned to Group 3, you will receive proton or photon treatment at a lower dose
      level and/or reduced length of radiation.

      If you are assigned to Group 2 and your insurance provider denies reimbursement, you may
      chose not to receive proton therapy and receive photon therapy instead. If you chose to
      receive photon therapy, you will be in Group 4.

      Radiation Therapy Administration:

      Both radiation therapy treatments (photon and proton) are given through a radiation machine
      called an accelerator. The radiation therapy administration process is very similar to the
      way that a CT scan is performed. You will lay on a table and the treatment machine rotates
      around you without touching your body. Each daily treatment should take about 20-30 minutes
      to complete. Most of this time is used to position you correctly before the machine is turned
      on. The actual time used to give the radiation should take about 3-5 minutes each day.

      While you are on this study and if you are in Groups 1 or 2, you will receive a total of 37
      radiation treatments. Radiation is given 5 days a week for about 7 1/2 weeks.

      If you are in Group 1, you will receive photon radiation treatment in the main hospital.

      If you are in Group 2, you will receive proton therapy in the proton treatment center (PTC).

      If you are in Group 3, you will receive either photon or proton therapy, whichever your
      doctor decides is better for you, for 6-7 1/2 weeks. If your doctor decides that photon
      therapy is better you will receive your treatment in the main hospital. If your doctor
      decides that proton therapy is better you will receive your treatment in the Proton Therapy
      Center.

      If you are in Group 4, you will receive Photon radiation treatment in the main hospital.

      Chemotherapy:

      You will receive carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy 1 time a week over 7 weeks. Each
      treatment will last 3-4 hours. Paclitaxel will be given by vein over 1 hour and carboplatin
      will be given by vein over 30 minutes. You will receive this chemotherapy combination with
      radiation therapy, as part of your treatment on this study.

      Your chemotherapy may also be decided by your treating medical oncologist as long as the
      therapy is allowed by the study.

      Study Visits During Chemoradiation:

      At least 1 time each week for all study participants, you will have study tests performed.
      During this weekly study visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have experienced.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a PET/CT scan performed to check the
      status of the disease during Week 4 or 5 of treatment.

      Length of Study:

      You will remain on study as long you are benefiting. You will be taken off study early if the
      disease gets worse, you experience intolerable side effects, or your doctor thinks that it is
      no longer in your best interest to receive the study treatment.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      After you have completed chemoradiation, the study staff or study nurse will contact you 1
      time each month to ask you about any symptoms you may have until 6 months after
      chemoradiation. Each phone call should last about 10 minutes.

      You will have your first follow-up visit 4-8 weeks after you have completed chemoradiation.
      You will have additional follow-up visits every 3-4 months for 3 years, every 6 months for
      the next 2 years, and then 1 time every year after that.

      At the first and second follow-up visit the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans and
           single proton emission tomography (SPECT) scans to check the status of your lungs and
           heart if the radiation or medical oncologist thinks it is necessary.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      If the radiation oncologist or medical oncologist thinks it is needed, at the follow-up
      visits, you will have breathing function tests performed to check your lung function for up
      to 1 year after the study treatment is complete. For this test, the radiation oncologist,
      medical oncologist or study nurse will have you breathe into a special machine. The radiation
      oncologist or medical oncologist will decide how many tests are to be performed each time.

      PET/CT and SPECT scans will be performed again at any time the radiation oncologist or
      medical oncologist thinks they are needed.

      Other tests may be performed if the study doctor (radiation oncologist, medical oncologist,
      surgeon or pulmonologist ) thinks they are needed.

      This is an investigational study. Both proton radiotherapy and IGAPT are FDA approved for the
      treatment of lung cancer.

      Up to 250 patients will take part in this multicenter research study. Up to 205 will be
      enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
