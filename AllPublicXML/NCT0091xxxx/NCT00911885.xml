    <textblock>
      Identifying a simple dietary recommendation for weight loss and metabolic health may
      demonstrate potential for a simple public health message to impact coronary heart disease
      (CHD) prevention and metabolic syndrome. In a randomized clinical trial, the investigators
      propose to compare the efficacy of two intervention approaches to dietary change for CHD
      prevention among persons with metabolic syndrome. The two approaches are 1) the AHA Dietary
      Guidelines; and 2) a simple dietary change condition that focuses on increasing fiber. The
      investigators hypothesize that a message promoting high fiber intake may be the simple
      message that has potential to produce broad impact.

      The investigators will recruit 240 overweight and obese adults from a primary care setting
      who meet diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome. The efficacy of the two dietary change
      interventions will be compared in a randomized controlled trial, with 120 patients per group.
      The two approaches are 1) the American Heart Association (AHA) Dietary Guidelines; and 2) a
      simple dietary change condition that focuses on increasing fiber. Patients in both conditions
      will receive intensive dietary instruction for 3 months, followed by a 9 month maintenance
      phase. Both conditions will receive dietary instructions via individual and group sessions
      led by registered dietitians. Assessments, including diet, anthropometrics, blood pressure,
      fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood lipids, insulin, inflammatory
      markers, medication use, depression, quality of life, and physical activity will be conducted
      at baseline and at 6-, and 12-months after randomization. A 3-month post-intensive
      intervention assessment will measure short-term changes in body weight, diet, and metabolic
      syndrome indicators.
