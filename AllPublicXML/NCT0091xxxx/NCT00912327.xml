    <textblock>
      Study BT-CL-PGG-CRC0821 is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, efficacy and safety study. It
      will be conducted using a two-stage design with the intention of determining the initial
      efficacy of Imprime PGG in combination with a monoclonal antibody (MAb; cetuximab) in the
      treatment of KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer (CRC). Both stages will be conducted in subjects
      with Stage IV CRC demonstrating the KRAS gene mutation. Subjects will dose until progression
      of disease or discontinuation from the study for other reasons; e.g., safety, non-compliance.
      Approximately 56 subjects will be enrolled at three participating centers (17 into Stage 1
      and 39 into Stage 2).

      Study BT-CL-PGG-CRC0821 is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, efficacy and safety study. It
      will be conducted using a two-stage design with the intention of determining the initial
      efficacy of Imprime PGG in combination with a monoclonal antibody (MAb; cetuximab) in the
      treatment of KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer (CRC). Both stages will be conducted in subjects
      with Stage IV CRC demonstrating the KRAS gene mutation. All subjects will receive Imprime PGG
      at 4 mg/kg and standard doses of cetuximab; Imprime PGG and cetuximab will be administered in
      6-week cycles. Subjects will dose until progression of disease or discontinuation from the
      study for other reasons; e.g., safety, non-compliance. The initial cetuximab dose will be 400
      mg/m2 on Cycle 1/Day1 and subsequent doses of cetuximab will be 250 mg/m2 weekly. Imprime PGG
      will be dosed weekly at 4 mg/kg. Tumor measurements and determination of tumor responses for
      this study will be performed according to RECIST. Approximately 56 subjects will be enrolled
      at three participating centers (17 into Stage 1 and 39 into Stage 2). Final results will be
      determined from combined Stage 1 and Stage 2 data.
