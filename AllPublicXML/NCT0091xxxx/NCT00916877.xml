      Though brain metastases are a risk in all patients with breast cancer, those with HER-2
      overexpression are at significantly greater risk. One series estimated a 30% incidence of
      brain metastases in this population, while another study found an incidence of approximately
      40%. Traditional systemic therapies do not cross the blood brain barrier to any significant
      degree or at all, but radiation treatment can be effective in the treatment of intracranial
      metastases.

      The rationale for PCI is that the brain is a sanctuary site where cancer cells can remain
      inaccessible to chemotheraphy and agents such as trastuzumab due to the blood brain barrier,
      which prevents potentially harmful chemicals such as chemotherapy agents and antibodies such
      as trastuzumab from reaching the brain. Decreasing the incidence of brain metastasis with
      acceptable effects on neurocognitive function would be a significant improvement in the care
      of patients with MBC.
