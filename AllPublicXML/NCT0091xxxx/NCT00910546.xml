  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to quantify the variation in tumour middle position during a
      course of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), and thereby be able to design radiotherapy
      margins that takes into account the full motion span throughout an entire course of SBRT.

      Lung tumours move with respiration. This must be considered when designing margins for
      radiotherapy. This movement can be quantified by fluoroscopy or 4DCT. It is possible to
      identify a tumour middle position for planning. This middle position will vary from day to
      day and the extent of this variation is not fully known. The aim of this study is to quantify
      the variation in tumour middle position during a course of stereotactic body radiotherapy
      (SBRT), and thereby be able to design margins for patients that take into account the full
      motion span throughout an entire course of SBRT Patients: 15 consecutive patients with
      inoperable low stage lung cancer or solitary metastases to the lung (1-2) referred for SBRT -
      45 Gy/3 fractions.

      Methods: A gold coil will be implanted into the lung tumour one week before the planning. At
      planning and all treatment days supplementary 4DCT of thorax and two orthogonal fluoroscopy
      sessions will be performed. Tumour motion in the superior-inferior, medio-lateral and
      cranio-caudal direction will be measured and variation in amplitude and baseline for the
      tumour motion will be reported.

      Perspective: By examining the variation in tumour movement it will be possible design margins
      for SBRT, accounting for the full tumour motion span and minimizing the risk of geographical
      miss and thereby optimizing the chance for local tumour control.
