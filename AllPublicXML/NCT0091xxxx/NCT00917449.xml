      Aim

      The principal objective of this project is:

      â€¢ To evaluate the efficacy of long term (18 months) L-Arginine therapy in preventing or
      delaying clinical onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus in subjects with impaired glucose
      tolerance (IGT) and Metabolic Syndrome.

      Secondary end points are:

        1. To define if a long term treatment with L-arginine is able to ameliorate insulin
           sensitivity and endothelial dysfunction in this population.

        2. To find new risk profiles and candidate genes able to define the sub-group of patients
           at higher risk to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Methodology This is a double blind, parallel, one centre study to determine if long term oral
      L-arginine administration is able to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients
      with Metabolic Syndrome. Two hundred and ninety four subjects were recruited at the
      Cardio-Metabolic and Clinical Trials Unit of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute. One
      hundred and forty two patients were randomized to enter the study and assigned to two arms:
      oral L-arginine (6.4 g/die) or placebo, in addition to diet and physical exercise. The
      treatment were maintained for 18 months. Visits were performed every 3 months for clinical
      evaluation, blood samples, treatment supply and collection of data on adverse events.
      Furthermore, patients were contacted every month by telephone to evaluate the accurate
      continuation of the study and they were instructed to phone to the centre in case of possible
      adverse events.

      An OGTT were performed before the enter into the study and at the end of the study period. An
      additional OGTT were performed at an intermediate visit if fasting glucose levels were more
      than 126 mg/dl. A diabetic response caused the end-point of the patient. Metabolic, hormonal
      and endothelial activation and inflammation parameters were measured. Evaluation of
      endothelium-mediated and non-endothelium-mediated vasodilatation were performed by strain
      gauche plethysmography evaluating forearm blood at the basal state. in post-ischemic
      conditions and after nitroglycerine administration.

      Before the enter into the study, an additional blood sample were drawn for DNA extraction and
      candidate genes variants evaluation. Before the enter into the study and at the end of the
      study period, gene expression for inflammation were measured on mRNA extraction on
      endothelial progenitor cells.

      This is a double blind, parallel, one centre study to determine if long term oral L-arginine
      administration is able to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with IGT and
      Metabolic Syndrome. Two hundred and ninety four subjects were recruited at the
      CardioMetabolic and Clinical Trials Unit of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute. One
      hundred and fourty two patients were randomized to enter the study. Patients were randomly
      assigned to two arms: oral L-arginine (6.4 g/die) or placebo in blind scheme. The treatment
      were maintained for 18 months. Visits will be performed every 3 months for clinical
      evaluation, blood samples, treatment supply and collect data on adverse events, if any.
      Furthermore, patients were contacted every month by telephone to evaluate the accurate
      continuation of the study and they were instructed to phone to the centre in case of possible
      adverse events.
