      RATIONALE: Studying the genes expressed in samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer
      may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tumor tissue samples from patients who have
      undergone surgery for breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine if candidate genes display differential expression between normal and
           cancer breast tissues.

      OUTLINE: Previously collected breast cancer tissue samples (paraffin embedded blocks) and
      normal adjacent tissue are used for immunohistochemistry studies of expression of candidate
      genes.
