  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of lenalidomide as a first
      line therapy in treating patients with B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. This study will
      compare the effects (good and bad) of lenalidomide with chlorambucil.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After notification from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 12 July 2013, Celgene
      agreed to discontinue the lenalidomide treatment for all patients due to an imbalance in the
      number of deaths in patients treated with lenalidomide versus patients treated with
      chlorambucil. No specific causality for this imbalance has been identified to date.
      Investigators were instructed to immediately discontinue all participants from experimental
      lenalidomide treatment and inform their patients accordingly. Participants on the
      Chlorambucil arm may continue up to 12 months (13 cycles) with the last participant
      completing in March 2014. All randomized participants will continue to be followed for
      overall survival and secondary primary malignancies.

    <measure>Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Progression Free Survival (PFS) With a Later Cut-off of 31 March 2014</measure>
    <time_frame>Data cut-off of 31 March 2014; up to approximately 53 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progression confirmed per investigator's assessment or death due to any cause on study, whichever occurred first. Progressive disease included lymphadenopathy, an appearance of any new lesion such as enlarged lymph nodes (&gt; 1.5 cm), splenomegaly, hepatomegaly or other organ infiltrates, an increase by 50% or more in greatest determined diameter of any previous site or an increase by 50% or more in the sum of the product of diameters of multiple nodes. The progression date was assigned to the earliest time when any progression was observed without prior missing assessments. If withdrawal of consent or lost to follow-up occurred before documented progression or death, then these observations were censored at the date when the last complete tumor assessments determined a lack of progression.</description>

    <description>AEs = any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, regardless of cause. Serious AE (SAE) = any AE which results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; constitutes an important medical event. The severity of AEs were graded based upon the participants symptoms according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 4.0); AEs were evaluated for severity according to the following scale: Grade 1 = Mild - transient or mild discomfort; no medical intervention required; Grade 2 = Moderate - mild to moderate limitation in activity; Grade 3 = Severe; Grade 4 = Life threatening; Grade 5 = Death</description>

    <description>The FACT-Leu scale is a valid, reliable, and efficient measure of leukemia-specific health-related quality of life for acute and chronic disease. The FACT-Leu is described as including 27 items that assess 17 physical symptoms (fevers, bleeding, general pain, stomach pain, chills, night sweats, bruising, lymph node swelling, weakness, tiredness, weight loss, appetite, shortness of breath, functional ability, diarrhea, concentration, and mouth sores) and 10 emotional/social concerns (frustration with activity limitation, discouraged by illness, future planning, uncertainty, worry about illness, emotional lability, isolation, infertility concern, family worry, and worry about infections).</description>

    <description>The standardized extended version of EQ-5D was designed for the collection of health state values using a visual analogue scale (VAS) rating scale - a vertical 20 cm visual analogue scale with the end points labeled best imaginable health state at the top and worst imaginable health state at the bottom having numeric values of 100 and 0 respectively. The participant is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
        <description>AEs = any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, regardless of cause. Serious AE (SAE) = any AE which results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; constitutes an important medical event. The severity of AEs were graded based upon the participants symptoms according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 4.0); AEs were evaluated for severity according to the following scale: Grade 1 = Mild - transient or mild discomfort; no medical intervention required; Grade 2 = Moderate - mild to moderate limitation in activity; Grade 3 = Severe; Grade 4 = Life threatening; Grade 5 = Death</description>
        <time_frame>From randomization up to data cut-off of 18 Feb 2013; Up to approximately 39 months; maximum duration of exposure for Lenalidomide was 1086 days and 406 days for Chlorambucil</time_frame>

The safety population was defined as all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of the study treatment (either lenalidomide or chlorambucil) as of the data cut off date of 18 Feb 2013</population>

        <title>Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Progression Free Survival (PFS) With a Later Cut-off of 31 March 2014</title>
        <description>Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progression confirmed per investigator’s assessment or death due to any cause on study, whichever occurred first. Progressive disease included lymphadenopathy, an appearance of any new lesion such as enlarged lymph nodes (&gt; 1.5 cm), splenomegaly, hepatomegaly or other organ infiltrates, an increase by 50% or more in greatest determined diameter of any previous site or an increase by 50% or more in the sum of the product of diameters of multiple nodes. The progression date was assigned to the earliest time when any progression was observed without prior missing assessments. If withdrawal of consent or lost to follow-up occurred before documented progression or death, then these observations were censored at the date when the last complete tumor assessments determined a lack of progression.</description>

        <description>A best overall response rate is a CR, CRi, nPR or PR and is defined as:
Complete Remission (CR):
No lymphadenopathy
No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly
Absence of constitutional symptoms
Polymorphonuclear leukocytes ≥ 1500/ul
No circulating clonal B-lymphocytes
Platelets &gt; 100,000/ul
Hemoglobin &gt; 11.0 g/dl
Normocellular &lt;30% lymphocytes, no B-lymphoid nodules;
Incomplete Clinical Response (CRi):
• CR without bone marrow biopsy confirmation.
Nodular Partial Response (nPR):
• CR with the presence of residual clonal nodules.
Partial Response (PR) requires:
≥ 50% decrease in peripheral blood lymphocyte count
≥ 50% reduction in lymphadenopathy
≥ 50% reduction in size of liver and/or spleen
1 or more of the following:
Polymorphonuclear leukocytes ≥ 1500/ul
