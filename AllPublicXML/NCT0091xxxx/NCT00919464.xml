      This study is to determine the natural history of compartment pressures in the anterior thigh
      secondary to a fracture of the femoral shaft.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compartment syndrome is a painful condition where increased tissue pressure in a restricted
      area compromises circulation and endangers the tissue within that area possibly leading to
      surgery, amputation, major loss of function and in rare cases, death. Compartment syndrome of
      the thigh can be particularly devastating because of the size of the muscle and large amount
      of blood flow to the area, however it is one of the more rare and therefore least understood
      of all compartment syndromes. The purpose of this study is to determine the natural history
      of pressures of the anterior compartment of the thigh following femur fracture, which could
      help elucidate the diagnostic and treatment algorithms for thigh compartment syndrome. This
      small project is designed to be a non-randomized, investigational prospective trail to be
      conducted at the General Division of Charleston Area Medical Center. The target population
      consists of males and non-pregnant females age 18 and over who have suffered a mid-shaft
      femur fracture.
