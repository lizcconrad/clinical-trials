    <textblock>
      Dose finding study of the MoaB PF-04605412 directed against the alpha5beta1 integrin. Main
      objective is to define the MTD (maximum tolerated dose) or MAD (maximum administrable dose)
      in cancer patients pre treated or unresponsive to standard therapies.

    <description>Number of participants with objective response based on assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to RECIST. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study ≥4 weeks after initial documentation of response.
Per RECIST v1.0: CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions. PR defined as ≥30% decrease in sum of the longest diameters dimensions (LD) of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum LD according to RECIST associated to non-progressive disease response for non target lesions.</description>

    <time_frame>Screening, and Cycle 1 Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change in the IAUC for dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) from baseline to Cycle 1 Day 15. IAUC reflects the contrast distribution volume (extravascular extracellular space) in addition to contrast delivery and transport across the vascular endothelium. An IAUC value of zero indicates the absence of disease (ie, no leakage of the contrast agent into the synovial volume); therefore, an increase in this parameter indicates worsening disease (ie, greater permeability of the synovial membrane).</description>

        <title>Objective Response - Number of Participants With Objective Response</title>
        <description>Number of participants with objective response based on assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to RECIST. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study ≥4 weeks after initial documentation of response.
Per RECIST v1.0: CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions. PR defined as ≥30% decrease in sum of the longest diameters dimensions (LD) of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum LD according to RECIST associated to non-progressive disease response for non target lesions.</description>
