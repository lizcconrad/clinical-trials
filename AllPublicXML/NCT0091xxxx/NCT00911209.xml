  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this study is to observe the impact of weight loss in overweight individuals who
      have pre-hypertension (have a blood pressure reading of 121-139/81-89 mm Hg). The specific
      focus is to observe the difference in diastolic dysfunction (heart function) in these
      individuals at the beginning of the study and then again after 24-28 weeks. Diastolic
      dysfunction in this population indicates an increased risk of heart failure in the future.
      The aim of this study is to prevent or reduce the risk of heart failure in overweight
      individuals with pre-hypertension.

      You will be enrolled in the study for 24-28 weeks and will be randomly assigned to one of two
      assigned group. One group of subjects (Intervention group) will receive information on Heart
      healthy diet, lifestyle recommendations and diet and exercise counseling with a dietitian in
      order to achieve at least 7% weight loss. The other group will receive standard of care i.e.,
      Information on Heart healthy diet at baseline visit (Standard of care group). The following
      is the time line of activities anticipated by the subject in each group. Both the groups will
      be screened at 3 different visits within 4 weeks to determine eligibility. If you are
      eligible they will be randomized to either be in Standard of care group or Intervention
      group. After randomization, the &quot;Standard of care group&quot; will come for Baseline and Final
      visit (24th week). The Intervention group will have 14 weekly visits with a nutritionist and
      1 monthly visit, about 40-50 minutes each visit (total of 15) in 24- 28 week time frame. The
      second monthly session will be the final assessment visit. Both the groups will have a
      Baseline Assessment and a Final Assessment visit which will last about 3 hours.
