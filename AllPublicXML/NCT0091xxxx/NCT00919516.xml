  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of dual intramuscular and
      intra-arterial autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell implantation for the treatment of
      patients with moderate to severe peripheral arterial disease in whom amputation was
      considered the only viable treatment option.

      Study Hypothesis: Patients with moderate to severe peripheral arterial disease who receive
      intramuscular and intra-arterial stem cell injections will have improved ankle brachial index
      (ABI) measurements; relief of rest pain; ulcer healing, if applicable; and absence of major
      limb amputations.

    <description>Dual intramuscular and intra-arterial injections of bone marrow mononuclear cells harvested from the iliac crest. Injection sites are determined by location of stenosis and/or occlusion on angiogram obtained prior to implantation and typically occur in three medial and three lateral sites approximating the disease location.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients at least 18 years of age.

          -  Patients with moderate or severe limb-threatening PAD, defined as ankle brachial
             indices (ABI) less than 0.7 or presence of non-healing ischemic ulcers with stenosis
             or occlusion of two of the following lower extremity arteries: anterior tibial,
             posterior tibial, and peroneal.

          -  Patients with conditions that preclude recommendation of traditional endovascular or
             open bypass treatments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients younger than 18 years of age.

          -  Patients who are eligible to undergo traditional endovascular or open bypass for the
             treatment of PAD.

          -  Female patients who are or may be pregnant.

          -  Patients who are prisoners.

          -  Patients with mental retardation or are unable to consent for participation
             independently.
