  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if adding enoxaparin sodium to standard
      treatment with the chemotherapy drugs cisplatin and etoposide will help treat extensive stage
      SCLC. Two different doses of enoxaparin sodium will be studied in order to determine if one
      dose is more effective than the other. Enoxaparin sodium (Lovenox) is a drug that is approved
      by the FDA to help treat or prevent blood clots. Results from previous research studies
      suggest that adding enoxaparin sodium to standard treatment improved the response to
      treatment for some study participants with various types of cancer.

      -  Since no one knows which of the study options are best, participants will be randomized
           into one of three study treatment groups. Group A will receive cisplatin and etoposide.
           Group B will receive cisplatin and etoposide plus low-dose enoxaparin sodium. Group C
           will receive cisplatin and etoposide plus high-dose enoxaparin sodium.

        -  Study treatment will be divided into chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy periods. All
           three groups (Group A, B and C) will receive six 3-week cycles of chemotherapy. Groups B
           and C will also receive daily enoxaparin sodium during the chemotherapy stage and daily
           enoxaparin sodium for 1 year after the chemotherapy.

        -  Cisplatin and etoposide are given as an infusion in 3-week cycles for up to six cycles.
           Enoxaparin sodium is given as an injection under the skin into the sides of the abdomen.
           Participants will be instructed in how to give themselves the injections.
