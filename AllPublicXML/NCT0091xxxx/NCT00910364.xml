      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of determining the effects of a
      structured exercise program started two to four weeks after diagnosis of a first episode
      lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) for a period of 12 weeks in reducing the incidence
      of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) affects nearly 300,000 people in the U.S. each year. DVT of the
      leg results in PTS in up to 65% of patients,despite receiving appropriate medical management
      with anticoagulant therapy.

      PTS, caused by persistent venous outflow obstruction and venous valvular dysfunction, may
      result in symptoms of leg pain, swelling, heaviness and cramping especially with prolonged
      standing.

      All eligible patients with documented first-episode DVT interested in participating will
      undergo medical screening and a screening treadmill test prior to enrollment between two and
      four weeks post DVT diagnosis. All patients will be provided and asked to wear class II (30
      to 40mmHg) knee length compression hose daily during the entire trial.

      The formal exercise training includes both a supervised walking program and a home-based
      walking program for 12 weeks with follow-up at 26 weeks. Blood tests will be taken to measure
      levels of indicators of inflammation at baseline, week 4, week 12, and week 26. The primary
      outcomes will be the feasibility of the exercise program and the incidence of post-thrombotic
      syndrome at 26 weeks.
