      State-anxiety can appear during banal events without objective harrowing factors. It is
      preponderant in particular situations as exams and competitive examination for example, and
      may be responsible of failures, notably at school. Particularly, a form of anxiety said
      anticipatory (largely named nerves) is focused on a coming performance. This anticipative
      anxiety, maximal before the beginning of the test, disappears during this test to let place
      to relief. Even if phenomenon of habituation exists, it can be responsible of social and
      professional failures.

      Numerous therapeutics exists to fight against anxiety, non medicinal first but the resort to
      drugs are sometime necessary. The reference is the class of benzodiazepines. Many patients
      try non conventional medicines, like homeopathy.

      Gelsemium sempervirens would be active on sensible et emotional persons, reducing anxiety in
      some situations. A large used of Gelsemium sempervirens is the case of a situation of
      provoked stress in particular exam. That is the reason why the drug is particularly intended
      to a population of young adults who don't want to use &quot; traditional &quot; tranquillizing. But
      this drug, largely used, has never showed his effectiveness on provoked anxiety, in
      biomedical research. That is why we proposed in this study to compare the effectiveness of
      Gelsemium sempervirens 5CH, Gelsemium sempervirens 15CH and placebo, in a situation of
      provoked anxiety in young adult healthy volunteers.
