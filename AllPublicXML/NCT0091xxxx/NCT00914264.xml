      1. The first objective of this study is to determine the differences between, while the
           airway obstruction severity is the same, and the acute continuous positive airway
           pressure (CPAP) effect on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with
           overlap syndrome compared with COPD patients without in terms of sleep quality,
           autonomic nerve activity, biologic markers of systemic inflammatory, and exercise
           performance.

        2. The second objective of this study is to evaluate the subacute (3 months treatment) CPAP
           effect on COPD patients with overlap syndrome in terms of pulmonary hemodynamic and
           right heart function, We will also determine the subacute effect of CPAP on sleep and
           life quality, autonomic nerve activity, biologic markers of systemic inflammatory, as
           well as exercise performance.

        3. The last objective of this study is to evaluate the long term (12 months treatment) CPAP
           effect on COPD patients with overlap syndrome. The un-scheduled clinic or emergency
           department visiting, hospitalization, or mortality will be recorded to see if there is
           significant treatment effect in terms of reducing morbidity and mortality. The long term
           CPAP effect on sleep and life quality, autonomic nerve activity, biologic markers of
           systemic inflammatory, exercise performance, as well as pulmonary hemodynamic and right
           heart function will be re-evaluation.
