      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of Amaryl®M 1/500 mg twice daily versus
      Amaryl® 4 mg both in combination with Lantus® once-daily regimen in type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
      patients with inadequate glycemic control.

      There are several kinds of oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) that are used in the treatment of
      patients with type 2 DM. Among them, sulfonylurea and metformin are well-established
      first-line OADs. However, as the beta cell dysfunction progresses over time, patients fail to
      achieve good glycemic control with OADs alone and need further treatment intensification,
      usually involving the introduction of insulin either alone or in combination with OADs. Now,
      an OAD combined with bedtime insulin is one of the recommended treatment options for patients
      with type 2 DM and OAD failure. But, it still remains unclear which OADs are the most
      effective in combination with insulin for the treatment of type 2 DM.

      so, this study we will be able to verify which OADs are the most effective in combination
      with insulin for the treatment of type 2 DM.
