    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  Subjects between the ages of 18 and 75 years of age inclusive;

          -  For early patients only: Subject with Parkinson's disease with a stable response to
             Levodopa (not suffering from &quot;wearing off&quot;) and currently treated with
             IR-Carbidopa/Levodopa containing 300-500mg Levodopa per day up to 4 doses per day.

          -  For group 3 only: Subject with Parkinson's disease experiencing predictable motor
             fluctuations, end of dose &quot;wearing off&quot;, defined by the patient's report of at least
             two episodes daily of a decline in function from peak benefit, with at least 2-3 hours
             OFF a day at the discretion of the PI (does not include early morning akinesia). Only
             patients with end of dose wearing off for at least 3 months will be included.

          -  For moderate patients only: patients who are currently treated with
             IR-Carbidopa/Levodopa containing 600-900mg Levodopa, in divided dose, per day.

          -  Subject has been stable at current CD/LD dose for at least 1 months

          -  Hoehn and Yahr stages I-III

          -  If subject is taking dopamine agonists, the dose has been stable for at least 1 month

          -  Other then Parkinson's disease, the subject is in satisfactory health, as assessed by
             physical examination, blood test (biochemistry and hematology). No abnormality on
             clinical examination and blood tests that in the opinion of the Physician responsible
             will compromise safety or interfere with study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have participated in another clinical trial within the last 30 days;

          -  Subjects with atypical Parkinsonism

          -  Subject has significant history of cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or renal disease or
             other condition or any major complication/illness which, in the opinion of the
             physician responsible, contraindicates his/her participation.

          -  Subject with symptomatic gastroparesis with frequent vomiting (at least once a week).

          -  Subjects with a history of clinically defined GERD, peptic ulcer or any
             gastrointestinal surgery other than appendectomy or herniotomy, or with any
             gastrointestinal disorder likely to influence drug absorption, or with any history of
             inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, severe gastrointestinal
             narrowing, or frequent nausea or emesis, regardless of etiology.

          -  Prior gastro-intestinal surgery or current gastrointestinal conditions of clinical
             significance including ulcers, diarrhea, vomiting, bleeding, intestinal obstruction or
             inflammatory bowel disease, which, in the opinion of the physician responsible,
             contraindicates his/her participation.

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse.

          -  Subject has a history of allergy to any component of the dosage form or any other
             allergy, which, in the opinion of the physician responsible, contraindicates his/her
             participation.

          -  Subjects suffering from psychological disorders that in the opinion of the physician
             responsible may interfere with full participation.
