  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percentage of patients over 80 admitted in ICU varies greatly from one center to another. ICU
      admission criteria of older patients are scarcely described and benefit of ICU admission for
      those patients is uncertain. In this study, we prospectively studied old patients arriving to
      the emergency department of 15 French hospitals with conditions that potentially warrant ICU
      admission.The working hypothesis was that ICU admission was associated with a 20% decrease in
      six-month mortality.

      This was a prospective multicenter observational cohort study of elderly individuals
      presenting to one of 15 emergency departments and possibly qualifying for admission to an
      ICU. To be included, subjects had to be aged at least 80 years and be diagnosed by the ED
      physician with one of 74 conditions potentially warranting ICU admission.Outcome studied are
      ICU eligibility as assessed by emergency and ICU physicians, hospital and six-month death and
      changes in functional status in the six month following emergency department visit.
