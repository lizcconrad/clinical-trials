      The purpose of this study is to measure the prevalence and severity of cardiac autonomic
      neuropathy (CAN), diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) which in non-diabetics is termed
      advanced nervous system (ANS) dysfunction, and autonomic dysfunction as well as the overall
      sympathovagal balance (SB) in the CEFH population of diabetic patients versus non-diabetic
      patients undergoing elective vitreoretinal surgery.

    <description>Three values are calculated by the ANSAR ANX 3.0® software of the spectral analysis of HRV and respiration:
RFa an indicator of parasympathetic function with normal values between 0.5 and 10 bpm2;
LFa an indicator of sympathetic function also with normal values between 0.5 and 10 bpm2;
SB or the ratio of LFa/RFa with normal reference values of 0.4 to 3.0.
The ANSAR ANX 3.0® software defines three different levels of autonomic neuropathy (autonomic dysfunction) as follows (see Figure 1):
Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy (CAN): resting parasympathetic insufficiency (not enough parasympathetic protection for the heart) or RFa &lt; 0.1 bpm2.
Diabetic Autonomic Neuropathy (DAN), or advanced autonomic dysfunction in non-diabetics, is defined as low autonomics: LFa &lt; 0.5 bpm2 or 0.1 &lt; RFa &lt; 0.5 bpm2.
Autonomic Dysfunction: normal resting LFa and RFa, but low LFa response to Valsalva or low RFa response to deep breathing.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Type I and Type II Diabetic patients 19 or older who are scheduled for elective
             surgery to improve vision impaired by diabetic retinopathy

          -  Patients scheduled during the same time period without diabetes for retinal surgery
             will serve as an age and gender matched reference group to undergo the non-invasive
             ANS testing on the day of surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to stand will only do baseline, deep breathing and Valsalva portions (A-D)
             of the testing as described in section 8.1

          -  Patients with syncope on standing will only do portions A-D of the test

          -  Inability to cooperate with deep breathing and Valsalva

          -  Tracheoscopy or otherwise not able to perform a Valsalva

          -  Not desiring to participate after informed consent

          -  Known history of idiopathic dysautonomia

          -  Pulmonary difficulties associated with hyperventilation, including acute URI

          -  Pacemaker dependent

          -  Persistently high intraocular pressure despite treatment

          -  Atrial fibrillation

          -  Ventricular arrhythmias greater than 10 beats per minute

          -  Taking MAO inhibitors
