  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ghrelin is a newly discovered peptide that is secreted by the stomach. Its main role is to
      stimulate food intake but recent studies indicate that it also acts on the cardiovascular
      system to confer beneficial effects. The mechanism of action is unclear but experimental
      studies suggest that ghrelin decreases the sympathetic nervous system. Beside there is new
      evidence in animal models that ghrelin may also be involved in stress reaction as ghrelin
      injection seems to protect against symptoms of stress. Given that circulating levels of
      ghrelin are reduced in obesity, this suggests that the effect of ghrelin may differ between
      lean and obese subjects. Ghrelin could represent an attractive therapeutic strategy for the
      treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the study if to gain more knowledge of the
      effect of ghrelin on the sympathetic nervous system and stress reactivity in both lean and
      obese subjects.

      This study will investigate the effect of intravenous administration of ghrelin on blood
      pressure, heart rate, muscle sympathetic nervous activity and baroreflex control in lean and
      obese individuals and will investigate whether ghrelin administration can influence the
      response to stress. Both lean and obese individuals will be recruited and will receive an
      intravenous administration of ghrelin at increasing doses for 1 hour. Their blood pressure,
      heart rate and sympathetic activity (small recording electrode in the peroneal nerve) will be
      recorded and subjects will be submitted to a mental arithmetic stress towards the end of the
      infusion. Blood samples will be taken at regular intervals for various metabolic tests. These
      responses will be compared to those when submitted to saline infusion.
