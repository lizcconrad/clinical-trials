  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, multicenter, prospective, open-label historically controlled Phase
      IIIb non-inferiority clinical trial on the efficacy and safety of Fibrinogen Concentrate
      (Human).

      It is estimated that 150-300 patients in the U.S. suffer from afibrinogenemia. Substitution
      with cryoprecipitate or alternative treatments have limited safety and efficacy.

      The primary purpose of the study is to demonstrate the hemostatic efficacy of Fibrinogen
      Concentrate (Human) by adequately controlling acute bleeding (spontaneous or after trauma) in
      patients with congenital fibrinogen deficiency (afibrinogenemia and hypofibrinogenemia).
      Cryoprecipitate hemostatic efficacy data from a retrospective physician survey will be used
      as a historical control.

    <description>Intravenous (IV) infusion to reach the peak target levels of 100 mg/dL with an accepted lower limit of 80 mg/dL on at least 3 subsequent days for minor bleeding episodes and 150 mg/dL with an accepted lower limit of 130 mg/dL on at least 7 subsequent days for major bleeding episodes.
If a subject's fibrinogen level is not known on Day 1, at the time treatment is initiated for the acute bleed (e.g., because they did not have a screening visit), the starting dose is to be 70 mg/kg b.w. Otherwise, the dose will be calculated individually.</description>
