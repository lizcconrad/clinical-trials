  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study is to evaluate a new genetic-based test which will identify
      patients diagnosed with muscle-invasive bladder cancer before their surgery, who might have
      specific genes, which will increase their chances of recurrence of cancer after their
      surgery.

      Some patients who are diagnosed with bladder cancer and have their had bladder removed, will
      have a recurrence of cancer sometime after their surgery. This recurrence is usually caused
      by tumor cells that originated from the bladder tumor and traveled to other parts of the
      body, which is called metastatic cancer. Some patients are more likely than others to have
      metastatic disease. This test may help in identifying these patients who might develop
      metastases from having these specific genes.
