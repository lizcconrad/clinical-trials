  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is laboratory evidence that cholesterol lowering medications (statins) inhibit the
      growth of breast cancer cells. Clinical studies are controversial but some show that women
      taking statins are less likely to get breast cancer. This ongoing randomized trial compares
      one-year of atorvastatin (Lipitorâ„¢) or placebo for lowering mammography-defined breast
      density and other surrogate markers associated with breast cancer risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project was designed to evaluate the effect of a specific statin (atorvastatin) on
      several breast cancer biomarkers. One hundred women will be treated for one year with either
      40 mg of atorvastatin or placebo. The primary aim of this project is to determine the effect
      of atorvastatin on breast density, a known risk factor for breast cancer. In addition, the
      affect of atorvastatin on serum biomarkers (IGF1) and tissue biomarkers (atypia and Ki67)
      associated with risk is being evaluated.

      Because of their tolerability and safety, statins have a great potential as a breast cancer
      preventative agent. Should this pilot study show a significant decrease in breast density
      and/or change in serum and tissue biomarkers in statin treated patients these data would then
      be used to support a large randomized trial.

      This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized placebo controlled clinical trial. Target
      enrollment is 100 women, with 50 receiving atorvastatin and 50 receiving a similar appearing
      placebo tablet. Eligible women must be at least 35 years old with regular menstrual cycles
      and a Gail Model risk of greater than 1.66% over 5 years.
