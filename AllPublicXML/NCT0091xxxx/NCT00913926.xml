  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of this NIS is to obtain further information on efficacy, tolerability, and acceptance of
      Wellnara in a large user population under the conditions of routine medical practice.
      Furthermore, any adverse drug reactions will be recorded in a large user population under the
      conditions of medical routine. To investigate the efficacy of Wellnara, patients will fill in
      a questionnaire, the so-called Menopause Rating Scale (MRS II). Further, the effects of
      treatment on skin and hair will be evaluated by the investigator. Patients will assess
      treatment effects on their sexual life. Safety parameters include monitoring of vaginal
      bleeding, measurement of blood pressure and body weight, and - as far as routinely used in
      the practice - calculation of waist-hip-ratio. Any relevant additional information related to
      adverse drug reactions will also be documented.

        The target population of this study are women who have received a prescription of Wellnara
        on the basis of the decision of the treating gynecologist. The study is expected to collect
        data of up to 2,400 women in about 700 gynecological practices in Germany.
