    <textblock>
      To examine a patient's quality of life using three methods for measuring stent size: (a)
      direct measurement, (b) patient height, and (c) a standardized formula. The intent of the
      study is to show if there is a difference in a patient's quality of life, postoperative
      symptoms, pain medication and anticholinergic use by using one of these specific methods for
      stent size determination. No method is interventional in this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ureteral stent placement is common in Urologic practice and many studies have been done
      looking at factors to improve stent related symptoms, but few have used a validated
      questionnaire to assess these symptoms affect on quality of life.We plan to prospectively
      randomize patients to three separate techniques such as (a) direct measurement,(b) patient
      height, and (c) a standardized formula for the determination of stent size. Using a validated
      questionnaire, the Ureteral Stent Symptoms Questionnaire (USSQ), we will assess whether there
      is a difference in outcome measures such as patient quality of life, need for pain
      medications and anticholinergics, and in postoperative symptoms based on one of these
      techniques. The USSQ was developed by Joshi et al to assess the impact of health-related
      quality of life issues related to ureteral stents. Data from USSQ questionnaire will be
      collected 7-10 days post-operatively as well as 4 weeks post-op and then this will be
      aggregated for our outcome measures to determine which method of stent size give better
      outcomes.

    <arm_group_label>1 Direct ureteric measurement</arm_group_label>
    <description>This is determined by using a 5 French Pollack Open-Ended Flexi-Tip Ureteral catheter (Cook, Spencer, Indiana) to cannulate the ureteral orifice. A retrograde pyelogram will be done at the conclusion of the procedure and the Pollack will be advanced to the pyeloureteral junction (PUJ) under fluoroscopy. At this point the length of the distance between the PUJ and vesicoureteral junction (VUJ) will be recorded and stent length determined based on this measurement.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>2 Based on patient height</arm_group_label>
    <description>We will use the height measurement criteria used by Lee et al in their study. Patients less than 5'2&quot; will receive a 22 cm stent, 5'3&quot;-5'7&quot; will get a 24 cm stent, 5'8&quot;-5'10&quot; will get a 26 cm stent, 5'11&quot; to 6'1&quot; will get a 28 cm stent, and all patients greater than 6'2&quot; will receive a 30 cm stent.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>3 Based on a predetermined formula</arm_group_label>
    <description>We will use the formula described by Wieder. Stent length in cm= patients height in inches - 42.</description>
