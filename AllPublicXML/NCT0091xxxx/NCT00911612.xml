    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that the medication approved for treatment of high blood cholesterol
      levels, Colesevelam HCl (WELCHOL), decreases colonic transit and permeability in patients
      with diarrhea due to irritable bowel syndrome.

      This effect is thought to result from the effect of the medication on bile acids, which can
      cause diarrhea.

      Background:

      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects about 15% of the U.S. population, about 5% having
      predominant diarrhea; current treatment is suboptimal as it may not be tolerated, lead to
      side effects or insufficient benefit. Bile acid malabsorption (BAM) is recognized as a cause
      of chronic diarrhea and has been investigated as a mechanism for the phenotype of diarrhea
      predominant IBS (D-IBS). Increased exposure of the colon to bile acids which may result from
      accelerated small bowel transit or abnormal function of the apical sodium bile acid
      transporter (ASBT) has been postulated to cause functional diarrhea or symptoms of D-IBS by a
      number of mechanisms, such as increase colonic secretion, and mucosal permeability. Recent
      preliminary data suggest that doses of chenodeoxycholate (CDC) that are approved for the
      dissolution of gall stones are associated with accelerated colonic emptying and looser stool
      consistency.

      Hypothesis:

      The bile acid binding agent, Colesevelam HCl, decreases colonic transit and permeability in
      patients with D-IBS.

      Specific Aim:

      To investigate the effect of Colesevelam, which binds bile acids in the small intestine and
      reduces the concentration of bile acids in the colon, on colonic transit, permeability and
      the bowel function of patients with D-IBS.

      Methods:

      Twenty-four D-IBS participants will be randomized to placebo or treatment with Welchol
      (Colesevelam HCL) 1.875 gram b.i.d. for 12-14 days. A baseline colon transit, 24 hour urine
      for colon permeability, and blood for serum 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (7 alpha-HCO)
      will be measured and venous blood DNA will be collected and stored. The measurement of serum
      7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (7 alpha-HCO), which is a measurement of hepatic
      cholesterol synthesis, is closely related to the fecal loss of bile acids, and is a validated
      method for screening for BAM. Following treatment for 12 days, transit and permeability
      studies will be repeated. Bowel function symptoms will be recorded for the duration of the
      study.

    <measure>Colonic Transit, Geometric Center at 24 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>After 12-14 days treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The scintigraphic method is used to measure colonic transit. An isotope is adsorbed on activated charcoal particles and delivered to the colon in a delayed release capsule. Anterior and posterior gamma images are taken hourly. The geometric center (GC) is the weighted average of counts in the different colonic regions. The scale ranges from 1 to 5; a high GC implies faster colonic transit. A GC of 1 implies all isotope is in the ascending colon, and a GC of 5 implies all isotope is in the stool.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ascending Colon Emptying T1/2</measure>
    <time_frame>After 12-14 days' treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The half time for the ascending colon emptying (T1/2) was measured by the scintigraphic method. An isotope is adsorbed on activated charcoal particles and delivered to the colon in a delayed release capsule that is swallowed by the subject. Anterior and posterior gamma images are taken hourly. From the hourly scans, a time-activity curve is plotted using linear interpolation between time points when content was measured. The time taken to empty 50% of the isotope from the ascending colon is read from this time-activity curve.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Colonic Permeability as Measured by Cumulative Urinary Excretion of Mannitol 8-24 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>after 12-14 days' treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Colonic permeability is measured through differential excretion of urine saccharides. The subject ingests a methacrylate-coated capsule that contains saccharides (mannitol 1g and lactulose 5 g powder). The capsule provides a means to protect the sugars from absorption, until the sugars are delivered to the colon by means of a standard delayed release capsule. The value reported is the mean for each arm of the total amount of mannitol excreted over the 8-24 hour time period.</description>

    <measure>Stool Consistency</measure>
    <time_frame>After 12-14 days' treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects rated their stool consistency using the Bristol Stool Scale. The Bristol Stool Scale is a medical aid designed to classify the form of human feces into seven categories or types. Types 1 and 2 indicate constipation with 3 and 4 being the &quot;ideal stools&quot; especially the latter, as they are the easiest to defecate, and 5-7 tending towards diarrhea.</description>

          <title>Baseline Colonic Geometric Center at 24 hours</title>
          <description>The scintigraphic method is used to measure colonic transit. An isotope is adsorbed on activated charcoal particles and delivered to the colon in a delayed release capsule. Anterior and posterior gamma images are taken hourly. The geometric center (GC) is the weighted average of counts in the different colonic regions. The scale ranges from 1 to 5; a high GC implies faster colonic transit. A GC of 1 implies all isotope is in the ascending colon, and a GC of 5 implies all isotope is in the stool.</description>

        <title>Colonic Permeability as Measured by Cumulative Urinary Excretion of Mannitol 8-24 Hours</title>
        <description>Colonic permeability is measured through differential excretion of urine saccharides. The subject ingests a methacrylate-coated capsule that contains saccharides (mannitol 1g and lactulose 5 g powder). The capsule provides a means to protect the sugars from absorption, until the sugars are delivered to the colon by means of a standard delayed release capsule. The value reported is the mean for each arm of the total amount of mannitol excreted over the 8-24 hour time period.</description>
