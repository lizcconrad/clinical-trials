  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are seeking participants for a study of the role of kisspeptin in the
      reproductive system. Kisspeptin is a naturally occuring hormone in humans that stimulates the
      production of reproductive hormones. The investigators hypothesize that kisspeptin
      administration will be a useful tool for characterizing certain reproductive disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The master reproductive hormone GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) is essential for normal
      reproductive function. People with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), hyperprolactinemia,
      and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) do not secrete or respond to GnRH in a normal way. In
      this study, investigators will give participants, kisspeptin— a hormone that is naturally
      found in the human body and is known to be a powerful stimulus of GnRH secretion. They may
      also give participants GnRH to determine if participants will be able to fully respond to
      kisspeptin.

      The goal of this study is to use kisspeptin administration to probe the condition of GnRH
      neurons in people with various reproductive disorders to better understand the underlying
      reasons for the disorders. Investigators hope to gain new insights into GnRH neuronal
      function (or dysfunction) that will lead to better diagnostics in the future.

      The investigators are seeking men and women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) and
      hyperprolactinemia, as well as women with PCOS. Study participation involves 1 to 2
      outpatient visits and 1 to 2, 3-15-hour hospital admission(s) where participants will receive
      kisspeptin and/or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) through an intravenous line (IV).
      Remuneration is up to $800 for study completion. Individuals interested in learning more may
      email MGHKisspeptinResearch@partners.org or call 617-726-5383.

                  of participants with hyperprolactinemia who by definition will have elevated
                  levels of prolactin.

               -  hemoglobin

               -  women: no less than 0.5 gm/dL below the lower limit of the reference range for
                  normal women,

               -  men: on adequate testosterone replacement therapy: normal male reference range;
                  off testosterone replacement therapy: no lower than 0.5 gm/dL below the lower
                  limit of the reference range for normal women (&gt; 11.5 gm/dL in our laboratory),
                  as men with hypogonadism off treatment have low serum testosterone levels which
                  causes hemoglobin concentrations to fall to the female range,

             Additional criteria based on subject population:

        1. Men and women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (n= 120: 80 males, 40 females to have
        40 males and 20 females complete the study). All subjects will have confirmed diagnosis by
        low sex steroids in the setting of low or inappropriately normal gonadotropins. If needed
        to verify clinical criteria, additional diagnostic labs and imaging tests may be performed
        including but not limited to: ferritin, prolactin, sex steroids, FSH, LH and brain MRI.

        2. Women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) (n=20, for 10 finishing the study) All
        subjects will have a confirmed diagnosis of PCOS as evidenced by 2 or more of the
        following: oligoamenorrhea, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and polycystic
        ovarian morphology, and exclusion of identifiable conditions that would result in this
        pattern. If needed to verify clinical criteria, additional diagnostic labs may be drawn
        including but not limited to: 17-OHP, sex steroids, FSH, LH.

        3. Men and women with hyperprolactinemia (n=16: 8 males, 8 females to have 4 males and 4
        females complete the study). All subjects will have confirmed diagnosis by elevated levels
        of prolactin measured via blood test and MRI imaging confirming no pituitary abnormality or
        a microprolactinoma (&lt;10 mm). Patients with a macroprolactinoma will be excluded. We will
        enroll subjects when they first present with hyperprolactinemia prior to receiving
        medication or subjects being treated with the dopamine agonist bromocriptine only. We will
        ask subjects being treated with bromocriptine to complete a washout period prior to the
        kisspeptin administration visit(s). The washout period will last at least 2 weeks. We will
        perform a blood test prior to the kisspeptin administration visit(s) to confirm elevated
        levels of prolactin.
