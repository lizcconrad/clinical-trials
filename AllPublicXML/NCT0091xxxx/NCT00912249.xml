      Horticultural Therapy (HT) uses plants, gardening, and the close relationship between
      well-beings and plants. It integrates effort, hope, expectation, harvest and the enjoyment of
      whole process to help people with disabilities. During the process, patient can learn more
      about themselves and experience the nature.

      It can be traced to 1798, Dr. B. Rush found farm work helped people with mental illness.
      Today, horticulture therapy is well applied in disabilities, elderly and children. It needs
      detailed evaluation for the condition of illness to achieve optimal efficacy. It contains two
      parts- to sense and to operate! Patients can relax themselves and learn to work with others,
      realize the responsibility of caring another life, understand their relationship with
      environment. Patient can tolerate frustration better via acceptance the withered plants. In
      cultivation, it trains patient the occupational technique ( to operate instrument),
      communication, social skill, independence, stable mood.

      Based on studies, 0ne third patients with mental illness stabilized after treatment. However,
      aggressive rehabilitation is necessary to maintain their function. In our study, it plans to
      incorporate horticulture therapy into psychiatric clinical practice in our hospital. We plan
      to recruit horticulture therapist, visiting staffs, residents, occupational therapists and
      nurses to participate the design and operation in class.

      This program will recruit patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, organic brain
      syndrome and other mental illness in our daycare. We will help patients with personal
      treatment record. We will use case study to report some typical cases. All the cases will be
      investigated qualitatively with intensive interview to explore the subjective experience on
      this therapy. We will also use simple questionnaire to found quantitative study in the
      further.

      To sum up, this program helps the connection for horticulture therapy and psychiatric
      rehabilitation. It promotes &quot; patient-centered&quot; support and offers physical, mental , social,
      spiritual services. It not only produces academic performance but fulfills the ideal of
      holistic health care!
