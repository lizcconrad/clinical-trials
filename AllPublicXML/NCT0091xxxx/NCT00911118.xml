  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a new type of IG-IMRT called
      &quot;ultra-hypofractionated IG-IMRT&quot; where a higher dose of radiation is given to the tumor
      during each treatment day. Since higher doses of radiation are used each day, the total
      number of treatment days needed to complete this type of radiation is only five instead of
      the 45-48 treatments currently used. Treatment takes place every other day and is complete
      after 2 weeks. If the patient decides to get this treatment, they will come in for 5
      treatments. This is different from the 48 treatments they would get normally.

    <description>Patients enrolled in the study will undergo image-guided, intensity-modulated radiotherapy using the same equipment, techniques, and treatment-planning procedures as currently practiced as MSKCC. MSKCC patients will have the option of continued follow-up through MSKCC's established Prostate Survivorship Clinic for an indefinite period of time, meaning patients enrolled in the protocol will be encouraged to remain at MSKCC for life-long follow-up after their treatment. The standard assessments obtained in the Survivorship Clinic will not be altered. All protocol relevant data collected at these visits through month 60 will be used for protocol analysis.</description>

    <description>A standard dose escalation design is utilized, with the initial treatment assigned as 6.5 Gy/fraction for five fractions to a total dose of 32.5 Gy. For any given dose tier, an initial cohort of 30 patients will be treated. However to adjust for potentially inevaluable patients who dropout prior to a full toxicity collection to assess potential DLTs enrollment of up to five additional patients per cohort can occur, per PI's discretion. Dose escalation will proceed if &lt; 10% of the 30 patients treated per tier exhibit any dose limiting toxicity (DLT) once the entire tier cohort has a minimum follow-up of 3 months and half the tier cohort has a minimum follow-up of 6 months. Dose escalation to the next tier will occur by increasing the dose per fraction by 0.5 Gy while keeping the fraction number constant at 5, leading to a total dose increase of 2.5 Gy per dose tier.</description>
