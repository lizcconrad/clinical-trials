      The purpose of this study is to determine the dose response of Ramelteon, once daily (QD), in
      Japanese subjects with Chronic Insomnia

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Complaints of sleep disorder are increasing with today's aging society and changing
      lifestyle. Sleep disorders not only impact one's activities of daily living, but also impede
      one's social life, leading to reduced productivity and sometimes accidents through
      carelessness.

      Ramelteon is a melatonin-1 receptor agonist under global development by Takeda Chemical
      Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan, for the treatment of transient and chronic insomnia and for
      the treatment of Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders.
