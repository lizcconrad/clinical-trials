  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims at providing information on how the Short Message Service (SMS) tool
      influences self-management in asthma patients and to assess the resulting health related
      effect. A wide range of models and theories exist in the compliance area, such as technical
      models, communication models, cognitive models and self-management models and theories. The
      use of some of these theories and models will serve as theoretical and explanatory tools for
      studying how and why the SMS tool influences the patient's self-management.

      Objective:

      The objective of this study is to assess the health-related effects of a SMS compliance and
      monitoring system for optimized asthma treatment in a controlled trial setting.

    <description>The intervention consisted of sequences of SMS messages sent to the intervention group, each containing 2 or 3 monitoring questions and one reminder to take the preventive medication. The SMS sequence was as follows.
Remember to take your preventive asthma medication (sent at 8.00 am).
Were you awakened during the night due to your asthma? Answer YES or NO.
How many times have you taken your asthma attack medication during the last 24 hours? Answer a number.
What was your peak flow this morning? Answer a number (optional, depending on the participant's use of a spirometer prior to the study).</description>
