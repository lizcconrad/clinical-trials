        <title>Change From Baseline to End of Treatment (Final Visit) in Mean Number of Incontinence Episodes Per 24 Hours</title>
        <description>The average number of incontinence episodes (any involuntary leakage of urine) per day was derived from the number of incontinence episodes recorded by the patient in a micturition diary for 3-days before the Baseline and Week 12 clinic visits. Least Squares (LS) Means were generated from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group, gender, and geographic region as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>The full analysis set-Incontinence included all randomized patients who took at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug and who had a baseline and at least 1 post baseline micturition measurement in the visit diary and who had at least 1 incontinence episode at baseline. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) was utilized.</population>

          <description>The average number of incontinence episodes (any involuntary leakage of urine) per day was derived from the number of incontinence episodes recorded by the patient in a micturition diary for 3-days before the Baseline and Week 12 clinic visits. Least Squares (LS) Means were generated from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group, gender, and geographic region as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>
          <population>The full analysis set-Incontinence included all randomized patients who took at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug and who had a baseline and at least 1 post baseline micturition measurement in the visit diary and who had at least 1 incontinence episode at baseline.

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and Final Visit in Mean Number of Nocturia Episodes Per 24 Hours</title>
        <description>Nocturia is defined as waking at night one or more times to void. The average number of times a patient urinated (excluding incontinence only episodes) during sleeping time per day was derived from the 3-day patient micturition diary.
LS Means are from an ANCOVA with treatment group, gender, and geographic region as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 4, 8 and 12</time_frame>
        <population>The full analysis set included all patients who took at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug and had a baseline and at least 1 post baseline micturition measurement in the visit diary and who had at least one nocturia episode at baseline. LOCF was used for the Final Visit analysis. N is the number of participants included at each time point.</population>

        <description>Overactive bladder symptoms were assessed using the symptom bother scale of the overactive bladder questionnaire. The symptom bother scale consists of 8 questions answered by the participant on a scale from 1-6. The total symptom bother score was calculated from the 8 answers and then transformed to range from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating worst severity. A negative change from Baseline in symptom bother score indicates improvements.
LS Means are from an ANCOVA with treatment group, gender, and geographic region as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and Final Visit in Health-related Quality of Life (HRQL) Total Score</title>
        <description>Health-related quality of life was assessed by the HRQL subscales (coping, concern, sleep and social interaction) of the overactive bladder questionnaire (OABq). The HRQL total score was calculated by adding the 4 HRQL subscale scores, and transforming to a scale from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. A positive change from Baseline in HRQL score indicates improvements.
LS Means are from an ANCOVA with treatment group, gender, and geographic region as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 and Final Visit in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI): Percent Activity Impairment</title>
        <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: Specific Health Problem (WPAI:SHP) questionnaire was used to assess the degree and extent to which overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms interfered with daily activities over the last 7 days. Percent activity impairment is derived from the patient’s assessment of the degree to which OAB affected their regular daily activities. A higher percentage indicates greater impairment. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>The full analysis set included all patients who took at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug and had a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline micturition measurement in the visit diary. The number of participants at each time point (N) included patients with both baseline and post-baseline values. LOCF was used for the Final Visit analysis.</population>

In the table below, each row title lists Baseline health status first followed by Final Visit health status and reports the number of patients in that category. Missing data indicates patients with no data available for that Visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Final Visit in European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Pain/Discomfort Score</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D is an international, standardized, nondisease-specific (i.e., generic) instrument for describing and valuing health status. Participants were asked to indicate which of the following statements best describes their health state:
I have no pain or discomfort; I have moderate pain or discomfort; I have extreme pain or discomfort. In the table below, each row title lists Baseline health status first followed by Final Visit health status and reports the number of patients in that category. Missing data indicates patients with no data available for that Visit.</description>

        <population>The full analysis set included all patients who took at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug and had a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline micturition measurement in the visit diary. LOCF was used for this analysis.</population>

        <description>The EQ-5D is an international, standardized, nondisease-specific (i.e., generic) instrument for describing and valuing health status. Participants were asked to indicate which of the following statements best describes their health state:
I am not anxious or depressed; I am moderately anxious or depressed; I am extremely anxious or depressed. In the table below, each row title lists Baseline health status first followed by Final Visit health status and reports the number of patients in that category. Missing data indicates patients with no data available for that Visit.</description>

        <population>The full analysis set included all patients who took at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug and had a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline micturition measurement in the visit diary. LOCF was used for this analysis.</population>

        <description>The EQ-5D is an international, standardized, generic instrument for describing and evaluating health status. Health status is assessed by patients evaluating their health on a vertical, visual analog scale from 0 to 100 where the endpoints are labeled 'Worst imaginable health state' (=0) and 'Best imaginable health state' (=100). On the EQ-5D VAS, a positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 and Final Visit in Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC)</title>
        <description>The PPBC scale is a global assessment tool that asks patients to rate their impression of their current bladder condition on a 6-point scale from 1: 'Does not cause me any problems at all'; 2: 'Causes me some very minor problems'; 3: 'Causes me some minor problems’; 4: 'Causes me (some) moderate problems'; 5: 'Causes me severe problems' and 6: 'Causes me many severe problems'. LS means are from an ANCOVA model with treatment group, gender, and geographical regions as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate. A negative change from Baseline score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Summary of Baseline, Week 12 and Final Visit Change in Bladder Symptoms on the Clinician Global Impression Scale</title>
        <description>The Clinician Global Impression Scale (CGI) assessed the change in the patient's bladder symptoms since the start of the study and was completed by the physician at Baseline and at Week 12/end of treatment. The degree of change was categorized as one of the following: 'Very much improved', 'Much improved', 'Minimally improved', 'No change', 'Minimally worse', 'Much worse', or 'Very much worse'.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>

The degree of change was categorized as one of the following: 'Very much improved', 'Much improved', 'Minimally improved', 'No change', 'Minimally worse', 'Much worse', or 'Very much worse'.</description>
          <population>The full analysis set included all patients who took at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug and had a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline micturition measurement in the visit diary. This assessment was completed by English speaking patients in the United States only. LOCF was used for the Final visit analysis.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Improvement in Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) at Week 12 and Final Visit</title>
        <description>The PPBC scale is a global assessment tool that asks patients to rate their impression of their current bladder condition on a 6-point scale from 1: 'Does not cause me any problems at all'; 2: 'Causes me some very minor problems'; 3: 'Causes me some minor problems'; 4: 'Causes me (some) moderate problems'; 5: 'Causes me severe problems' and 6: 'Causes me many severe problems'. Improvement was defined as at least a one point improvement from Baseline to post-baseline and a major improvement was defined as at least a two point improvement from Baseline to post-baseline in PPBC score.</description>
