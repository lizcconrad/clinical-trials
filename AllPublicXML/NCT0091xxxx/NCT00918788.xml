      RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of breast tissue from patients who have undergone
      biopsy or surgery to test in the laboratory may help the study of cancer in the future.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at samples of breast tissue from women who have
      undergone breast biopsy or surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To prove that optical spectra collected by inserting an optical fiber probe into breast
           tissue through a biopsy needle can be of adequate quality to render a spectroscopic
           diagnosis.

      OUTLINE: Optical spectra are acquired from ex vivo samples of normal and malignant breast
      tissue using diffuse reflectance, fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopy. Tissue spectra are
      measured using a portable clinical spectroscopy device with front- and side-viewing optical
      fiber probes that are inserted into the breast tissue through a hollow biopsy needle. After
      the probes are withdrawn through the needle, cutting biopsies are obtained and the tissue is
      marked at the site of the spectral measurements. The biopsy specimens are then fixed in
      formalin and submitted for histopathologic studies using standard light microscopy techniques
      (i.e., H&amp;E staining and IHC). Additional histochemical, immunohistochemical, and fluorescent
      in situ stains may be performed to support the diagnosis or to better understand the
      spectroscopy results.

      Medical records are reviewed to obtain information from the pathology report on patient
      demographics, pathological characteristics of the surgical specimen, and clinical indication
      for the surgical procedure.
