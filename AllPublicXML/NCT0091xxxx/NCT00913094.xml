  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether impedance cardiography (ICG) parameters can predict favorable or
      unfavorable blood pressure (BP) response and time to BP control prior to initiation or
      intensification of specific antihypertensive drug classes and drug combinations, independent
      of initial BP levels.

      -  Patients with higher vascular resistance index and/or lower arterial compliance index
           will lower BP faster and to a greater degree overall when receiving vasodilating agents
           - such as ACEI's, ARB's, dihydropyridine CCB's, direct vasodilators, and central alpha
           agonists.

        -  Patients with an elevated cardiac index will lower BP faster and to a greater degree
           overall when receiving agents that reduce contractility, heart rate, or blood volume -
           such as beta blockers, non-dihydropyridine CCB's, and other agents that are known to
           reduce cardiac index.

        -  Patients with an elevated thoracic fluid content or lower orthostatic change in thoracic
           fluid content will lower BP faster and to a greater degree overall when receiving
           diuretics (thiazide, loop, potassium sparing), however - one of these agents will emerge
           as a superior alternative to reduce BP in patients with high thoracic fluid content /
           low orthostatic change in thoracic fluid content.
