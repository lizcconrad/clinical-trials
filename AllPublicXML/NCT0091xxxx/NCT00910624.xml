  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multicenter study of boceprevir (BOC) in combination with peginterferon
      plus ribavirin (PEG/RBV) in adult chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1 participants who
      completed their per-protocol defined treatment and did not achieve sustained viral response
      (SVR) while in the PEG/RBV control arm(s) of an Schering-Plough Research Institute (SPRI)
      study of BOC combination therapy. Participants who are able to enroll in this study within 2
      weeks after the last dose of PEG/RBV in previous protocol are to receive BOC+ PEG/RBV for up
      to 44 weeks followed by 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up. Participants who are not able to
      enroll in this study within 2 weeks after the last dose of PEG/RBV in previous protocol are
      to receive PEG/RBV for 4 weeks followed by BOC+ PEG/RBV for up to 44 weeks, with 24 weeks
      post-treatment follow-up.

    <description>SVR24 was defined as undetectable Hepatitis C Virus ribonucleic acid (HCV-RNA) at Follow-up Week (FW) 24. SVR rates were evaluated by the prior interferon response (e.g., log drop from baseline at TW 4 or TW 12) in the previous studies.</description>

    <description>AE= any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product/biologic (at any dose), whether or not considered related to the use of that product. Included the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that required intervention/additional therapy, required a dose modification, or were associated with a clinical manifestation were considered AEs. SAE= any adverse drug or biologic or device experience occurring at any dose resulting in death, was life-threatening, was persistent or caused significant disability/incapacity, required in-patient hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization, or was a congenital anomaly or birth defect.</description>

             all study treatment and scheduled procedures within the previous study.

          -  Participant must have received at least 12 weeks of treatment with PEG/RBV and must
             have discontinued treatment in the previous study due to the futility rule (as defined

          -  Participant must have had detectable HCV-RNA upon completion of the previous study.

          -  Participant and participant partner(s) must each agree to use acceptable methods of
             contraception for at least 2 weeks prior to starting any study treatment and to
             continue until at least 6 months after the last doses of study drugs, or longer if
             dictated by local regulations.

          -  Participant must be willing to give written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  All participant exclusion criteria from the SPRI clinical study in which the

             EXCEPT for the following:

               -  Treatment with RBV within 90 days and any interferon-alpha within 1 month of the

          -  Participants who had the opportunity to receive boceprevir in the previous study.
