      Participation in this research study involves two research visits, at least one of which is
      at Children's Hospital Boston. The first visit lasts about 4-6 hours. On this visit, the
      child will work with a research assistant on a few different cognitive assessments while one
      or both parents answer interview questionnaires about the child's development, along with
      other family history information. The second visit at the hospital lasts about 2 and a half
      hours and involves medical history and family history questionnaires, as well as height,
      weight, and head circumference measurements and a blood draw from each family member. In
      addition, digital photographs will be taken of each family member and a 3-D picture of the
      child's face will be taken. Shortly after the visits, participants will receive a research
      report of our observations. These results include cognitive, behavioral, developmental, and
      social findings. The total time commitment for the study is 6 to 8 hours.
