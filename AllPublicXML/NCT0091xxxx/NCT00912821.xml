  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an important model of renal replacement therapy for end-stage
      renal disease (ESRD) patients. Thus far, evidence for the initiation dosage of PD treatment
      is lacking, most patients begin their PD with four 2 L exchanges per day. However, many
      patients have their residual renal function at the initiation of PD, an 8 L dialysate per day
      will enhance the toxicity of bioincompatible dialysate and increase the economic burden
      compared with that of 6 L dialysate per day. Thus, the investigators perform a prospective,
      randomized, controlled, multi-center clinical study. The patients initiation of PD treatment
      within 6 months are randomized to be assigned to two groups: 6 L of dialysate per day and 8 L
      of dialysate per day, follow up will be regularly performed until 96 weeks. Clinical outcomes
      such as mortality, complications and life quality between the two groups will be
      investigated.

      To investigate the effect, feasibility and safety of 6L of dialysate per day after initiation
      of peritoneal dialysis (PD), we perform a prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center
      clinical study. The patients initiation of PD treatment within 6 months are randomized to be
      assigned to two groups: 6L of dialysate per day and 8L of dialysate per day, follow up will
      be regularly performed at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36 weeks, 48 weeks,
      60 weeks, 72 weeks, 84 weeks and 96 weeks. Serum biochemical parameters, Kt/V, residual renal
      function (RRF), life quality and cardiovascular test will be regularly recorded. Clinical
      outcomes such as mortality, technique failure, complications and life quality between the two
      groups will be investigated.
