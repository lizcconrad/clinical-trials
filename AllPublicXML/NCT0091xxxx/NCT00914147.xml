      RATIONALE: Measuring how well the lungs work in patients with cancer may help doctors predict
      how patients will respond to treatment and help plan the best treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying lung function testing in patients with locally
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To obtain the distribution of DLCO, FVC, and FEV_1 by pulmonary function testing (PFT)
           in patients with heavily pretreated locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors referred
           to the Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI) Phase I Clinical Trials Program.

        -  To estimate the mean DLCO to within 4 units (% of predicted) of the true mean with 95%
           confidence.

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the percentage of patients who meet the defined eligibility criteria
           (including PFT levels, especially DLCO) from the entire population enrolled in the KCI
           Phase I Clinical Trials Program.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo pulmonary function testing comprising spirometry test, lung
      volumes, and DLCO measurement utilizing the single-breath breath-holding technique. Patients
      then proceed to treatment on a phase I clinical trial.

    <description>After signing consent, patients will undergo a complete spirometry test, lung volumes and diffusing capacity (DLCO) measurement utilizing the single-breath breath holding technique, according to the ATS/ERS consensus and standardization. PFT measurements will be reported as absolute values (e.g. liters) and percentage of predicted. The predicted normal values will be calculated according to sex, age, height and race using the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) reference equation. Predicted values for diffusion capacity will be calculated using the Morris/Polgar equation. DLCO values will be adjusted to anemia (hemoglobin levels)</description>
