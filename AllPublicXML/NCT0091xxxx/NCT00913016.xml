      1. TOI is the sum of the scores from the physical and functional well-being and the breast
           cancer subscales.

        2. To assess incidence of adverse events (including cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and
           endocrine, musculoskeletal) in Korean postmenopausal breast cancer patients in early
           adjuvant setting.

        3. To assess the effect of letrozole (Femara) on BMD in early adjuvant setting.

        4. To assess the effect of letrozole (Femara) on total cholesterol in early adjuvant
           setting.
