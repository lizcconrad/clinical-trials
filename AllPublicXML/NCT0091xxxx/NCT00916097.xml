      Primary Objective:

      To estimate the overall response rate after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy of Docetaxel 75 mg/m2
      in combination with Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 given for 3 cycles, and followed by conventional
      radiotherapy in UCNT.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To evaluate:

        -  The radiological response after chemotherapy and radiotherapy

        -  The pathological response after chemotherapy by cavum biopsy

      To estimate:

        -  The duration of overall response

        -  The time to progression (T.T.P)

      To analyze:

        -  The overall survival

        -  The safety profile
