  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of conditioning with
      fludarabine, busulphan and thymoglobuline in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS),
      myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorders (MDS/MPD) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)
      undergoing haematopoietic stem cell allograft with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
      (G-CSF)-mobilised peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) (or bone marrow) from HLA compatible
      sibling donors.
