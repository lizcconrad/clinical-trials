  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Bendamustine (TREANDA™),
      in combination with Melphalan in subjects with multiple myeloma who are undergoing an
      Autologous Stem Cell Transplant.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bendamustine (TREANDA™) has been used in clinical trials to treat multiple myeloma. The
      results from these trials suggest that it may be beneficial in the treatment of multiple
      myeloma in a different treatment context. Researchers aim to determine if there may be an
      improved benefit in the context of bone marrow transplant. This initial clinical trial is
      intended to help determine how safe it is to use bendamustine as a conditioning regimen for
      bone marrow transplant, and to look for any initial evidence of benefit.

      Bendamustine (TREANDA™) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
      treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Melphalan is a type of chemotherapy drug.

      The use of Melphalan alone as a conditioning regimen for Autologous Stem Cell Transplant is
      considered &quot;Standard of Care,&quot; that is, the treatment or process that your doctor would
      normally follow to treat your disease. Although Bendamustine (TREANDA™) has been used in
      multiple myeloma research studies, the combination of Bendamustine (TREANDA™) and Melphalan
      as treatment for Multiple Myeloma is not approved by the FDA, thus the combination therapy
      used in this research study is considered &quot;investigational.&quot;
