  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RLP) has gained widespread acceptance as
      a standard treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer. Despite the enhanced
      visualization and precise dissection afforded by the robotic platform, two major
      comorbidities affect a significant number of men: incontinence and erectile function.

      Urinary continence and erectile function

      It is commonly believed that the most important factor affecting continence is preservation
      of the external urinary sphincter complex which lies just below the prostate. Trauma to the
      urethral tissue itself after it is transected from the prostate and damage to the autonomic
      nerves that control this sphincter may lead to sphincteric dysfunction. In addition,
      dissection of the bladder may lead to bladder irritability which also plays a role in
      incontinence. Surgical removal of the prostate also causes significant inflammatory damage to
      the pelvic floor which likely delays recovery of urinary continence. The same trauma issues
      apply to sexual function.

      One possible method to protect the nerves and other tissues from operative trauma may be the
      use of local hypothermia (cold-ischemia) to the pelvis. Local tissue hypothermia using ice,
      ice slush, or cold irrigation has been safely and routinely used for decades in humans during
      brain, heart, and kidney surgery to minimize organ damage. Yet, this technique has never been
      applied to prostate surgery. We will accomplish local cooling of the pelvis using a cooling
      balloon inserted into the rectum. The cooling balloon is powered by an FDA approved cooling
      system developed by Innercool therapies. Temperatures of 57-86 degrees F (22+/-8 degrees C).
