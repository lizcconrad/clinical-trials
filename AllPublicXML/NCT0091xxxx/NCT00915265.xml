      The purpose of this study is to compare the continuous preperitoneal infusion of local
      anesthetic and continuous epidural analgesia for postoperative pain management in fast-track
      open colorectal surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Optimized pain relief allowing early mobilization is a prerequisite for enhanced recovery
      after surgery. Open colorectal surgery is associated with severe and prolonged postoperative
      pain, especially during mobilization. No analgesic technique has fulfilled all requirements
      of optimal efficacy: no side effects, low costs, high patient compliance, and improvement in
      outcome, and consequently, multimodal analgesic techniques have been introduced with a focus
      on opioid sparing to improve analgesia and recovery. Epidural analgesia (EA) has shown a
      marked benefit in controlling pain at mobilization, and significantly improves pain
      management when compared with systemic patient-controlled morphine analgesia. However,
      eligible patients may not benefit from it because of technical problems or failure of
      efficiency. Recently, continuous preperitoneal infusion of local anesthetic (CPA) has been
      shown to be an effective method to relief pain after open colorectal surgery, to reduced
      morphine consumption and accelerated postoperative recovery. However, this technique has
      never been evaluated in a fast-track program (ERAS protocol). Moreover, continuous
      preperitoneal infusions of local anesthetic and epidural analgesia have never been compared.

      The purpose of this randomized and double-blinded study is to compare these two techniques on
      pain control during mobilization, as a prerequisite for enhanced recovery after open
      colorectal surgery: 1- CPA group: continuous preperitoneal administration of 0.2% ropivacaine
      using a multilobed catheter positioned between the previously closed parietal peritoneum and
      the underside of the transversalis fascia + intravenous morphine (patient-controlled
      analgesia, PCA) as a rescue; 2- EA group: epidural infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine
      (patient-controlled epidural analgesia, PCEA) + continuous preperitoneal administration of
      0.9% saline.
