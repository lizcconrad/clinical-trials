  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to evaluate efficacy of a single dose of Liproca Depot in patients
      with localized prostate cancer. Primary efficacy variable was the proportion of patients
      showing PSA nadir. 24 Caucasian men, with a mean age at inclusion of 68.4 years, with
      localized prostate cancer were injected once with a ready made paste including 600 mg
      2-hydroxyflutamide (Liproca Depot) into the site of the prostate where the tumour was
      localized. The patient was monitored for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for maximum 6 months
      or to progression within this time period. The primary endpoint showed interesting results
      with high success rate (83%), i.e. proportion of patients (Responders) that reached plasma
      PSA nadir.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with localized prostate cancer were followed to progression or maximum 24 weeks
      after a single injection in one lobe of 2-8 mL ready-made paste (corresponding to 400-1600 mg
      2-Hydroxyflutamid). Progression was defined as an increase in PSA by &gt; 25% over baseline or
      on-treatment nadir.Among the 24 patients the primary endpoint, plasma PSA nadir, was reached
      by 20 patients (Responders). Efficacy was measured primarily as PSA nadir, and secondly as
      time to PSA nadir and prostate volume change. Safety was monitored throughout the whole study
      period.
