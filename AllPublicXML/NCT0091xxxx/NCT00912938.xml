  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      to evaluate whether bone marker can provide the valuable predictor of skeletal complications
      and whether regular assessing of NTX(N-telopeptide of type I collagen) and osteocalcin can be
      useful in advanced breast cancer patients with bone metastasis receiving zoledronic acid.

    <description>Patients with advanced breast cancer with radiographic confirmation of bone metastases. This arm will be receiving zoledronic acid administration. The primary endpoint is to find the correlation between bone turnover markers and the frequency of skeletal-related-events for one year. Skeletal related events are defined as pathologic fractures, the need for radiation therapy, orthopaedic surgery, hypercalcemia of malignancy and spinal cord compression. A total of 237 patients will be included.</description>
