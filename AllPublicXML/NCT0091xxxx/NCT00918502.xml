    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to gather data to correlate physiological signals
      measured by the AVIVOâ„¢ Mobile Patient Management System with the patient's respiratory
      status, including apnea and hypopnea events, during polysomnography
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with suspected sleep disordered breathing will be monitored during polysomnography
      and the collected information will be used to assess patient's respiratory status.
