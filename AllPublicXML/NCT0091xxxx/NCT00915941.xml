      The purpose of this study is to learn if chemicals from the mouth or stomach can be found in
      the lungs. This may suggest a process called aspiration. This study may help us understand if
      aspiration plays a role in different lung diseases.

      This study is a single center, prospective, observational study of determining pepsin levels
      in BALF samples obtained from consecutive bronchoscopies at the Mayo Clinic Jacksonville. It
      is inherently an exploratory pilot study to confirm whether pepsin in BAL can act as a marker
      of gastric to pulmonary aspiration and whether specific association to pulmonary pathologies
      can be identified.

      As an overview, all patients who are undergoing a bronchoscopy for clinical indications will
      be screened for potential participation in the study by obtaining BALF samples during the
      procedure for laboratory analyses. The BALF will then be tested for pepsin at the Thoracic
      Diseases Research Unit (Mayo Clinic Rochester) using a commercially available ELISA kit, and
      the ancillary markers will be analyzed per the clinical laboratory. Internal controls will be
      defined as normals when subjects have no lung dysfunction, no respiratory symptoms, and no
      lung parenchymal infiltrates on chest radiographs.

      The primary aims of this project parallels the short-term hypotheses stated above:

        1. Confirm pepsin can be detected and quantitated in BALF obtained during a routine
           bronchoscopy.

        2. Identify specific pulmonary pathologies that are more often associated with increased
           pepsin BAL levels.

        3. Identify a normal range of pepsin in BALF in control normals.

        4. Identify any correlation of pepsin BAL levels with reflux, swallow, or respiratory
           symptoms (standardized questionnaires).

        5. Identify any correlation between pepsin BAL levels and lung function test or
           radiographic abnormalities.

      Secondary aims of the study will include exploratory analyses of lesser defined potential
      aspiration markers including bilirubin, lipase, amylase, and pepsinogen. Analyses of these
      markers will parallel the analyses performed for pepsin.

      The focus of the study is to:

        -  definitively identify whether pulmonary aspiration is occurring;

        -  quantitate the burden of aspiration that is occurring (i.e., dose);

        -  localize from where aspiration is occurring (e.g., gastric, duodenal, biliary,
           oropharyngeal, nasal);

        -  identify what is specifically being aspirated (e.g., acid, exogenous oils, bacteria,
           gastric contents, bile, gastric enzymes, pancreatic enzymes).

      BALF specimens will be collected by the MCF Biospecimen Facility at the time of the
      bronchoscopy. A minimum of 5 mL will be collected. Specimen processing will include
      centrifugation to separate the cell pellet from the supernatant. The supernatant will be
      stored in 2 mL cryovials, and stored at -70Â°C until time of testing for the pepsin-ELISA.
      Storage will allow retesting at another date if the assay is modified or if another substance
      of interest arises in the course of the study that requires re-testing of the specimens. The
      clinical sample will also be tested through the Mayo Clinic medical laboratory for bilirubin,
      pepsinogen, amylase, and lipase.

        All subjects will be recruited from the Mayo Clinic Jacksonville site. As defined in the
        inclusion criteria, patients will only be identified once they are scheduled for a
        bronchoscopy for clinical indications. Only adult patients will be considered, and there
        will be no regard to gender or ethnicity in the screening or selection. The BAL procedure
        may or may not be requested by the referring clinician as part of the patient's
        bronchoscopy. In those subjects where the BAL is not requested for clinical indications,
        that means the BAL will be an additional procedure to be added to the patient's
        bronchoscopy for research purposes. Both patients in the inpatient and outpatient settings
        will be recruited, but emergent or operating room based bronchoscopies will be excluded.
        The specific inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed below.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Undergoing bronchoscopy for clinical reasons

          2. 21 years of age or older

          3. Ordering clinician and bronchoscopist is consenting

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Emergent bronchoscopies

          2. Bronchoscopies performed in the operating room

          3. Pre-procedural oxygen requirement &gt; 2 LPM for those who do not have a bronchoalveolar
             lavage ordered by the clinician as part of the bronchoscopy

          4. Pre-procedural bronchospasm for those who do not have a bronchoalveolar lavage ordered

             ventilated patient

          6. The study coordinator, investigator, clinician, or the bronchoscopist may at any time
             withdraw the patient with regards to any concerns on patient safety or if there is
             concerns on the patient's or patient's surrogate's ability to give an informed consent

          7. The clinician or the bronchoscopist may at any time withdraw the patient if by
             participating in the study, the bronchoalveolar fluid obtained is felt to be
             inadequate for clinical testing
