        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with clinically observable macular edema associated with diabetic retinopathy
             in study eye

          -  Macular edema in study eye is associated with

               1. visual acuity of 20/40 or worse; and

               2. retinal thickening in the fovea as seen on biomicroscopic examination

               3. angiographic evidence of leakage involving the perifoveal capillary net

          -  Failure of macular edema to improve with prior macular photocoagulation, or the
             patient is unlikely to benefit from macular photocoagulation in the opinion of the
             investigator

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age and older

          -  Patients must be willing and able to return for scheduled follow up examinations for 3
             years after initial surgery.

          -  Patients must sign and be given a copy of the written Informed Consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Monocular, or vision worse than 20/400 in the fellow eye

          -  Visual acuity worse than 20/200 20/200 and &lt; 34 letters read in the study eye

          -  Use of depot periocular steroids in the study eye within the past 30 days

          -  Current use of &gt;15 mg/day of oral steroids

          -  Known steroid responder

          -  Ocular hypertension &gt; 22 mmHg in the study eye or need for more than one medication to
             maintain IOP &lt; 22 mmHg.

          -  Cup to disc ratio of &gt; 0.8 in the study eye

          -  Prior filtration surgery or glaucoma implant surgery in the study eye

          -  Any active ocular infection in either eye

          -  History of herpetic ocular infection in the study eye

          -  Macular ischemia, defined as angiographic evidence of enlargement of the foveal
             avascular zone to 1 disc area or larger, centered on the fovea

          -  Macular or panretinal photocoagulation treatment in the study eye within the past 90
             days; laser capsulotomy within the past 90 days

          -  Planned or known need for ocular surgery in the study eye within 90 days after
             enrollment and treatment

          -  Any condition that precludes the subject's ability to comply with study requirements,
             including examinations or the completion of the study; or any condition that precludes
             the examiner's ability to obtain reliable fundus photography, angiography, or OCT
             images

          -  Females who are pregnant or lactating, and premenopausal females who are unwilling to
             use a medically accepted method of birth control for the duration of the study

          -  Participation in another investigational trial within 30 days prior to enrollment or
             during the study period

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP &gt; 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP &gt; 90 mmHg)

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c &gt; 13)

          -  Chronic renal failure requiring dialysis or anticipated renal transplant

          -  Retinal or choroidal neovascularization in the study eye; anticipated need for
             panretinal photocoagulation within the next 30 days

          -  Macular edema in the study eye known to be due to a cause other than diabetic
             retinopathy

          -  Use of immunosuppressant drugs
