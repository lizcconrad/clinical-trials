  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney dysfunction is common after cardiac surgery. While many patients suffer no
      long-term ill effects from post-operative kidney dysfunction, some require initiation of
      dialysis therapy that can contribute to long-term morbidity. Further, there is evidence to
      suggest that those patients requiring dialysis after cardiac surgery have a higher risk of
      death in hospital.

      The exact reasons why some patients develop acute kidney dysfunction after cardiac surgery is
      not well understood. However, research evidence to date has suggested that the presence of
      co-morbid illnesses (i.e., diabetes mellitus) and exposure to cardiopulmonary bypass
      (heart-lung machine used during operation when heart is stopped). Cardiopulmonary bypass, in
      particular, has been shown to over-activate several aspect of the body's immune system. Such
      over-activity can induce oxidative stress and contribute to acute kidney dysfunction.

      The investigators believe that the statin drug, atorvastatin, might reduce the oxidative
      stress that occurs during cardiopulmonary bypass, and thus, prevent or reduce the magnitude
      of acute kidney dysfunction in those patients at highest risk. The investigators hope to give
      atorvastatin (40 mg orally) to patients immediately prior to and for 3 days after cardiac
      surgery, and to compare the effects on kidney function with patients who have not had
      atorvastatin.

      Atorvastatin is the most commonly prescribed medication in Australia and is used to reduce
      blood cholesterol levels and decrease the risk of heart attacks and stroke. Recently,
      however, it has been discovered that atorvastatin may be useful for prevention of
      inflammation and oxidative stress in other conditions, such as following cardiac surgery with
      cardiopulmonary bypass.

      Thus, the investigators plan to examine whether atorvastatin can prevent acute kidney
      dysfunction. This trial as planned is a pilot study. If atorvastatin shows promising evidence
      of reduction in acute kidney dysfunction, further studies on a larger scale would be required
      to justify its general use.

      The investigators plan to determine whether atorvastatin, a statin drug, possesses kidney
      protective effects in patients at risk for perioperative acute kidney dysfunction after
      cardiac surgery and exposure to cardiopulmonary bypass.

      This is a pilot, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial.

      The investigators plan to administer atorvastatin (40 mg orally) or placebo to patients
      immediately prior to and for 3 days after cardiac surgery. The atorvastatin/placebo will be
      given orally either by orogastric tube after induction of anaesthesia or swallowed by the
      patients.

      Whether a particular patient receives the atorvastatin or placebo will be decided at random,
      and neither the patient nor the investigators will be aware of the allocated treatment.

      The investigators plan to measure kidney function before and after cardiac surgery using the
      standard blood tests. The investigators also plan to measure markers of inflammation and
      oxidative stress in the blood. This may give insight into the mechanisms whereby atorvastatin
      exerts its effects. The investigators will also take four 20 ml samples of blood, spaced
      before, and after the operation, from the arterial catheter routinely inserted in every
      patient undergoing cardiac surgery.

      The investigators believe that there will be no significant additional risk to a patient who
      participates in the study, and no discomfort other than that normally associated with cardiac
      surgery. Informed consent will be obtained from the patient prior to the operation by one of
      the investigators or the ICU research nurse. The clinical care of a patient who does not
      consent for any reason will not be affected.
