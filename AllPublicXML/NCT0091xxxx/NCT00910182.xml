      Retrospective study in order to investigate the outcome after conservative (with or without
      transcatheter arterial embolization) and surgical treatment of splenic injuries.

      Background

      Splenic injuries after blunt abdominal trauma are treated with increasing frequency without
      operation. Patients undergo observation and bed rest. In certain circumstances an additional
      transcatheter arterial embolization is performed. It is uncertain which splenic ruptures
      (injury grades according to Moore) are best treated non-operatively and which are best
      treated with an emergency operation. Furthermore the value of organ-preserving surgery
      (splenorrhaphy) is uncertain. In addition, the importance of transcatheter arterial
      embolisation is unknown.

      Objective

      Evaluation of outcome (splenic salvage rate, complications, survival) after conservative and
      surgical treatment. Evaluation of the importance of organ-preserving surgery and of
      transcatheter arterial embolization.

      Methods

      All adult patients with splenic injuries after blunt abdominal trauma are included
      (2002-2008). The patients charts are studied and the following main information retrieved:
      age, gender, mechanism of accident, grade of splenic injury, concomitant injuries, patient
      management in the emergency department (fluid administration etc.), diagnostic methods
      (ultrasound, computed tomography), treatment modalities (bed rest, surgery, embolization),
      complications of treatment, re-operations, long-term outcome.
