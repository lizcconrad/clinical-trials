      The purpose of this study is to find out if a medication that increases levels of a brain
      chemical called acetylcholine will improve balance and reduce falls in patients with
      parkinson's disease who have the problem of very poor balance and are frequently falling or
      nearly falling on a daily basis. Donepezil, a drug approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's
      dementia, will reduce falls in subjects with Parkinson's disease and balance impairment.

      This trial is a double-blinded cross-over design comparing donepezil with placebo in 40
      subjects with idiopathic Parkinson's disease who report frequent falls or near falls
      (&gt;2/week). The purpose of this study is to find out if a medication that increases levels of
      a brain chemical called acetylcholine will improve balance and reduce falls in patients with
      parkinson's disease who have the problem of very poor balance and are frequently falling or
      nearly falling on a daily basis. Donepezil, a drug approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's
      dementia, will reduce falls in subjects with Parkinson's disease and balance impairment.

    <description>The primary outcomes were fall frequency determined using daily event recording by the subjects onto postcards which accumulated data for six weeks per phase. Falls were defined as landing on the floor. Fall frequency is the number of reported falls divided by the number of days reported. Postcards were mailed back to the investigator weekly.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of Near Falls Per Day</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome was near fall frequency determined using daily event recording by the subjects onto postcards which accumulated data for six weeks per phase. Near falls were defined as a fall that did not land on the floor (for example grabbing a handrail or a table). Near fall frequency is the number of reported near falls divided by the number of days reported. Postcards were mailed back to the investigator weekly.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Adult subjects were those diagnosed with probable idiopathic PD, defined as manifesting two of three cardinal features (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia), without any other historical or physical signs to suggest another diagnosis, and were recruited from the Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) Movement Disorders clinic.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This is a cross-over treatment trial. Each drug phase, donepezil or identical placebo, lasted 6 weeks, with a three week washout period in between. In each drug phase, subjects were instructed to take one tablet (mg of donepezil or placebo) for three weeks and to increase to two tablets (10 mg) for the remaining three weeks.</pre_assignment_details>
