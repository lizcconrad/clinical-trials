      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility, primary safety and efficacy of
      foldable capsular vitreous body (FCVB) in the treatment of retinal detachment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) has been one of the most important ophthalmic surgeries for
      treating a number of blinding diseases by removing and replacing the diseased vitreous body.
      Current clinic vitreous substitute cannot mimic the natural vitreous which is unable to
      regenerate after surgery. We have devised a novel foldable capsular vitreous body (FCVB)
      consisting of a vitreous-like capsule with a tube-valve system, and demonstrated it could
      finely mimic the morphology and restore main physiological function of the natural vitreous
      body in our previous study.

    <description>FCVBs filled with balanced salt solution (BSS) were removed from all 11 cases, however, the risk of retinal redetachment and blindness rises after earlier FCVB removal. Approved by the Sun Yat-sen University Medical Ethics Committee, the removal of the FCVB will be decided by doctors depending on the conditions of eye. The eyes implanted with the silicone oil-filled FCVB are still under observation.</description>
