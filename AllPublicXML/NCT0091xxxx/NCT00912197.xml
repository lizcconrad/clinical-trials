  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to look into the effects of oligofructose supplementation on appetite,
      energy intake, and body weight and body composition in overweight subjects. Compared to a
      placebo product (cellulose) oligofructose is hypothesised to suppress hunger and thereby
      reduce food intake moderately leading to a decrease in body weight.

      Appetite regulation plays an important part in energy balance. Suppressing appetite by
      manipulating the diet is a safe way of reducing energy intake and body weight compared to
      drug therapy and obesity surgery. How various nutrients affect appetite is not fully
      understood. Non-digestible carbohydrates (NDC) may affect appetite differently due to
      differences in physio-chemical properties.

      This project will look into how two different NDC affect appetite and energy intake in
      overweight individuals in a randomised, double-blinded, placebo controlled parallel study.
      The NDC under investigation are oligofructose and cellulose, both natural compounds of plant
      origin. The former is broken down (fermented) in the large bowel by friendly bacteria
      producing various compounds that may affect appetite and the metabolism of the host.

      Volunteers will consume one of the two NDC for eight weeks (including a two week run-in
      period). Appetite study session, functional MRI (fMRI) and MRI body fat scans will be
      conducted before and after the supplementation with NDC (or during the supplementation in the
      case of fMRI). Using fMRI the effect of the NDC supplementation on central appetite
      regulating centres will be investigated. Appetite questionnaires and dietary records will
      completed under free-living conditions at baseline and during the supplementation to explore
      the effect on subjective appetite feelings and energy intake, respectively.

      It is hoped that this project will enhance the understanding of how NDC affect appetite and
      provide further information on how fermentation of NDC, gut hormone release, body
      composition, and appetite regulation are linked.
