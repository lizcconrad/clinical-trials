      As part of the global clinical development program for AG-013736, studies are ongoing (and
      planned) in cancer patients in China. An assessment of AG-013736 pharmacokinetics in Chinese
      subjects, as required by the Chinese Health Authorities, is therefore warranted.

      In the current study the single dose pharmacokinetics of AG-013736 will be characterized at 3
      doses (5 mg, 7 mg and 10 mg).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and/or female (of nonchildbearing potential) Chinese (individuals
             currently residing in mainland China who were born in China and have both parents of
             Chinese descent) subjects between the ages of 18 and 45 years, inclusive. (Healthy is
             defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical
             history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate
             measurement, 12 lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests.)

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 19 to 24 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs). A
             BMI lower limit of 18.5 kg/m2 may be rounded up to 19.0 kg/m2; a BMI upper limit of
             24.5 kg/m2 may be rounded down to 24.0 kg/m2 and will be acceptable for inclusion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal
             allergies at time of dosing) disease or clinical findings at Screening.

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).

          -  Drug dependency, a positive urine drug screen, or alcohol dependency.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 28 or more units per week. (One
             unit=285 mL of beer or 25 mL of spirits or 125 mL of wine).

          -  Use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products (or a positive urine cotinine test).

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 3 months (or as determined by local
             regulations) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of study medication.
