    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to investigate the impact of physical
      therapist-directed exercise counseling combined with fitness center-based exercise training
      on stage of exercise behavior in people with type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from
      insulin resistance. Research studies indicate that complications such as cardiovascular
      disease, peripheral vascular disease, retinopathy, and loss of physical function are
      associated with type 2 diabetes. Clinical management of people with type 2 diabetes consists
      of medical nutrition therapy, pharmacological therapy, and exercise. Exercise has been shown
      to improve risk factors associated with complications of type 2 diabetes such as elevated
      plasma glucose, elevated blood pressure, loss of muscular strength, and loss of exercise
      capacity. In fact, the American Diabetes Association and American College of Sports Medicine
      have published position statements recommending the use of exercise, specifically resistance
      and aerobic training, as an intervention for people with type 2 diabetes. However, 31 percent
      of people with type 2 diabetes have reported no regular physical activity and an additional
      38 percent have reported less than recommended levels of physical activity. Therefore,
      interventions to promote regular exercise behavior in people with type 2 diabetes are
      clinically important by potentially preventing type 2 diabetes-related complications.

      Previous studies have investigated the impact of exercise counseling on exercise behavior in
      people with type 2 diabetes. However, these studies have limitations such as lack of
      agreement with exercise training guidelines for people with type 2 diabetes and research
      design flaws. This current study investigates the effect of a novel, physical
      therapist-directed exercise counseling combined with fitness center-based exercise training
      intervention on stage of exercise behavior in people with type 2 diabetes.

    <description>Each participant in the experimental group receives exercise counseling from the same physical therapist as described in previous research. In short, during each exercise counseling session, the physical therapist addresses the benefits of exercise for people with type 2 diabetes, advises each participant to adhere to the prescribed exercise program, and assists each participant by reviewing the prescribed exercise program. Exercise counseling is tailored to the stage of exercise behavior as described in previous literature. The experimental group is also provided access to a fitness center.</description>

Each participant in the comparison group receives the same prescribed exercise program as the experimental group and is supervised during each exercise training session by a trained co-investigator in a controlled exercise laboratory setting.</description>
