  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well everolimus with or without trastuzumab works in treating
      patients with breast cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy and has spread from
      where it started to other places in the body. Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      trastuzumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving
      everolimus and adding trastuzumab at the time of disease progression may be an effective
      treatment for breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common type of invasive cancer in women, with more than 1 million
      cases and almost 600,000 deaths occurring worldwide annually. Breast cancer that has spread
      to other parts of the body (metastasized) is usually not curable. Patients with a type of
      metastatic breast cancer that has hormone receptors on the surface of the cancer cells are
      usually treated with the drug tamoxifen, which interferes with the function of these hormone
      receptors. However, the average survival time for these patients remains at around 36 months.

      In patients who no longer respond to tamoxifen (hormone-refractory breast cancer), the cancer
      drug trastuzumab (Herceptin), which acts on a protein called human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2 (HER2), may have some activity. In addition, studies suggest that the drug
      everolimus, which acts on a pathway within cancer cells that is important for growth of the
      tumor, may make the cancer cells more sensitive to treatment with trastuzumab. Thus, the two
      drugs may act together to increase their anti-cancer potential.
