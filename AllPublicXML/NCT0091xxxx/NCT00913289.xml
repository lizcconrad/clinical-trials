    <textblock>
      Mesenchymal stem cells have the capability to differentiate into hepatocytes and will be
      useful for liver regeneration. Adipose tissue is relatively enriched with mesenchymal stem
      cells compared to bone marrow tissue. In this trial, eligible liver cirrhosis patients will
      receive autologous adipose tissue derived stromal cells which include such mesenchymal stem
      cells.

    <textblock>
      The population of the liver cirrhosis patients is enormous in Japan and the only radical
      treatment for them is liver transplantation. However, the number of giving donors is
      extremely limited. Mesenchymal stem cells have been capable to differentiate into
      mesodermal-lineage cells as well as endodermal-lineage cells such as hepatocytes. They reside
      in the mesenchymal tissues such as bone marrows as well as adipose tissues. The latter
      tissues are relatively enriched with mesenchymal stem cells compared to bone marrow cells. In
      this study, the cirrhotic patients will receive autologous adipose tissue derived stromal
      cells which contains substantial number of mesenchymal stem cells.
