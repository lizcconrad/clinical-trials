      The purpose of this Phase I, open-label, single sequence drug-drug interaction trial in human
      immunodeficiency virus-type 1 infected patients is to investigate the potential interaction
      between steady-state nevirapine (NVP) 200 mg b.i.d. (twice a day) and a single dose of 400 mg
      TMC207 and to explore the pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed into the bloodstream,
      distributed in the body and eliminated from the body).

      TMC207 is being investigated for the treatment of M. tuberculosis (TB) infection. This is a
      Phase I, open-label (both participant and investigator know the name of the assigned
      medication), single-sequence (all participants receive treatments in the same order)
      drug-drug interaction trial in human immunodeficiency virus - type 1 (HIV-1) infected
      patients to investigate the potential interaction between steady-state nevirapine (NVP) 200
      mg b.i.d. (twice a day) and a single dose of 400 mg TMC207. The study medication will be
      taken orally. The trial population will consist of 16 patients infected with HIV-1 virus who
      have not yet been treated for this infection (antiretroviral or ARV naïve) with a medical
      indication to start ARV therapy and electing to start treatment with NVP plus two
      nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N(t)RTIs). The primary objective is to
      evaluate the effect of steady-state NVP 200 mg b.i.d. on the pharmacokinetics of TMC207 and
      its M2 metabolite after single-dose administration of TMC207 400 mg, in HIV-1 infected
      patients. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of single-dose TMC207 400 mg on
      the steady-state plasma concentrations of NVP 200 mg b.i.d. and to evaluate the short-term
      safety and tolerability of coadministration of single-dose TMC207 and steady-state NVP in
      HIV-1 infected patients. Prior to starting the NVP-containing regimen, patients will receive
      a single dose of TMC207 400 mg (Treatment A). At least 2 but no more than 4 weeks later, NVP
      will be started (in combination with 2 N(t)RTIs) at the recommended dosing regimen (200 mg
      once daily for 2 weeks followed by 200 mg twice daily). After 4 weeks of NVP at a dose of 200
      mg b.i.d., a second single dose of TMC207 400 mg will be administered (Treatment
      B).Pharmacokinetic profiles over 336 hours will be determined for TMC207 and its
      N-monodesmethyl metabolite (M2) after administration of TMC207 400 mg alone, and in
      combination with steady-state NVP. Morning predose concentrations of NVP will be determined
      at several time points.Safety and tolerability will be evaluated throughout the trial.
      Adverse events will be recorded at every visit. A blood and urine sample will be taken at
      screening, day -1, 1, 2 and 15 of treatment A and B and at both follow-up visits. An
      electrocardiogram will be recorded at screening, twice on day 1 and once on day 2 and 15 of
      treatment A and B and at the last follow-up visit. Vital signs will be measured at screening,
      on day 1, 2 and 15 of treatment A and B and at both follow-up visits. A physical examination
      will be performed at screening, on day -1 of treatment A and B and at both follow-up visits.
      On day 1 of treatment A and B 400 mg TMC207 (4 tablets) will be taken by mouth in the morning
      within 10 minutes after completion of the breakfast. At least 2 but no more than 4 weeks
      after the first single dose of TMC207, NVP will be started [in combination with 2 N(t)RTIs]
      as 200 mg once daily for 2 weeks followed by 200 mg twice daily, orally. After 4 weeks of NVP
      at a dose of 200 mg twice daily, a second single dose of TMC207 will be administered.
