    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence is the most common type of female incontinence. The efficacy of
      pelvic floor muscle training with biofeedback has been already proved in many studies. But
      intravaginal probe is one of the limitation. So, the purpose of this study is to assess the
      efficacy and safety of extracorporeal biofeedback device with pelvic floor muscle training.
