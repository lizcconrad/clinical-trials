  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double blind, vehicle-controlled evaluation of the effectiveness
      and safety of HylaCareTM. The study will employ the patient as her own control, a commonly
      used method for the evaluation of topical dermatologic agents. Each patient will be
      randomized blindly as to whether the study serum will be applied to the medial or lateral
      portion of the treated breast, using the nipple as the dividing line. The product and placebo
      will also be applied to the contra-lateral breast in the same fashion, as a further control.
      The study drug and placebo will be applied three (3) times daily.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be allocated to the treatment using a randomized permuted block. There will be
      no stratification. Patients will be randomized to receive the investigational product to be
      applied to either the medial (inside) or lateral (outside) portion of the breast, a placebo
      product will be used on the other side. Patients and clinical investigators will be blinded
      to the treatment assignments.
