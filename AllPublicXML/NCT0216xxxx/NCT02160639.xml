      Improving diabetes social support is associated with health improvement benefits. This study
      is a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of telephone-based
      diabetes self-management support (DSMS) compared with usual care, which includes diabetes
      self-management education (DSME), during a 1-year period. It will determine whether this
      specific model for providing on-going support to people with diabetes will better enable them
      to maintain the engagement in self-care behaviors, clinical improvements and
      diabetes-specific knowledge gained during the course of diabetes self-management education.
