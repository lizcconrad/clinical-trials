  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of adding a single
      shot parasacral (sciatic) nerve block to a continuous lumbar plexus block in patients
      undergoing total hip replacement.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study is intended to assess the efficacy of placing a parasacral (sciatic)
      nerve block in addition to a lumbar plexus block for postoperative analgesia following total
      hip arthroplasty. Although the placement of a lumbar plexus block alone has become accepted
      as the standard of care at UPMC for postoperative analgesia following total hip arthroplasty,
      the addition of a parasacral (sciatic) nerve block may provide the advantage of blocking the
      superior gluteal nerve and nerve to the quadratus femoris which both supply small articular
      sensory branches to the posterior hip capsule.
