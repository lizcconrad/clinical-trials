  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK - the study of the way a
      drug enters and leaves the blood and tissues over time) and relative bioavailability (the
      extent to which a drug or other substance becomes available to the body) of JNJ-56021927,
      when administered as 3 tablet formulations (test) compared with JNJ-54781532 softgel capsule
      formulation (reference) in healthy male participants under fasted conditions at a single dose
      of 240 milligram (mg).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), open-label (all
      people know the identity of the intervention), single-center, 4-treatment, parallel design (a
      medical research study comparing the response in two or more groups of participants receiving
      different interventions) study of a single dose of 240 mg JNJ-56021927. The duration of study
      will be approximately of 78 days per participant. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening
      phase (that is, 21 days before study commences on Day 1); Open-label Treatment phase
      (consists of 4 parallel single-dose treatments); and End-of-Study (completion of the Hour
      1344 PK sampling on Day 57, or upon early withdrawal). All the eligible participants will be
      randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 possible treatments: Treatment A (240 mg dose as softgel
      capsule); Treatment B (240 mg dose as Tablet Formulation 1); Treatment C (240 mg dose as
      Tablet Formulation 2); or Treatment D (240 mg dose as Tablet Formulation 3). Participants
      will fast overnight from food and fluids (excluding non-carbonated water) for at least 10
      hours before study drug administration on Day 1. Blood samples will be collected pre-dose and
      over 1,344 hours (Day 57) after dosing for the determination of JNJ-56021927 concentration
      and its active metabolite. Relative bioavailability of 3 tablet formulations as compared to
      the softgel capsule formulation of JNJ-56021927 will be evaluated primarily. Participants'
      safety will be monitored throughout the study.
