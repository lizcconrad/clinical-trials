      Background

      Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a term representing all diseases related to reduction in
      blood flow to the heart characterised by clot formation over a segment of blood vessel
      narrowing. A major constituent of clot are blood cells called platelets and many of the
      medications used in ACS target platelet function. Ticagrelor is known to reduce platelet
      activity in clot formation by blocking a specific step in the process (P2Y12 receptors). A
      recent study has found that the presence of ticagrelor may also reduce clot formation by
      significantly enhancing another process involving the molecule nitric oxide (NO). This is of
      particular interest if translates into clinical practice, as many patients with heart disease
      have abnormal function of their blood vessel lining. This is known to cause a reduction in
      available nitric oxide. Does this therefore mean these patients will have a reduced response
      to ticagrelor therapy and subsequently be at increased risk of clot formation?

      Aims

        1. Will ticagrelor increase the anti clot effect of vessel lining produced nitric oxide?

        2. Do patients with diabetes or smokers, who have poor function of their vessel lining,
           have a reduced response to ticagrelor?

      Methods

      This is a pilot study in which we propose to look at 64 patients with known disease of their
      heart blood vessels, with an equal mix of smokers, diabetics, smoking diabetics and non
      smoking non diabetics. We will also recruit ten healthy normal subjects to ensure that our
      tests produce the same results as the basic science study mentioned above.

      To answer the questions posed we will perform blood tests, primarily looking at platelet
      function, and non-invasive blood vessel lining assessment. This will be done before and after
      ticagrelor treatment on each participant, enabling statistical comparison.
