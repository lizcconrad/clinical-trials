  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the current dose of nevirapine recommended
      in the Ontario Ministry of Health vertical transmission prevention protocol achieves
      therapeutic drug levels in newborn infants at high risk of HIV infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although nevirapine (NVP) is often given as part of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)
      at our institutions for prevention of vertical transmission (VT) in high risk infants, the
      optimal prophylactic dose of nevirapine is unknown. The National Institute of Health (NIH)
      guidelines currently recommend a single 2 mg/kg dose of nevirapine given to the infant within
      72 hours of birth, however, this dose is not being used in practice given the controversies
      previously described with single-dose nevirapine. In the absence of any guidance to inform
      the multiple daily dosing of nevirapine for prophylaxis of VT, we are currently using the
      treatment dose for infants &gt;15 days of age of 150 mg/m2 once daily for 14 days, then
      increasing to 150 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days. This is analogous to the treatment dosing of
      triple antiretrovirals (ARVs) that is given for occupational post-exposure prophylaxis.
      Nevirapine is given for 4 weeks total with zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC), followed by
      2 additional weeks of AZT and 3TC to prevent the development of nevirapine resistance from
      its long half life. Stopping all 3 drugs simultaneously would result in a period of
      functional NVP monotherapy, resulting in a risk of NVP resistance should the infant become
      infected despite prophylaxis. Since the dose of nevirapine being used in our clinic
      populations for prevention of VT is higher than has been previously studied in neonates, it
      is important to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this dosing regimen, using therapeutic
      drug monitoring.

        The patients in this study are newborn infants clinically prescribed combination
        antiretroviral treatment with nevirapine for prevention of mother-to-child HIV
        transmission. These infants are routinely referred to the SickKids and CHEO HIV clinics in
        Toronto and Ottawa, respectively, for ongoing management. The majority of referrals are
        from Mount Sinai Hospital and St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, and the Ottawa General
        Hospital in Ottawa.

             prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission. These infants are routinely referred
             to the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) and Children's Hospital of Eastern
             Ontario (CHEO) HIV clinics in Toronto and Ottawa, respectively, for ongoing
             management. The majority of referrals are from Mount Sinai Hospital and St. Michael's
             Hospital in Toronto, and the Ottawa General Hospital in Ottawa.
