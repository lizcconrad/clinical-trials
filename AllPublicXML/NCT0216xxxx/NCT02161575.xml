  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AMD (Age Related Macular Degeneration) is the leading cause of severe visual loss and
      blindness registration in the UK . It is a disease which affects the retina (the nerve and
      blood vessel network at the back of the eye responsible for vision). Patients can suffer with
      severe visual loss and have difficulties with every day tasks such as recognising faces,
      reading &amp; driving.

      There are two variations of the disease, a 'dry' type &amp; a 'wet' type also known as
      neovascular AMD (nAMD). In wet/nAMD new vessels grow from the blood supply underneath the
      retina, in part due to higher than normal levels of a protein called Vascular Endothelial
      Growth Factor (VEGF). Since the introduction of drugs which block VEGF, visual outcomes for
      patients with wAMD have dramatically improved.

      There are 2 widely used treatments; ranibizumab and aflibercept. Whilst the majority of
      patients have a successful outcome with treatment, many patients experience suboptimal
      response. This study will evaluate if these patients experience a benefit from a switch to a
      different antiVEGF drug treatment. In this study nAMD patients who are showing no or poor to
      response to treatment with aflibercept will be switched to ranibizumab to assess if there is
      any benefit in terms of treatment outcomes.

      Patients will visit the hospital clinic 8 times over the 7 - 8 month study period. Monthly
      ranibizumab injections will be given for the first 3 months, then monthly as required for the
      next 3 months. 162 patients will be treated in around 33 centres in Europe, of which
      approximately 127 patients will be included in the UK

    <measure>Change in Central Subfield Retinal Thickness (CSRT) from Baseline to Day 90.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of the improvement in Central Subfield Retinal Thickness, determined by high definition optical coherence tomography (HD-OCT) after 3 monthly injections of ranibizumab. OCT is a non-invasive technique which can determine and measure thickness of the retina. Improvement is determined as a reduction in CSRT, which indicates less retinal fluid and therefore ilower disease activity.</description>

    <description>The mean change from baseline at all visits up to Day 180 in size, i.e. height or volume as appropriate, of the following anatomical parameters as measured by HD-OCT: SF, IRC, PEDs. This will give an indication of changes in disease activity.</description>
