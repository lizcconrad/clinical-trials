  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past, dietary nitrate supplementation has been shown to have clinical benefits in the
      treatment of cardiovascular issues. More recently, however, the focus of nitrate
      supplementation has shifted to focus of human performance, and has shown to increase the time
      to exhaustion during maximal intensity exercise and lower the cost of oxygen consumption
      during submaximal intensity exercise. Acutely, nitrate supplementation in the form of
      beetroot juice has been shown to increase strength measurements, as well as increase the time
      to complete a 2000 meter rowing ergometer test. However, to the author's knowledge, there are
      no studies that link the relationship between multi-day nitrate supplementation and the
      rowing test or the nitrate's effect on strength when in the salt form. Additionally, to the
      author's knowledge, no evidence has been published which relates dietary nitrate
      supplementation and its effects on a CrossFit circuit workout.

      Our central hypothesis is that six days of dietary nitrate supplementation will improve
      strength, endurance, a power more than a placebo in male CrossFit athletes.

      The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, crossover study is to identify if dietary
      nitrate supplementation improves strength , endurance, and power measurements in male
      CrossFit athletes. Specifically, the strength measurements will be taken using isometric and
      isokinetic tests on the Biodex dynamometer. Endurance will be measured using time trials for
      a 2000 meter rowing test and the &quot;Fran&quot; CrossFit workout. Finally, power will be analyzed
      using the Wingate cycle test.

      The treatment group will receive 1 serving of f potassium nitrate KNO3- (N) (8 mmols NO3-).
      The placebo group will receive 1 serving of the nitrate-free placebo (PL) potassium chloride
      (8 mmol KCl).

      The participants will complete two three-day baseline testing, with a six-day supplementation
      period following each round of baseline testing. Following the first six-day supplementation
      period, there will be a 10 day washout period before the second baseline testing begins.
