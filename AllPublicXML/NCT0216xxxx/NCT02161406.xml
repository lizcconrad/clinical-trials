  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that SC abatacept is safe and shows evidence of efficacy (improvement
      in modified Rodnan score [mRSS]) in patients with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis
      (dcScc) compared to matching placebo.

      This study is a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind phase 2 trial of patients with
      dcSSc. Eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either 125 mg SC abatacept
      or matching placebo, stratified by duration of dcSSc disease duration (&lt;18 months vs &gt;18 to
      &lt;/=36 months). Study participants will be treated for 12 months on double-blind study
      medication, followed by an additional 24 weeks of open-label SC abatacept therapy. 86
      patients will be randomized in approximately 35 centers in the US, Canada and Europe, with
      the goal of analyzing 74 participants. The investigators study will test whether abatacept is
      statistically superior to placebo in reducing the MRSS at month 12 and explore the ability of
      abatacept to prevent or reverse progression in patients with early disease duration and lower
      MRSS scores, and reverse established disease in patients with longer disease duration and
      higher MRSS scores.
