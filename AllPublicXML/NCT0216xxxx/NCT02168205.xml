      This study will evaluate the effect of food and smoking on healthy older subjects taking
      pomalidomide.

      This study will be conducted in two parts. Parts 1 and 2 may be conducted in parallel and
      subjects are only allowed to participate in one part.

      In Part 1, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a single oral dose of 4 mg
      pomalidomide on Day 1 under fed (standard high fat breakfast) or fasted conditions. After a
      washout period of at least 3 and no more than 7 days, subjects will receive a single oral
      dose of 4 mg pomalidomide under the opposite condition to what they received in the first
      period.

      In Part 2, healthy male smoker subjects must smoke approximately 20 cigarettes per day for a
      total of 10 days. Non-smokers will neither smoke nor be in the presence of smokers. All
      subjects will receive orally a 200-mg caffeine capsule on Day 6, and on Day 8, subjects will
      receive a single oral dose of 4 mg pomalidomide.

      For both Parts 1 and 2, serial blood samples will be collected for determination of plasma
      pomalidomide concentrations.
