    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of RO6799477 following once daily oral administration for 2 weeks in healthy
      volunteers (Part 1) and in Type 2 diabetes patients (T2D) (Part 2). The anticipated time on
      study treatment is two weeks.

        Part 2 Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Type 1 diabetes

          -  Acquired or secondary forms of diabetes such as those resulting from pancreatic

             as judged by the investigator, or pre-proliferative/proliferative diabetic retinopathy
             as judged by the investigator or already diagnosed by the diabetologist or general
             practitioner

          -  Disorders of central nervous system, psychiatric disorders, behavioral disturbances

          -  Any condition or disease detected during the medical interview / physical examination
             that would render the patient unsuitable for the study, place the patient at undue
