  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether community-based rehabilitation plus
      facility-based care is superior to facility-based care alone in reducing disability related
      to schizophrenia in rural Ethiopia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cluster randomised trial set in rural Ethiopia with kebeles (villages) as the unit
      of randomisation. 54 kebeles will be included. 27 will be randomly allocated to the
      intervention arm (Facility based care (FBC) + Community-based Rehabilitation (CBR)) and 27
      randomly allocated to the control arm (FBC alone).

      The aim is to determine whether CBR + FBC is superior to FBC alone in reducing disability
      related to schizophrenia, measured by the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule version 2.0
      (WHODAS 2.0) at 6 and 12 months.

    <description>Community-based rehabilitation is delivered to participants and their caregivers at their home by a specialist CBR worker. It comprises psychoeducation, adherence support, rehabilitation (including self-care and social skills), family support groups and accessing existing community organisations. It also involves community awareness raising and education and mobilisation of community leaders.
Facility based care (usual care) consists of anti-psychotic medication prescribed by a nurse or clinical officer in a health centre and basic psycho-education.</description>
