  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with persistent irregular heartbeats also called persistent atrial fibrillation
      usually have a lower probability of curing their arrhythmia with ablation with heat called
      radiofrequency then those with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, as previous studies have
      shown.

      The emerging ablation with freeze(cryoablation) has not been studied for persistent atrial
      fibrillation but has been proven to be efficient in the paroxysmal type.

      We hypothesized that persistent atrial fibrillation will have a freedom of recurrence rate of
      70% after use of cryoablation at one year of follow up.

      This was a retrospective single center cohort study designed to assess the freedom from
      recurrence of atrial fibrillation in the sample of patients with long persistent atrial
      fibrillation.

      All patients who underwent cryoballoon ablation for atrial fibrillation at Staten Island
      University Hospital in the period ranging from January 2010 to 2013 were included in the
      study.

      Data was collected from the electronic medical record as well as from the physician's office
      records after Institutional Review Board approval of the protocol

      .Data collected included demographics, comorbidities pertaining to diabetes, heart failure,
      coronary artery disease, stroke occurrence, medications including antiarrhythmics and
      anticoagulants, procedural details including time of procedure and of fluoroscopy, vein
      ostial size, number of veins isolated, time to first recurrence after blanking period,
      complications of procedure and mortality. All patient identifiers were kept in a password
      protected computer.

    <description>Cryoballoon ablation will be applied to all patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. It consists on applying the Arctic Front Cryoballoon to the pulmonary veins and freezing the antrum. In addition debulking of the atrial roof will be performed by a single application of the cryoballoon to the left and right roof, the septal wall and the lateral ridge wall.</description>

    <description>. The goal was to isolate all 4 veins with application of cryoballoon on the ostium of the vein. A 28 mm balloon was used with centrifugal cooling system. The maximum temperature reached was between -45 C and -60 C to optimize irreversible isolation without causing extracardiac complications. A circular catheter (Achieve) was used to map electrograms in conjunction with the NavX ENSITE 3000, St Judes . Intracardiac ultrasound was used to measure the pulmonary vein diameter, check for intraoperative complications, determine complete occlusion of the vein by the balloon and guide transeptal puncture. . In each patient the left atrium was debulked by applying cryoballoon</description>
