      Skin Carotenoid Scores (SCS) are a biomarker of overall antioxidant status. This study will
      use Raman Spectroscopy to examine the ability of increased dietary intake of fruits and
      vegetables to increase SCS in medical students. This will be an observational, non-invasive
      study examining skin carotenoid levels over time in individuals who have increased their
      intake by dietary adjustments. Thirty medical students meeting study inclusion criteria will
      be asked to increase their intake of high antioxidant fruits and vegetables to 4-6 cups per
      day over an eight week period of time. Students will self-select their fruits and vegetables
      from a given list and will receive supermarket gift cards to offset the cost of the increased
      food. Students will be asked to follow their usual diet for one week. Then increase their
      intake of high antioxidant fruit and vegetable to 4-6 cups per day for eight weeks. Then
      return to their usual diet for 2 weeks. SCS scores will be taken at baseline and week 1. At
      the beginning of week 2, students will be asked to increase fruit and vegetable intake to 4-6
      cups per day. SCS will be measured every two weeks during the 8-week intervention phase.
      Students will return to their usual diet for 2 weeks and SCS will be measured at the end of
      that 2-week period.

    <description>Skin Carotenoid Scores (SCS) are a biomarker of overall antioxidant status. The purpose of this study is to measure changes in SCS in medical students when fruit and vegetable consumption is increased. SCS will measured using a Bio-photonic Scanner. This scanner non-invasively measures carotenoid levels in the skin using optical signals. By placing the palm of the hand in front of a low-energy blue light for less than two minutes, the scanner can determine the SCS.</description>
