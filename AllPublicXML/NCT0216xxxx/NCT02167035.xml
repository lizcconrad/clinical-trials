  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare Combigan BID vs Simbrinza TID in subjects currently being treated with Latanoprost
      for Open-Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension. Both of these drugs are currently FDA
      approved as combination therapy for patients with Open-Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension.
      The purpose of this clinical trial would be to assess which treatment, if either, is superior
      in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP). A secondary objective is to assess the tolerability
      of each drug.
