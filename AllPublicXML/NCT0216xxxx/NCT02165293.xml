  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-center, open-label study will investigate RO7033877 concentrations in plasma and
      in various lung compartments, including epithelial lining fluid (ELF), and alveolar
      macrophages (AM) in healthy volunteers after multiple intravenous (IV) administration.
      Bronchoscopy will be performed after the start of the last infusion on Day 3 at different
      timepoints. Blood, urine and brochoalveolar lavage samples will be collected to determine
      RO7033877 concentrations. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3 days.

             as postmenopausal or surgically sterile

          -  Healthy status is defined by absence of evidence of any active or chronic disease
             following a detailed medical and surgical history, a complete physical examination
             including vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), hematology, blood chemistry,
             serology and urinalysis

          -  Nonsmokers

          -  Healthy male volunteers with female partners of childbearing potential must use
             adequate contraception methods

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of active chronic disease

          -  Regular consumption of drugs of abuse

          -  Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV), or hepatitis C
             (HCV)

          -  History of clinically significant hypersensitivity or allergic drug reactions

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities (e.g. cardiovascular, laboratory values)

          -  Abnormal blood pressure or vital signs

          -  Contraindications to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
