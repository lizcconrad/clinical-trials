  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a markedly higher prevalence of
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) than the general population. Dyslipidemia is considered a major
      cause of CVD in patients with CKD. Especially for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, the use
      of glucose as the osmotic agent in PD solutions has been associated with a variety of
      metabolic consequences ranging from acute hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia to dyslipidemia
      and weight gain. Among lipid abnormalities, hypertriglyceridemia is the most common in PD
      patients. A study showed that patients with high triglyceride levels were more
      insulin-resistant than those with normal triglyceride levels.

      Insulin resistant is associated with atherogenic response represented high plasma levels of
      monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in a large cohort of dialysis patients. Therefore, high
      triglyceride level may play an important role to CV outcome of PD patients. PD solution
      decreasing triglyceride levels is essential in PD patients.

      Icodextrin, a starch-derived high molecular weight glucose polymer was found to increase
      ultrafiltration compared to glucose solutions. Furthermore, a low peritoneal absorption of
      icodextrin, which is catabolized into maltose, considerably reduces caloric uptake.
      Therefore, icodextrin may have an additional favorable effect on triglyceride level.

      There are several studies regarding the effect of icodextrin on triglyceride level in PD
      patients. However, the outcomes are controversial, some studies showed no association between
      icodextrin and triglyceride change, even the others showed positive results but these also
      have study design limitations such as non-randomized study or secondary primary outcome. It
      is not clear about the effect of icodextrin on triglyceride especially in PD patients without
      diabetes.

      The investigators therefore want to conduct a randomized, cross-over, controlled multicenter
      trial comparing icodextrin solution and glucose solution in PD patients with and without
      diabetes, focusing on triglyceride change.
