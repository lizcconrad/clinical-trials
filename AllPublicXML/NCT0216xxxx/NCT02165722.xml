  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether or not the 4 Pillars Immunization Toolkit
      increases adolescent vaccination rates, particularly influenza and human papillomavirus (HPV)
      but also tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap), and meningococcal conjugate (MCV)
      vaccination rates. The vaccines are all FDA licensed vaccines and to be used according to
      national guidelines. The investigators will conduct a randomized cluster trial of this
      toolkit in diverse primary care practices with electronic medical records (EMRs).

      This intervention is a stratified randomized cluster trial in about 21 diverse primary care
      practices. These practices will be randomly assigned to be intervention or control sites to
      test this 4 Pillars Immunization Toolkit intervention package of evidence-based techniques
      tailored to their practice structure and culture; the specialties are split between pediatric
      and family medicine practices.

    <description>Behavioral: Pillar 1: Convenient Vaccination Services (e.g. use every visit [chronic and acute] as an opportunity to vaccinate; use express vaccination clinics and dedicated vaccination stations; use influenza vaccination as an opportunity to vaccinate for other vaccines).
Behavioral: Pillar 2: Patient Notification (e.g. use electronic reminders and social media for vaccination reminders; use physician recommendations).
Behavioral: Pillar 3: Enhanced Office Systems (e.g. implement Standing Order Programs; use EMR prompts; add vaccination status as a vital sign when rooming).
Behavioral: Pillar 4: Motivation (e.g. establish an office Immunization Champion to track goal progress, aided by research team feedback).</description>
