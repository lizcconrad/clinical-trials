      To evaluate the efficacy (based on mean change in Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory [CMAI]
      total score from baseline as the primary efficacy variable), dose-response, and safety of
      aripiprazole at 2, 3, and 6 mg/day in comparison with placebo in patients with agitation

      This trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      comparison trial to assess the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole in patients with agitation
      associated with Alzheimer's type dementia. Screening period is 4 weeks. Patients are randomly
      assigned to one of 4 groups, and treatment period is 10 weeks. Period of post-treatment
      observation is 30 days.
