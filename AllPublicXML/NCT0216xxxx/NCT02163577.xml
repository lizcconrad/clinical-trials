      The objectives of the study are to:

        -  Identify a dose and dosing regimen of KRN23, based on safety and PD effect, in pediatric
           XLH patients

        -  Establish the safety profile of KRN23 for the treatment of children with XLH including
           ectopic mineralization risk, cardiovascular effects, and immunogenicity profile

        -  Characterize the PK/PD profile of the KRN23 doses tested in the monthly (Q4) and
           biweekly (Q2) dose regimens in pediatric XLH patients

        -  Determine the PD effects of KRN23 treatment on markers of bone health in pediatric XLH
           patients

        -  Obtain a preliminary assessment of the clinical effects of KRN23 on bone health and
           deformity, muscle strength, and motor function

        -  Obtain a preliminary assessment of the effects of KRN23 on patient-reported outcomes,
           including pain, disability, and quality of life in pediatric XLH patients

        -  Evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of KRN23 Evaluate the long-term safety and
           efficacy of KRN23
