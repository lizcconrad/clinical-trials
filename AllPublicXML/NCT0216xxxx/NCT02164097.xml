    <textblock>
      This study will be with pediatric patients who have refractory/recurrent solid tumors. They
      will receive standard chemotherapy (ICE) and we are investigating if the addition of a new
      drug, ODSH, will help to increase the time of their platelet recovery after ICE
      chemotherapy.The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ODSH in
      pediatric patients receiving &quot;ICE&quot; chemotherapy.

             neuroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, retinoblastoma, and primitive
             neuroectodermal tumors. Histologic proof malignancy must have been available at the
             time of initial diagnosis.

          -  Age: 1-21

          -  Patients must have received standard first-line chemotherapy or other appropriate
             standard first line therapy for their malignancy.

          -  Patients must have radiologic or histologic evidence of recurrence

          -  Patients must have fully recovered from the toxic effects of the prior chemotherapy
             and must have an ANC &gt;1000/μL and a platelet count &gt;100,000/μL

          -  Performance status &gt; 60 from Lansky (age 1 to 16) or Karnofsky (age &gt; 16)

             normal limit).

          -  Parent or guardian able to provide informed consent and have signed an approved
             consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who, in the investigator's opinion, have extensive bone marrow involvement
             with tumor

          -  Presence of significant active infection or uncontrolled bleeding

          -  Renal insufficiency, which, in the opinion of the investigator, might adversely affect
             schedule and dose of therapy ICE chemotherapy. patients with creatinine levels ≥2
             mg/dl are not eligible

          -  Pre-existing liver disease , other than liver metastasis

          -  Use of recreational drugs within the prior month

          -  Known history of positive hepatitis B surface antigens or HCV antibodies

          -  Known history of positive test for HIV antibodies

          -  Patients receiving any form of anticoagulant therapy

          -  Presence of a known bleeding disorder or coagulation abnormality

          -  Treatment with any other investigational agent, or participation in another clinical
             trial within 28 days prior to study entry

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding patients

          -  Patient with childbearing potential not using adequate contraception

          -  Hemorrhage risk that requires maintenance of platelet counts at 50,000 or higher.

          -  Psychiatric or neurologic conditions that could compromise patient safety or
             compliance, or interfere with the ability of the patient or family to give proper
             informed consent.
