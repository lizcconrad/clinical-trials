      Hypothesis: A beverage with a resistant starch will blunt and sustain the post-prandial rise
      in blood glucose and insulin concentrations compared to beverage with maltodextrin (an easily
      digested carbohydrate).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  About two-thirds of adults in the United States are overweight or obese which can cause
           adverse health consequences for those individuals. Post-prandial hyperglycemia is one of
           these possible consequences and is associated with a higher risk for Type 2 Diabetes.
           Controlling hyperglycemia is important in the prevention of the onset of diabetes and
           obesity. Resistant starch is a dietary carbohydrate which is not completely digested in
           the gut and produces energy for the body to use. The investigators are interested in
           assessing the effects of resistant starch on postprandial blood glucose and insulin
           concentrations.

        -  Aim: To assess the effects of a resistant starch on post-prandial blood glucose and
           insulin concentrations.

        -  Hypothesis: A beverage with a resistant starch will blunt and sustain the post-prandial
           rise in blood glucose and insulin concentrations compared to a beverage with
           maltodextrin (an easily digested carbohydrate).

    <description>Each subject will complete 2 testing days (randomized and crossover design). On each of 2 test days, subjects will arrive at the Purdue Clinical Research Center after a 12-h fast and will consume a beverage containing resistant starch. The test beverage will be consumed along with a standard meal provided at the start of the test day. A second standard meal that does not contain the beverage will be consumed four hours later. Below is what will be included in the test bar.</description>
