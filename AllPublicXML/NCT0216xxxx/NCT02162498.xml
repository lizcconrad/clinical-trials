  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2010 revised WHO recommendations to provide antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis or treatment
      to mothers or infants during the breastfeeding period indicate a paradigm shift in prevention
      of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT); care; and treatment programming. Yet despite South
      Africa's adoption of this guidance, myriad challenges currently exist. Confusion in the
      public health care system related to mixed messaging around safe infant feeding and the
      provision of—and now withdrawal of—free formula milk have made adherence to exclusive
      breastfeeding a challenge in South Africa. Cultural, social, and psychological factors
      influence the ability of women to follow PMTCT guidelines, which include exclusive
      breastfeeding for six months, adherence to ARV prophylaxis or treatment, and early infant
      diagnosis. Facility-based interventions alone are often inadequate to effect sustained
      behavioral changes in the face of multiple contextual factors. Community- and home-based
      support are needed, yet cost and systems constraints make these infeasible in many PMTCT
      programs. Some preliminary pilot data suggests that a feeding buddy strategy could fill this
      gap and provide a home-based support system for the mother. The feeding buddy, who is
      selected by an HIV-positive pregnant woman to support her in overcoming sociocultural
      challenges to adhering to various aspects of PMTCT programs, is not an employed health care
      worker, but rather an individual known to the mother, making the intervention extremely
      cost-effective, and requiring minimal resources to implement. In the Uthungulu District of
      KZN the Programme for Appropriate Technologies in Health (PATH) is implementing a programme
      (Window of Opportunity-WinOp) of improving health of mothers and infants, and the feeding
      buddy strategy is one of the strategies included in this overall package of care. While this
      strategy has been encouraged by the South African Department of Health, it has not previously
      been implemented nor obviously evaluated. In order to scale-up such a programme and justify
      the human resource costs, it is vital that such a programme be evaluated.

      The goal of this proposed research study is therefore to evaluate the effect of the feeding
      buddy strategy to support mothers to adhere to PMTCT recommendations.

      The investigators hypothesize that mothers who choose a feeding buddy will have increased
      rates of exclusive breastfeeding and adherence to ARV prophylaxis or treatment, as well as
      improved rates of early infant diagnosis and stigma reduction.

      This evaluation will provide valuable information to the Department of Health in terms of
      choosing best practice models for promoting HIV-free infant survival and optimum health of
      infants in resource limited settings. The project plans to employ a cluster randomized
      intervention design and will include 300 mothers and their infants as well as the 300 buddies
      in the intervention group, as well as 300 mothers in the control group. All participants will
      be part of the WinOp feeding buddy intervention programme.

    <measure>To determine the effect of a feeding buddy on adherence to exclusive breastfeeding.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>We hypothesize that mothers who choose a feeding buddy to provide enhanced support will have increased rates of initiation and duration of exclusive breastfeeding.
Exclusive breastfeeding: Defined as no other food or drink, not even water, apart from breast milk (including expressed breast milk) with the exception of drops or syrups consisting of vitamins, mineral supplements or medicines (WHO/UNICEF. Infant and young child feeding counselling: an integrated course. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2006), measured by recall prior to each visit; from this aggregate data number of months engaged in EBF will be calculated.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the effect of a feeding buddy on adherence to ARV prophylaxis or ART regimens.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>We hypothesize that mothers who choose a feeding buddy to provide enhanced support will have increased rates of adherence to ARV prophylaxis or ART regimens.
Adherence to ARV: Three separate outcomes will be examined, including adherence to:
ARV prophylaxis to prevent MTCT among HIV+ mothers who do not have indications for ARV treatment
ARV treatment of HIV+ mothers when indicated for their own health
ARV prophylaxis of infant
Adherence to ARV in each case defined as taking more than 95% of prescribed doses.71 Adherence will be assessed through:
Medical records at each clinic visit (e.g., pill counts) &amp;
Self-report at study visits Dose adherence is measured as number of prescribed doses per drug per day divided by the self-reported number of missed doses on each of the past four days. In addition, an adherence index 71 is based on dosing, timing and special instructions questions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the effect of a feeding buddy on adherence to infant HIV testing at 6 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>We hypothesize that mothers who choose a feeding buddy to provide enhanced support will have increased rates of having their infant tested for HIV at 6 weeks.
Early infant HIV diagnosis: This will be examined through date of infant HIV PCR test as indicated through recall and medical record.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the effect of a feeding buddy on disclosure and stigma.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>We hypothesize that mothers who choose a feeding buddy will have increased rates of disclosure and decreased effect from stigma around HIV status.
Impact on stigma and disclosure: This will be measured through descriptive analysis of perceived and enacted stigma associated with being HIV.
Exposure: The exposure of interest is choosing a feeding buddy and level of exposure to the feeding buddy, the latter providing a dose-response measure of support. Exposure will be measured as having selected a buddy who has attended an orientation session (yes/no); number of visits to antenatal and postnatal visits accompanied by the feeding buddy; and the number, frequency, and type (in-person, telephone) of contacts between mother and buddy.</description>
