  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the efficacy of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol
      (FF/UMEC/VI) to reduce the annual rate of moderate and severe exacerbations compared with
      dual therapy of FF/VI or UMEC/VI in subjects with COPD. Published studies which assessed the
      use of an 'open' triple therapy (use of Inhaled Corticosteroid [ICS]/ Long-acting Muscarinic
      Receptor Antagonists [LAMA])/ Long Acting Beta-Agonist [LABA] delivered via multiple
      inhalers) in moderate-severe COPD patients, reported improvements in lung function, Health
      Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), hospitalization rates and rescue medication use, compared to
      dual therapy (ICS/LABA) or LAMA alone. These studies have also shown similar safety profile
      with dual or monotherapy doses for periods of up to one year. Given the clinical experience
      with FF, UMEC and VI, and that the associated risks with these compounds are anticipated from
      their known pharmacology, the potential benefit of a new therapy option in patients with
      moderate to severe COPD supports the further development of the closed triple combination
      (delivered via one inhaler). In the current study subjects meeting all inclusion/exclusion
      criteria will complete 2-week run-in period; 52 week treatment period and a 1-week safety
      follow-up period. Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of the following double-blind
      treatment groups FF/UMEC/VI 100 micrograms (mcg)/62.5 mcg/25 mcg once daily (QD), FF/VI 100
      mcg/25 mcg QD, or UMEC/VI 62.5 mcg/25 mcg QD

             For this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the
             investigator's/designee's medical examination of the subject or review of the
             subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview
             with the subject or from the subject's medical records. Double barrier method: condom
             and an occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal
             agent (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository)

          -  COPD Diagnosis: An established clinical history of COPD in accordance with the
             definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society

          -  Smoking History: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette
             smoking of &gt;=10 pack-years at screening (visit 1) [number of pack years = (number of
             cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years smoked (e.g., 20 cigarettes per day for 10
             years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years)]. Previous smokers are defined as those
             who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Note: Pipe and/or
             cigar use cannot be used to calculate pack-year history

             predicted will be calculated using the European Respiratory Society Global Lung
             Function Initiative reference equations. Note: A documented history of a COPD
             exacerbation (e.g., medical record verification) is a medical record of worsening COPD
             symptoms that required systemic/oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics (for a
             moderate exacerbation) or hospitalization (for a severe exacerbation). Prior use of
             antibiotics alone does not qualify as an exacerbation history unless the use was
             associated with treatment of worsening symptoms of COPD, such as increased dyspnea,
             sputum volume, or sputum purulence (color). Subject verbal reports are not acceptable

             during the study

          -  Asthma: Subjects with a current diagnosis of asthma. (Subjects with a prior history of
             asthma are eligible if they have a current diagnosis of COPD)

          -  Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency: Subjects with Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency as the
             underlying cause of COPD

          -  Other respiratory disorders: Subjects with active tuberculosis, lung cancer,
             significant bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, lung fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension,
             interstitial lung diseases or other active pulmonary diseases

          -  Lung resection: Subjects with lung volume reduction surgery within the 12 months prior
             to Screening

          -  Risk Factors for Pneumonia: immune suppression (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus
             [HIV], Lupus) or other risk factors for pneumonia (e.g. neurological disorders
             affecting control of the upper airway, such as Parkinson's Disease, Myasthenia
             Gravis). Patients at potentially high risk (e.g. very low BMI, severely malnourished,
             or very low FEV1) will only be included at the discretion of the Investigator

          -  Pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation that has not resolved at least
             14 days prior to Screening and at least 30 days following the last dose of
             oral/systemic corticosteroids (if applicable). In addition, any subject that
             experiences pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation during the run-in
             period will be excluded

          -  Other Respiratory tract infections that have not resolved at least 7 days prior to
             screening

             of pneumonia or a clinically significant abnormality not believed to be due to the
             presence of COPD, or another condition that would hinder the ability to detect an
             infiltrate on CXR (e.g. significant cardiomegaly, pleural effusion or scarring). All
             subjects will have a chest x-ray at Screening Visit 1 (or historical radiograph or
             computerised tomography (CT) scan obtained within 3 months prior to screening) that
             will be over-read by a central vendor. Note: Subjects who have experienced pneumonia
             and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation within 3 months of screening must provide
             a post pneumonia/exacerbation chest x-ray to be over-read by the central vendor or
             have a chest x-ray conducted at screening. For sites in Germany: If a chest x-ray (or
             CT scan) within 3 months prior to Screening (Visit 1) is not available, approval to
             conduct a diagnostic chest x-ray will need to be obtained from the Federal Office for
             Radiation Protection (Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz [BfS])

          -  Other diseases/abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of
             clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic,
             immunological, gastrointestinal, urogenital, nervous system, musculoskeletal, skin,
             sensory, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or
             hematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any
             disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the safety of the subject
             at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis
             if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study

          -  Unstable liver disease as defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy,
             coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia, esophageal or gastric varices or persistent jaundice,
             cirrhosis, known biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or
             asymptomatic gallstones).

             in the last 3 months; New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV Heart failure

          -  Abnormal and clinically significant 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) finding:
             Investigators will be provided with ECG reviews conducted by a centralized independent
             cardiologist to assist in evaluation of subject eligibility. The Principal
             Investigator will determine the clinical significance of each abnormal ECG finding in
             relation to the subject's medical history and exclude subjects who would be at undue
             risk by participating in the trial. An abnormal and clinically significant finding
             that would preclude a subject from entering the trial is defined as a 12-lead tracing
             that is interpreted as, but not limited to, any of the following: atrial fibrillation
             (AF) with rapid ventricular rate &gt;120 beats per minute); sustained or nonsustained
             ventricular tachycardia (VT); Second degree heart block Mobitz type II and third
             degree heart block (unless pacemaker or defibrillator had been inserted); QT interval

             hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that, in the opinion of the Investigator
             contraindicates study participation

          -  Cancer: Subjects with carcinoma that has not been in complete remission for at least 5
             years. Subjects who have had carcinoma in situ of the cervix, squamous cell carcinoma
             and basal cell carcinoma of the skin would not be excluded based on the 5 year waiting
             period if the subject has been considered cured by treatment

          -  Oxygen therapy: Use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) described as resting oxygen

             Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program within 4 weeks prior to Screening or subjects who
             plan to enter the acute phase of a Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program during the study.
             Subjects who are in the maintenance phase of a Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program are
             not excluded

          -  Drug/alcohol abuse: Subjects with a known or suspected history of alcohol or drug
             abuse within the last 2 years

          -  Non-compliance: Subjects at risk of non-compliance, or unable to comply with the study
             procedures. Any infirmity, disability, or geographic location that would limit
