  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study. The purpose of this study is to determine what is the best dose of
      the study drug BYL719 in combination with the study drug LJM716 and traztuzumab (Herceptin®).
      The study will test the safety of the combination of these three drugs, and to find out the
      effects, good and/or bad, that these three drugs have on the patient and breast cancer.

    <description>The MTD is defined as per the Continual Reassessment Method.

    <description>A treatment cycle will consist of 28 days. Treatment doses for trastuzumab and LJM716 will be fixed at trastuzumab 2mg/kg weekly, and LJM716 20mg/kg weekly. The exception to this is if dose de-escalation results in treatment of patients at dose level 1, where LJM will be dosed at 10mg/kg weekly. On Arm A, BYL719 was administered orally once daily continuously at one of 5 dosing levels, beginning with dose level 3, 250mg orally daily. On Arm B, BYL719 will be administered orally once daily during 4 of 7 days in a week, at one of 5 dosing levels, beginning with dose level 3, 250mg orally daily. This means BYL719 will be given to patients on Arm B during days 1-4, 8-11, 15-18, and 22-25 of each cycle. The dose-finding phase will follow a Continuous Reassessment Methods (CRM) phase I biostatistical design.</description>

             caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository

        Note: Post-menopausal women are allowed to participate in this study. Women are considered
        post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they are:

          -  Aged ≥60;

          -  or aged &lt; 60 and have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous, in the absence of
             chemotherapy, tamoxifen, toremifene, or ovarian suppression) amenorrhea with and FSH
             and estradiol in the postmenopausal range (serum FSH &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt;10
             pg/mL or according to the postmenopausal range definition for the local laboratory
             involved)

          -  or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) For women
             with therapy-induced amenorrhea, oophorectomy or serial measurements of FSH and/or
             estradiol are needed to ensure postmenopausal status. NOTE: Ovarian radiation or
             treatment with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonist (goserelin
             acetate or leuprolide acetate) is not permitted for induction of ovarian suppression.
