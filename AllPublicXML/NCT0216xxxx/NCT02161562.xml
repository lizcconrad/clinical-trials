    <textblock>
      This trial will assess the efficacy of optimized re-treatment therapy with omalizumab (150mg
      or 300mg) after relapse, in patients with Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria who were clinically
      well-controlled following their first course of treatment with omalizumab (150mg or 300mg).

      Will also assess the benefit of uptitrating to 300mg dose those patients who are not
      well-controlled following their first course of treatment with omalizumab 150mg.

          -  Patients with evidence of parasitic infection

          -  Patients with a history of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal
