  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thioredoxin reductase plays an critical role in lung cancer patients, in vitro study showed
      that, ethaselen, specific inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase, could inhibit lung cancer cell
      growth and induce apoptosis. In China, phase 1 clinical trials of ethaselen showed that 1200
      mg dose ethaselen could be well tolerated, in pre-clinical study we found that, approximately
      50% non-small cell lung cancers harbored high thioredoxin reductase expression(IHC result ++
      or +++), phase 1a/b of ethaselen had finished in 2008, the result showed that 1200mg
      ethaselen per day was safety and tolerated by Chinese malignant tumor patients.In
      pre-clinical research, our group found that, elevated of thioredoxin reductase activity was
      associated with the expression of thioredoxin reductase tested by immunohistochemistry, which
      means high expression of this enzyme may be a favourite predicted factor of ethaselen, the
      specific inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase.

      This phase 1c study will include patients pathologic diagnosis advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer who had received more than two lines standard treatment, according to NCCN Non-small
      cell lung cancer guideline, there were no standard treatment scheme for these patients.
      Approximately 40 patients will be included in the study, patients will received oral
      ethaselen dispersible tablet, 600 mg bid dose, primary endpoint of this study is 6 week
      disease control rate(DCR, CR+PR+SD), secondary endpoints include progression free
      survival(PFS), overall survival(OS), quality of life(QOL) and drug safety.
