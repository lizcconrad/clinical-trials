  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation, Phase 1 study of oral LGH447 in Japanese
      patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma for which no standard effective
      treatment options exist.

      The study consists of a dose escalation part to estimate the maximum tolerated dose and/or
      the recommended dose for expansion and a dose expansion part to further assess safety and
      preliminary anti-cancer activity of LGH447 at the maximum tolerated dose and/or the
      recommended dose for expansion.
