  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As human aging, 50% of women will be faced with the threat of cancer, especially
      gynecological malignancies. Ovarian, cervical and endometrial cancer are three major
      gynecological malignancies. In recent years, the incidence of cervical cancer, especially in
      young women significantly increased; ovarian cancer, although the incidence of malignant
      tumors in the female reproductive system ranked second, but its mortality rate already in the
      first place; and the morbidity and mortality of endometrial cancer is also rising.

      The key to gynecologic malignancies is how to early diagnose and treat. With the advancement
      of science and technology, such as molecular biology techniques widely used in the medical
      field, early diagnosis, proper treatment and other aspects in gynecologic malignancies is
      expected to achieve a breakthrough. Genome-wide scan strategy, making the whole genome for
      linkage analysis for gynecological malignancies possible. Therefore, the investigators intend
      to find specific mutations to provide a new early screening approach for gynecological
      malignancies, which in later result in early diagnosis and specific treatment for
      gynecological malignant tumors.
