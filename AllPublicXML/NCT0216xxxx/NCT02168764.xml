             3rd edition (beta version), criterion 3.1.2.

          -  Subject reports a minimum of 4 cluster attacks per week on the side of their dominant
             headache laterality. Subjects who report more than 8 attacks per day or attack
             duration of less than 30 minutes (untreated or unsuccessfully treated) must have been
             tested to rule out other forms of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias.

          -  Both subject and physician judge previously or currently used preventive and/or acute
             cluster headache treatment to be inadequate.

          -  Subject is able to distinguish cluster attacks from other headaches (i.e., migraine,
             tension-type headaches).

          -  Subject agrees to not use therapy involving TENS or magnetic field treatment while the
             Neurostimulator is implanted.

          -  Subject agrees to not participate in supplemental or alternative therapy, including
             acupuncture and spinal manipulation, from Study Enrollment through the end of the
             Experimental Period of the study.

          -  Subject agrees to maintain current preventive headache medication regimens (no change
             in type, frequency, or dose) - except to manage tolerability - from Study Enrollment
             through the Experimental Period of the study.

          -  Subject agrees not to use any acute medications, including oxygen therapy, for their
             treatable cluster attacks during the Experimental Period until after they have used
             SPG stimulation therapy for at least 15 minutes.

          -  Subject has had a dental examination and cleaning in the past six (6) months.

          -  Subject has the ability to read and comprehend, and to reliably record information as
             required by the Protocol.

          -  Subject is able to provide written informed consent prior to participation in the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject's overall health, age and/or comorbidities place subject at high risk for
             complications from surgery and/or general anesthesia.

          -  Subject has had a change in type, dosage or dose frequency of preventive headache
             medications &lt; one (1) month prior to study enrollment

          -  Subject has been diagnosed with any other form of Trigeminal Autonomic Cephalalgias
             (e.g., paroxysmal hemicrania, SUNCT, etc.) or has a history of trigeminal neuralgia.

          -  Subject has undergone facial surgery in the area of the pterygopalatine fossa or
             zygomaticomaxillary buttress ipsilateral to the planned implant site that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, may lead to an inability to properly implant the
             Neurostimulator.

          -  Subject currently has an active oral or dental abscess or an active maxillary sinus
             infection based on present symptoms.

          -  Subject has been treated with therapeutic radiation to the facial region.

          -  Subject has been diagnosed with any major infectious processes such as osteomyelitis,
             or primary or secondary malignancies involving the face that have been active or
             required treatment in the past six (6) months.

          -  Subject has other significant pain problem(s) that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, might confound the study assessments.

          -  Subject is a woman of childbearing potential who is pregnant, nursing, or not using
             contraception.

          -  Subject is currently participating or has participated in the last month in another
             clinical study in which the subject has, is, or will be exposed to an investigational
             or non-investigational drug or device.

          -  Subject has demonstrated or is believed to be at risk of non-compliance with study
             procedures (e.g., for completing the diary or maintaining a stable headache medicine
             regimen or returning for required follow-up visits).

          -  Subject is at risk of being unable to complete at least 1 year of follow-up (e.g., has
             plans to relocate).

          -  Subject has had previous lesional radio-frequency (RF) ablation, balloon compression,
             gamma knife, or glycerol treatments of the ipsilateral sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG),
             trigeminal ganglion or any branch of the trigeminal nerve.

          -  Subject has had blocks or non-lesional pulsed RF of the ipsilateral SPG in the last
             three (3) months.

          -  Subject's pterygomaxillary fissure is less than 1.2 mm in width at the level of the
             vidian canal, as determined by CT scan.

          -  Subject has undergone onabotulinumtoxinA injections of the head and/or neck or has had
             an occipital nerve block in the last three (3) months.

          -  Subject has or requires an active implanted medical device, such as a

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator, the subject currently meets criteria as defined by
             the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) for an active
             major depressive episode or for active significant psychiatric disorders, including
             dementia, uncontrolled general anxiety disorder, psychotic disorders or uncontrolled
             bipolar disorder. Exclusion criteria also include: active psychosis, untreated severe
             anxiety disorder, homicidal ideation, significant Axis II disorders and significant

          -  Subject may be, in the opinion of the Investigator, at greater risk of infection
             (e.g., subjects with diabetes, taking steroids, with gingivitis/periodontitis,
             malnutrition or anorexia/bulimia) or at higher risk of harm from infections.

          -  Subject is currently using a tobacco cessation regimen (e.g. Wellbutrin, Zyban,
             Aplenzin, etc.).
