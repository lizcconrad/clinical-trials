  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a prospective, observational study to examine the ECG
      waveforms captured by the new medical device as compared to a traditional Holter monitor for
      subsequent use in visual diagnoses of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias as well as cardiac
      impulse and/or conduction disorders by qualified clinicians.

      The hypothesis is that this new medical device prototype is non-inferior to traditional
      Holter monitoring for capturing ECG waveforms that can be visually assessed for atrial and
      ventricular arrhythmias as well as disorders of cardiac impulse formation and/or conduction.
