  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the safety and efficacy profiles of Tazarotene Cream, 0.1 % to the reference
      listed drug Tazorac® (tazarotene) Cream, 0.1 % in order to demonstrate bioequivalence, and to
      demonstrate superiority of the 2 active creams over that of the cream vehicle (placebo) in
      the treatment of acne vulgaris.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, double-blind study of
      Tazarotene Cream, 0.1% in subjects with acne vulgaris. Subjects will be assigned in a 1:1:1
      ratio to test product, reference product, or cream vehicle. Subjects will be admitted into
      the study only after written informed consent has been obtained and all of the inclusion and
      none of the exclusion criteria have been met. Randomized subjects will apply the study
      medication once daily in the evening for 12 weeks (84 days).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of equivalence of the test product to the reference product</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The primary evaluation of equivalence will be through 2-sided 90% confidence intervals (CIs) about the ratio in mean percent reduction from baseline to Visit 4/Week 12 in the number of inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions, respectively, of the test product to the reference product. These evaluations are based on a normal distribution adjusted for the effects of treatment group and site.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of superiority</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The primary evaluation of superiority will be conducted using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model on the mean percent reduction in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions, respectively, with treatment and site as fixed effects. Contrasts will be performed to compare each active treatment with the vehicle cream.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects with a clinical response of &quot;success&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary efficacy endpoint will include the proportion of subjects with a clinical response of &quot;success&quot; at Visit 4/ Week 12. Success is defined as an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score that is at least 2 grades less than the baseline assessment.</description>

          3. Have a clinical diagnosis of acne vulgaris, defined as having all of the following:

               1. On the face, ≥ 20 inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules)

               2. On the face, ≥ 25 non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones)

               3. On the face, ≤ 2 nodulocystic lesions (nodules and cysts)

               4. Baseline IGA of acne severity grade 2, 3, or 4

          4. Be in general good health and free from any clinically significant disease other than
             acne vulgaris that might interfere with the study evaluations.

          5. Be willing to refrain from use of all other topical acne medications or antibiotics
             during the 12-week treatment period.

          6. Be willing and able to understand and comply with the requirements of the study, apply
             the study medication as instructed, return for the required treatment period visits,
             comply with therapy prohibitions, and be able to complete the study.

          7. Female subjects of childbearing potential (excluding women who are surgically
             sterilized or postmenopausal for at least 2 years) must have a negative urine
             pregnancy test (with a minimum sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL for human chorionic
             gonadotropin [hCG], begin treatment during a normal menstrual period and must agree to
