  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective trial we aim to investigate the intra-individual and inter-individual
      variance in secondary hyperalgesia following pain elicited by the experimental pain model:
      Brief Thermal Sensitization.

      Furthermore we wish to investigate how precise the psychological tests, Pain Catastrophizing
      Scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale predict the size of the area of secondary
      hyperalgesia.
