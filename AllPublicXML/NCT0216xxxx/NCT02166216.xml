    <textblock>
      Competitions such as marathon running and endurance cycling events are increasingly popular
      and represent an important motivation for sustaining training among leisure-time athletes.
      However, there is a concern that prolonged, high-intensity exercise may increase the risk of
      cardiovascular (CV) events. Following prolonged high-intensity exercise there is an increase
      in levels of circulating markers of myocardial damage such as Troponin I (TnI). The precise
      cause and clinical significance of this TnI increase is unknown.

        -  The primary objective of this study was to determine the relationship between
           high-sensitive cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) levels and coronary artery disease and
           cardiovascular outcomes in 1000 presumably healthy leisure sport athletes that
           participated in a 91 km long, high intensity endurance cycling competition.

        -  The secondary objective was to assess the relationship between other CV risk factors,
           fitness level and outcomes following high intensity endurance cycling competition in the
           same population.

      The NEEDED observational study was designed to be performed in two phases:

      Phase 1 (NEEDED 2013) was a pilot study targeting 100 subjects to test the logistics and
      identify the optimal blood sampling time points following the race. A total of 97 subjects
      completed the pilot phase in June 2013.

      Phase 2 (NEEDED 2014) aim to recruit another 1000 subjects from the participants of the race
      in June 2014.

      The study populations will be followed for cardiovascular events for up to 20 years following
      the baseline blood samples.

      The results from the two phases will be pooled for the main statistical analyses.

    <description>Blood will be drawn at 24 hours prior to, and at 3 and 24 hours following a 91 km long mountain bike race. The level of high sensitive TnI will be analyzed at all time-points. All study participants will be followed-up for 30 days, and all events will be recorded. Additionally, based on data from the NEEDED 2013 pilot study all participants with an increase in high sensitive cTni &gt; 200 ng/l within 24 hours following the cycling competition will be assessed by CT coronary angiography within the first week following the race to determine the presence of significant coronary artery disease in order to detect subclinical coronary artery disease.</description>
