  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of dual sentinel node staining method using
      mixture of indocyanine green(ICG) and radioisotope (RI) in breast cancer patients who receive
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      Over the past few years, several studies have found using methylene blue, isosulfan blue,
      indocyanine green or radioisotope alone by detection method had several disadvantages.

      In this study we expects using mixture of indocyanine green (ICG) with radioisotope (RI) has
      potential to improve sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in breast cancer patients who receive
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      -  5 patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cN1-cN2 or cT2 on TNM staging

        -  sentinel lymph node biopsy(SLNB) by sentinel lymph node staining method using mixture of
           indocyanine green (ICG) with radioisotope (RI).

        -  indocyanine green (ICG) penetrates human tissue to depths of several millimeters to 2cm,
           and the fluorescence can be detected percutaneously in real time.

        -  using RI only has several disadvantages such as invisibility,interference. RI only
           detect sound or confirm numerical value through gamma probe.

        -  ICG can be visualized with a fluorescence imaging system

        -  confirm Identification rate of sentinal lymph node biopsy, and duration of sentinel
           lymph node biopsy
