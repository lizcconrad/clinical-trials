    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm study designed to collect clinical data to
      support the safety and effectiveness of BioFoam used as a surgical adjunct to anastomotic
      hemostasis following cardiovascular surgery.

      The overall objective of this clinical study is to collect clinical data supporting the
      safety and effectiveness of BioFoam used as a surgical adjunct to anastomotic hemostasis
      following cardiovascular surgery. This study is intended as a post-market surveillance
      (follow-up) study.

        Patients undergoing cardiac or cardiovascular procedures, including, but not limited to:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is undergoing an elective cardiac or cardiovascular procedure;

          -  Subject is willing and able to give prior written informed consent for investigation
             participation; and

          -  Subject is &gt; 18 years of age.

        Intraoperative inclusion criteria include:

        • Subject that requires the use of an adjunctive surgical hemostatic agent to the repair
        site to control generalized oozing following standard repair procedures (such as sutures
        and staples).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Subject with known hypersensitivity to albumin, bovine products, or glutaraldehyde;

               -  Subject with active infection (either systemic or in the repair region);

               -  Subject whose pathology or underlying disease state makes them an unacceptable
                  candidate for a clinical investigation in the opinion of the Investigator;

               -  Subject diagnosed with a coagulation disorder;

               -  Subject with abnormal calcium metabolism (e.g., chronic renal failure,
                  hyperparathyroidism);

               -  Subject whose life expectancy is less than that required for the prescribed
                  follow-up duration;

               -  Subject who is pregnant, planning on becoming pregnant during the follow-up
                  period, or actively breast-feeding; or

               -  Subject who is immunocompromised.

        Intraoperative exclusion criteria include:

        • Any major intraoperative bleeding incidences (i.e., American College of Surgeons Advanced
        Trauma Life Support Class II, III, or IV Hemorrhage).
