      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety of the triple COG schema with the monoclonal
      antibody Dinutuximab + cytokines (GM-CSF and IL2) and isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid, or
      RA) in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.

      Assess toxicity and safety of subcutaneous GM-CSF and iv IL-2 in enhancing
      Dinutuximab-mediated ablation of Bone Marrow (BM) disease in patients with high-risk
      neuroblastoma who have achieved a Complete Response or Very Good Partial Response of the
      macroscopic disease in the investigators institution.

      Assess response of minimal residual disease (MRD) of the anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody
      Dinutuximab combined with granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-2
      in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma (NB). More precisely, to apply real-time
      quantitative RT-PCR to test the hypothesis that minimal residual disease content of BM after
      the first treatments with dinutuximab/GM-CSF has significant prognostic impact on
      relapse-free survival.

    <description>Dinutuximab will be administered at 17.5 mg/m2/day for 4 days up to 5 courses. Each dose should be infused IV over approximately 10 hours.
Immunotherapy (sargramostim + isotretinoin + interleukin2) Sargramostim will be administered at 250 micrograms/m2/d by subcutaneous (SC) injection daily from Day 0 through 13 (daily with the infusion of Dinutuximab and for 3 days before and 7 days afterward).
Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid, or RA) (160mg/m2/day or 5.33mg/kg/day if &lt; 12kg) PO divided into 2 doses daily x 14 days.
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) 3 MIU/m2/day will be given by continuous infusion for 4 days during the first week of each course 2 and 4 given on Days 0 - 3</description>

    <description>Patients will receive 5 courses of Dinutuximab + GM-CSF + IL2 at intervals of 28 days for all courses. In addition, all patients will receive isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid, or RA) at 160 mg/m2/dose twice a day for 14 days every 28 days, for 6 courses.
Patients come off study if progressive disease develops at any time after cycle 1 or life-threatening grade 4 toxicity occurs clearly attributable to Immunotherapy.</description>

          1. Diagnosis of neuroblastoma as defined by international criteria by histopathology or
             bone marrow metastases. Patients age must be less than 18 years at the time of initial
             diagnosis.
