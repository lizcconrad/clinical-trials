  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance and low vitamin D
      status. Vitamin D has traditionally been known to involve in calcium homeostasis and prevent
      rickets; however, recently it has been recognized to inversely associate with many
      non-skeletal diseases and conditions including obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In vitro
      studies have demonstrated that vitamin D possesses anti-inflammatory properties. It remains
      unknown if the effect of vitamin D on insulin sensitivity is mediated by suppressing
      inflammation in human adipose tissues. The main objective of this study was to assess the
      association between vitamin D and insulin sensitivity and inflammation in morbidly obese
      pre-menopausal women. Obese women (n=76) were recruited from the University of Illinois at
      Chicago (UIC) Nutrition and Wellness Center and the UIC medical center bariatric surgery
      clinics. Insulin sensitivity/resistance was assessed by (1) Oral glucose insulin sensitivity
      (OGIS) index, derived from dynamic oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and (2) Homeostasis
      model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), calculated from fasting steady-state glucose and
      insulin. Also, to better understand the potential mechanism and the role circulating vitamin
      D (25OHD) plays in adipose tissue inflammation, we assessed messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)
      expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and various inflammatory genes in visceral (VAT) and
      subcutaneous adipose tissues (SAT) of obese women that underwent a restrictive bariatric
      procedure. We hypothesized that subjects with higher serum vitamin D levels would be less
      inflamed and more insulin sensitive and have increased expression of VDR and pro-inflammatory
      markers compared to those with lower serum vitamin D levels.
