      1. Target disease : Patients with combined dyslipidemia with adequately controlled LDL-C
           but inadequately controlled triglyceride level by atorvastatin monotherapy

        2. Study objective : The objective of this study is to demonstrate that Pravafenix Cap. is
           clinically superior to atorvastatin by evaluating a percent change in Non-HDL-C in each
           group after 8 weeks treatment with atorvastatin or Pravafenix Cap. (pravastatin
           sodium/fenofibrate) in patients with adequately controlled LDL-C but inadequately
           controlled triglyceride level by atorvastatin monotherapy in a multicenter, randomized,
           double blind setting.

        3. Phase and design : A multicenter, double blind, randomized, active controlled,
           parallel-design, Phase 3 study

        4. Duration of study : 12 months from the IRB approval date

        5. Duration of administration : 4-week single blind run-in period plus 8-week double blind
           treatment period

      This study is to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Pravastatin/Fenofibrate Complex in
      Patients With Combined Dyslipidemia With Adequately Controlled LDL-C But Inadequately
      Controlled Triglyceride Level by Atorvastatin Monotherapy. After administrating the
      atorvastatin or Pravafenix Cap. (pravastatin sodium/fenofibrate) for 8 weeks, evaluate the
      variation of the Non-HDL-C for each arm. Ultimatly verificaite the Pravafenix Cap.
      (pravastatin sodium/fenofibrate) have better effects than atorvastatin.
