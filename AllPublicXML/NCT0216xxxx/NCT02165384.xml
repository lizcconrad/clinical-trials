      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the TTI device for
      the placement of ear tubes in patients undergoing a tympanostomy tube placement procedure.The
      trial will be a multi-site, prospective, treatment only study of the Preceptis ear tube
      introducer . Patients will already have a scheduled tympanostomy procedure. Enrollment in the
      study at each site will begin after receipt of Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval.
      Patients will be considered enrolled at the time the informed consent document is signed. A
      maximum of two hundred fifty (250) subjects will be included in the study at up to 5 sites.

    <description>Success will be determined at the end of each ear tube procedure, by whether or not the TTS was used to make the incision in the tympanic membrane and to deploy the ear tube.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Scheduled to undergo tympanostomy tube insertion.

          2. At least 6 months old.

          3. Subject is able and willing to comply with follow-up requirements.

          4. Signed Informed Consent, Parental Consent Form, or Child Assent Form as applicable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator may place the subject at greater
             risk (e.g., pregnancy)

          2. Significantly atrophic tympanic membrane.

          3. Significantly atelectatic tympanic membrane. For example, the tympanic membrane is in
             contact with the promontory of the cochlea.

          4. Anatomy precludes sufficient visualization and access to the tympanic membrane.
