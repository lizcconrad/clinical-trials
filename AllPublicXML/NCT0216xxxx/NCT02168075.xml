  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mannitol is widely used in patients with elevated intracranial pressure. In neurosurgical
      field, especially in large size or with brain edema, it is necessary to decrease brain volume
      to facilitate surgical approach. In general, 0.25 -1.5g of mannitol per kilogram has been
      known to decrease ICP effectively. But there are some debates in regard to appropriate dose
      of mannitol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous meta-analysis reported that mannitol has dose-response relationship with
      intracranial pressure. Another study of Sorani showed dose-response relationship between
      mannitol and intracranial pressure (ICP) in traumatic brain injury patients.

      In this study, authors would investigate that mannitol increments can provide more brain
      relaxation in patients undergoing craniotomy for supratentorial brain tumor removal.

    <description>Brain relaxation was assessed immediately after opening of the dura on a scale range from 1 to 4 (1=bulging brain, 2=firm brain, 3-satisfactorily relaxed, 4=perfectly relaxed) by neurosurgeon who is blinded to dose of mannitol.
3 and 4 scale means brain relaxed. We would analyse if the success proportion of brain relaxation increase according to the mannitol increment 0.25g/kg, 0.5g/kg, 1.0g/kg and 1.5g/kg using Cochran-Armitage trend test.</description>
