    <textblock>
      In this randomized controlled study, the investigators compare two classes of behavioral
      approaches to change habits and health outcomes with an application to dental health:
      cognitive vs. behavioral financial incentives. Under cognitive incentives subjects are paid
      to correctly answer health-related quizzes. Under behavioral incentives subjects earn money
      for making healthy choices. The investigators apply these incentives to toothbrushing, a
      daily health-related behavior critical to the prevention of dental caries and periodontal
      disease, two high-burden conditions among US adults.
