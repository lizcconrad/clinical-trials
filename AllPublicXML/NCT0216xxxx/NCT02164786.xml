      Acute severe disease is a major public health challenge that often affects young adults.In
      past decade, there are lot of new techniques have been developed that aim to improve the
      outcome of acute severe disease, But few of these works success. According to recently
      studies, the mortality of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome（MODS) that is the major
      cause of death in patients who suffering from acute severe disease, is not improved. On the
      contrary, if MODS be predicted in early stage of acute severe disease, the death can be
      prevented. Because acute severe disease poses complex injury that involves multiple
      pathological processes, understanding the cellular and metabolic network malfunction during
      acute severe disease is crucial for clinical monitoring and intervention.

      Human metabolism is a complex network with hundreds of cross-linked paths. During critical
      illness, the metabolic network is dynamically disturbed at multiple points. Classical
      research typically isolates a small part of this network to investigate the impact of
      pathological physiology molecular mechanisms on clinical outcome. In particular, researchers
      have examined metabolic disturbances such as cytokine network dysfunction, skeletal muscle
      breakdown, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, testosterone and growth hormone/Insulin like
      growth factor （IGF）dysfunctions, low thyroxine syndrome, and deficiency of vitamin D and
      calcium with secondary hyperparathyroidism. These complex metabolic disturbances appear and
      interact at different stages during the pathological process after acute severe illness.
      Therefore, an integrated approach that combines the biochemical/molecular changes with
      network disturbances is the key to understanding acute severe illness at the systems biology
      level and establishing an accurate quantitative model for clinical monitoring.

      An interdisciplinary method that includes high-throughput quantitative techniques and
      effective mathematical and visualization tools is necessary. Furthermore, interdisciplinary
      methods present the opportunity to develop innovative clinical diagnosis and monitoring
      methods for severe injuries. The aim of this study is to provide a novel high-throughput
      method that integrated proton-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomic fingerprinting and
      High Performance Liquid Chromatography with advance mathematics tools to modeling metabolic
      dynamics after acute severe disease.
