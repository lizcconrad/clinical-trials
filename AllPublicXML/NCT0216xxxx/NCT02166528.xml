  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Female pelvic floor dysfunction (FPD) is due to defects in the pelvic support structures,
      degradation, damage or dysfunction. The main problem of which is pelvic organ prolapse(POP),
      urinary incontinence(UI) and genital tract injury. Although it does not pose a serious threat
      to life, but affect the patient's quality of life seriously in the physical, psychological,
      social behavior and other aspects. With the growing aging population, the incidence rate has
      gradually increased, and increasing demands for people's quality of life simultaneously, more
      and more attention was raised to PFD as common chronic diseases.

      In recent years, the basic research, epidemiology, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of PFD
      have made great progress, especially in developing gynecological urology theory and
      reconstructive pelvic surgery. But overall the basic research of PFD is lagging behind,
      especially susceptibility gene localization and functional studies did not get enough
      attention.
