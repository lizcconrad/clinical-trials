  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pursuant to our previous longitudinal study (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02073370) in geriatric
      outpatients cooperated with the Department of Family Medicine, Department of Geriatrics and
      Gerontology, National Taiwan University Hospital, this study will be conducted to examine the
      impacts of the specific co-morbidities and ageing psychology on the outcomes of
      frailty/sarcopenia syndrome. The thresholds of specific chronic disease will be reviewed
      after frailty being considered in the elderly with co-morbidity condition. In addition, the
      conceptual framework and corresponding measuring instrument of &quot;mental frailty&quot; will be
      expected developed.

    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The psychological adaptation to aging is a dynamic process. The dynamic process and the Selection-Optimization-Compensation process will have their effect on the actual coping actions in everyday life. The instruments will be set up to evaluate the aging psychology process</description>

    <measure>Compare the well chronic disease control and inappropriate condition on the dynamic frail transitions in ambulatory geriatric outpatients</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>The records of chronic disease control status of the same ambulatory geriatric outpatients from previous study, &quot;Clinical evaluation, biomarkers and metabolomics of sarcopenia in frail older adults at ambulatory clinics&quot;, will be linked to this study.</description>
