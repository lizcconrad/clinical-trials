      This clinical study is an open, controlled, prospective, single center, single-surgeon,
      post-market-clinical-follow-up study to evaluate the long-term (18 months) effectiveness of
      the femtolaser-assisted astigmatic keratotomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective post-market-clinical-follow-up study is to address the
      long-term effectiveness of arcuate incisions, in eyes after VICTUS femtosecond laser-assisted
      astigmatic keratotomy.

      This study will be conducted at Gemini eye clinic in Zlin, Czech Republic by Dr. Pavel
      Stodulka who will examine up to 100 eyes who previously received VICTUS femtolaser-assisted
      arcuate incisions treatment.

      Patients will be recruited according to the study inclusion/exclusion criteria.
