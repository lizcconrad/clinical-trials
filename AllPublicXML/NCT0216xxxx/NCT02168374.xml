  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assessed the clinical performance of a resin-modified glass ionomer cement
      containing different concentrations of chlorhexidine digluconate and doxycycline hyclate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the in vivo microbiologic action of the best concentration of
      chlorhexidine and doxycycline associated with the resin-modified glass ionomer cement applied
      on remaining dentine after indirect pulp treatment.

    <description>Carious dentine was sampled from the mesial portion of the cavity floor and the pulpal wall was entirely covered with one of the randomly selected materials: GIC containing 4.5% DOX; GIC containing 1.25% CHX or GIC as a control group. The antimicrobial concentrations were chosen based in the previous in vitro results obtained in this study. The cavities were then temporarily restored using a conventional GIC. Within 3 months after the initial treatment,the materials were carefully and completely removed, a new dentine sample was collected, and the teeth were then restored with a light-cured composite resin using a bonding system, after a new placement of the initial liner material.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  an active deep carious lesion at the internal half of the dentine thickness of a
             primary molar that had not been previously restored and that involved the occlusal or
             occlusoproximal surface;

          -  the absence of signs of irreversible damage to the pulp

          -  the absence of radiolucencies at the interradicular or periapical region or thickening
             of the periodontal spaces, absence of internal and external root resorption, absence
             of calcification of the pulp tissue

          -  children presenting no systemic disease or those not using medications.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  presence of signs of irreversible damage to the pulp

          -  children presenting systemic disease or those using medications.
