  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complete esophageal obstructions leads to definitive fasting. The rendez-vous endoscopic
      approach had already been described for complex stenoses but never for disruption with loss
      of tissue and SES. Patients and methods: This is a retrospective observationnal study about
      patients referred for complete esophageal disruption and classified in two groups: 1/ Long
      disruption (&gt; 5cm), after caustic ingestion or due to an esophageal stripping during SEMS
      removal; 2/ Short disruption (&lt; 5cm), consecutive to radiation therapy. All the procedures
      are performed according the anterograde retrograde approach, using CO2 and under X-rays
      guidance. We report the characteristeristics of the procedures, the efficacy, the time before
      discharge and refeeding, the complications, and the follow-up, especially the number of
      dilatation sessions for each group. The hypothesis is that anterograde retrograde endoscopic
      technique is safe and effective for the management of esophageal disruptions in patients for
      which the surgical treatment confers a high risk of morbidity and mortality.

    <description>All patients received clear and detailed information about the different steps, the benefits and the risks of the procedure they would undergo, and gave an informed consent.
The rendez-vous technique shared some common characteristics whatever the etiology and the length of esophageal disruption. First, prior to start the specific endoscopic management, all the patients needed to have undergone a surgical gastrostomy one month earlier in order to allow the retrograde access. This one-month delay was necessary to get it completely healed before using it for the procedure.
The principle of the combined anterograde retrograde approach is to get an endoscopic access to both the proximal and distal side of the obstruction in the purpose to achieve better and safer recanalization, which could be carried out with either transillumination or using a needle under x-rays guidance.</description>
