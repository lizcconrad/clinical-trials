  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Combined antiretroviral therapy (cART)-treated patients have increased mortality and
      morbidity compared to age-matched seronegative individuals. This increased mortality and
      morbidity has been associated to immune activation that persists also in patients under cART
      even with undetectable levels of HIV-RNA in blood. Indeed, HIV-infected patients,
      irrespective of cART treatment, show higher levels of activated T cells, inflammatory
      monocytes and proinflammatory cytokines than seronegative individuals. Several putative
      causes of this residual inflammation have been proposed and include ongoing HIV replication
      at low levels, the presence of coinfections such as cytomegalovirus, and microbial
      translocation.

      None of these causes are mutually exclusive and understanding the degree to which of these
      three cause residual inflammation in cART-treated individuals will require novel therapeutic
      interventions aimed at alleviated each putative cause.

      In this longitudinal study we aim:

        1. to reduce microbial translocation induced inflammation in cART-treated individuals with
           supplementation of cART with the probiotics.

        2. to investigate the potential benefits of 24 weeks of probiotics supplementation on
           immune function and on immune activation status

      Indeed, the early stage of HIV infection is associated with dysbiosis of the GI tract
      microbiome with reducted levels of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus species with increased
      levels of potentially pathogenic proteobacteria species.
