  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examined the effects of 8 months of Yoga training on bone density and bone
      turnover markers in premenopausal women, ages 35-50 years. The style of Yoga used was power
      Yoga that involved postures with a jumping component. The investigators hypothesized that the
      Yoga intervention would result in beneficial improvements in bone turnover markers, by
      increasing the bone formation marker and decreasing the bone resorption marker.
