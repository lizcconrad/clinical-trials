  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The quality of colon cancer surgery is highly debated these years since the mortality of the
      disease is not declining markedly. Surgery is the main treatment of colon cancer and during
      surgery it is very important for the surgeon to remove the tumour and all potential ways of
      tumour spread. As colon cancer first of all spreads to the nearby lymph nodes lying along the
      tumour feeding artery the surgeon aims to cut the vessel as central as possible. This means
      that all of the tumour feeding artery should have been removed after surgery.

      In this study the investigators want to measure the length of the tumour feeding artery after
      surgery as a quality control of the surgery. The investigators hypothesize that the artery
      will be shorter than 5 mm.

      The investigators wish to CT scan all patients two days after colon cancer surgery and
      afterwards measure then length of the artery on the images. This study will not inflict with
      the normal routine for patient information and treatment.
