  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of tuberculosis infection with high
      mortality. Current treatment regimens are not based on clinical trials. Rifampicin is a key
      drug for TBM, but its penetration into the brain is limited, suggesting that a higher dose
      may be more effective.

      There are several highly relevant, outstanding questions related to the appropriate dose of
      rifampicin for TBM, before a multicenter phase 3 trial can be performed. These are:

        1. Previous phase 2a randomized clinical trial (done in the same setting as this proposed
           study) suggests that high doses of intravenous rifampicin (600mg, circa 13 mg/mg) for
           TBM is safe and associated with a survival benefit in adults. Given that i.v. rifampicin
           is not readily available, this needs to be confirmed using an equivalent higher oral
           dose of rifampicin.

        2. Recent pharmacokinetic analysis of a continuation trial comparing 600 mg i.v. rifampicin
           with 750 mg and 900 mg oral rifampicin suggests that an even higher dose may be needed;
           but this has not been examined

        3. Based on those previous data, there is a need to explore a longer duration of high-dose
           rifampicin for a subsequent phase 3 randomized clinical trial; treatment response in the
           investigators previous trial suggest that the optimal duration may be &gt; 14 days.

        4. There is a need to explore relevant treatment endpoints besides mortality including
           neurological, neuroradiological and inflammatory response.
