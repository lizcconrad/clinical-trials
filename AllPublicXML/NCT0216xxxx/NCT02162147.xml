  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient safety is an internationally recognized health care priority. Canadian data suggests
      that about 8% of adults admitted to hospital experience unintended harm (or 'adverse events')
      from the health care provided during their hospital stay. On a national level, this
      represents almost 25,000 preventable deaths among hospitalized adults each year. The
      emergency department is recognized as a high-risk environment for adverse events but most
      patient safety research is not specific to the emergency department. As well, the vast
      majority of people treated in the emergency department are sent home after their visit; yet
      safety research focuses primarily on people who are admitted to hospital. Finally, although
      children have also been identified as particularly high risk for suffering adverse events,
      very little research has been done on how often these events occur among children who visit
      the emergency department. Our study will address this gap in our knowledge about patient
      safety and provide important information on the frequency, severity and preventability of
      adverse events occurring among children in the emergency department. This information will
      help us to improve the safety of emergency department care for all Canadian children.

    <description>An adverse event will be defined as an event that results in unintended harm to the patient, and is related to the health care and/or services provided to the patient rather than to the patient's underlying medical condition. Emergency department care will be defined as any care provided in the emergency department and will explicitly include care provided by emergency department specific staff (i.e., staff physicians, nurses, and allied health care providers) and care provided by consultants in the emergency department.</description>

    <description>For all patients, we will report the clinical severity as: (a) an abnormality on laboratory testing, (b) â‰¤1 day of symptoms, (c) &gt;1 day of symptoms, (d) nonpermanent disability (e) permanent disability, or (f) death. For admitted patients, we will also report clinical severity according to The Institute for Health Care Improvement trigger tool categories: (a) temporary harm to the patient requiring intervention, (b) temporary harm to the patient requiring initial or prolonged hospitalization, (c) permanent patient harm, (d) intervention required to sustain life, or (e) death.</description>

    <measure>System response required for adverse events</measure>

    <description>The response will be classified as: (a) no treatment (symptoms only), (b) required medical/surgical intervention, (c) visit to MD office, (d) Emergency Department visit, (e) admission to hospital. These previously published broad categories were chosen in order to address the effect of the Adverse Events at both the patient and health care system level.These categories are not exclusive.</description>
