      Backgrounds: Unilateral vocal cord paralysis caused from recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN)
      injury is not an unusual disease and may deteriorate patients'voice and swallowing outcomes.
      Although the long term treatment effect is encouraged, the point when to perform surgical
      treatment is not conclusive. Previous reports suggested late treatment principle because
      patients may spontaneous reinnervation to some degree within 4-5 months after injury. The
      vocal cord position and tone may change during reinnervation. Others delineated laryngeal
      synkinesis by misdirected reinnervation is common and suggested early temporary injection
      laryngoplasty. They implied early injection laryngoplasty may improve patients'not only short
      term voice outcomes but also decrease the incidence of transcervical laryngeal framework
      surgery as a determined surgery. However, lacking of prospective study and objective data
      makes the treatment-time policy still controversial. Purposes: 1. To find incidence of
      spontaneous reinnervation or synkinetic regeneration. 2. To detect the relationship between
      changing of glottal gap and laryngeal synkinesis. 3. To detect the impaction of early
      intracordal hyaluronic acid injection on vocal cord position change in patients with
      laryngeal synkinesis. Study design: Forty patients is planned to be enrolled in the study.
      Twenty of them will undergo hyaluronate intracordal injection at three-six month from RLN
      damage. The other 20 patients will follow the watch-and wait policy. Laryngoscope, laryngeal
      EMG (electromyography), voice analysis and voice outcome survey will be done at 3-6 month and
      12-month after RLN injury. At the end of follow up, the glottal gap, voice laboratory data
      and quality of life will be compared. The outcomes will also be correlated with laryngeal
      electromyography (LEMG) data and the impact of synkinetic reinnervation.

    <time_frame>before and 6 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>laryngeal electromyography signals were obtained using a concentric needle electrode with the surface-ground electrode adhered to the forehead. We examined the electromyography signals on bilateral thyroarytenoid muscle and cricothyroid muscles. With the concentric needle electrode in the thyroarytenoid muscle , the patient was asked to produce three series of &quot;e&quot;s at three different intensities (low, moderate and highest possible), with each &quot;e&quot; lasting at least 400 ms and each inter-&quot;e&quot; interval lasting about 200 ms. To evaluate cricothyroid function, the patients were asked to produce a glissando upward &quot;e&quot; at normal loudness.</description>
