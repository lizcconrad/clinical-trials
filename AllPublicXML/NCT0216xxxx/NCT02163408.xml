  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a technical development study with the goal to develop 3D techniques for
      atherosclerosis plaque characterization. We hypothesize that 3D MRI is superior to 2D MRI in
      characterizing major plaque constituents that contribute to severe clinical events such as
      myocardial infarction or stroke. The major advantages of the 3D techniques to be developed
      will include high spatial resolution, reduced scan times, and optimized image contrast. The
      use of contrast injection is not needed with the new techniques, which is greatly beneficial
      for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.This is not a funded clinical trial.

      All participants will undergo the conventional MRI protocol and the new imaging protocol
      using our developed techniques. They may have either non-contrast scans or contrast-enhanced
      scans or both depending on the stage of development. The comparison results between the two
      protocols will be used to evaluate the performance of the new techniques and help
      optimization of specific technical aspects.
