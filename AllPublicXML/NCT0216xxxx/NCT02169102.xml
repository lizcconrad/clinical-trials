  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety, pain and discomfort are common stressful situations that occur during the dentistry
      practice, especially in the urgency endodontic practice. Studies have concluded that low
      intensity laser therapy is effective in treating pain. However, most studies have reported
      the low intensity laser therapy in chronic pain, few studies have shown its application on
      acute pain and none have evaluated the low intensity laser´s analgesic effect in acute pain
      of the pulp inflammation. Since the pulp tissue has the peculiar characteristic to be
      surrounded by dentin, in acute pulpits, the inflammatory reaction is more complicated than
      usual. Furthermore, during the inflammatory process, sometimes anesthesia is not always
      completely effective. Thus, this present study aims to evaluate whether previous therapy with
      low intensity laser could, by its analgesic effect, promote greater comfort especially to
      this type of patient. 60 patients with acute pulpits pain will be selected to this study
      (randomized and double-blinded) and they will be divided in 4 groups:

      Group 1 ( n=15) - Control Group; Group 2 (n=15) - Laser 1: 780 nanometers (nm); 40 milliwatts
      (mW); 4 seconds per point; 0.16 Joules/point; total irradiated points: 02; Group 3 (n=15) -
      Laser 2: 780nm; 40 mW; 40 seconds per point; 1.6 Joules/point, total irradiated points: 02;
      Group 4 (n=15) - Placebo group - Sham Laser Irradiation.

      The pain will be evaluated by a visual analogue scale (VAS) in 3 different times: initial
      pain, pain immediately after and 15 minutes after interventions (laser irradiation, or sham
      laser irradiation). After that, patients with acute pulp irreversible inflammation will be
      submitted to conventional endodontic urgency treatment. Data concerning the need of
      complimentary local anesthesia will be also taken into account. Data of different groups and
      times will be statistically compared.
