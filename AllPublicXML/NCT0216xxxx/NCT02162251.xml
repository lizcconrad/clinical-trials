    <measure>Severity of dementia based on the Functional Assessment Staging Test (FAST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6, and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>FAST is a seven stage system based on level of functioning and daily activities. It focuses more on an individual's level of functioning and activities of daily living versus cognitive decline</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE is a brief 30-point questionnaire test that is used for the assessment of dementia patients' cognitive impairment. Evaluation of points are as follows: 24 to 30 = no cognitive impairment, 18 to 23 = mild cognitive impairment, 0 to 17 = severe cognitive impairment. Lower scores indicate worsening.</description>
