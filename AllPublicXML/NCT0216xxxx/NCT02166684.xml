  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate whether do-it-yourself devices for self-measuring health
      parameters by subjects can be used for obtaining useful data in scientific studies.

      Besides, the study aims to evaluate if increased awareness of own health status by
      self-monitoring health parameters also serves as motivational instrument for changing health
      behaviour.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During this three month study subjects will self-monitor multiple parameters of health with
      do-it-yourself devices. Subjects are supplied with devices for measuring physical activity,
      food intake, body weight, blood pressure, blood glucose level and blood cholesterol level.
      These devices have to be used with varying frequencies, ranging from continuously to only a
      baseline- and endpoint measure.

      Subjects will have to upload data resulting from these self-measures to an encoded account on
      an online portal.

      At any time during the study, subjects can log-on to this portal, to gain insight in their
      own health parameters.

      Only encoded subject data can be exported from this portal for data analysis.

    <description>Medisana Vifit is worn every day all-day by each subject
Subjects use Medisana MTX Blood pressure monitor twice per week for 13 weeks to measure their blood pressure.
Blood cholesterol is measured by subjects using the Mission Cholesterol 3-1 meter once at baseline and once after 13 weeks
Subjects use Medisana BS 440 BT scale daily
In three weeks (week 1, week 7 and week 13) subjects self-record food intake at three days (two week days and on weekend day) using the FatSecret app.
Subjects self-measure fasting blood glucose twice per week for 13 weeks.
Subjects perform a do-it-yourself Oral Glucose Tolerance Test in week 1 and week 13. Subjects use the Medisana MediTouch 2 for assessing blood glucose levels at t=0, t=30, t=60, t=90 and t=120.</description>
