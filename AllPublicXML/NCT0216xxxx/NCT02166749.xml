      The purpose of this study was to find out subjective and objective outcomes of patients
      undergoing subtotal or total abdominal hysterectomy during a follow up of a mean 33 years
      after the operation. The hypothesis is that there are similar outcomes after both types of
      operations.

      Objective: To evaluate ultra long-term follow-up after subtotal and total hysterectomy in
      patients operated on during 1978-1979 in Turku University Hospital, Finland.

      Methods: From the original cohort of 212 patients 193 were sent a postal questionnaire in
      1997 to find out possible symptoms related to hysterectomy. Again in 2011 a questionnaire
      based evaluation with a possibility of a clinical visit to study hospital was done for 153
      patients. In the first evaluation a self-made questionnaire and in the second evaluation
      validated questionnaires were used. During a follow-up visit a clinical examination using
      also POP-Q-system was done. Additionally, hospital records of the patients were reviewed to
      find out subsequent operations after hysterectomy.
