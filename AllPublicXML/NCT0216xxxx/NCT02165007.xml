  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a Pilot/Phase 1 trial of reduced intensity Haploidentical HSCT in
      patients with sickle cell disease and thalassemia. The purpose of the study is to assess the
      safety and toxicity of reduced intensity conditioning haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research subjects will undergo reduced intensity conditioning (Hydroxyurea, ATG, Fludarabine,
      Thiotepa, Melphalan) followed by infusion of a peripheral blood stem cell graft collected
      from haploidentical family donors that are CD34+ positively selected using the CliniMACS
      device. Sirolimus will be used for GVHD prophylaxis and given for 9 months post-transplant
      and then tapered off by one year

      The use of the CliniMACS device for CD34 selection will be performed at CNMC through
      cross-reference of the master file for CliniMACS CD34+ Reagent by Milteyni Biotech (BB-MF
      8061).

      CliniMACs is an electromechanical device intended to isolate certain cell subsets from mixed
      cell populations. When used in combination with the CliniMACs CD34 reagent, it is possible to
      prepare extremely pure populations of CD34+ cells with upwards of 5 logs depletion of
      contaminating T cells within a closed and sterile system.

      We intend to use this system to select cells from HLA haploidentical related donors who have
      been mobilized with G-CSF prior to stem cell collection. Since previous investigations of
      this strategy in adult patients have not translated into enhanced long term survival, we
      intend to limit this protocol to patients under the age of 22 as they have more rapid immune
      reconstitution.
