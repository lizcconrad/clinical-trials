  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be the first time GSK1325756 Solution for Infusion formulation that has been
      administered to humans. Prior studies have been performed with oral GSK1325756. The primary
      objectives of this study are to obtain information on the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and twice daily intravenous (IV) administration of GSK1325756
      in healthy subjects. In Part A, single, escalating doses will be given in the same cohort of
      subjects after a seven day washout. In addition, the study will evaluate the absolute
      bioavailability of a single dose of the current oral tablet formulation as compared to the IV
      formulation in Part A. In Part B, twice daily (BID) intravenous dose administration will be
      given for 5 days (9 total doses) in two separate cohorts of subjects. Data from this study
      will provide understanding of the safety, tolerability, and PK of intravenously administered
      GSK1325756 twice daily to guide dose selection in future clinical studies in patients with
      viral respiratory tract infections
