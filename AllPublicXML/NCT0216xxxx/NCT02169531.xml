  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus type 2 is a long-term metabolic disorder that is primarily characterized by
      insulin resistance, relative insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia. Our hypotheses is that
      liver would be the primary organ responsible for the metabolic disorder because of some
      unknown defects, where sugar would not be efficiently converted to glycogen and fat, leading
      to hyperglycemia. The constant hyperglycemia would keep pressure on beta-cells in the
      pancreas to eventually exhaust their ability to produce and secret sufficient amount of
      insulin, exacerbating the disease. The Immunotherapy would enhance the liver functions and
      correct the abnormal sugar metabolism. In addition, the ex vivo activated cells produce and
      secret growth factors which would help endothelial cells of blood vessels to reproduce and
      grow, resulting in reduced arteriosclerosis.

      We plan to recruit 20 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who suffer hyperglycemia with or
      without medication. The patients will come to our hospitals for the treatment. A small amount
      of peripheral blood will be drawn and processed and cultured in our laboratory. The cultured
      cells (autologous) will be infused intravenously back to patients. Levels of plasma
      hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and other metabolic parameters before and after the therapy will be
      compared. The therapy is planned to take four weeks for each patient.

    <description>Up to 20 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia will be enrolled and assigned to a single treatment group. Patients will give a small amount of peripheral blood and the blood will be processed and cultured in our laboratory. The ex vivo activated autologous blood cells will be infused intravenously back to patients. The treatment will be done twice a week for consecutive 4 weeks. The metabolic parameters of patients before and after the therapy will be compared to determine if the therapy is safe and effective.</description>

    <description>The patients who take medication before the enrollment will be required to reduce at least half the amount of the medication before the treatment. The reduction of the medication will continue during and after the therapy until the levels of plasma hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) increase to equal or above the levels of the baseline measured before the treatment.</description>
