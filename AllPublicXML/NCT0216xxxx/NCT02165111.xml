  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, clinical trial assessing the therapeutic efficacy of
      Botulinum toxin A (Onabotulinumtoxin A) in treating scleroderma-associated Raynaud's
      syndrome. Each patient will undergo injection with a treatment dose of Botulinum toxin A in
      one randomly-selected hand, and the contralateral hand will be injected with sterile saline
      (placebo) to serve as a control.

      Study participants at the first study visit will complete study questionnaires, their hands
      will be assessed clinically for digital ulceration, and their hands will undergo non-invasive
      laser Doppler imaging to assess blood flow. After this initial assessment, the patients will
      undergo peri-arterial injection of Botulinum toxin A in one hand, and of sterile saline
      solution (placebo) in the other, in a randomized, blinded manner.

      Patient will report the severity of their Raynaud's symptoms weekly over the four month study
      period. At one month post-injection, the patient will complete study questionnaires, their
      hands will be assessed clinically for digital ulceration, and their hands will undergo
      non-invasive laser Doppler imaging. At four months post-injection, the patient will again
      complete study questionnaires, their hands will be assessed clinically for digital
      ulceration, and their hands will undergo non-invasive laser Doppler imaging. In addition,
      patient will be given the option of one week post-injection visit, at which point the same
      assessment will be performed.

      At the conclusion of the study, unblinding will occur.

    <measure>Change in Digital Blood Flow From Pre- to Post-injection.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured pre-injection and at one month post-injection.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is change in blood flow to the fingers, from a pre-injection baseline to post-injection follow-up visit as measured by non-invasive laser Doppler imaging.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Change in Raynaud's Phenomenon Symptoms Measured With the Raynaud's Condition Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly rate of change over the four-month study period.</time_frame>
    <description>Raynaud's Condition Score is a patient-reported, validated outcomes scale that measures the severity of Raynaud's phenomenon on a scale of 0 (&quot;No difficulty&quot;) to 10 (&quot;Extreme difficulty&quot;), where higher values represent a worse outcome.
Data from each weekly report were combined using a statistical model (generalized linear population-average model) to calculate a weekly rate of change for each participant's hand, where a negative value represents a improvement over time and a positive value represents worsening over time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Ulcers as Measure of Digital Ulcer Healing</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at one month post-injection.</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary outcome of this study is the number of digital ulcers as determined by clinical examination. Mean number of ulcers was calculated as total number of ulcers / total number of hands in each group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Raynaud's Symptoms Severity Using the Quick-DASH Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at one month post-injection.</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary outcome of this study is severity of Raynaud's symptoms as measured by the self-reported Quick-DASH score. The Quick-DASH scores measures the degree of hand and upper extremity function on a scale of 0 (not limited) to 100 (severely limited) where a higher value represents a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Raynaud's Symptom Severity Using the McCabe Cold Sensitivity Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at one month post-injection.</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary outcome of this study is the patient-reported sensitivity to coldness as measured by the McCabe Cold Sensitivity score. Patients' answers on this validated instrument are scored on a scale from 0 (no sensitivity) to 400 (extreme sensitivity), where a higher number represents a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Raynaud's Symptom Severity Using the VAS for Pain.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at one month post-injection.</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary outcome of this study is pain as measured by the validated visual-analog scale (VAS) for pain. The VAS pain instrument measures pain on a scale from 0 cm (no pain) to 10 cm (extreme pain)</description>

        <title>Assessment of Raynaud's Symptom Severity Using the VAS for Pain.</title>
        <description>A secondary outcome of this study is pain as measured by the validated visual-analog scale (VAS) for pain. The VAS pain instrument measures pain on a scale from 0 cm (no pain) to 10 cm (extreme pain)</description>
        <time_frame>Measured at one month post-injection.</time_frame>

            <description>One hand of each patient was randomly selected for injection of Botulinum Toxin A (Onabotulinumtoxin A, 20 units/mL).
Injections were performed using a 30 gauge insulin syringe through the dorsal surface in seven locations: adjacent to the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th common digital arteries through the web spaces (10 units each=0.5mL each), and the radial side of the index finger metacarpal head, the ulnar side of the small finger metacarpal head, and each side of the thumb metacarpal head (5 units each= 0.25mL each). Total treatment dose of Botulinum Toxin A will not exceed 50 units per hand.

    <limitations_and_caveats>Multi-level data prevents conclusions from being drawn from aggregate data alone. High degree of variability of the results suggests a heterogeneous group of scleroderma patients. Screening methods and no dose escalation may explain negative findings</limitations_and_caveats>
