    <textblock>
      The female upper genital tract is a unique compartment involved in HIV pathogenesis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The persistent detection of HIV in the female genital tract in spite of ART is unexplained,
      and it is possible the uterine endometrium serve as a reservoir. There are limited data
      regarding the interaction between HIV expression, antiretroviral therapy (ART) and host
      immune system in the uterine endometrium.

    <description>Endometrial lavage (EML) and biopsy (EMB) samples were compared to cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) and fluid (CVF) samples from HIV-negative healthy women (N=x) and HIV-infected women (n=x) taking ART with plasma HIV RNA &lt;40 copies/mL. All participants were in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Immunologic study was completed using Luminex and flow cytometry. Concentrations of tenofovir (TFV), emtricitabine (FTC) and their active intracellular metabolites (TFVdp and FTCtp) were measured using LC-MS/MS in 11 HIV-infected women. HIV RNA was measured in plasma, EML and CVL using the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay (lower limit of detection 40 copies/mL).</description>

    <description>Endometrial biopsy (EMB) specimens were collected via a 3 mm diameter plastic pipelle that was inserted into the uterus following EML. A sample of tissue was obtained by retracting the pipelle's plunger leading to negative suction and rotating the cannula for approximately 15 seconds.</description>
