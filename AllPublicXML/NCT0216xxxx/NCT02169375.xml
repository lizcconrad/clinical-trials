  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sensorimotor (also know as mu) rhythm based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are a tool for
      controlling electronic devices using only brain signals. Often, the computer software that
      analyzes mu-rhythm brain signals constantly adapts to the individual user's brain signals
      when the training target location is known. The investigators want the BCIs to be more
      universal, and not depend on knowing the target location. Therefore, the investigators will
      test the effect removing adaptation has on accuracy of using a mu-rhythm BCI.

    <measure>Accuracy of a mu rhythm BCI using adaptation versus no adaptation.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 times over 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Accuracy with which subjects can select one of two targets after a 3-second time period. The accuracy for a run is calculated as the % of the trials in which the correct target is selected. The average accuracy will be calculated for each of the 10 usage sessions and changes over the sessions will be tracked.</description>
