  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of addiction and mental health problems seen in adults present first in youth.
      There is strong evidence that prevention and early identification during childhood can
      mitigate some of these risks. Students who screen at risk for the development of mental
      illness will be offered online intervention programs with personal guidance from a trained
      coach. In addition, lessons revolving around resiliency will be provided to all students.

      The objectives of this study are:

        -  Decreased rates of depression and suicide (as well as rates of suicide attempts)

        -  Decreased use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs, with additional downstream benefits
           such as reduced rates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and cancer

        -  Decreased school drop-out rates Decreased rates of interactions with the justice system

        -  Decreased costs across a range of ministries (health, education, justice, human
           services), both for youth as well as their families who have been involved in this
           program
