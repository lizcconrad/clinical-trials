      Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of prostatic artery embolization (PAE) in patients with
      benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and refractory lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in
      decreasing the volume of the prostate gland.

      Participants: Study participants will be recruited from UNC Urology clinics as well as
      referring providers. We will include 15 men who are experiencing LUTS not controlled by
      medication with estimated prostate gland weight between 80 and 150 grams.

      Procedures (methods): Enrolled patients will undergo the standard work-up for a surgical
      prostate procedure. In addition, the patient's arteries will be evaluated with a pelvic CT
      angiogram. Then, patients will undergo prostatic artery embolization. Follow up visits will
      be scheduled at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the procedure.

      At the end of the follow-up period, if reduction in prostate gland size has made the patient
      eligible for transurethral therapy, they may proceed to such procedure or elect to undergo no
      further surgical procedure, depending on residual symptoms. Similarly, if insufficient gland
      size reduction has occurred, the patient may elect to pursue OP or no further procedure if
      they are no longer bothered by LUTS.

    <description>Prostatic artery embolization (PAE) is a new procedure that decreases the size of the prostate by blocking its arterial blood flow. Through a tiny puncture in the upper thigh or forearm a catheter is directed to the prostatic artery using fluoroscopic guidance. Once in place, sub-millimeter particles are injected that obstruct the prostatic arteries resulting in gland ischemia, and ultimately, reduction in size. The technique has only been recently developed in Portugal and Brazil and has similarities to Uterine Artery Embolization used to treat uterine fibroids.</description>
