    <textblock>
      Aging in human physically refers to a multidimensional process that all the changes were
      accumulated in a person over time. These aging changes are responsible for the progressive
      increases in the chance of disease and death associated with them. So far, there are several
      theories have been developed to understand the aging process, such as cross-linking, which is
      led by Maillard Reactions. Maillard Reaction is a complex series of reactions between
      reducing sugar/aldehydes and amino groups on proteins. Under physiological conditions,
      aldehydes are products of various exogenous and endogenous amines catalyzed by
      semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO), a family of heterogeneous enzyme. It was
      reported that SSAO shows a significant higher catalytic activity, producing more aldehydes in
      age-related diseases. However, SSAO is not a perfect candidate to be monitored for evaluating
      aging, because it is widely distributed in tissues, which are not readily accessible
      sample-sources for clinical applications. In this work, the investigators have found 6
      biomarker candidates by developing a standard-free, label-free MS-based proteomics method
      based on standard protein (human serum albumin, the highest abundance protein in human
      plasma) model in vitro. Then, the investigators wanted to verify these biomarker candidates
      by clinical plasma samples to see if there is significant quantitative difference among
      people with different ages.

      The procedure of clinical study was:

        1. to get plasma samples from hospital;

        2. digestion of plasma protein-mixture by trypsin in lab;

        3. run mass spectrometry and monitor the amount of target HSA-peptides.
