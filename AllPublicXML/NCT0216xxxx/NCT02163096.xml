      The purpose of this study is to assess benign joint hypermobility syndrome (BJHS) in children
      with a history of wheezing or asthma. BJHS is a common syndrome of joint and connective
      tissue laxity without any other rheumatologic disease. This assessment will be performed by
      using either method below depending upon if the child has a history of wheezing or severe
      asthma:

        1. Determine the correlation, if there is an increased rate of BJHS in children with a
           history of wheezing as well as if there is an increased history of wheezing in children
           with BJHS; or

        2. Determine asthma control, lung function and asthma exacerbations (a flare up or acute
           worsening of symptoms) in children with BJHS compared to children with asthma without
           BJHS, to assess if it BJHS is associated more with children with severe asthma.

    <description>Determine the correlation, if there is an increased rate of BJHS in children with a history of wheezing as well as if there is an increased history of wheezing in children with BJHS, enrolled during well child visits and perform physical exams to screen for BJHS using a standardized assessment, Beighton Criteria, where a score is reached by testing the range of motion of the child's joints to determine if they are more loose than normal.
Pediatric asthma patients will participate by, either the caregiver or child filling out a questionnaire to assess asthma control and history of exacerbation. Spirometry, a pulmonary lung function test, will be performed on all subjects along with a physical exam to screen for BJHS using standardized assessment, Beighton Criteria, where a score is reached by testing the range of motion of the child's joints to determine if they are more loose than normal.</description>
