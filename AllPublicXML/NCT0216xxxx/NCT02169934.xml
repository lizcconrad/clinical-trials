  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the routes of excretion for TRV130 and it's
      metabolites, and to determine and characterize, structurally, the metabolites present in
      plasma, urine, and feces in healthy male subjects.

      This study is an open-label, non-randomized, metabolism and excretion study of a single 2 mg
      IV dose of [14C] TRV130 (approximately 100 µCi) administered as a 10 mL manual IV push over 2
      minutes in a fasted state.
