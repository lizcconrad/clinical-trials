      This pilot clinical trial studies fluorine F 18 fluorothymidine (FLT) positron emission
      tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in measuring cell proliferation in patients with
      brain tumors. Comparing results of diagnostic procedures done before, during, and after
      treatment may help doctors measure tumor growth and plan the best treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Using FLT PET/CT as a measure of cellular proliferation, assess tissue proliferation in
      disease sites of brain tumor patients before therapy (surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy
      or any combination of these).

      II. Determine level of change in cellular proliferation compared with baseline (scan 1) in
      brain tumors at mid-therapy (scan 2), after completion of therapy (scan 3) and in the
      clinical follow-up period (scan 4), when possible.

      III. Correlate levels of cellular proliferation measured by FLT PET/CT at baseline and
      treatment-induced changes in brain tumor proliferation with clinical response status
      (clinical categories are complete remission, lesser degrees of response/stable disease, and
      no response).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess spatial heterogeneity of FLT uptake to identify local differences in brain tumor
      disease burden.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 18F-FLT PET/CT at baseline (pre-therapy), mid-therapy, completion of
      therapy, and 1 year after completion of therapy or time of suspected recurrence.

      After completion of study, patients are followed for up to 7 years.
