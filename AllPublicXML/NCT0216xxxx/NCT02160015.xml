      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given together
      with ibrutinib and rituximab in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small
      lymphocytic lymphoma that has come back, has not responded well to prior treatments, has
      spread to other parts of the body, or cannot be removed by surgery. Biological therapies,
      such as lenalidomide, use substances made from living organisms that may stimulate or
      suppress the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Ibrutinib
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may find cancer cells and help kill them. Giving
      lenalidomide together with ibrutinib and rituximab may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II doses of lenalidomide and ibrutinib for combination
      with rituximab in previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic
      lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of lenalidomide, ibrutinib and
      rituximab in previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma.

      II. To describe any preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of the combination of
      lenalidomide, rituximab and ibrutinib in previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia and
      small lymphocytic lymphoma as defined by response rate, duration of response, and
      progression-free survival.

      III. To observe and record anti-tumor activity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.

      Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on day 1 (up to 6 courses), lenalidomide orally
      (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 (up to 12 courses), and ibrutinib PO QD on days 1-28.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 6 months
      for 10 years.
