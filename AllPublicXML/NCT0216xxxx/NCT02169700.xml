  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) are identified through physical examination as
      hypersensitive spots within taut bands of skeletal muscle, painful on compression, triggering
      characteristic referred pain and generating motor dysfunction as well as autonomic phenomena.
      Different dry needling procedures have been described in the treatment of MTrPs. Needling
      therapies which consist in partially inserting and withdrawing the needle from the trigger
      point site in order to elicit local twitch responses are associated with higher effectiveness
      in releasing MTrPs. Deep dry needling has obtained a grade A recommendation compared to sham,
      for immediate reduction of pain in patients with upper-quadrant myofascial pain syndrome.
      Nevertheless, trigger point dry needling are frequently associated to a post-needling
      soreness. The application of ischemic compression (IC) after trigger point injection in the
      upper trapezius muscle has shown higher reduction of pain and disability in myofascial pain
      patients, compared with trigger point injection alone. To the authors' knowledge, no previous
      studies have evaluated the effectiveness of IC or any manual therapy methods for the
      treatment of post-needling soreness. The aims of this study were: (a) to evaluate the
      effectiveness of IC on reducing post-needling soreness after dry needling of one latent MTrP
      in the upper trapezius muscle, and (b) to investigate the effect dry needling combined with
      IC, compared to dry needling alone and dry needling combined with placebo IC will have on
      cervical range of motion (c) to determine whether psychological factors are predictive of
      postneedling pain and (d) to analyze if the relationships between psychological variables and
      postneedling pain varied as a function of postneedling soreness treatment

    <description>VAS. Despite being a subjective evaluation, it has been documented in previous studies its reliability and validity and its sensitivity to the clinical changes. For this reason, this scale has been used in numerous clinical trials. The patient places a vertical mark on a flat horizontal line of 10 cm. One extreme is 0 (no pain) and the other extreme is 10 (maximum pain) and it must be a difference of 2 points in the evaluation range to produce minimal improvement which is clinically significant</description>

    <measure>Cervical Range of Motion (CROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>CROM measurements were taken before needling, after the intervention, and at 24 and 72 hours post-treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects sat in a chair and a CROM goniometerc was placed over his or her head. They were asked to perform active neck movements to the fullest extent of their mobility. Each movement was recorded three times and the average value was calculated. The CROM measurement device has proven to be a reliable measure33 of movement, with an intra-rater reliability ranging from 0.7 to 0.9 and an inter-rater reliability ranging from 0.8 to 0.87.</description>

    <intervention_name>Ischemic compression. Dry Needling</intervention_name>
    <description>Ischemic compression was carried out after dry needling. Dry needling was performed with a solid filament needle. Subjects were asked to lie in a prone position. The MTrP was held firmly in a pincer grasp. Before inserting the needle, the patient was advised about the possible sharp pain and muscle twitching. The needle was inserted perpendicular to the skin. Then, the muscle fibers were repeatedly perforated by rapidly inserting and partially withdrawing the needles from the MTrP until two local twitch responses were elicited from the muscle. On removal of the needle, the area was compressed firmly with a cotton bud for two minutes. Immediately after the needling, subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups (IC, sham and control).</description>
