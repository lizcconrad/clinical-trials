    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a non-progressive disorder caused by an insult or injury to the brain
      when the brain is most rapidly developing and which results in some motor dysfunction. Causes
      for the injury to the brain are numerous and can occur prior to birth, during the birth
      process, or within the first few months following birth. The motor dysfunction can involve
      any or all four extremities but most often affects the legs, causing abnormal ambulation. The
      level of severity depends on the extent of the injury to the brain and can be mild to severe.
      In severe instances, the child is dependent on others for all his/her care.

      There is no known cure for CP, but physical and occupational therapies are administered in an
      attempt to improve function. The frequency of these therapies varies from once a week (the
      standard of care in the Western Hemisphere) to five times a week (the standard of care in
      Asia and some Eastern European countries). The current understanding of brain plasticity
      offers a theoretical explanation to justify the more intense approach. Active repetitive
      motor skill-directed rehabilitation utilizes the plasticity of the brain and can restore some
      function. Intense active physiotherapy can stimulate non-injured but 'dormant' neurons and
      prevent their 'natural' degeneration in order for them to substitute for the function of
      injured neurons. It is the very young brain that is most likely to respond to this therapy.

      The aim of this proposal is to evaluate the effect of administering both physical and
      occupational therapy five times each week for 12 weeks and compare it with the standard of
      care (SOC) approach of one time each week in children between the ages of 12 months and 36
      months. This is the first randomized crossover trial to both enroll this young a population
      of children with cerebral palsy as well as to evaluate this approach from both the therapists
      and the parents perspectives. The number of children that this study will enroll is larger
      than in most CP studies. The children will be evaluated clinically with two validated
      instruments, one of which was designed specifically for children with CP and is administered
      and scored by certified therapists and the other which was designed for children with
      developmental disabilities and is scored by the child's care provider. A sub-set of children
      will have a special type of MRI to evaluate any changes in the neurological structure of the
      brain.

      The Department of Pediatrics at the University of Arizona recently completed a collaborative
      study with the Neurologic Department at the Beijing Children's Hospital where the intense
      approach of five therapies per week is the SOC. The positive results prompted another
      investigation to determine if such an approach would be feasible in the United States. A
      compliance rate of 81% confirmed feasibility and the perception that parents who have a child
      diagnosed with CP will do whatever they can to improve their child's motor function.

      Specific Aim #1: To compare the effectiveness of an intense physiotherapy program with the
      current standard of care in the management of children with spastic cerebral palsy.

      Hypothesis #1: Children receiving a short cluster of intense therapies (5 times per week for
      12 weeks) will show greater functional gains as determined by the Gross Motor Function
      Measure (GMFM-66) and the Pediatric Evaluation Disability Inventory (PEDI) than those
      receiving the same therapies once a week, the current standard of care.

      Specific Aim #2: To determine if the functional gains by children with spastic cerebral palsy
      achieved with an intense physiotherapy program will continue to improve while receiving less
      intense standard weekly therapies for at least 36 weeks (9 months) following completion of
      the intense program.

      Hypothesis #2: Motor skills gained after 12 weeks of intensely administered physiotherapies
      as determined by the GMFM and the PEDI will continue to improve at a rate greater than that
      seen in children receiving the same therapies once a week, the current standard of care.

      Specific Aim #3: After receiving the same number of therapies at the end of the 48-week
      protocol, children receiving the intense series of therapies during the first 12-weeks will
      have made greater functional gains than those receiving them during the last 12-weeks.

      Hypothesis #3: Children who receive intense physiotherapies at an earlier age make greater
      gains then those who receive the same therapies at a later age.

      Specific Aim #4: To develop a clinical profile that will identify those children most likely
      to benefit from intensely administered physiotherapies.

      Hypothesis #4: Clinical and radiologic characteristics play a major role in response to
      therapy.

      Explorative Aim: To assess the correlation between clinical improvement from intense
      physiotherapies and anatomical changes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      Hypothesis: The improvements from intense physiotherapies seen in the clinical assessments
      will be reflected by alterations of brain connectivity parameters available from
      neuroanatomical MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).

    <description>The primary aim is to assess function. The evaluation instruments we chose are standard in CP research and include an assessment by a certified therapist of Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (GMFM-66) and a parental assessment of the child's functional abilities in the home environment (PEDI-FS). For the primary and secondary outcomes, these endpoints will be assessed at baseline and at 12 weeks as well as every 12 weeks for the next 36 weeks. The evaluation at 48 weeks after the completion of the intense schedule allows an estimation of the persistence of change.
The GMFM-66 is a criterion referenced validated instrument that has been shown to detect change in gross motor function (performance) of children with CP as a result of various interventions. The 66 test items have been grouped into five dimensions: (1) lying and rolling; (2) crawling and kneeling; (3) sitting, standing and walking; (4) running, and (5) jumping.</description>

The PEDI-FS is an instrument developed specifically for children from 6 months through 7 years of age who have some type of a disability. It is a child's primary care provider's assessment of what skills the child is able to perform. The skills are grouped into three domains: (1) self-care, (2) mobility, and (3) social function.</description>

    <description>As part of an exploratory aim, imaging studies will be done at the Barrow Neurological Institute at Phoenix Children's Hospital on a small subset of enrolled children with hemiplegia. Ten children from each of the two randomized groups stratified for age and severity will be imaged before therapy and at 36 weeks after the beginning of therapy. The purpose of this subset is to evaluate white matter integrity and connectivity throughout the entire brain. Differences at 36 weeks will be indicative of alterations in white matter and connectivity scores due to therapy.</description>

    <description>The type of physiotherapy to be administered is Perception-Action (P-A). The P-A (motor) intervention is a child-driven approach without the need for special equipment and considers the child and environment as a single unit.Treatment is a coupling of the child with the environment. The environment is changed to enable, enhance or stimulate movement. The action is initiated by the child with the therapist augmenting the child's environment using touch (tactile information) or light support (cushions, bolsters, and gentle touch or pressure) to assist and/or alter the child's active movement. Toys are used and positioned in different places to encourage movement of upper and lower extremities and the trunk; reaching, turning, sitting balance, crawling, walking.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age: 12 to 36 months of age (The diagnosis of CP is often uncertain under the age of
             12 months. The cutoff at 36 months is to have a population of young children when the
             brain is most &quot;plastic&quot; and most susceptible to reorganization).

          2. Diagnosis: Diagnosis of spastic CP confirmed by a pediatric neurologist or pediatric
             rehabilitation specialist.

          3. Etiology: The insult to the central nervous system that caused the motor dysfunction
             must have occurred during gestation or within one year after birth independent of
             gestational age.

          4. Disease severity level: Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels I,
             II and III.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis: Diagnosis of CP secondary to neuronal migration.

          2. Co-morbidities: Medical conditions that may prevent the administration of
             rehabilitation therapies at the intensity required by the study, or that may
             compromise the study ability to maintain blindness, or that have a co-morbidity not
             typically associated with CP (i.e. cancer, cystic fibrosis).

          3. Co-interventions: Anticipated pharmacological intervention or procedure or
             participation in other studies that may interfere with this study.
