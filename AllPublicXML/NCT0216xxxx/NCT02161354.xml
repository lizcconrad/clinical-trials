      To evaluate the efficacy of a single dose NTC-510 or NTC-510A for dental pain following third
      molar extraction.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study to
      evaluate the efficacy, concentration versus efficacy relationship, and safety of NTC-510 and
      NTC-510A at doses of 2.0, 1.0, and 0.5 mg.

      The study will consist of 4 phases: screening (within 28 days before check-in), check-in
      (before surgery on Day 1), treatment (surgery, randomization, and treatment with study drug
      on Day 1), and follow up (Days 6 to 8). During the screening phase, screening procedures will
      be performed, subject eligibility will be determined, and written consent will be obtained.
      Subjects will then undergo dental surgery to extract 1 or 2 third molars (with at least 1
      partial or complete bony mandibular extraction). The impaction score ([1] erupted in tissue,
      [2] broken soft tissue, [3] partial bony impaction, and [4] full bony impaction) will be
      collected for statistical adjustment should there be randomization imbalance. The surgery
      will be conducted according to standard clinical unit procedures.

          -  Subject has positive urine test for alcohol, cotinine, or drugs of abuse at screening
             or check-in. If a subject is excluded for a positive drug screen due to prescribed
             medication for pain from an infected molar, the subject may be rescreened after the
             appropriate washout period.

          -  Subject has used any medication (with the exception of vitamins and contraceptives),
             including over-the-counter medications, herbal and/or mineral supplements, dietary
             supplements, or has ingested grapefruit-containing foods or beverages within 3 days

             gastrectomy or malabsorption) or has taken oral medications that affect gastric acid
             availability (including H2 antagonists, proton-pump inhibitors, and antacids) within 3
             days before administration of study drug.

             participation in this study.

          -  Subject has significant medical or psychiatric symptoms, cognitive impairment, or
             other factors which, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude compliance
             with the protocol, adequate cooperation in the study, or obtaining informed consent.
