  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerotic disease, or hardening of the arteries, is characterized by the thickening of
      the arterial walls due to fatty deposits in wall and inflammation in the wall of arteries.
      High cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity and genetics play an important role
      in developing clinical symptoms of atherosclerosis disease. The complications of advanced
      atherosclerosis are chronic, slowly progressive and cumulative, resulting in heart attack,
      stroke and/or death and blockage of arteries.

      This study is being done to assess the effectiveness of Spironolactone therapy to slow down
      the worsening of atherosclerotic disease (hardening of the arteries) in aorta (this is a
      large vessel coming out of your heart) compared to placebo (look alike sugar pill). This will
      be checked by comparing before and after therapy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pictures of
      your aortic wall.

      Spironolactone is an FDA approved drug used to treat heart failure and in the management of
      hypertension (high blood pressure), but in this study it is used for another unapproved
      reason. In this study, we would like to evaluate the effects of Spironolactone in people with
      diabetes and atherosclerotic disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients &gt;45 or &gt;40 years with known atherosclerotic events (examples
             include MI, Stroke) and able to provide informed consent (females must be either
             post-menopausal for one year, surgically sterile, or using effective contraception.
             Oral contraceptives are disallowed.
