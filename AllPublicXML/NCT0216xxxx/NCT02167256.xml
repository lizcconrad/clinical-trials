  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AZD0530 is an inhibitor of Src and Abl family kinases1. It has been developed as treatment
      for malignancies because these kinases play a role in tumor invasion and proliferation.
      However, the Src family kinases (SFKs) are highly expressed in brain and have major effects
      on synaptic plasticity2. Moreover, the investigators have recently shown that a specific SFK,
      namely Fyn, is aberrantly activated by specific conformations of the Amyloid Beta (Aß)
      peptide from Alzheimer's disease (AD). Genetic deletion of Fyn rescues AD deficits in
      preclinical models. This clinical trial will test the potential benefit of AZD0530 for
      Alzheimer's disease modification.
