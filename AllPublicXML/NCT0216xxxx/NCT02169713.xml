    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of solifenacin and mirabegron on the
      concentrations of tamsulosin HCl after combined dosing. This study will also evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of the combined administration of solifenacin, mirabegron and
      tamsulosin HCl.

      This study is comprised of two study sequences with 2 investigational periods in each
      sequence. There will be a wash-out period between each investigational period. Patients will
      be admitted to the clinic until discharged after each investigational period.
