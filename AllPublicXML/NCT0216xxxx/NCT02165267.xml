    <textblock>
      Antibodies are natural proteins that the body makes to fight infections. Antibodies can also
      be manufactured like a drug and infused or injected into the body to prevent or treat a
      disease. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of and the body's response to an
      antibody against HIV in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and drug levels of five
      different schedules for the intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) administration of a human
      monoclonal antibody (VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB [VRC01]) against HIV in healthy, HIV-uninfected
      adults.

      The study will enroll 88 healthy, HIV-uninfected adults aged 18 to 50 years.

      This study will enroll participants in 5 groups. Groups 1-3 will enroll simultaneously.
      Groups 1 and 2 will be randomized together but not blinded, while Group 3 will be randomized
      separately and will be blinded. With the implementation of Version 2.0, Groups 4 and 5 will
      be randomized together and will enroll simultaneously. Each group will have a different
      schedule of clinic visits and receive different doses of VRC01 or placebo for VRC01.
      Participants will attend 8 months of scheduled clinic visits.

      Participants in Group 1 will receive an IV infusion of VRC01 on Days 0, 28, 56, 84, 112, and
      140. Participants in Group 2 will receive an IV infusion of VRC01 on Days 0, 56, and 112.
      Participants in Group 3 will receive an IV infusion of VRC01 or IV placebo for VRC01 on Day
      0, followed by SC injections of VRC01 or SC placebo for VRC01 on Days 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84,
      98, 112, 126, 140, and 154. Participants in Groups 4 and 5 will receive an IV infusion of
      VRC01 (each group will receive a different dose) on Days 0, 56, and 112.

      Participants will remain in the clinic for about an hour after receiving the infusions and
      injections for observation and monitoring. Participants in Group 3 who have no problems with
      the first SC injection will have to wait in the clinic for only a half an hour after the rest
      of the SC injections.

      At study entry, participants will give a medical history; undergo a physical exam, blood
      collection, and urine collection; and receive HIV risk reduction counseling. At follow-up
      visits, participants will undergo a brief physical exam and blood collection, receive HIV
      risk reduction counseling, and be asked questions about their health and their experience
      participating in the study. At all visits, participants who were born female will have a
      pregnancy test. At select study visits, saliva, rectal, and semen or cervical secretion
      samples will be collected from participants who consent to collection of these samples.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        General

          -  Blood products received within 120 days before first infusion, unless eligibility for

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding

        Vaccines and Other Injections

          -  HIV vaccine(s) received in a prior HIV vaccine trial. For participants who have

             trial. Exceptions may be made for some vaccines and vaccine trials. For participants
             who have received an experimental vaccine(s) less than 6 months ago, eligibility for
             enrollment will be determined by the HVTN 104 PSRT on a case-by-case basis.

             first infusion and with no evidence of residual inflammation; or scheduled within 10
             days after first infusion (e.g., measles, mumps, and rubella [MMR]; oral polio vaccine

             less than 11 days, with completion at least 30 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Serious adverse reactions to vaccines or to vaccine components, including history of
             anaphylaxis and related symptoms such as hives, respiratory difficulty, angioedema,
             and/or abdominal pain. (Not excluded: a participant who had a nonanaphylactic adverse
             reaction to pertussis vaccine as a child)

          -  Immunoglobulin received within 90 days before first infusion, unless eligibility for
             earlier enrollment is determined by the HVTN 104 PSRT.

             process includes but is not limited to:

               -  A process that would affect the immune response,

               -  A process that would require medication that affects the immune response,

               -  Any contraindication to repeated infusions or blood draws,

               -  A condition that requires active medical intervention or monitoring to avert

               -  Any condition specifically listed among the exclusion criteria below.

          -  Any medical, psychiatric, occupational, or other condition that, in the judgment of
             the investigator, would interfere with, or serve as a contraindication to, protocol

             informed consent

          -  Psychiatric condition that precludes compliance with the protocol. Specifically
             excluded are persons with psychoses within the past 3 years, ongoing risk for suicide,

          -  Asthma other than mild, well-controlled asthma (symptoms of asthma severity as defined
             in the most recent National Asthma Education and Prevention Program [NAEPP] Expert
             Panel report).

          -  Exclude a participant who uses a short-acting rescue inhaler (typically a beta 2
             agonist) daily, or uses moderate/high dose inhaled corticosteroids, or in the past
             year has either of the following:

               -  Greater than one exacerbation of symptoms treated with oral/parenteral
                  corticosteroids;

               -  Needed emergency care, urgent care, hospitalization, or intubation for asthma.

          -  Diabetes mellitus type 1 or type 2, including cases controlled with diet alone. (Not
             excluded: history of isolated gestational diabetes)

          -  Hypertension:

               -  If a person has been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension during
                  screening or previously, exclude for blood pressure that is not well controlled.
                  Well controlled blood pressure is defined as consistently less than or equal to
                  140 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic, with or without
                  medication, with only isolated, brief instances of higher readings, which must be
                  less than or equal to 150 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 100 mm Hg
                  diastolic. For these participants, blood pressure must be less than or equal to
                  140 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic at enrollment.

               -  If a person has NOT been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension
                  during screening or previously, exclude for systolic blood pressure greater than
                  or equal to 150 mm Hg at enrollment or diastolic blood pressure greater than or
                  equal to 100 mm Hg at enrollment.

          -  Bleeding disorder diagnosed by a doctor (e.g., factor deficiency, coagulopathy, or

          -  Malignancy (Not excluded: participant who has had malignancy excised surgically and
             who, in the investigator's estimation, has a reasonable assurance of sustained cure,
             or who is unlikely to experience recurrence of malignancy during the period of the
             study)

          -  Seizure disorder: history of seizure(s) within past 3 years. Also exclude if
             participant has used medications in order to prevent or treat seizure(s) at any time
             within the past 3 years.

          -  Asplenia: any condition resulting in the absence of a functional spleen

          -  History of hereditary angioedema, acquired angioedema, or idiopathic angioedema.
