      This pilot clinical trial studies magnetic resonance (MRI)-guided focal stereotactic
      radiosurgery (SRS) in treating patients with low- or intermediate-risk localized prostate
      cancer. Stereotactic radiosurgery may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause
      less damage to normal tissue.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the correlation of histopathology findings in comparison to regions of the
      prostate reported to be suspicious for harboring tumor burden on multiparametric MRI
      report/s.

      II. Demonstration of the dosimetric and radiobiological advantages of focal stereotactic body
      radiation therapy (SBRT) versus whole-gland radiation therapy.

      III. Evaluation of clinical outcomes in focal SBRT for localized prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 3 fractions of MRI-guided focal SRS every other day for 1 week. Patients
      undergo additional MRI scans between the 2nd and 3rd fractionated treatments, at 6 months
      following the end of radiation therapy, and at 12 and 24 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 24
      months.
