  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incisional hernia is the most frequently seen long term complication in surgery causing much
      morbidity and even mortality in patients. Despite studies on the optimal closing technique
      for laparotomies, the risk for incisional hernia after midline incision remains about 5-20%.
      It has been established that implementing a mesh reduces recurrence of the incisional hernia
      but still the results of repair are often disappointing. Incisional hernias can become
      increasingly complex due to complicated abdominal wall defects caused by a disturbed anatomy,
      fistulas, burst abdomen, wound and mesh infections. In these cases it is not save to repair
      the incisional hernia by means of a synthetic mesh and other augmentation tools need to be
      implemented.

      In the recent years the use of biological meshes has been gaining popularity. Recent reports
      of the use of collagen-based prosthesis have suggested that they support new vessel growth,
      do not excite a significant foreign body reaction, form fewer adhesions, are well
      incorporated into host tissues with minimal wound contraction, and can be used in grossly
      contaminated wounds with fewer infective complications. Biologic meshes are harvested from a
      source tissue and processed for medical use but they vary widely in their processing methods.
      They include tissues of human or animal origins, both chemically cross-linked and non
      cross-linked processes, and submucosal, pericardial, or dermal tissue sources. Current
      studies investigating the effectiveness of these meshes are small and have short periods of
      follow-up. These shortcomings can be explained to high cost of the meshes and unclear
      indication when to use a biological mesh.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the short and long term effects of the Strattice
      biological mesh. The investigators will also inquire why a biologic mesh was used and what
      the direct and indirect costs were.

        Patients operated by members of the ROKI group (Arbeitsgruppe für Rekonstruktion komplexer
        Inzisionaler Hernien); i.e. a group of German hernia surgeons using Strattice for complex
        abdominal wall surgery. This group of surgeons is willing to share their patient cases with
        the investigators to achieve more knowledge on this delicate topic.
