    <textblock>
      This study is the evaluation of ultrafine endoscope (with small caliber and turning radius
      )for colonoscopy in decreasing abdominal pain of patients . 60 patients will be accepted in
      this trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the advantages of an endoscope with smaller turning
      radius and softer insert section in reducing patients' abdominal pain in colonoscopy.
      Transnasal gastroscope was selected in this study , because of its small caliber (5.9mm) and
      small turning radius . Visual analogue scale(VAS),cecum intubation time and cecum intubation
      rate were evaluated.
