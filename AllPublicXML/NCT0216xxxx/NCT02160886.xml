  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized trial investigating if effects of a goal-directed task oriented intervention is
      influenced by who takes the decision and establishes the goal (the child or the parent) and
      whether establishing a goal per se influence performance and goal-achievement. The main
      hypothesis are that children's participation in the goal-setting process would positively
      influence goal achievement, children's self-identified goals would be achievable and that
      both groups would achieve goals that were the target of a goal-directed intervention.

    <measure>Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Three times, at baseline, post-intervention (8-weeks) and follow-up (5-months)</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of the Goal Attainment Scaling, GAS is to measure goal attainment. GAS is an individualized criterion-referenced measure it involves describing current performance and specifying a range of outcomes for a specific goal, using the scale to evaluate the individual change after a specific intervention period</description>

    <time_frame>Assesed once a week up to 11 weeks which include three baseline assesments and eight assesments during the egiht weeks intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>The performance scale of the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure is a 10 point rating scale of ability of performance of a specific task, the purpose is to detect change in an individual's perception of the occupational performance.</description>

    <time_frame>Three times, at baseline, post-intervention (eigth weeks) and at follow-up (5-months)</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of the subscale self-concept in the Beck Youth Scales is to measures the child's estimated perceived self-concept.</description>

    <description>The children will receive goal- directed task oriented interventions based on goals identified by the children themselves, using the Swedish version of the Perceived Efficacy and Goal Setting System (PEGS).
A PEGS interview will be performed with the children. The children identifies tasks they find difficult to perform and prioritize three tasks, they want to perform better, as goals for intervention.</description>

    <description>The children will receive goal- directed task oriented interventions based on goals identified by the parents using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM).
Using the COPM interview technique, the parents are encouraged to talk about an ordinary day to identify occupational performance issues their child is not able to perform. Identified performance issues are rated for importance and the parents selects the three most important issues as goals for intervention.</description>

    <description>The 8-week goal-directed intervention include completing a daily home program and a weekly follow-up session with the child's occupational therapist.
The parents are responsible for the day to day practice and are encouraged to let the children practice daily in their natural environment.
The home-programs focus on enhancing the agreed upon goal specific task performance. They include structured practice of tasks and adaptations and modifications of the environment and the tasks.
The weekly sessions with the occupational therapist are meant to sustain motivation, follow-up on progress, adjust the home program for the coming week and support parents in how to carry out the daily interventions.</description>
