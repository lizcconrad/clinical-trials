  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part study in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation positive
      (EGFRm+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has progressed on treatment with an
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI): Part A will
      determine the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD9291; Part B will allow
      patients further access to AZD9291 and will provide for additional safety data collection.

      Part A is a randomised, open-label, 2 treatment period crossover study in which patients will
      each receive a single oral dose of AZD9291 (1 x 80 mg tablet) at breakfast time
      (approximately 0800) in each of 2 treatment periods (once immediately following a high fat
      meal [fed], and once in the fasted state [fasted]), with a washout period of 9 days between
      doses.

      Approximately 38 patients are planned to be enrolled and dosed; at least 30 evaluable
      patients will be required to complete Part A (ie, the last PK sample in Treatment Period 2
      [TP 2] has been collected). Additional patients may be enrolled to allow for at least 30
      evaluable patients.

        fulfilled:

          1. Participation in another clinical study with an IP during the last 14 days (or a

             limited field of radiation for palliation within 1 week of the first dose of study
             treatment, with the exception of patients receiving radiation to more than 30% of the
             bone marrow or with a wide field of radiation which must be completed within 4 weeks
             of the first dose of study treatment; Patients currently receiving (or unable to stop
             use prior to receiving the first dose of study treatment) medications or herbal
             supplements known to be potent inhibitors of CYP2C8 and of CYP3A4 (at least 1 week
             prior) and potent inducers of CYP3A4 (at least 3 week prior). All patients must try to

             or other products containing grapefruit or Seville oranges within 7 days of the first
             administration of the IP until the end of Part A.

          4. Any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy greater than CTCAE Grade 1 at the time of
             starting study treatment with the exception of alopecia and Grade 2, prior platinum

      <recruitment_details>First subject enrolled: 14 November 2014; Last Subject Last Visit for Part A: 23 March 2015 and Part B: 22 March 2016. The study was performed at 12 sites across Asia and Western Europe. Part A determined effect of food on PK of AZD9291; Part B allowed subjects further access to AZD9291 and provided additional safety data.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>43 subjects were enrolled (signed informed consent). Subjects were assigned to treatment if they met all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. 5 subjects were enrolled but failed inclusion/exclusion criteria and so were not eligible to be assigned treatment. The remaining 38 subjects started Period 1 and received treatment.</pre_assignment_details>
