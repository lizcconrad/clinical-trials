  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this three-year research project were: 1) to develop and evaluate the
      feasibility of the Wheelchair-bound Senior Elastic Band (WSEB) for the demented,
      wheelchair-bound seniors in long-term care facilities, 2) to evaluate the long-term effects
      of the instructor-led WSEB on the functional fitness, daily life function, depression, and
      problem behaviors of this senior population, and 3) to test the feasibility, compliance, and
      effectiveness of the DVD-led WSEB on this senior population.

      A three-year, longitudinal, triangulation research method was applied. First Year (Phase I):
      A preliminary WSEB, including hard copy descriptions and DVD demonstrations of each exercise,
      were sent to the 12 experts in the Delphi advisory panel for their critique and evaluation.
      First Year (Phase II): A quasi-experimental, one-group, pretest-posttest design was used to
      pilot-test the feasibility of the WSEB on a group of 15-20 demented, wheelchair-bound seniors
      in long-term care facilities. Second Year: A quasi-experimental, pre-post tests,
      non-equivalent control group design was used to test the long-term effects of the
      instructor-led WSEB on the functional fitness (cardiovascular-respiratory function, body
      flexibility, range of the joint's motion, and muscle strength and endurance), daily life
      function, depression, and problem behaviors of the demented, wheelchair-bound seniors in
      long-term care facilities. Eight long-term care facilities with 150 demented,
      wheelchair-bound seniors from southern Taiwan were recruited and randomly assigned based on
      the facilities to a WSEB experimental group or a waiting-list control group. Participants in
      the experimental group received the WSEB lead by the pre-trained and certified instructors,
      three times per week, 40 minutes per practice for 24 weeks; participants in the waiting-list
      control group remained regular activities in the facilities. One pre-test and two post-tests,
      12 weeks apart, were conducted. Third Year: Using the same method as in the second year,
      participants from the second year were continued practicing the WSEB, but guided by a DVD,
      for another 36 weeks. The feasibility, compliance, and effectiveness of the DVD-led WSEB on
      the demented, wheelchair-bound seniors in long-term care facilities were tested, and another
      three post-tests, 12 weeks apart, were conducted on the same outcome measurements as in the
      second year.

    <description>Wheelchair-bound Senior Elastic Band (WSEB) exercise program has three phases: 1) warm-up: 6 movements to loosen up the body and elevate the energy for a safe transition to the next phase, 2) aerobic motions: 6 low-to-medium speed exercises to enhance the cardiovascular-respiratory workout, and 3) static stretching: 6 low-speed, gentle stretching exercises to build up muscle power/endurance and increase range of motion and flexibility. It is conducted three times per week, 40 minutes per practice.</description>
