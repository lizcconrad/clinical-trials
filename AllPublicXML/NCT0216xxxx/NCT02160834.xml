  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Greater time spent in sedentary behaviors, independent of physical activity level, can
      increase risk of morbidity and mortality. Objective assessments indicate that bariatric
      surgery patients spend large amounts of time in sedentary behaviors. The present study is the
      first to test whether a mobile health (mHealth) approach that employs widely adopted
      smartphone technology to monitor and modify sedentary behaviors as they occur is a feasible
      and acceptable method of reducing sedentary time in these patients and other obese
      populations.
