  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are common and impairing. Although exposure therapy is one of the most
      effective treatments for anxiety, some individuals do not fully respond to treatment, and
      these individual differences are not well understood. Exposure therapy involves repeated,
      deliberate, safe engagement with a feared stimulus without the feared outcome occurring. This
      treatment is thought to work through a type of emotional learning called fear extinction.
      This study aims to look at links between fear extinction learning and exposure success, with
      the overall goal of better understanding who is likely to respond best to exposure therapy
      and why.
