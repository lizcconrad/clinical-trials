      The purpose of the study is to determine whether MLN9708 is effective as maintenance therapy
      following allogeneic stem cell transplant in patients with high-risk multiple myeloma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although multiple myeloma is considered fatal, survival has dramatically improved over the
      last two decades with the introduction of more effective treatment options. Proteasome
      inhibitors have an anti-myeloma effect and are often used as either initial treatment or at
      relapse in patients with multiple myeloma. MLN9708 is an orally bioavailable, potent,
      reversible inhibitor of the 20S proteasome. Phase I studies have shown MLN9708 to be very
      well tolerated with minimal peripheral neuropathy. It has also shown impressive anti-myeloma
      activity in both the relapsed/refractory setting and the upfront setting (Kumar et al. 2011,
      Berdeja et al. 2011, Richardson et al. 2011). These characteristics make MLN9708 an ideal
      proteasome inhibitor to use after allogeneic stem cell transplant. In this Phase II,
      open-label, multicenter, non-randomized study the investigators will investigate the role of
      MLN9708 as maintenance after allogeneic stem cell transplant in patients with high-risk
      multiple myeloma, and in patients with multiple myeloma who have relapsed after an autologous
      stem cell transplant.

    <description>Patients will be enrolled between Days 45 and 120 after allogeneic transplant and will receive MLN9708 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle for 6 cycles. Up to 18 patients will be enrolled in a dose-escalation phase to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Once the MTD is determined, an additional 20 patients will be enrolled in an expansion phase at that dose.
Dose-Escalation Phase: MLN9708 will be administered orally (PO) as monotherapy. Dosing will start at 2.3 mg. If acceptable tolerability is demonstrated, escalations will be made to 3 mg and to a maximum-planned dose (MPD) of 4 mg.
Expansion Phase: An additional 20 patients will be enrolled between Days 45 and 120 after allogeneic transplant and will receive MLN9708 orally on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle for 6 cycles.</description>
