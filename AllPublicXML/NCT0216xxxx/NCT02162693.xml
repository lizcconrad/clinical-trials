  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current medication treatments for KOA aim to relieve inflammation and pain, but they do
      little to delay or reverse the disease progression and most medications have obvious side
      effects. When the conservative treatments are useless to patients and joint deformities and
      joint disfunction, the patients may require surgery. Although surgery of the joints can
      relieve the pain temporarily, long-term effect (over 10 years) is hard to achieve.

      Human adipose-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells (haMPCs) are obtained through a series of
      procedures: firstly, the fresh adipose tissue is digested with collagenase, filtered,
      centrifuged and then discard mature adipose cells to obtain adipose tissue-derived nuclear
      cells also called stromal vascular fraction cells (SVFs). In the end, haMPCs are prepared
      after being purified andamplified to P2-P5. When induced by specific factors, haMPCs have a
      potential for multilineage differentiation towards bone, cartilage and fat tissue both in
      vivo and in vitro. The haMPCs can secrete a number of soluble mediators to stimulate the
      proliferation of endogenous progenitor cells, to act as nutrients, to be immunosuppressive,
      to be anti-inflammatory, to prevent fibrosis and promote angiogenesis. The cytokines secreted
      by haMPCs play a synergic role in restoring the dynamic balance of synthesis and decompositon
      of cartilage tissue, and finally to repair the impaired cartilage.
