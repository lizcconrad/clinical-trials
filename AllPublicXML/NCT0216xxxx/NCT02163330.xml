    <textblock>
      Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is an uncommon cause of dementia possibly reversible with
      treatment. First described in 1965 it consists of a triad of gait disturbance, cognitive
      deterioration, and urinary incontinence together with enlarged cerebral ventricles and normal
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. Foregoing trauma and hemorrhage, infection, mass lesions,
      or aqueductal stenosis can contribute to hydrocephalus. These symptomatic or secondary forms
      of NPH are not considered here and the focus lies on the idiopathic type (iNPH). Prevalence
      of iNPH increases significantly with age. General estimates range from 21.9 per 100,000 in
      total population surveys but increase up to 181.7 per 100,000 for people 70 to 79 years of
      age. The clinical presentation varies significantly in severity and progression of symptoms.
      For diagnosis the entire triad does not have to be present. In typical cases gait and balance
      disturbances appear either before or concurrently with urinary incontinence or the onset of
      dementia. Current treatment recommendations are based on surgical diversion of CSF , with
      shunts placed either into the ventricular system or the lumbar subarachnoid space to a distal
      site, such as the peritoneal or the pleural cavity or the venous system, where the CSF can be
      reabsorbed . Even though immediate response rate to shunt treatment might be favorable and
      rates of 80% responders have been reported , the perioperative and long-term morbidity and
      mortality of CSF shunting procedures are significant. A meta-analysis of 44 articles found
      that the pooled, mean rate of shunt complication was 38% . Even though acute surgical
      complication rates are low, shunt dysfunctions and long-term complications are relatively
      common. Shunt malfunction (20%), subdural hematoma (2-17%), seizure (3-11%), shunt infection
      (3-6%) and intracerebral hematoma (3%) are the most common complications . In those with good
      long-term survival, sustained improvement is possible, with a rate of 39% documented after 5
      years .In view of the complication rates, the lack of alternative treatment options and
      clinical studies is surprising. Even though iNPH per definition lacks raised intracranial
      pressure on spinal tap, monitoring of ICP prior to surgery reveals an increased amount of
      brief (usually 30 seconds to 1 minute) increases in the static ICP, called Lundberg B waves,
      in patients which improve by shunt placements . When patients are scheduled for shunt
      treatment there is a waiting period of several weeks between diagnosis and operation due to
      congested waiting list.

      Acetazolamide (Diamox) has been shown to reduce the production of CSF in clinical cases of
      raised intracranial pressure . It is considered the drug of choice for the treatment of
      idiopathic intracranial pressure (pseudotumor cerebri). Intuitively a connection between
      Acetazolamide as a treatment option in iNPH seems logical. Encouraging case studies have been
      published previously showing a fascinating improvement and success of treating iNPH with
      Acetazolamide. A systematic placebo controlled study concerning the use of Acetazolamide in
      iNPH is missing and would possibly pave the way to an alternative treatment option avoiding
      surgery and its complications.

    <description>The effect of acetazolamide on motor and cognitive function in iNPH patients will be examined.
Motor system investigations - Gait assessment using a quantified scale (Boon et al., 1997). Scores from this metric represent 3 summed subscores: 10-m step count, 10-m time, and the following 10 features: hesitation, wide and small steps, low clearance, impaired turning, sway, fall tendency, impaired tandem walking, and inability to walk with and without assistance. The summed score has a range from 2-40, with 2 representing unimpaired gait.</description>
