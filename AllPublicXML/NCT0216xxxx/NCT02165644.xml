  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) can occur commonly in the setting of trauma or brain aneurysm.
      SAH accounts for 10% of all the strokes. Aneurysmal SAH accounts for 80 % of cases of
      non-traumatic cases of SAH, 6-8% of all strokes and 22-25% of all cerebrovascular deaths.
      Mortality can be 50% in the first few years of aneurysmal SAH rupture, 15% are severely
      disabled post SAH and only 20-35% having a moderate to good recovery it has gained lot of
      attention and pre-clinical and clinical trials of various agents have been tried to prevent
      poor outcome. The United States epidemiology data reveals the fact that 1% to 5% of adults
      have unruptured brain aneurysm and 30,000 people suffer from aneurysm rupture annually
      translating to brain aneurysm rupture every 18 minutes.

      Vasospasm is the most common SAH complication post 24 hours. It is the segmental or diffuse
      narrowing of the vessels especially the large vessels. Fifty percent of those patients who
      develop clinical vasospasm, progress to infarction and 15-20% will advance to disabling
      stroke or die of cerebral ischemia. The present treatment modalities are insufficient to
      prevent vasospasm. So, we need new treatment modalities to decrease the mortality and
      morbidity in SAH patients.

      The investigators hypothesize that Acetazolamide administration can prevent development of
      vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH.

      If the subject decides to take part in this study, they will receive acetazolamide with
      standard of care or standard of care only for four days. This means:

      The subject will be given acetazolamide tablet orally with standard care for subarachnoid
      hemorrhage or standard of care only, for a maximum of 4 days. If the subject cannot take
      medication orally then the investigators will put a tube through the nose to stomach or small
      intestine. Being part of the study does not exclude the subject from receiving the standard
      therapy. The subject will be given the current standard of care therapy irrespective of being
      in the study or not. The investigators will review the subject's medical records and collect
      information from standard of care procedures that would have been done even if the subject
      were not enrolled in this study. This information will include, but will not be limited to,
      the subject's imaging data, sub arachnoid hemorrhage assessments and medical history. The
      subject's Hunt and Hess scale score and (World federation of neurologic surgeons) WFNS scale
      score will also be collected. Hunt and Hess and WFNS scale are used to assess the level of
      damage to neurologic functions of a person caused by sub arachnoid hemorrhage.

      The subject will be asked to come for the follow-up at 3 months after the discharge from the
      hospital. The following data will be obtained from each subject at 3-month follow-up.

        1. Modified Rankin Scale (m-RS) scores

        2. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores

    <description>The modified Rankin Scale (m-RS) is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people after they have suffered a stroke including subarachnoid hemorrhage. The score is given according to following scale.
0- No symptoms at all
No significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and activities
Slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own affairs without assistance
Moderate disability; requiring some help, but able to walk without assistance
Moderately severe disability; unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance
Severe disability; bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant nursing care and attention

    <description>Neurological status of a subject is assessed by physical neurological examination of the subject by a qualified neurologist. It is one of the most important aspect in determining neurological health of a subject after subarachnoid hemorrhage. It also helps to determine subarachnoid hemorrhage severity and prognosis.</description>

    <measure>Glasgow Outcome Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At 3 months from the baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) was developed to rank outcomes after head injury, but has been used in stroke studies including subarachnoid hemorrhage. The score is given according to following scale ranging from 1-5.
Death- Severe injury or death without recovery of consciousness
Persistent vegetative state- Severe damage with prolonged state of unresponsiveness and a lack of higher mental functions
Severe disability- Severe injury with permanent need for help with daily living
Moderate disability- No need for assistance in everyday life, employment is possible but may require special equipment.
Low disability- Light damage with minor neurological and psychological deficits.</description>

    <measure>Hunt and Hess Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Hunt and Hess scale, is one of the grading systems used to classify the severity of a subarachnoid hemorrhage based on the patient's clinical condition. It is used as a predictor of patient's prognosis/outcome, with a higher grade correlating to lower survival rate. It gives an index of the mortality associated with the various grades. The mortality is minimum with grade 1 and maximum with grade 5. The grades are as follows:
Asymptomatic, mild headache, slight nuchal rigidity
Moderate to severe headache, nuchal rigidity, no neurologic deficit other than cranial nerve palsy
Drowsiness / confusion, mild focal neurologic deficit
Stupor, moderate-severe hemiparesis
Coma, decerebrate posturing</description>

    <measure>World Federation of Neurosurgeons Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The World Federation of Neurosurgeons (WFNS) classification uses Glasgow coma score (GCS) and focal neurological deficit to gauge severity of symptoms. It is intended to be a simple, reliable and clinically valid way to grade a patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The prognosis becomes worse when we move from grade 1 to grade 5.
Grade 1 represents a GCS of 15 with absent focal neurological deficit, Grade 2 represents a GCS of 13-14 with absent focal neurological deficit, Grade 3 represents a GCS of 13-14 with focal neurological deficit present, Grade 4 represents a GCS of 7-12 with present or absent focal neurological deficit, Grade 5 represents a GCS of &lt;7 with present or absent focal neurological deficit.</description>
