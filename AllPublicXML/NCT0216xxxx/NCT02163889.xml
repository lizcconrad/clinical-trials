      The objective of this study is to investigate T2Candida performance as a monitoring tool for
      post-therapy clearance of Candida compared to blood culture.

      This study will collect a T2clinical specimen and companion blood culture from patients who
      have exhibited a positive blood culture by gram stain for yeast, and who are receiving
      treatment with antifungal therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One blood culture and one set of T2clinical specimens will be collected at specified
      intervals to monitor the clearance of Candida infection from the bloodstream.

      Each T2 result will be compared to the companion blood culture result. The comparison will
      determine if the presence of antifungal therapy inhibits blood culture and leads to an
      incidence of blood culture false negative test results. The T2 result, which is not impacted
      by the presence of antifungal therapy, can show that the pathogen is still present for some
      additional period of time.
