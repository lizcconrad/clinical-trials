    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the strategy for mass drug administration (MDA)
      which provides the greatest reductions in prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni in
      school-aged children after 4 years of intervention.

    <textblock>
      Intestinal schistosomiasis is caused by the blood-dwelling flatworm Schistosoma mansoni.
      Despite the increasing focus on the use of praziquantel against schistosomiasis infections
      for the last three decades many areas in Sub-Saharan Africa still have high prevalences and
      intensities of schistosomiasis especially among school-age children. This is true for the
      area of Mwanza Region of Tanzania adjacent to Lake Victoria. The study is a six arm study and
      includes 150 communities (25 in each arm). From each community 100 school children (aged 9-12
      years), 100 first year students (aged 7-8 years) and 50 adults (aged 20-55 years) are
      included, diagnosed and treated with praziquantel using strategies composing of a mixture of
      community wide treatment (CWT), school-based treatment (SBT) and years without treatment
      (-T). The 100 school children provided stool specimens on three consecutive days, while the
      100 first year students and 50 adults with few exceptions only provided one specimen. The
      treatment strategies during the 4 years for the different arms are as follows: Arm 1: CWT,
      CWT, CWT, CWT; Arm 2: CWT, CWT, SBT, SBT; Arm 3: CWT, CWT -T, -T; Arm 4: SBT, SBT, SBT, SBT;
      Arm 5: SBT, SBT, -T, -T; Arm 6: SBT, -T, SBT, -T.
