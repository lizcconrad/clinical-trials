    <textblock>
      Patients candidates for total hip replacement are, generally elderlies and have hip pain, we
      will check if the pressure to the soft tissue changes before and after operation using a
      tapet with pressure sensors sending the information to specific software.

      one hundred Patients 60 years old and more will be considered for this study, both sexs, that
      have schedule for elective unilateral total hip replacement and have not bedsores previously.

      All the data will be collected by FSA software, classified in an excel table. A crossover
      study will be performed and analyzed by a paired test.
