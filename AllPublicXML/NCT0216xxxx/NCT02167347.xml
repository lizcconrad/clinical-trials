      The purpose of the study is to test the feasibility of culturally adaptive family
      intervention for Psychosis

      Primary Objective :

        -  To test whether Pakistani families caring for someone with psychosis will engage with a
           model of family intervention which has been culturally adapted to meet their needs.

        -  To evaluate the acceptability of the intervention to the families who receive it and to
           gather feedback regarding any changes that might improve the intervention.

        -  To gain an impression of whether the intervention has the potential to address unmet
           psychological and social needs of the families and how this affects their levels of
           stress

      the investigators will conduct a feasibility pilot study to test whether Pakistani families
      offered the intervention will want to receive it. The Participants will be recruited from
      psychiatric department of different hospitals. They will be randomly divided into two groups;
      intervention group and treatment-as-usual group. A total of thirty six participants will be
      recruited in the pilot study and divided equally into two arms. This will ensure that, even
      after loss to follow-up, we will have at least 12 subjects per group for analysis (FDA
      guidance http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/5356fnl.pdf).Randomization will be carried out by
      the on offsite statistician. This will provide a reliable geographically remote service. For
      intervention group ten sessions of family intervention will be provided by trained research
      clinician during the period of three months. Relatives of Patients in the treatment as usual
      (TAU) group will be given details of intervention at the end of the study and interested
      families will be offered family intervention
