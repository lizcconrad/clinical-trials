      To evaluate whether remote ischemic per-conditioning (RIPC) can reduce infarct size in
      patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction treated with primary percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PPCI) within 12 hours of symptoms onset.

    <textblock>
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity.
      Early myocardial reperfusion with either of thrombolytic therapy or primary percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PPCI) is the most effective strategy for reducing the size of a
      myocardial infarct and improving the clinical outcome. Although this process can restore
      blood flow to the ischemic myocardium, it can induce injury. This phenomenon termed
      myocardial reperfusion injury can paradoxically reduce the beneficial effects of myocardial
      reperfusion. The pre-clinical study in animal models of acute myocardial infarction suggests
      that lethal reperfusion injury accounts for up to 50% of the final size of a myocardial
      infarct.

      Remote ischemic conditioning uses brief ischemia and reperfusion of a distant organ to
      protect the myocardium. In animal study, remote ischemic postconditioning seems to be more
      effective than local postconditioning in experimental myocardial infarction.Bøtker et al. has
      reported remote ischemic preconditioning before hospital admission increase myocardial
      salvage in patients with acute myocardial infarction.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate whether remote ischemic per-conditioning (RIPC)
      can reduce late infarct size in patients with STEMI treated with PPCI within 12 hours of
      symptoms onset. To test this hypothesis, we will randomize patients into PPCI + RIPC or PPCI
      alone. We will evaluate marker of reperfusion injury using contrast cardiac magnetic
      resonance image.

    <time_frame>6 months after index procedure</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Enzymatic Infarct Size</measure>
    <time_frame>1 to 5 days after index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Enzymatic infarct size will be assessed by the area under the curve of creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) and troponin I (TnI) release. Blood samples will be collected before PCI and every day after index PPCI. Area under the curve of CK-MB and troponin I release will be expressed in arbitrary units and calculated with the trapezoidal method.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Resolution of ST-segment deviation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 to 5 days after index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>ST-segment deviation score will be measured in 12-lead electrocardiograms, calculated as the sum (in millimeters) of ST-segment deviation (elevation or depression) at 80 ms after the J-point in all 12 leads. ST-segment deviation score will be measured at presentation and 30 min after PCI, by 2 physicians blinded as to the patients' data, and the mean value of the 2 assessments will be used. ST-segment resolution will be calculated as a percentage: ratio of the reduction in ST-segment deviation score from presentation to half an hour after PCI over the ST-segment deviation score at presentation × 100% (i.e., [(ST-segment deviation at presentation − ST-segment deviation post-PCI)/ST-segment deviation at presentation] × 100%). Full ST-segment resolution will be defined as 80% or more reduction of ST-segment deviation score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acute kidney injury</measure>
    <time_frame>1 to 3 days after index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Acute kidney injury will be defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine of ≥0.5 mg/dl or a relative increase of ≥25% compared with baseline within 96 h after PCI (the maximal measured concentration of serum creatinine during these 96 h will be used). Relative reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula, within 96 h after PCI will be assessed.</description>

In patients allocated into PPCI plus RIPC group, the protocol will be started immediately after cuff preparation.
