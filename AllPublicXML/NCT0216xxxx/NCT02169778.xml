  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has become a global epidemic with huge public health implications. Although clinical
      significant weight loss can be achieved by a combination of diet and behavioral modification,
      strong metabolic adaptations, with increased appetite and suppressed energy expenditure, are
      activated, which compromise weight loss maintenance and increase the risk of relapse. The aim
      of this project is to compare the effects of intermittent versus continuous energy
      restriction on the compensatory responses previously described using two low calory diets,
      with a similar macronutrient distribution. More specifically, this study will analyze, in the
      short-term, if an intermittent energy restricted diet is associated with less appetite and
      low reduction in energy expenditure when compared with a continuous energy restricted diet.
      This project can bring large practical benefits concerning the design of weight loss programs
      to minimize weight relapse.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The intermittent energy restricted group will undergo 3 nonconsecutive days of partial fasting per week. During the 3 days of partial fasting, participants will be asked to consume a very-low calorie diet (VLCD) providing 550kcal/day for women and 650kcal/day for men. The VLCD products provide 110kcal/pack and include a variety of shakes, smoothies and soups. For the feeding days a diet matching energy needs will be prescribed, using meal replacements (such as smoothies, soups and cereal bars) and conventional food. Drinking at least 2.5 liters of non-caloric liquids will be recommended.</description>

    <description>The continuous energy restricted group will be prescribed a low calorie diet (LCD) with 33% energy restriction, using meal replacements (such as smoothies, soups and cereal bars) and conventional food. The diets' macronutrient composition of the two groups will be matched (50% carbohydrates, 20% protein and 30% fat).</description>
