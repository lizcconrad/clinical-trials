  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among the current myocardial CT perfusion techniques, dynamic CT perfusion technique is most
      advantageous in obtaining information on myocardial blood flow and volume. However, dynamic
      CT perfusion technique involves higher radiation dose than static CT techniques. Patients
      have to take a breath hold during 30 seconds with current dynamic CT perfusion protocol. If
      patients cannot hold their breath, anterior or inferior myocardium might be excluded due to
      limited scan coverage of a 128-slice dual-source CT scanner.

      Reduction of scanning duration of dynamic CT perfusion may not only reduce radiation
      exposure, but also make patients more comfortable. Therefore, the investigators intended to
      propose a modified scan protocol with shorter scan duration and compare diagnostic accuracy
      of a modified scan protocol with the current scan protocol.

      The aim of this study is to compare the diagnostic performance of adenosine-stress dynamic
      myocardial CT perfusion using a reduced dynamic scan duration with perfusion protocol of
      30-second scan duration for the detection of myocardial perfusion defect and significant
      coronary artery stenosis.

      This trial is a single center, prospective, randomized trial designed to compare diagnostic
      performances and radiation doses between two protocols with 30-second or 21-second dynamic
      scan durations. A total of 120 symptomatic patients will be randomized to dynamic CT
      perfusion protocols with 30-second or 21-second scan duration. They will also undergo 1.5-T
      MRI and invasive coronary angiography as reference standards for the assessment of myocardial
      perfusion and coronary artery stenosis. The primary end point of the study is to compare
      diagnostic performances between two CT protocols of dynamic CT perfusion. The secondary
      endpoint of this study is to compare radiation doses and image qualities of two scan
      protocols.
