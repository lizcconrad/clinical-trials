  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at whether or not participating in a physical activity intervention
      during chemotherapy for breast cancer can prevent a marker of aging called p16 from having a
      large increase after chemotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our research team has determined that p16INK4a - a biomarker of aging -- increases
      dramatically during chemotherapy and that p16 levels among patients of similar age are lower
      among those who exercise. We hypothesize that engagement in physical activity during
      chemotherapy will have a moderating effect on increases in p16 levels during chemotherapy. To
      test this hypothesis, we propose to enroll 48 patients age 21-59 with a Stage I-III breast
      cancer diagnosis who are about to start adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in a physical
      activity intervention program. Our primary objective is to compare the change in p16 from
      baseline to end of chemotherapy for participants in this study (who are engaged in a physical
      activity intervention) to the mean change in p16 seen in a previous study of similar patients
      who did not participate in a physical activity intervention. As secondary objectives, we
      propose to evaluate (1) changes in treatment-related toxicity, physical function, fatigue,
      and quality of life between baseline, end of chemotherapy and 6 months post-chemotherapy, (2)
      the association of changes in p16 levels with changes in measures of treatment-related
      toxicity, physical function, fatigue, and quality of life, and (3) the association of changes
      in physical activity levels with changes in measures of treatment-related toxicity, physical
      function, fatigue, and quality of life.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  21 to 59 years of age, female (A similar trial LCCC 1226 explores physical activity in
             women 60 years and older and is now in progress.

          -  Histologically confirmed Stage I, II or III breast cancer (if the patient has had more
             than one breast cancer, then the most recent diagnosis)

          -  Scheduled to begin an appropriate adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy regimen as
             defined by NCCN guidelines (www.nccn.org). Patients receiving anti-HER-2 therapy are
             eligible but the intervention will only be tested during the chemotherapy portion of
             the regimen.

          -  English speaking

          -  IRB approved, signed written informed consent

          -  Approval from their treating physician to engage in moderate-intensity physical
             activity

          -  Patient-assessed ability to walk and engage in moderate physical activity

          -  Willing and able to meet all study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  One or more significant medical conditions that in the physician's judgment preclude
             participation in the walking or strength training intervention.

          -  Unable to walk or engage in moderate-intensity physical activity.
