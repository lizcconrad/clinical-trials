    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized, unblinded, multi-center investigational study with enrollment at up
      to 45 investigational sites. The study is designed to compare the study device (Direct Flow
      Medical Transcatheter Aortic Valve System) composite event rate to a blended commercial
      comparator (using approved Medtronic self-expanding bioprosthesis or Edwards
      balloon-expandable bioprosthesis) in high and extreme risk Subjects with severe symptomatic
      aortic stenosis. Subjects will be followed through the index procedure, hospital discharge,
      and at 30 days, 6 months and 1 year for the primary endpoint analysis. Thereafter, annual
      follow-up at 2 through 5 years will be conducted and analyzed separately.

      Prospective, randomized, unblinded, multi-center investigational study with enrollment at up
      to 45 investigational sites. The study is designed to compare the study device (Direct Flow
      Medical Transcatheter Aortic Valve System) composite event rate to a blended commercial
      comparator (using approved Medtronic self-expanding bioprosthesis or Edwards
      balloon-expandable bioprosthesis) in high and extreme risk Subjects with severe symptomatic
      aortic stenosis. Subjects will be followed through the index procedure, hospital discharge,
      and at 30 days, 6 months and 1 year for the primary endpoint analysis. Thereafter, annual
      follow-up at 2 through 5 years will be conducted and analyzed separately.

      The primary study endpoint is a composite of all-cause mortality, disabling stroke, or
      moderate or greater residual aortic regurgitation (based on core lab assessment) at 1 year.
      All primary endpoint events will be evaluated by a CEC using the definitions located in this
      protocol.

      A sample size of 648 subjects (432 subjects in Direct Flow Medical Transcatheter Aortic Valve
      System cohort + 216 subjects in blended control cohort) will provide at least 85% power to
      test that the study device is non-inferior to the comparator with non-inferiority margin of
      10%.

      Subjects must meet the fundamental enrollment criteria of severe symptomatic, calcific aortic
      stenosis with quantifiable and documented source records.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. The subject has severe senile degenerative aortic valve stenosis determined by
             echocardiogram and Doppler, or simultaneous pressure recordings at cardiac
             catheterization defined as: mean aortic gradient ≥40 mmHg, or an aortic valve area
             ≤1.0 cm2 or aortic valve area index ≤0.6 cm2/m2.

          2. The subject has moderate to severe symptoms from aortic valve stenosis (NYHA
             Functional Class ≥II).

          3. Subject has a documented aortic annulus size of ≥22 mm and &lt;29 mm based on the
             center's assessment of pre-procedure diagnostic imaging (and confirmed by the Patient
             Review Committee [PRC]) and is deemed treatable with an available size of both test
             and control device.

          4. There is agreement by the heart team (which must include a site cardiac
             interventionalist and two cardiac surgeons which can be either two cardiac surgeon
             staff members at the hospital where the procedure is to be performed or one surgeon
             from the hospital where the procedure is to be performed and a surgeon from the
             referring institution or practice) that subject is at high operative risk or greater
             of serious morbidity or mortality with surgical valve replacement (see note below for
             definitions of extreme and high risk, the required level of surgical assessment, and
             PRC confirmation) and that TAVR is appropriate. Subjects will be designated either
             extreme risk (defined as a mortality or irreversible morbidity 50% or great at 30
             days) or high risk (i.e., Society of Thoracic Surgeons operative risk score &gt;8% or at
             a &gt; 15% risk of surgical mortality at 30 days but not extreme risk). This conclusion
             shall be based on consensus of one cardiac interventionalist and two cardiac surgeons
             that have reviewed the case after careful consideration of the Subject's STS risk
             score and co-morbidities.

          5. Subject understands the study requirements and the treatment procedures, and provides
             written informed consent.

          6. Subject agrees and is capable of returning to the study hospital for all required
             scheduled follow up visits.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;20% determined by resting echocardiogram.

          2. Subjects with an acute STEMI within 30 days preceding the index procedure.

          3. Chronic kidney disease with creatinine clearance &lt; 20 ml/min.

          4. Subjects with a platelet count of &lt;50,000 cells/mm³ or a WBC &lt; 1000 cells/mm³ within 7
             days prior to index procedure.

          5. Subject has a known contraindication or hypersensitivity to all antithrombin regimens
             (aspirin, all P2Y12 inhibitors) that cannot be adequately pretreated, or inability to
             be anti-coagulated for the study procedure. Note: Subjects who require chronic
             anticoagulation must be able to be treated additionally with either aspirin or
             clopidogrel.

          6. Any subject with a balloon valvuloplasty (BAV) within 72 hours prior to the index
             procedure.

          7. Subjects who are on a waiting list for any organ transplant.

          8. Subjects with known other medical illness associated with a life expectancy of less
             than one year, or expectation that subject will not improve despite treatment of
             aortic stenosis.

          9. Subject has known hypersensitivity to contrast agents that cannot be adequately
             pre-medicated, or has known hypersensitivity to nickel, tantalum, titanium, or
             polyurethanes.

         10. Subjects with a history of a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within previous
             60 days of index procedure.

         11. Subjects with an active gastrointestinal (GI) bleed or bleeding precluding dual
             antiplatelet therapy.

         12. Subjects presenting with hemodynamic instability or cardiogenic shock requiring
             inotropic support or mechanical support devices.

         13. Subjects who have a planned treatment with any other investigational device or
             procedure through 1 year follow-up, or who are currently participating in an
             investigational drug or another device trial.

         14. Any planned surgical, percutaneous coronary or peripheral procedure to be performed
             within the 30 day follow-up from the TAVR procedure.

         15. Untreated clinically significant coronary artery disease requiring revascularization.

         16. Newly identified left atrial thrombus that has not been treated.

         17. Active endocarditis or sepsis within 6 months prior to the study procedure.

         18. Any condition resulting in inability to provide informed consent for the trial or
             difficulty in assessment of neurologic status.

         19. Congenital bicuspid or unicuspid valve.

         20. Prior aortic valve surgery or pre-existing prosthetic heart valve in any position
             (mitral and tricuspid rings are permissible).

         21. A native valve annulus diameter &lt;22mm or &gt;29mm determined by the screening CT scan.

         22. Echocardiographic evidence of new intra-cardiac mass, untreated thrombus, or
             vegetation that requires treatment.

         23. &gt;3+: aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation or tricuspid regurgitation.

         24. Severe mitral or tricuspid stenosis.

         25. Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) &gt;5.50 cm.

         26. Inability to transfuse blood.

         27. Subject has femoral arterial access that is not acceptable for the study as defined in
             the device Instructions for Use.

         28. Coronary anatomy that precludes the perfusion of native coronary arteries
             post-implant.

         29. Prohibitive left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) calcification that would prevent
             proper deployment of a transcatheter valve.
