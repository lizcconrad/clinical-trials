  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aims for this study are to determine whether UVB excimer laser treatment of
      psoriasis affects serum inflammatory markers, and to assess hyperpigmentation and erythema
      with excimer laser treatment.

      The investigators hypothesize that treatment of psoriasis with UVB delivered via 308 nm
      excimer laser will decrease the levels of serum inflammatory markers. The investigators
      hypothesize that treatment will decrease plaque erythema and will result in minimal
      hyperpigmentation.

      Subjects will undergo Excimer treatment twice a week until they reach a PASI 75 improvement,
      or until they reach the maximum of 20 total treatments. A blood draw to assess serum
      inflammatory markers will be performed at the screening visit and final visit. Chromameter
      assessment, photographs, PASI and PGA (Physician Global Assessment) will be performed
      throughout the study to monitor psoriasis improvement, hyperpigmentation and erythema.
