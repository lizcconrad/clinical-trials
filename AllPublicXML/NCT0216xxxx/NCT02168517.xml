      The overall aim of the study is to investigate if patients with musculoskeletal chronic pain
      have reduced semen quality in comparison with age matched healthy controls. Secondly, the aim
      is to investigate whether overweight with or without chronic pain are related to reduced
      semen quality. We will investigate semen quality in obese chronic pain patients, normal
      weight chronic pain patients and in obese and normal weight healthy controls.

      Obesity is associated with several disorders including chronic musculoskeletal pain. For
      example obesity has been implicated in the development or progression of low back pain and
      knee osteoarthritis. The mechanism by which obesity causes lumbar back pain is poorly
      understood, but the contribution of both mechanical and system factors is likely. Direct
      mechanical stress on the intervertebral discs and adjacent structures are suspected to be
      mechanisms through which obesity affects the spine, leading to subsequent low back pain. The
      link between obesity and knee osteoarthritis has also been demonstrated, but potential
      factors underlying the association of obesity with knee osteoarthritis has not entirely been
      elucidated.

      It is a well-known fact that obesity leads to an excess load on the joint, increased
      cartilage turnover, increased collagen type 2 degradation products and increased risk of
      degenerative meniscal lesions. Although all of these factors have been proposed to lead to
      knee osteoarthritis, no causal relationship has been demonstrated.

    <description>The patients will be tested for their pain in terms of intensity and quality. Intensity will be rated on a visual analogue scale (VAS 0-10) for ongoing pain. Pressure pain will be measured by application of a handheld pressure algometer. A validated Danish version of short form McGill Pain Questionnaire will be given to evaluate the quality of pain. In addition, distribution of pain will be mapped by drawing on a body chart.</description>

      A research biobank will be established during the project period. Majority of each sperm
      sample will be analyzed immediately but approximately 250 ul seminal plasma will be frozen
      and later analyzed at Aalborg University Biotechnology Department.
