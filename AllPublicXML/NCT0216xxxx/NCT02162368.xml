  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spine surgery is the most common procedure in neurosurgical setting. Some centers have chosen
      the patient self-position to avoid complications such as accidental extubation or loss of the
      iv line. The aim of our retrospective study is to describe our experience in the laryngeal
      mask use for airway management in patient submitted to spine surgery in neurosurgery
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Retrospective analysis of our experience in the last 8 years with the airway management in
      spine surgery in prone position. A total of 358 cases were reviewed from 2008 to 2013.

      Airway management (need for LM repositioning, orotracheal intubation because of failed LM
      insertion), anticipated difficult airway, and airway complications were registered.
      Statistics were compared between groups with the t test or the χ test, as appropriate.
