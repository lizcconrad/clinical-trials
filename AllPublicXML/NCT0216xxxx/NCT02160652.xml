      re-implantation for malignant ureteral obstruction.

      The Research Question: Is laparoscopic ureteral re-implantation, for the treatment of
      malignant ureteral obstruction, associated with high patency rates, low complication rates,
      and a significant improvement in quality of life?

      Study design: A single center single arm prospective study, assessing the outcome of ureteral
      re-implantation for malignant ureteral obstruction.

      Study population: Patients with malignant ureteral obstruction, treated with laparoscopic
      ureteral re-implantation, who have a life expectancy of over 6 months and are willing and
      able to participate in the study.

      Intervention: Laparoscopic ureteral re-implantation.

      Study Time line: This will be a 1 year study. At initiation a baseline physical exam, blood
      test, and ultrasonography will be performed. Baseline quality of life questionnaires will be
      filled. After the operation, Follow-up visits will occur at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after
      surgery. At each follow up visit a medical history and physical examination, blood tests and
      quality of life questionnaires will be performed. At 3, 6 and 12 months renal ultrasonography
      will be performed.

      Primary Endpoint: Ureteral patency at 6 months following treatment - assessed by stable or
      improved hydronephrosis and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) according to the
      Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation.

      Study impact: Current treatments for malignant ureteral obstruction with nephrostomy tubes
      negatively impact the patient's quality of life. The findings of the current study may
      support the use of laparoscopic ureteral re-implantation for the treatment of malignant
      ureteral obstruction, if patency is preserved, and quality of life is improved, following the
      procedure.
