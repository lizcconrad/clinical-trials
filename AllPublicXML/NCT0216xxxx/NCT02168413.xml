  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two main goals :

        -  to develop the cortcial excitbality (CE) measurement methodology using coupling between
           transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and physiological recordings such as
           electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG),

        -  to automatize these measurements using robotized TMS.

      Assessing CE is a preliminary and crucial step in any TMS protocol, in either fundamental or
      clinical research. It is an important indicator which determine the stimulation power applied
      on the cortical target during the TMS experiment, or during the rTMS cure (patients). CE is
      in general measured on the motor cortex using EMG activity as the main indicator of the
      system's response, whatever the real cortical target is located. The present study thus
      propose to generalize this measurement on other cortical areas in link with the actual
      targets, and using other external recordings such as EEG. Moreover, as neuronavigation
      systems significantly improved TMS precision in the past years, CE measurements could
      significantly gain to become fully automatized using robotized TMS.

      CRITERIA OF INCLUSION

        -  Major Topic (18 to 75)

        -  Signed informed consent,

        -  A medical examination must be done before participation in research,

      CRITERIA OF NON-INCLUSION

        -  Topic of under 18 and over 75 years.

        -  Against-indications (CI) to the practice of MRI pacemaker or implantable defibrillator
           or pacemaker neurosensory (risk of temporary or permanent damage to the device or
           heating metal parts). Cochlear implants (risk of demagnetization, electrode temperature
           rise and artifacts). Ocular or cerebral ferromagnetic foreign body close to the nerve
           structures (risk of displacement and complications such as eye or brain damage). Metal
           prostheses (possibility of significant artifacts according to their size and their
           ferromagnetic character, some neurosurgical clips or heart valves can cause problems and
           require an investigation into the exact model implanted). Topics claustrophobic.
           Pregnant woman. Neurosurgical ventriculoperitoneal bypass valves. Irremovable metal
           braces.

        -  CI practice of TMS: the history of epilepsy or seizures during hyperthermia during
           childhood are related ICs. Ferrom√©talliques body presence in the brain, cochlear
           implants, pacemakers, insulin pumps, during pregnancy, about jet lag or not having slept
           the night before the session of TMS.

        -  Existence of a severe condition in general terms: cardiac, respiratory, hematologic,
           renal, hepatic, cancerous,

        -  Regular Taking anxiolytics, sedatives, antidepressants, neuroleptics,

        -  Psychiatric disorder characterized,

        -  Alcohol ingestion before the examination,

        -  Persons referred to in Articles L1121-5 to L1121-8 CSP.
