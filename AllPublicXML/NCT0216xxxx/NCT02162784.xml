      The objective of the study is to evaluate the dose response of SYN006 HFA MDI, which is a
      combination drug product of budesonide and procaterol hydrochloride, in asthma patients.
      Patients with mild to moderate asthma will be recruited. There will be two study medication
      administered in this study. The investigational medication is SYN006 (Budesonide/Procaterol
      hydrochloride, 180 mcg/10 mcg per inhalation) and the active comparative medication is
      Ventolin (Salbutamol sulfate 100 mcg per inhalation). The study medication will be
      administered by oral inhalation with the supervision of the investigator or a qualified
      staff.

      Three treatments will be administered in a patient:

        -  A. Two inhalations of Ventolin 100 mcg,

        -  B. One inhalation of SYN006 180/10 mcg,

        -  C. Two inhalations of SYN006 180/10 mcg.

      Patients will be received the study treatment according to one of the six treatment sequences
      according to the randomization schedule:

        1. A-B-C,

        2. B-A-C,

        3. C-A-B,

        4. C-B-A,

        5. A-C-B,

        6. B-C-A.

      The efficacy endpoint is

        -  The change in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) within 6 hours.

        -  The change in Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) within 6 hours.

        -  The change in Force Vital Capacity (FVC) within 6 hours.
