      The goals of this research project are: 1) to develop and evaluate the safety and feasibility
      of the Senior Elastic Band (SEB) exercise program for elderly residents in long term care
      facilities, 2) to evaluate the long-term effects of the SEB on physical functional fitness
      and sleep quality of elderly residents in long term care facilities, and 3) to investigate
      the compliance of elderly residents with long-term SEB exercises.

      A three-year, longitudinal, triangulation research method will be used. The study purpose of
      the first year is to develop a safe and appropriate SEB program for the elderly residents in
      long term care facilities using Delphi survey with a panel of 12 experts and pilot-testing on
      a group of 15-20 elderly residents in long term care facilities. In the second year of the
      study, a quasi-experimental, non-equivalent control group design will be used to evaluate the
      effects of the SEB exercise program on the physical functional fitness
      (cardiovascular-respiratory function, body flexibility, muscle power/muscle endurance, and
      balance) and sleep quality of elderly residents in long term care facilities. Through the
      convenience sampling strategy, a total of four long term care facilities with approximately
      120 elders in Kaohsiung will be recruited and randomly assigned based on the resided
      facilities to a SEB experimental group or a waiting-list control group. The subjects in the
      experimental group will receive the SEB interventions lead by the certified instructors,
      three times per week, 40 minutes per practice for six months; the subjects in the
      waiting-list control group will remain regular daily activities in the facilities. All
      subjects will receive one pre-test and two post-tests three months apart during the study. In
      the third year, the elderly participants will continue practicing the SEB guided by a VCD for
      another nine months, and the compliance of the participants toward regular SEB exercise and
      its long-term effects on the physical functional fitness and sleep quality outcomes will be
      tested with additional three post-tests, three months apart.
