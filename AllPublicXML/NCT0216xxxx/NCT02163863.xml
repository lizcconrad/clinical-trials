      The Mimics Study is a prospective, part randomized study; an initial roll-in registry of 10
      subjects treated with BioMimics 3D followed by a randomized assignment to treatment with
      BioMimics 3D or Control on a 2:1 basis for 76 subjects.

      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the BioMimics
      3D Stent System in the treatment of symptomatic SFA/proximal popliteal disease based on:

        -  Safety; measured by freedom from major adverse events determined at 30 days after the
           procedure, compared to historic controls.

        -  Performance; measured by freedom from clinically driven TLR at 6 months, compared to
           historic controls.

             of the study

          -  Rutherford 1-4(mild claudication to ischemic rest pain), with an occlusion or de novo
