  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few studies have been conducted to assess the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of
      orally consumed intact cannabis (e.g., cannabis-containing brownies). Careful analysis of
      oral cannabis dose effects on these parameters is required to determine the level and
      duration of biological cannabinoid exposure and associated subjective, cardiovascular and
      cognitive effects. The present study will evaluate the detection of cannabinoids in oral
      fluid, plasma, hair, and urine for up to 9 days following consumption of oral cannabis (10mg,
      25mg, or 50mg THC). In addition, we will conduct subjective, behavioral, and cognitive
      performance assessments to evaluate the time course of the consequences of oral cannabis
      ingestion among study participants. The outcomes of the study will extend scientific
      knowledge about the behavioral pharmacology and toxicology of oral cannabis and can inform
      policies regarding clinical, workplace and roadside drug testing programs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have provided written informed consent

          2. Be between the ages of 18 and 45

          3. Be in good general health based on a physical examination, medical history, vital
             signs, 12-lead ECG and screening urine and blood tests

          4. Test negative for recent cannabis use in urine at the screening visit (confirmed by
             GC/MS laboratory test) and at clinic admission

          5. Test negative for other drugs of abuse, including alcohol at the screening visit and
             at clinic admission

          6. Demonstrate ability to expectorate 3-5 mL of &quot;native&quot; oral fluid over a 5-minute
