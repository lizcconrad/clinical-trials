  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is commonly known that heart failure (HF) is the main cause of mortality and morbidity
      which affects about 15 million people in the world and is the primary chronic cause of death.
      In spite of the development of pharmacological therapies which have led to a good control of
      the pathology, almost 50% of patients with advanced HF does not survive after the first year.
      Heart failure consists of a deterioration of the cardiac pump, whose performance become
      insufficient to satisfy the organism needs. HF can be the consequence of various pathologies,
      such as ischemia, chronic hypertension, valvulopathies, pericarditis, etc. In conditions of
      chronic overload, as the one induced by the cited pathologies, the cardiomyocytes reply with
      hypertrophy and/or death due to necrosis or apoptosis. At the same time, there is a collagen
      alteration which causes the substitution of the myocardial damaged portion with fibrotic
      material, increasing in this way cardiac rigidity and reducing contractility. Finally, the
      onset of inflammation, the activation of the immune system and of the inflammatory mediators
      affect heart functionality. These phenomena are regulated by a complex interaction between
      the cellular and molecular mechanisms, which moreover guarantee the homeostasis maintenance
      in physiological conditions. Nevertheless, their imbalance activates a complex series of
      events which have recently started to be recognized and studied. In effect, a recent work has
      underlined the importance of the splenic monocytes in the cardiac response to acute heart
      ischemia, changing our vision concerning the role of the immune system in heart
      diseases.Historically, the term &quot;cardiac remodeling&quot; had been introduced to describe the
      anatomical change of the heart which occurs after myocardial infarction. At a later stage, it
      has been acknowledged that also other pathological conditions, such as chronic hypertension,
      can be a cause of the myocardial remodeling. Physiologically, the immune system cells have
      always been considered for their role of protection from infections. Recently, instead,
      evidence have been showing that immune system cells might have far more complex functions in
      the heart. The myocardial remodeling comes from modifications that may be adaptive to the
      initial insult, but then this structural adjustment may become the activation of
      structural/metabolic circles which can potentially culminate in the transition to HF.

      This observational study will evaluate the immunological profile in relation to cardiac
      geometry variations in hypertensive patients. Aim of this project is to characterize the
      profile of immune system activation during the process of cardiac remodeling which is typical
      of the cardiomyopathy of overload. The main goal will be reached through the characterization
      of the circulating profile of immune system cells, in order to find a correlation with the
      clinical phenotype.

        Patients will be selected from the outpatient cardiac centre of the IRCCS Mediterranean
        Neurological Institute Neuromed, according to specific inclusion criteria. Approximately
        100 subjects aged between 30 and 65 years will be included in the study. At the present 30
        subjects have been enrolled.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Outpatients between 30 and 65 years of age

          -  Subjects with a new diagnosis of hypertension not in treatment OR Subjects on
             antihypertensive treatment in need of further diagnostic analysis to evaluate the
             possibility of secondary hypertension. In this case treatment suspension will be
             necessary in order to obtain the ideal conditions for a diagnostic evaluation, in
             accordance with the guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension.
