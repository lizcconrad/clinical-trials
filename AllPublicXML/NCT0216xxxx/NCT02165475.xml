      Background: Biofeedback and medical treatments have been extensively used for moderate fecal
      incontinence. There is limited data comparing and combining these two treatments.

      Aim: To evaluate the effect of biofeedback and medical treatments, separately and in
      combination.

      Methods: Sixty-five consecutive female patients, referred to a tertial center for fecal
      incontinence were included. The patients were randomized to start with either biofeedback
      (4-6 months) or medical treatment with loperamide and stool-bulking agents (2 months). Both
      groups continued with a combination treatments, i.e. medical treatment was added to
      biofeedback and vice versa. A two-week prospective bowel symptom diary and anorectal
      physiology were evaluated at baseline, after single- and combination treatments.
