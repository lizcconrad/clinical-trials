    <textblock>
      This study will provide evidence on whether the use of an FDA-approved drug therapy for the
      treatment of chronic migraine (OnabotulinumtoxinA) shows similar efficacy for treatment of
      chronic headaches caused by traumatic injury to the brain (TBI) from a direct hit to the
      head, or a fall, or a motor vehicle accident, or some other traumatic event.

      Headaches caused by trauma are called post-traumatic headaches (PTH). The Center for Disease
      Control estimates that between 1.4 and 1.8 million civilians in the US sustain a traumatic
      brain injury (TBI) each year. The objectives of the study will be evaluated in a civilian
      population which has sustained a mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI). Research has found that
      the total cost due to headache in the US workforce is $20 billion per year, most of which is
      in the form of reduce productivity while at work. For patients with TBI who are already
      struggling with cognitive and health challenges in an effort to be productive, it seems
      reasonable to suspect that chronic PTH may slow rehabilitation efforts and successful
      re-entry into the work force and societal responsibility. Results from this study have the
      potential to contribute to recommendations for treatment of chronic PTH.

    <measure>To determine whether OnabotulinumtoxinA is an effective treatment for chronic post-traumatic headache (PTH) following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects complete headache diary entries every day while enrolled in the study. The primary outcome measure is a statistically significant reduction in the number of headaches recorded at screening versus the intervals every three months after treatment and at the final visit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess whether treatment results in improvement of quality of life and a reduction of disability in individuals suffering from chronic PTH.</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects complete assessments at five timepoints: Screening, Injection visit 1, Injection visit 2(90 days after previous visit), Injection visit 3(90 days after previous visit), and the Final visit(90 days after previous visit).</time_frame>
    <description>Assessments include the following:
Short Form 36 (SF-36) Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6) Migraine Disability Assessment Test (MIDAS) Assessments will be administered to all subjects. Results will be evaluated to measure improvement from the first assessment at screening versus the four interval assessment done during the study.</description>
