      This study aims to test the hypothesis that jailed-balloon technique(JBT) is superior to
      jailed-wire technique(JWT) in non-left main coronary bifurcation percutaneous coronary
      intervention(PCI) by lowering the risk of side branch(SB) loss and PCI related myocardial
      infarction, as well as 1-year major adverse cardiovascular events(MACEs).

      1. Objective: To compare the protective effect between JBT and JWT during PCI for non-left
           main coronary bifurcation lesions.

        2. Background: Solid evidence is scant to compare the protective effect between JBT and JWT
           during PCI for non-left main coronary bifurcation lesions.

        3. Study design: This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized study.

        4. Methods

      4a. Study populations: Patients with non-left main coronary bifurcation lesions(Medina 1,1,1
      ), which SBs are less than 2.5mm and more than 1mm, are enrolled in this study. Patients are
      randomized to JBT group and JWT group.

      4b. Procedure: For patients enrolled in JBT group, a monorail balloon is placed at the ostium
      of SB to protect the SB before the stent in main branch(MB) is deployed. Only a PTCA wire
      would be placed in the SB while stenting MB for patients randomized in JWT group. Only
      drug-eluting stent should be implanted in the target vessel.

    <description>The primary outcome of the study is a composite of SB loss or PCI related myocardial infarction.
According to Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grading system, SB loss is defined as less than TIMI 3 flow immediately following MB stenting. It is considered temporary SB loss if TIMI 3 flow is restored with angioplasty and/or stenting. Otherwise, SB loss is considered permanent.
In patients with normal (≤99th percentile URL) baseline cardiac troponin(cTn) concentrations, PCI related myocardial infarction is defined as elevations of cTn &gt;5× 99th percentile URL occurring within 48 hours of the procedure, which should be accompanied with other evidence of myocardial injury. A rise of &gt;20% is required for the diagnosis of PCI related myocardial infarction if the baseline cTn values are elevated and are stable or falling.</description>

    <description>A monorail balloon is placed in the side branch(SB) before the stent in main branch(MB) is deployed. After MB stent is deployed to nominal pressure, the balloon in SB is inflated to 3 atm generally but to higher pressure to perform angioplasty if the blood flow in SB is compromised. The balloon in SB is then removed while the wire in SB is left in place. The MB stent balloon is inflated again for stent apposition. The SB wire is left in place to facilitate rewiring if the blood flow in SB is compromised. Otherwise the SB wire is removed after the stent balloon is inflated again.</description>

Otherwise the SB wire is removed after the MB stent is deployed.</description>
