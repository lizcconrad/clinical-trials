  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will examine the safety of using a concentration of proteins from a patient's own
      blood, referred to as platelet rich plasma or (PRP) and applying it to a second degree burn
      wound.

      The objective of this trial is to demonstrate the safety of applying autologous PRP gel
      (Magellan® Bio-Bandage™) to acute deep partial thickness thermal burns in the first days
      after burn injury.

      The Magellan® Bio-Bandage™ Burn Wound Care Kit is intended for the preparation and
      application of an autologous biological covering to deep partial thickness burn wounds to
      delay or minimize skin grafting requirements.
