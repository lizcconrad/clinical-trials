  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigation is designed to determine whether the gold standard for treating anxious youth
      is enhanced by teaching parents to become their anxious child's CBT coach. Children (7-17
      years old) with either Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Phobia, or Separation Anxiety
      Disorder are treated with a combination of the Coping Cat Program and a parent-training
      intervention that is designed to teach the child's parents the same cognitive and behavioral
      skills that the child is learning and how to help their child to complete exposure
      activities. The research methods are parallel to those used in the CAMS study so that this
      data can be merged with that data set to evaluate the relative efficacy of the enhanced
      intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children between the ages of 7 and 17 years old who are primarily experiencing either
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Separation Anxiety Disorder or Social Phobia and are not
      experiencing a cognitive or learning disability that would prevent them from validly
      completing the measures are eligible for participation in the study. Children who are
      experiencing another psychological disorder as their primary disorder would be excluded from
      the current investigation. Outcome measures include the ADIS for Diagnostic and Statistical
      Manual (fourth edition)(DSM-IV( Child or Parent, Children's Global Improvement Scale (CGI-I),
      Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS), Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS), Negative
      Affect Self-Statements Questionnaire (NASSQ), Coping Questionnaire (CQ), Goal Attainment
      Scale (GAS), Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ), Multi-dimensional Anxiety Scale for
      Children (MASC), Screen for Child Anxiety and Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED),Family

      (PTR), Satisfaction Questionnaire (SQ), Child Behavior Check List (CBCL), Family Burden
      Assessment Scale (BAS), Brief Symptom Index (BSI), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI),
