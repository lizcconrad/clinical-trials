    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, multi-center, phase II study to determine the efficacy and
      safety of CTL019 in adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL. The study will have the following
      sequential phases: Screening, Pre-Treatment, Treatment and Primary Follow-up, Secondary
      Follow-up (Relapse Follow-up) and Survival Follow-up. The total duration of the primary
      follow-up is 1 year from cell infusion. Safety will be assessed until the end of the
      treatment and primary follow-up phase.

             contraception methods include:

               1. Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are NOT acceptable methods of

               4. BOTH of the following forms of contraception must be utilized:

                    -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or
                       other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure

                       suppository

               5. Use of intrauterine devices (IUD) are excluded due to increased risks of

               6. In case of use of oral contraception, women must be stable on the same pill for a
                  minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment

        Women who are not of reproductive potential (defined as post-menopausal for at least 24
        consecutive months (i.e. have had no menses) or have undergone hysterectomy, salpingotomy,
        and/or bilateral oophorectomy) are eligible without requiring the use of contraception.
