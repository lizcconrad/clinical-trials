  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment directed towards the control of periodontal infections is to about 90% non-surgical
      procedures. There is evidence from a large number of randomized controlled studies that the
      efficacy in terms of clinical outcomes of a full-mouth ultrasonic debridement approach (FMUD)
      is comparable to that of traditional section-wise scaling and root planing (SRP). A
      hypothesis for the current effectiveness study is that comparable clinical effects will be
      obtained with the FMUD approach as with conventional section-wise SRP, but with significantly
      more favourable patient-centred and health-economic outcomes.

      This randomized study involves about 100 professionals (dental hygienists) and more than 1000
      patients at 45 dental clinics in the Vastra Gotaland Region, Sweden. The project not only
      evaluate treatment effects in terms of pertinent clinical outcomes, it also has a strong
      focus on patient-centered measures - patient-reported experience measures (PREM) and
      patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) - as well as health-economics.

    <description>Motivation and instruction in proper oral hygiene. Before initiation of the subgingival debridement the patient must show sufficient self-performed infection control (full-mouth plaque score &lt;30%). One session of full-mouth ultrasonic pocket/root debridement using a piezoceramic ultrasonic instrument. A follow-up visit after 2-4 weeks is scheduled for oral hygiene control and re-motivation/re-instruction if indicated. At 3 and 6 months re-evaluation is performed and re-instrumentation of all sites showing a remaining probing pocket depth of ≥5 mm carried out. Final evaluation at 18 months.</description>
