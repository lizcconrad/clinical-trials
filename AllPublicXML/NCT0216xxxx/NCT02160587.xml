  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a safety study to determine the skin sensitization potential of ZuraPrep™ and
      ZuraPrep™ without isopropyl alcohol (IPA) after repetitive patch applications to skin of
      human subjects. Indications of both sensitization and skin irritation will be evaluated.

      This study is designed to determine if the test product, ZuraPrep™ is a skin sensitizing
      agent when applied to human skin. The study, a modified Draize skin sensitization evaluation,
      will be conducted in three discrete phases: 1) induction, 2) rest, and 3) challenge. During
      the Induction Phase, skin sites are exposed to the test product repeatedly for 21 consecutive
      days. The Rest Phase, a 14-day period when no treatment is performed, serves to provide
      adequate time for the immune system to react to ZuraPrep™, given any of its components serve
      as antigens. During the Challenge Phase, the subjects' skin is re-exposed to the test product
      (ZuraPrep™) to determine if it is likely to be immunosensitizing.
