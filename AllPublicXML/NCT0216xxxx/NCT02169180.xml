  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate overall response rate (ORR) (complete response [CR]
      rate plus partial response [PR] rate) of ibrutinib (IMBRUVICAâ„¢; PCI-32765; JNJ-54179060), as
      assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC), in participants with relapsed or
      refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL-a cancer of the lymph nodes or tissues).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, single-arm, open-label (all knew the intervention of study), and
      multicenter (when more than 1 hospital or medical school team work on a medical research
      study) study to explore the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (the study of the way a
      drug enters and leaves the blood and tissues over time) of ibrutinib in Japanese participants
      with relapsed (the return of a medical problem) or refractory (not responding to treatment)
      MCL. The study will consist of a Screening Phase of 30 days prior to first dose of study drug
      followed by treatment Phase and a post-treatment follow-up Phase. Participants will receive
      ibrutinib 560 milligram (mg) orally, once daily on a 28-day cycle until disease progression
      (or relapse if the participant achieved a CR), unacceptable toxicity, or study end, whichever
      occurs first. Treatment Phase will have disease assessments every 8 weeks up to 24 weeks
      after start of study drug, then every 12 weeks thereafter to assess efficacy up to 2 years
      after last participant enrolled. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by ORR. Participants'
      safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years after last participant enrolled</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response is defined as achievement of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC), based on the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. CR is: a) disappearance of all detectable disease symptoms and signs; b) lymph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed on computed tomography (CT) to normal size; c) negative positron emission tomography (PET) scan; d) normal sized spleen or liver if enlarged before therapy; d) bone marrow infiltrate must be cleared if would have been involved before treatment; e) no new sites of disease. PR is: a) greater than 50 percent decrease in the sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses, splenic and hepatic nodules; b) no increase in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen, c) no measurable disease in other organs; d) no new sites of disease; e) 1 PET-positive site of disease (required for the CT+PET assessment of PR).</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 up to 30 days after last dose administration</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who will receive study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or congenital anomaly.</description>

    <description>The AUC (0-last) is the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to the time corresponding to the last quantifiable concentration.</description>
