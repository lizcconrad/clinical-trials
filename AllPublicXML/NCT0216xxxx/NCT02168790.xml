  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed at developing a technique to apply amniotic membrane to a diseased
      ocular surface without surgical intervention (sutureless amniotic membrane transplantation).
      This system needs to be concordant with laws and guidelines for the use of medical and
      pharmaceutical products.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A ring system (AmnioClip) was developed for mounting an amniotic membrane (AM) that can be
      applied like a large contact lens. AM is mounted between the two rings with a special
      designed, accessory mounting device. The safety of the ring system AmnioClip was tested in an
      interventional including 7 patients with ocular surface disorders and need for AM
      transplantation (1, 2, 3). About similar systems was reported (3, 4).
