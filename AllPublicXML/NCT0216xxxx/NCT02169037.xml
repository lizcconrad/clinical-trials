  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized study to assess the safety and efficacy of FIRM (Focal
      Impulse and Rotor Modulation)-guided ablation for the treatment of symptomatic atrial
      fibrillation (AF). The study hypothesis is that the efficacy of AF elimination at 1 year will
      be higher by ablating patient-specific AF-sustaining rotors and focal sources by Focal
      Impulse and Rotor Modulation (FIRM) compared to conventional ablation alone (wide-area PV
      isolation).

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is a standard of care therapy for atrial fibrillation (AF).
      However, it produces suboptimal results, with a single procedure success of 45-55%, and
      multiple procedure success rates of 65-75% in recent randomized trials. The rationale of PVI
      is to eliminate triggers from the Pulmonary veins. An alternative strategy is to eliminate
      the substrates that sustain AF after it has been triggered, as applied to other arrhythmias.
      However, the relevance of AF substrates - at least in persistent AF - has been questioned
      with the recent STAR-AF-II trial, in which ablating at additional lines or complex atrial
      electrograms (CFAE) did not improve the success of PVI alone (Verma et al., 2015) - although
      success remained at ~50% for a single procedure. Because of STAR-AF2, the PVI limb in this
      trial will be PVI alone (wide area circumferential ablation) with no additional lesions.

      Focal Impulse and Rotor Modulation (FIRM) is a novel approach to eliminate specific
      electrical substrates for AF, demonstrated in studies from many laboratories to take the form
      of localized electrical circuits. These rotors and focal sources lie in patient-specific
      locations, often away from typical PVI ablation sites and in right atrium, and ablating them
      has substantially improved the single procedure success rate of PVI in several multi center
      non-randomized trials (Narayan, J Am Coll Cardiol. 2012; Miller, J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol.
      2014).

      There is therefore equipoise in the literature between PVI alone, with a long-history but
      suboptimal results, and FIRM only, that is newer with potentially greater efficacy but
      without randomized trial data.

      This study will test both strategies in a randomized controlled fashion.
