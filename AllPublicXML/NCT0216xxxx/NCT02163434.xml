  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will compare the effectiveness of gabapentin to metoclopramide for 1-2
      weeks among 80 women with hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) in this randomized, double-blinded
      trial. After completion of the 2-week double-blind phase, subjects will be offered open-label
      gabapentin with rescue metoclopramide until their symptoms no longer require treatment.
      Enrollment will occur at the University at Buffalo and the University of Rochester.

    <description>This study will utilize a flexible study endpoint in order to focus assessments of the outcome measures in the outpatient setting and before any repeat iv fluids are administered since these are the circumstances in which HG patients are most symptomatic. As such, the Study Endpoint will be the mean values from Days 13-14 or, for subjects requiring repeat iv hydration after hospital discharge but before Day 14, the Study Endpoint will be the mean values over the 48 hours prior to this repeat iv hydration administration. Subjects enrolled as outpatients who require repeat iv hydration before study Day 14 will also have a Study Endpoint consisting of the 48 hours prior to the repeat iv hydration administration. Utilizing this flexible Study Endpoint will be an extremely important feature of this study's design since it will avoid including the confounding variables of hospital admission and iv hydration in the data analysis. HG inpatients are typically discharged after 2-5 days.</description>
