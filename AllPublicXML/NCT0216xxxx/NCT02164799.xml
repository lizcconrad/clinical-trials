    <textblock>
      The Shock Tool study is designed to improve the clinical evaluation for differentiating shock
      in the emergency department. The goal of this study is to evaluate and improve the accuracy
      of physicians differentiating causes of shock.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim #1: To study the epidemiology of shock in the emergency department Hypothesis 1:
      We will better understand shock states if we determine shock etiology among patients
      presenting to the emergency department in a carefully conducted observational prospective
      study.

      Specific Aim #2: To determine the accuracy of physician diagnosis for the underlying etiology
      of shock.

      Hypothesis 2: Physician assessment of the underlying cause of shock is challenging and often
      inaccurate in the early stages of care in the emergency department.

      Specific Aim #3: To optimize the evidence-based approach to assist in the diagnosis of shock
      etiology from elements readily available when a patient demonstrates shock physiology in the
      Emergency Department.

      Hypothesis 3: An evidenced-based, standardized approach to clinical decision making
      integrating elements of the history, physical exam, and early testing will improve a
      physician's ability to accurately differentiate etiologies of shock.
