  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sensory coverage in the finger continues to be a challenging problem. This study reports
      sensory reconstruction of the fingers with the bilaterally innervated dorsal digital flaps
      and compares the results between the dual- and single-innervated flaps.The main evaluated
      outcomes are static 2-point discrimination and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament scores of the
      flap, fingertip pain and joint motion.

      Pain was given subjectively by the patient using the visual analogue scale (VAS). The VAS
      consists of a 10 cm line that was grouped into mild (0-3 cm), moderate (4-6 cm) and severe
      (7-10 cm). Tinel's sign was rated as the following: grade 1=none; grade 2=mild, slight
      tingle; grade 3=moderate, very uncomfortable; and grade 4=severe, patient unable to use hand
      because of any stimulation of the neuroma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  a soft-tissue defect in the areas where sensory return was considered important ‚óèa
             defect with exposed bone or tendon in one finger

          -  the defect associated with the transected digital nerves in both sides

          -  a defect greater than 1.5 cm

          -  a patient aged 15 to 60 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  injuries to the dorsum of the finger or to the course of the vascular pedicle that
             precluded its use as the donor

          -  injuries to the dorsal branches of the digital nerves that precluded its use as donor
             nerves attached with the flap

          -  a defect less than or equal to 1.5 cm
