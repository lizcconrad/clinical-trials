  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy profiles of Tazarotene Cream,
      0.05% and Tazorac® (Tazarotene) Cream, 0.05% in order to demonstrate bioequivalence and to
      demonstrate the superiority of the 2 active creams over that of the Vehicle (placebo) in the
      treatment of plaque psoriasis.

    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled, multicenter study of
      Tazarotene Cream, 0.05% in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Subjects will be randomly assigned
      in a 1:1:1 ratio to Test, Reference, or Vehicle.

      Subjects will be admitted into the study after informed consent has been obtained and all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria have been met. At each visit, the same investigator (whenever
      possible) will grade the clinical signs of plaque psoriasis at the designated target lesion
      site using the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI), an Investigator's Global Assessment
      (IGA) of disease severity will be performed (IGA scores range from 0 = none to 5 = very
      severe), and application site reactions (erythema, dryness, burning/stinging, erosion, edema,
      pain, and pruritus) will be assessed. In addition, the involved body surface area (BSA) will
      be determined at Visit 1 and Visit 4. Safety will be assessed by monitoring all adverse
      events (AEs) at each visit and a telephone contact at Day 7 (+ 4 days)

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects with treatment success on the IGA at Visit 4/Week 12. Treatment success is defined as absent, very mild, or mild disease shown by a score of 0, 1, or 2 within the treatment area on the IGA. The primary analyses include evaluation of bioequivalence between the 2 active products and evaluations of superiority of each active treatment over the vehicle.</description>

             involving at least 2% and no more than 20% of the body surface area (BSA) (not
             including the scalp and intertriginous areas)

          4. Have a minimum plaque elevation at the target lesion site of at least moderate
             severity (grade ≥ 3 on the Psoriasis Area Severity Index [PASI]). The most severe
             lesion at baseline should be identified as the target lesion

          5. Have an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) of disease severity of at least
             moderate (score ≥ 3) as an overall assessment of all lesions to be treated.

          6. Be in general good health and free from any clinically significant disease other than
             psoriasis that might interfere with the study evaluations

          7. Be willing and able to understand and comply with the requirements of the study, apply
             the study medication as instructed, return for the required treatment period visits,

             sterilized or postmenopausal for at least 2 years) must have a negative urine
             pregnancy test having sensitivity down to at least 50 mIU/ml for hCG, begin treatment
             during a normal menstrual period and must be willing to use an acceptable method of
             contraception during the study. The following are considered acceptable methods of

          3. Have a history of psoriasis unresponsive to topical treatments

          4. Have other inflammatory skin disease in the treatment area that may confound with the
             evaluation of plaque psoriasis (e.g., atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, eczema,
             tinea corporis)

          5. Have pigmentation, extensive scarring, pigmented lesions, or sunburn in the treatment
             areas that could interfere with the rating of efficacy parameters
