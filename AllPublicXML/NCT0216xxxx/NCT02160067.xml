      The purpose of this study is to obtain pharmacokinetic data for a dose proportionality and
      relative bioavailability assessment of 2nd generation BTDS patches compared to 1st generation
      BTDS patches.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to examine a new 2nd generation BTDS patch formulation at 2 strengths: 3.15
      mg and 12.6 mg, compared to 1st generation patches at 2 strengths: 5 mg and 20 mg, to assess
      dose proportionality and relative bioavailability before proceeding to a definitive program
      of studies. Determination is by measurement of drug concentrations in the blood at serial
      collection time points pre-dose until 288 hours post-patch application.
