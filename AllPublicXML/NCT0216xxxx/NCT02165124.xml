  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is evaluate the safety and effectiveness of bariatric embolization
      as a minimally-invasive image-guided procedure for morbid obesity. In this procedure,
      specific blood vessels to the stomach are blocked in order to suppress some of the body's
      signals for feeling hungry, leading to weight loss.

      Morbid obesity is currently treated with diet and exercise, medications, and surgery. This
      study is designed to help treat obesity using a minimally invasive, non-surgical,
      angiographic (through the blood vessel) approach. This procedure is similar to a common
      procedure used to treat bleeding within the stomach. This version of the procedure has been
      named &quot;bariatric embolization&quot;.

      Although there are over 40 hormones that limit food intake, there is only one hormone,
      ghrelin that has been shown to stimulate (prompt) food intake. In obese patients, eating
      fails to suppress ghrelin levels, which is believed to prevent feeling full after a meal and
      to lead to overeating. Due to the strong hunger craving effects of ghrelin, this hormone has
      been a target for the treatment of obesity and weight loss. More recently, ghrelin has been
      shown to have a significant role in the long-term effect of weight loss in bariatric
      (obesity) surgery where ghrelin levels are shown to be much lower when compared to untreated
      patients.

      Recent data collected in animals in has shown that blocking blood vessels to a particular
      portion of the stomach (bariatric embolization) can temporarily decrease levels of the
      appetite inducing hormone ghrelin, and decrease short-term weight gain. In a study of 5
      people, there was a decrease in ghrelin levels and weight loss in the first month after the
      procedure, but there is no information about the effects of the procedure over longer periods
      of time.

      The investigator hopes to learn if bariatric embolization results in safe and effective
      weight loss in people who are morbidly obese.
