      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the prevalence of any functional limitations and
      their associated factors at one, three, six, and twelve months after LASIK surgery and
      finally the level of patient satisfaction, including the prevalence of any dissatisfaction
      and its associated factors at one, three, six and twelve months following LASIK surgery using
