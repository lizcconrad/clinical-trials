  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is widely known that exercise improves general fitness and that fitter patients recover
      more easily from illness and surgery. Conversely, unfit patients have a significantly higher
      morbidity and mortality after surgery and a longer inpatient stay. This will become
      increasingly important in an aging population as baseline fitness generally declines with
      age.

      One method of improving cardiovascular fitness is by using low intensity endurance training
      programmes, a disadvantage of these it that they can take several months to show improvement.
      High intensity interval training (HIT) programmes that use short episodes of high intensity
      exercise have also been shown to improve fitness. These HIT programmes have also shown
      improvement in functional capacity and quality of life in patients with chronic disease. An
      advantage of HIT is that improvements in fitness may occur in a shorter time than traditional
      endurance training. It is also known that HIT can give superior gains over endurance
      training.

      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether an improvement in aerobic fitness, as
      judged by a 2ml/kg/min increase in VO2peak, can be achieved within 31 days via a HIT
      programme, in a group of healthy elderly volunteers.

      As a secondary aim we will assess whether this programme would be acceptable to the group
      studied, through determination of subject compliance and adherence to the training programme.
