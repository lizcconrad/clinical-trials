  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Y-75/ginsan is an acidic polysaccharide with a molecular weight of 150,000 Da, isolated from
      the aqueous Korean Panax ginseng extract. Preclinical laboratory studies have shown its
      function as an immunomodulatory molecule. The present study performed to evaluate the safety
      and beneficial effects of Y-75 on immune function in a group of healthy adults.

      The focus of this trial was modulation of innate immunity, comprising cytotoxic activity of
      natural killer cells, phagocytic activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and mononuclear
      phagocytes, and serum levels of monocyte-derived mediators.
