    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility (ability to be done) of experimental
      technologies to determine a tumor's molecular makeup. This technology includes a genomic
      report based on DNA exomes and RNA sequencing that will be used to discover new ways to
      understand cancers and potentially predict the best treatments for patients with cancer in
      the future.

             sign or the legal guardian's ability to sign the informed consent, and subject's
             ability to cooperate and participate in the study
