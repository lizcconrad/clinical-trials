  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In addition to their role in allergic inflammation, mast cells are often found at the site of
      tumors. They have been attributed both to pro- and anti-tumorigenic roles depending on the
      tumor type. Secretion of mast cell mediators such as histamine, tryptase, fibroblast growth
      factor (b-FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) can
      enhance tumor growth and angiogenesis while TNF-a and heparin act as tumor suppressors.

      The non-small cell lung cancer constitutes the majority of cases of lung cancer. In lung
      cancer, mast cell numbers correlate with tumor angiogenesis and poor prognosis.

      In this work, we are interested to determine the factors in lung cancer microenvironment that
      attribute to mast cell activation. Beside the tumor cells themselves, the cancer
      microenvironment includes other cells such as fibroblasts. The fibroblasts arising from tumor
      stroma, called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), undergo activation, and have different
      feature compared to normal fibroblasts (NFs). In this work we are interested to determine
      whether CAF cells derived from lung tumors, together with the lung cancer cells, or
      microvesicles-derived from these cells, are able to stimulate mast cells to degranulate and/
      or to release various cytokines and chemokines.

      For this propose, during surgery of patients with lung cancer, we will take unnecessary
      sample from the cancer and from normal area for purification of CAF or normal fibroblast
      cells. Those cells will be co-cultured with both lung cancer cell line (A-549) or
      microvesicles-derived from these cells, and human mast cell line (LAD2). Supernatants will be
      collected for determine degranulation and cytokine release from these mast cells.
