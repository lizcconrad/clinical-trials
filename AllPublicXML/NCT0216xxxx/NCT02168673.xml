  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for developing chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD). Patients with COPD have difficulty clearing mucus and debris from their
      airways. Even smokers who have not developed COPD may have difficulty clearing the airways.
      This is partly because smoking impairs the function of cilia, tiny hairs lining the airways
      that sweep out mucus to keep the airways clean. The investigators have found that smoking
      reduces the length of cilia, which may contribute to the worsened cilia function in smoking
      and COPD. This is true even in smokers who show no signs of lung disease. The investigators
      believe that smoking affects levels of genes in lung cells, resulting in shorter cilia.

      In this study, we will use bronchoscopy (inserting a scope into the lungs) to obtain lung
      cells by brushing cells from the airways and we will study genes that may be related to cilia
      length. Our goals are (1) to prove that exposure to cigarette smoke results in shorter cilia,
      (2) to learn which specific genes control cilia length, and (3) to learn how smoking affects
      the gene ODF2 and what effect this has on cilia. Understanding how smoking affects cilia may
      help us identify new ways to treat patients with COPD.
