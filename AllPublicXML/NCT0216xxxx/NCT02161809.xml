  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators long-term goal is to increase the number of Summer Day Camps (SDC) that
      meet the National Afterschool Association Healthy Eating and Physical Activity (HEPA)
      Standards. The objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-component intervention
      designed to increase children's PA levels and improve the quality of lunches and snacks
      children consume in SDCs. The HEPA intervention is designed to target children, parents,
      staff, program leaders, and the SDC environment and uses a train-the-trainer model with SDC
      leaders to train their staff to deliver and integrate the intervention into routine practice.
      In the proposed study, the investigators will evaluate these HEPA strategies, using a 4-year
      randomized controlled trial with 20 SDCs. An important feature of the study will be the
      evaluation of maintenance of the intervention after the removal of research support (e.g.,
      training, boosters) during the final year, as well as costs associated with implementation.

      The investigators hypothesize that intervention SDCs will achieve significantly greater
      increases in HEPA, compared to control SDCs. The investigators expect the study to support
      the cost-effectiveness and maintenance of our strategies for promoting HEPA that will
      facilitate SDCs meeting newly-established HEPA standards for this setting.

      The investigators aim to:

      Evaluate the impact of the HEPA interventions on: 1.) The proportion of children meeting the
      PA Standard (i.e., â‰¥60min MVPA/d) while attending summer day camp; 2.) The proportion of
      foods (e.g., fruit, vegetable, water) children and staff bring and consume at the summer day
      camp that meet the HE Standards; and 3/) Changes in children's age-sex specific BMI
      percentile from the start to end of summer

      Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the HEPA intervention

      Evaluate the maintenance of the HEPA intervention in summer day camps

    <description>The Healthy Eating and Physical Activity (HEPA) intervention aims to increase the quality of foods and beverages and physical activity opportunities in summer day camps. Through staff-level training, physical activity opportunities are modified to provide children with a substantial amount of meaningful physical activity. Through working with foods service providers, changes to the types of foods and beverages served will be made.</description>
