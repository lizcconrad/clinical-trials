    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate how Lid-Parallel Conjunctival Folds recovers or
      persists after the continued usage or discontinuation of contact lenses or refitting with low
      coefficient of friction lenses.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 2-, 4-, 8- and 12-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>LIPCOF was assessed at baseline to 2-, 4-, 8- and 12- week Follow-up. Each subject eye was graded using a 4- point using the scale (Grade 0: No conjunctival folds, Grade 1: One permanent and clear parallel fold, Grade 2: Two permanent and clear parallel folds, (normally lower than 0.2mm) and Grade 3: More than two permanent and clear parallel folds, (normally higher than 0.2mm) at two 2 locations in the eye (Temporal and Nasal). The graded responses for each location (Temporal and Nasal) was average. The sum of the average LIPCOF grade for Temporal and Nasal was reported. (Score=average Nasal Grade + average Temporal Grade).</description>

             eye.

          5. The subject's refractive cylinder must be less than 1.50D in each eye.

             year experience in contact lens wear.

          9. The subject must have normal eyes (i.e. no ocular medications or infections of any
             type).

             inflammatory event (e.g. past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any other

          <title>Lid-Parallel Conjunctival Folds (LIPCOF)</title>
          <description>LIPCOF was assessed at baseline to 2-, 4-, 8- and 12- week Follow-up. Each subject eye was graded using a 4- point using the scale (Grade 0: No conjunctival folds, Grade 1: One permanent and clear parallel fold, Grade 2: Two permanent and clear parallel folds, (normally lower than 0.2mm) and Grade 3: More than two permanent and clear parallel folds, (normally higher than 0.2mm) at two 2 locations in the eye (Temporal and Nasal). The graded responses for each location (Temporal and Nasal) was average. The sum of the average LIPCOF grade for Temporal and Nasal was reported. (Score=average Nasal Grade + average Temporal Grade).</description>
