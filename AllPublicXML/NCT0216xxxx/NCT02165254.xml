  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a tai-chi based exercise program designed for
      patients who recently had a heart attack and do not wish, or are unable, to attend
      traditional cardiac rehabilitation.

      We will estimate the feasibility, acceptability and safety of two different doses of the Tai
      Chi intervention (primary outcome). 60 patients (30 per dose arm) will be randomly assigned
      to a standard dose of Tai Chi (the dose used by our group in large studies of heart failure
      patients) or to a high dose matching the recommended frequency and duration of exercise
      classes in current CRs. Acceptability assessments will include surveys and focus groups to
      formally assess the impact of Tai Chi on facilitators and barriers to CRs in this population.
      We will also obtain estimates of effect sizes of each dose on accelerometry measured physical
      activity and on the proportion of patients achieving the current American Heart Association
      (AHA) recommendation for physical activity (secondary outcome). Additional outcomes will be
      cardiac fitness, quality of life, body weight, and sleep. In addition, we will gather
      exploratory information on possible mechanisms by which Tai Chi training may affect physical
      activity. We will collect information on possible mediators such as exercise self-efficacy,
      perceived social support, and depression. In addition, since Tai Chi training is associated
      with meditative practices aimed at increasing present-moment awareness, we will gather
      information on mindfulness levels. Measurements will be conducted at baseline, 3-, 6-, and 9
      months after enrollment.

    <description>To estimate mean between-doses differences in physical activity (and other continuous secondary outcomes listed below), we will estimate multivariate linear mixed models for within-participant change since baseline as a function of dose group (high or low), time point (3, 6, and 9 months from enrollment, treated as a categorical variable to allow for non-linear trajectories), and their interaction. A statistically significant interaction indicates that between-group differences vary across time points.</description>
