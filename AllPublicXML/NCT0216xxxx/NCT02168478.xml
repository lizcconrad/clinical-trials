  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 48 hour patch test performed in healthy volunteers to determine the presensitization
      (pre-existing allergy) of Neo-Synalar (neomycin sulfate 0.5%(0.35% neomycin base),
      fluocinolone acetonide 0.025%) Cream . Subjects also receive a positive control (Sodium
      Lauryl Sulfate) and a negative control (Saline).

      The primary objective of this study is to determine if any subjects exhibit an allergic
      reaction which may be indicative of a pre-existing sensitization.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following approximately 48 hours of continuous skin contact, the patch units and test
      material are removed at the testing facility. The test sites are evaluated for a significant
      reaction according to the ESS (Erythemal Scoring Scale).

      The test sites are also re-evaluated at 96 and 168 hours post-application (for late reaction)
      using the ESS.

    <description>ESS is measured at 48, 96 and 168 hours post-application of study material. The Erythemal Scoring Scale (ESS) is defined as a 6 point scale (0-4). &quot;0&quot;= no visible erythema; &quot;0.5&quot;= slight, barely perceptible erythema; &quot;1&quot;= mild erythema; &quot;2&quot;= moderate erythema; &quot;3&quot;= marked erythema; &quot;4&quot;= severe erythema. An ESS score of 1 or greater that persists or worsens from one visit to the next is defined as pre-existing sensitization.</description>

          <title>Evidence of Pre-Existing Sensitization by Use of the Erythemal Scoring Scale (ESS)</title>
          <description>ESS is measured at 48, 96 and 168 hours post-application of study material. The Erythemal Scoring Scale (ESS) is defined as a 6 point scale (0-4). &quot;0&quot;= no visible erythema; &quot;0.5&quot;= slight, barely perceptible erythema; &quot;1&quot;= mild erythema; &quot;2&quot;= moderate erythema; &quot;3&quot;= marked erythema; &quot;4&quot;= severe erythema. An ESS score of 1 or greater that persists or worsens from one visit to the next is defined as pre-existing sensitization.</description>

          <title>Patch Test Group</title>
          <description>All subjects are patched with the following: 1.Neo-Synalar Cream 2.Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and 3. Saline. Test material is applied to the absorbent pad and allowed to remain in direct skin contact for a period of 48 hours.
Neo-Synalar Cream: Approximately 0.2 g of test material is applied to the absorbent pad portion of a semi-occlusive dressing and applied as received to the upper back between the scapulae.
Sodium Lauryl Sulfate Aqueous Solution (0.40%): Approximately 0.2 ml of the positive , 0.40% aqueous solution of sodium lauryl sulfate is applied to the absorbent pad portion of an occlusive dressing and applied as received to the upper back between the scapulae.
Saline: Approximately 0.2 ml of the saline is applied to the absorbent pad portion of an occlusive dressing and applied as received to the upper back between the scapulae.</description>
