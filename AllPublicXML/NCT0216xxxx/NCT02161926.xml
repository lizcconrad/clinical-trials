  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity is growing in elderly with heavy consequences in term of medical
      complications and mortality, so that this is nowadays an important public health issue.

      The major therapeutic solution is dietary restrictions, but and the advantages and the
      metabolic consequences are not well known in elderly. The MONA study main aim is to assess
      the metabolic changes in this population, after dietary restrictions, compared to young
      people.

      Primary endpoint : Study the metabolic adaptations of the subcutaneous adipose tissue after a
      diet in elderly obese men compared to young obese men.

      Secondary endpoints : Study the metabolic adaptations of skeletal muscle, the genetic
      adaptations of subcutaneous adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, the inflammatory and fibrosis
      modifications of subcutaneous adipose tissue, the insulinosensibility modifications, the
      modifications on the physical composition, modifications of the energy expenditure in resting
      state and the oxidation of the substrata, study the lipoproteins metabolism and identify new
      biomarkers. All those endpoints are studied comparing elderly obese subjects versus young
      obese subjects.
