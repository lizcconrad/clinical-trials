  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is a proven strategy for preventing type 2 diabetes. Traditionally individuals have
      been prescribed moderate-intensity continuous aerobic exercise but adherence to this standard
      exercise program is dismal. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a novel form of
      exercise that involves brief, repeated bursts of vigorous exercise separated by periods of
      recovery. HIIT elicits many favourable cardiometabolic adaptations that are similar to
      traditional exercise but does so with a lower amount of exercise and in substantially less
      time than moderate-intensity continuous exercise. Therefore, HIIT has been touted as a
      &quot;time-efficient&quot; exercise strategy for improving health. Whether overweight individuals at
      risk for pre diabetes will show greater adherence to HIIT than moderate-intensity continuous
      exercise over the long-term (12-months) has not been tested. Because exercise adherence
      requires complex self-regulation, interventions designed to improve adherence should include
      a behavioural component. The investigators will assess adherence to HIIT and
      moderate-intensity continuous exercise over 12 months following a short-term (2 week)
      intervention of either HIIT or moderate-intensity continuous exercise. Both conditions will
      include a self-regulatory component targeted to increase participants' confidence to engage
      in regular, independent exercise. The results will help determine whether HIIT is a more
      feasible option for promoting exercise adherence for pre diabetes prevention than the
      traditional moderate-intensity continuous exercise. The investigators hypothesize that a)
      over the 12 months follow-up subjects randomized to the HIIT will be more likely to adhere
      when compared to moderate-intensity continuous exercise, b) over the 12 months follow-up
      subjects randomized to HIIT will have higher rates of adherence and levels of total physical
      activity, c) greater increases in self-regulation (including goal setting, self-monitoring,
      and self-regulatory efficacy) following HIIT will mediate higher rates of adherence, d)
      10-days of HIIT and moderate-intensity continuous exercise will improve cardiorespiratory
      fitness, increase insulin sensitivity, reduce circulating inflammatory markers, and improve
      glucose control and e) Improvements in cardiometabolic health factors will be greater
      following HIIT compared to moderate-intensity continuous exercise.

      Eligible participants will be randomized to the HIIT or moderate-intensity continuous
      exercise conditions. Each condition will involve a two-week supervised exercise period
      consisting of ten sessions. Exercise prescriptions for each condition will be progressive in
      nature over the two week supervised period and will be matched for external work.
      Specifically, individuals randomized to HIIT will begin with four intervals lasting 1-minute
      each at ~85-90% peak oxygen uptake [VO2peak] and increased to 10 X 1-min intervals by day 10.
      Individuals randomized to moderate-intensity exercise condition will begin with 20 minutes of
      continuous activity at ~55-60% V02peak and gradually increase the duration to 50 minutes by
      day 10. Participants will self-select exercise modality (walking outdoors, elliptical
      machine, treadmill walking, or stationary cycling). One trainer will supervise participants
      during the 2-week training program. Participants will complete 3 of the 10 training days (day
      4, 7 and 9) at home unsupervised. Participants will wear a heart rate monitor during each
      exercise session (supervised and unsupervised) to monitor exercise intensity and ensure
      compliance. In addition, participants will record their exercise bouts in a logbook on both
      lab and home training days.

      Participants in both conditions received 10 minutes of behavioural counseling each day they
      trained in the lab (for a total of 70 minutes). Following the supervised training,
      participants will be instructed to maintain HIIT or moderate-intensity continuous exercise
      three days per week independently. Specifically, individuals randomized to HIIT will be
      prescribed three exercise sessions per week involving 10 X 1-minute intervals at ~85-90%
      VO2peak, while participants randomized to moderate-intensity continuous exercise will be
      prescribed three session per week of 50-minute continuous exercise at ~55-60% VO2peak.
      Training logs will be provided and participants will be instructed to estimate exercise
      intensity based on physiological cues taught during supervised training days.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-month follow-up and 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak), an objective measure of fitness and habitual activity, will be used as an integrative measure of exercise adherence (and overall health) at 6-month and 12-month follow-up. Specifically, peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) will be assessed by a maximal cycling exercise test. Power output will begin at 30 W and increase by 15 W/min until volitional exhaustion. Expired gas samples will be collected continuously and VO2 measured by a metabolic cart (Parvomedics TrueOne 2400). The mean of the two highest 30 s average values will define VO2peak. VO2peak will be confirmed using standard criteria110. A Polar chest strap, which is integrated to the metabolic cart and cycle ergometer (Lode Excalibur), will capture Heart Rate. Peak power output will be recorded as the highest value attained.</description>

    <measure>Changes in insulin sensitivity and inflammation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention, 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in insulin sensitivity and inflammation will be examined. Specifically fasting blooding samples will be taken to assess markers of insulin sensitivity (glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR) and inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin [IL]-6, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha).</description>

    <measure>Changes in acute affect during exercise sessions</measure>
    <time_frame>Repeated measurements on Day 1, Day 6 and Day 9 of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The acute affective response to exercise will be assessed using the 1-item Feeling Scale (FS). The FS is the most frequently used measure of in-task exercise feelings of pleasure/displeasure. Consistent with our established laboratory protocol for assessing and comparing affect in intermittent and continuous exercise bouts, feeling scale will be assessed immediately pre- and post-exercise, and at the beginning (2.5%), middle (42.5%), and end (92.5%) of workout completion. These time points correspond to the midpoint of the first, fifth, and tenth interval within the HIIT protocol. Measurements of affect will be taken in Day 1, Day 6 and Day 9 of the 10-day intervention.</description>

    <measure>Changes in exercise enjoyment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post intervention, 6- and 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) will be used to assess perceived enjoyment at baseline and post intervention. This 18-item measure is scored on a 7-point bipolar scale based on the instruction; &quot;Please rate how you feel at the moment about the physical activity you have been doing:&quot;. Example items are &quot;it's not very refreshing/It's very refreshing&quot; and &quot;I would rather be doing something else/there is nothing else I would rather be doing&quot;. Items are summed to produce an overall enjoyment score out of 126.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in average blood glucose at day 9 of the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Intervention day 9</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in average blood glucose from baseline to day 9 of the intervention will be measured using the CGMS iPro2 (Medtronic, Northridge, CA). The CGM records glucose values in a blinded fashion using a small microneedle inserted into the subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue that is connected to a recorder that quantifies interstitial glucose values every 5 minutes for up to three days. Finger stick blood glucose samples, taken four times per day, are used as calibrators to create a 24-hr blood glucose curve, which are downloaded upon device removal and analyzed for: i) average blood glucose, ii) 2 hr postprandial area under the glucose curve, iii) post-meal spikes, and iv) overall glycemic stability. Participants wearing the CGM will be provided a standardized diet (~24 kcal/kg, 60% carbohydrates, 27% fat, 13% protein) to consume during each 24 hr monitoring period. CGM data will be collected at baseline and day 9 of training.</description>

    <measure>Change in Affective and Instrumental Attitudes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, intervention day 6, post-intervention, 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Affective attitudes towards physical activity will be assessed using the procedures outlined by Ajzen (2002). Specifically, a 7-point semantic differential scale will be used, with anchors including &quot;Enjoyable—Unenjoyable&quot;, &quot;Pleasant—Unpleasant&quot;, &quot;Interesting—Boring&quot;. Previous research has found support for both the internal consistency and predictive utility of scores derived from this instrument.</description>
