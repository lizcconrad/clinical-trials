    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether the new crosslinked hyaluronan hydrogel
      was safe to use, and was effective for the prevention/reduction of adhesion formation
      following gynecological surgery

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postsurgical adhesions are a common medical complication of gynecologic and pelvic surgeries,
      and are frequently associated with chronic or recurrent pelvic pain, intestinal obstruction
      and infertility. This randomized, controlled, multicenter, clinical study was designed to
      evaluate the safety and performance of the new crosslinked hyaluronan hydrogel versus the
      standard of care for the reduction of postoperative adhesions in subjects undergoing
      laparoscopic surgeries. Subjects were scheduled to return at 9 weeks after the initial
      surgical procedure. At that time, a second-look laparoscopy was performed for postsurgical
      adhesion assessment. Adhesions were graded using a modified American Fertility Society (mAFS)
      scoring system.
