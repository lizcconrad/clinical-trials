      Investigators aimed to investigate whether training can increase fitness levels in patients
      with myotonia, and thereby reduce the symptom of myotonia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators aimed to investigate whether a 10-week bicycle exercise program can increase
      fitness levels in patients with myotonia, and thereby reduce the symptom of myotonia in
      everyday life. The effect on myotonia is assessed by a standardized myotonia scale with six
      statements concerning self-rated myotonia, and a number of performance tests that objectively
      describes the degree of myotonia.

      The effect of the training program is assessed by an incremental test, measuring maximal
      oxygen uptake, maximal heart rate and maximal workload. The muscle enzyme creatine kinase
      (CK) is measured in plasma to follow muscle injury and safety during the training.

    <time_frame>Week 0 and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in myotonia is assessed before and after 10 weeks of exercise training. Myotonia is measured as self-assessment of myotonia using the Myotonia Behavior Scale every day in a week before training start and every day in a week before training finish. Furthermore, myotonia is measured as changes in time climbing a 14 steps stair before and after the 10 weeks training period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in fitness</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and after week 10</time_frame>
    <description>An incremental test is performed at baseline and in the end of 10 weeks training. The primary outcome is change between the two tests in maximal oxygen consumption and work load.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in creatine Kinase</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 2, week 4, week 7 and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Creatine Kinase (CK) is measure in plasma to follow muscle injury during the trial.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in other myotonia</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and after week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Myotonia assessed by eye-open-close test, hand open-close test, and by up-and-go test. The three performance tests describe objectively the degree of myotonia.
The outcome measure is changes between before and after training.</description>
