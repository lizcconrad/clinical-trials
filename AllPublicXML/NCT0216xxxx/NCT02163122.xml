  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot trial in cat allergic participants, designed to compare allergic responses in
      each participant to a specific allergen by two methods of exposure. The methods of exposure
      to be used are: the environment exposure chamber (EEC) and nasal allergen challenge (NAC).
      Potential participants will be screened for evidence of cat allergy.

      Participants with a range of allergic sensitivities to cat allergen will be enrolled. To help
      ensure some breadth in the level of allergic sensitivity among participants, individuals with
      both high and low exposures to cat allergens in their daily lives will be enrolled.

         27. Any clinically significant physical findings of nasal anatomical deformities
             (including the presence of nasal mucosal ulceration, nasal polyps, purulent
