      -  Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesized that Pentoxifylline has potent
           anti-inflammatory effect which can augment the antimicrobial effect of antibiotics in
           treatment of Late onset sepsis (LOS) in preterm infants thus decreasing neonatal
           mortality and morbidity.

        -  The purpose of this study: to assess the efficacy and safety of Pentoxifylline as an
           adjunct to antibiotic therapy on mortality and morbidity of preterm infants with LOS.

  <detailed_description>

      -  Role of pentoxifylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, in reducing mortality associated
           with neonatal sepsis is not well studied.

        -  Hypothesis: we hypothesized that Pentoxifylline has potent anti-inflammatory effect
           which can augment the antimicrobial effect of antibiotics in treatment of Late onset
           sepsis (LOS) in preterm infants thus decreasing neonatal mortality and morbidity.

        -  Purpose of the study: to assess the efficacy and safety of Pentoxifylline as an adjunct
           to antibiotic therapy on mortality and morbidity of preterm infants with LOS.

        -  Design: A prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial.

        -  Setting: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Mansoura University Children's Hospital.

        -  Patients: 120 preterm infants with suspected or confirmed LOS.

        -  Intervention: Enrolled infants were randomly assigned to receive intravenous
           Pentoxifylline (5 mg/kg/hr for 6 hours on 6 successive days) or placebo in addition to
           antibiotics.

        -  Primary outcome: Death before hospital discharge.

        -  Secondary outcomes: Length of hospital stay, duration of respiratory support, duration
           of antibiotics use, chronic lung disease, necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular
           hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity, Serum levels of
           Tumor necrosis factor, C-Reactive protein levels, and adverse effects of Pentoxifylline.
