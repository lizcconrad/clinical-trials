      The purpose of this study is to determine whether school gardens influence children's dietary
      intake, nutritional knowledge, and other outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schools in New York, Washington State, Iowa, and Arkansas were randomly assigned to receive
      school gardens and associated curriculum or to serve on the wait list control group that
      received gardens and curriculum at the end of the 2-year study. Baseline data were collected
      in Fall 2011. Garden interventions began in Spring 2012. Follow-up data were collected at 6,
      12, 18 months following baseline data collection.

    <description>fruit + vegetables planted, harvested; methods of fruit and vegetable distribution; and garden-based lessons delivered to the class are measures at each wave of data collection from Fall 2011 to Spring 2013.</description>

    <measure>change in Nutritional Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to follow-up at 6, 12, 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>In the classroom, children complete a 7-item multiple choice questionnaire developed by the Healthy Gardens, Healthy Youth curriculum development team. The questionnaire includes items about plant science (e.g., Which part of the plant uses the sun's energy to make food? root, stem, leaf, flower) and nutrition (e.g., Which nutrient supplies our bodies with energy? fiber, carbohydrates, water, vitamins). Data represent the number of correct answers.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in Science Technology Engineering Math (STEM) self efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline (Fall 2011) to follow-up at 6, 12, 18 months.</time_frame>
    <description>In the classroom, children complete a 15-item questionnaire, derived from the Science Process Skills Inventory (SPSI) (Arnold &amp; Bourdeau, 2009) and the Iowa 4-H Science Youth Self-Assessment (Staker, 2011). Items include, for example: &quot;I can do an experiment to answer a question&quot; and &quot;I can develop a plan for a good garden I want to plant&quot; with response options &quot;Disagree.&quot; &quot;Not Sure.&quot; or &quot;Agree&quot; denoted 1, 2, or 3 respectively. The STEM self-efficacy score range is thus 15-45, with higher scores indicating that participant has stronger positive beliefs in their abilities to use STEM to solve problems.</description>
