  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) occurs at least 11% of adolescents and approximately 53-90%
      of those adolescents have insomnia. If left untreated, insomnia increases the risk of relapse
      and recurrence of depressive episodes, unintentional injuries, poor school performance,
      substance use, obesity, and the risk for suicide. This project seeks to develop a
      nonpharmacological treatment for insomnia in adolescents with depression that is feasible and
      effective. The specific methodologies that will help accomplish these results are: 1) use of
      focus groups of adolescents with depression and insomnia to determine how the current
      standard, nonpharmacological treatment for insomnia (cognitive-behavioral therapy for
      insomnia; CBTI) among adults can be modified for use by adolescents with depression and 2)
      determine the preliminary effectiveness, feasibility, and tolerability of group CBTI in
      adolescents with depression (CBTI-AD) developed using feedback from the focus groups. This
      project will help to improve the quality and scope of delivery of mental health services in
      Michigan by a) gaining a greater understanding of how sleep disturbance may perpetuate
      depression in adolescents and b) to provide mental health professionals with a
      nonpharmacological treatment option for insomnia in adolescents with depression.
