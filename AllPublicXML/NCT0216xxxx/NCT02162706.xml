    <textblock>
      Cortisol is a hormone critical for survival in times of stress. Currently most measurements
      are done with blood samples. The hypothesis of this study is cortisol measured from saliva
      using mass spectrometry can be used to replace measurements by blood.

      Cortisol levels change depending on the time of day. Salivary samples were collected from
      health controls at bedtime, midnight and first morning waking on two consecutive nights and
      salivary cortisol levels were measured using mass spectrometry. In a patients with possible
      endocrine disorders who were going through an adrenocortiotropin stimulation test for adrenal
      insufficiency, salivary cortisol was measured prior to giving cosyntropin and 30-40 minutes
      after cosyntropin.
