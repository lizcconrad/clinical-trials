    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With Improved Pain Relief and/or Stimulation Side Effects During the Automatic Control Arm Relative to the Manual Control Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>20 days</time_frame>
    <description>After subjects experience both automatic and manual control after 20 days, subjects are asked to compare pain relief and stimulation side effects between the two arms of the study (blinded) in two separate domains using two 5-point Likert scales. The outcome measure for the primary objective is the percentage of subjects who report improved pain relief with no worsening of stimulation side-effects or improved stimulation side-effects with no loss of pain relief during the automatic control arm relative to the manual control arm. These subjects were considered successful for the primary outcome.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients enrolled in this study must meet the following inclusion criteria:

          1. Have been diagnosed with chronic, intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs (VAS â‰¥
             5), which has been refractory to conservative therapy for a minimum of 3 months.

          2. Have been approved to undergo a trial of SCS.

          3. Be an appropriate candidate for the surgical procedures required in this study based
             on the clinical judgment of the implanting physician

          4. Be on a stable dose (no new, discontinued, or changes in dose) of all prescribed pain
             medication for at least 4 weeks prior to the trial

          5. Be 18 years of age or older at the time of enrollment

          6. Be willing and capable of giving informed consent

          7. Be willing and able to comply with study-related requirements, procedures, and visits

          8. Females of childbearing age must have a negative urine pregnancy test at baseline

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients enrolled in this study must not meet the following exclusion criteria:

          1. Have a medical condition or pain in other area(s), not intended to be treated with
             SCS, that could interfere with study procedures, accurate pain reporting, and/or
             confound evaluation of study endpoints, as determined by the Investigator

          2. Have evidence of an active disruptive psychological or psychiatric disorder or other
             known condition significant enough to impact perception of pain, compliance of
             intervention and/or ability to evaluate treatment outcomes

          3. Are not a surgical candidate due to a diagnosis of a coagulation disorder, bleeding
             diathesis, progressive peripheral vascular disease or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus

          4. Have a diagnosis of scoliosis that precludes lead placement

          5. Have a condition, treatable with SCS, that requires leads to be inserted into the
             cervical region

          6. Have an existing drug pump and/or SCS system or another active implantable device such
             as a pacemaker

          7. Have a condition currently requiring or likely to require the use of MRI or diathermy

          8. Have pain due to a malignant disease

          9. Have a life expectancy of less than 1 year

         10. Have an active systemic or local infection

         11. Be allergic, or have shown hypersensitivity, to any materials of the neurostimulation
             system which come in contact with the body

         12. Be pregnant or nursing (if female and sexually active, subject must be using a
             reliable form of birth control, be surgically sterile or be at least 2 years
             post-menopausal)

         13. Have within 6 months of enrollment a significant untreated addiction to dependency
             producing medications or have been a substance abuser (including alcohol and/or
             illicit drugs)

         14. Be concomitantly participating in another clinical study

         15. Be involved in an injury claim under current litigation

         16. Have a pending or approved worker's compensation claim
