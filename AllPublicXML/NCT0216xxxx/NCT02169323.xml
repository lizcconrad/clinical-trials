  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence that non-eosinophilic asthmatics are less sensitive to inhaled
      corticosteroids (ICS) than eosinophilic asthmatics.

      As non-eosinophilic asthmatic patients are treated by ICS according to international
      guidelines for asthma, the investigators would like to investigate whether stepping-down of
      ICS in these patients may be safe. Indeed, the investigators can reasonably expect that a
      progressive cessation of ICS is possible in some of these patients without any clinical
      worsening.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients whose asthma is not controlled at the beginning of the study, a step-up of the
      treatment is planned to the step 4 of Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA). This step-up will
      last for 3 months and will permit to ensure that these patients achieve the best possible
      level of asthma control. A progressive step-down of the inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) will
      then be achieved.

      For patients whose asthma is controlled at the beginning of the study, a progressive
      step-down of the ICS will be directly achieved.

      The progressive step-down of the ICS dose will be undertaken every 3 months according to the
      dose levels defined by GINA guidelines (from high to low daily dose) until a complete
      cessation of the ICS for 6 months. Other associated asthma treatment of asthma will be kept
      unchanged.

      At each quarterly visit, a clinical composite outcome will be measured, for each patient.
      This composite outcome includes the score of asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) and the
      number of exacerbations. This outcome will determine at each visit if patients continue the
      study (success criterion) or stop the study (failure criterion). The success criterion is
      defined in the section &quot;Current Primary Outcome&quot;
