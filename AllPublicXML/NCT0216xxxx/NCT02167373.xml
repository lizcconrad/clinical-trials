    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of a mobile sensing platform in a
      primary care setting has an effect on provider workflows, patient outcomes, patient
      engagement, patient self-help behavior, health research, and total cost of care.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Engagement</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at six months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient engagement will be assessed through frequency of patient use of the mobile technology, no-show rate at appointments, and completion of treatment homework assignments in the last six months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Help Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at six months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-help behavior will be measured through change in behavior patterns, usage of the mobile application, and requests for additional resources in the last six months.</description>
