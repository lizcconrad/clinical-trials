  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with an allergy to iodine based intravenous contrast cannot undergo a CT scan with
      contrast, unless they are premedicated. Premedication can result in a delay in diagnosis,
      that can be significant with acute conditions such as Pulmonary embolism.

      The investigators are evaluating the use of Gadolinium as an alternative contrast agent in
      CT. Gadolinium has been used extensively in MRI exams but the dose that is used is not
      sufficient to provide good enhancement on CT. Dual Energy CT is a new technology that has
      better sensitivity to lower doses of intravenous contrast and the investigators aim to study
      its effectiveness in improving the enhancement with Gadolinium. The investigators will
      compare enhancement of Iodine with enhancement of Gadolinium during Dual Energy CT, to assess
      the possibility that Gadolinium could be used as an alternative for patients who are
      suspected of having Pulmonary embolism. They will recruit up to 50 patients who are having a
      routine Chest CT during treatment for a malignancy and administer Gadolinium contrast and
      Iodine contrast during a chest CT exam. The enhancement with the two agents can be compared.

      Although safe in most patients, iodine may be associated with lifethreatening adverse events,
      particularly in high-risk patient. This application is of particular clinical significance in
      patients with conditions like pulmonary embolism which could be fatal. CT pulmonary angiogram
      (CTPA) with sensitivity of 83-100% and specificity of 89-97% is currently the gold standard
      for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. However, in patients who have allergy to iodinated
      contrast agent, CTPA cannot be performed. Gadolinium based contrast agent can serve as a
      viable alternative in such patients and can be used for Gadolinium enhanced MR pulmonary
      angiography (MRPA) and CTPA. Gadolinium enhanced MRPA however has inherent limitations in
      evaluating pulmonary embolism as evident from multicentre prospective study (PIOPED III)
      which reported technically inadequate exams in as many as 25% of patients (range 11% to 52%).
      The MRPA sensitivity was also low in the range of 78%. Moreover, unlike CT, low spatial and
      temporal resolution of MR hampers precise evaluation of lung parenchyma. Previously
      investigators have evaluated gadolinium enhanced CTPA on a single energy CT (SECT) at
      different tube potential (80 - 120 kV) and reported encouraging results. However, these
      patients received higher volume of gadolinium contrast (mean 53 ml, range 30-64 ml) and in
      spite, the scans performed at 120 kV demonstrated overall suboptimal pulmonary artery
      enhancement. These limitations can be potentially over come with dual-energy CT which
      simultaneously acquires low and high energy data. From this data, monochromatic images can be
      reconstructed at any desired energy from 40 keV to 140 keV.

      The investigators aim to recruit up to 50 patients who will guide in determining gadolinium
      contrast volume, injection rate and image delay required to maximize pulmonary arterial
      enhancement.
