  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior research has documented serious health, mental health, and social-behavioral issues
      among people living with HIV (PLH) in St. Petersburg. The investigators have established that
      PLH are clustered in friendship groups with other HIV+ persons and that an intervention
      delivered to groups composed of HIV+ men who have sex with men (MSM) who were friends in real
      life reduced mental health distress more than individual counseling. Specific aims of the
      collaborative mixed-methods, qualitative/ quantitative research are to: (1) identify
      facilitators and barriers of medical care attendance and ART adherence among PLH in St.
      Petersburg; (2) integrate these data into an intervention designed to increase HIV care
      attendance, retention, and adherence; (3) carry out a test-of-concept pilot study that
      recruits groups of PLH friends and delivers an intervention to intact PLH friendship groups
      to encourage mutual social support for attending medical appointments and adhering to HIV
      care; and (4) evaluate the effects of the intervention on both behavioral and biological
      measures, including viral load. These specific aims will be achieved by research carried out
      in two phases:

      In Phase I, we will conduct in-depth interviews with 60 PLH and key informants in St.
      Petersburg purposively selected to include HIV+ persons in and not in medical care, adherent
      or not adherent to ART, and including men and women representing diverse exposure risks.
      In-depth interviews will be analyzed to identify factors associated with attending or not
      attending care and adhering or not adhering to ART, as well as identifying how HIV+ friends
      can support one another in HIV care entry, retention, and adherence.

      In Phase II, the investigators will undertake a randomized intervention pilot study in which
      20 groups of PLH friends are recruited by enrolling a PLH seed who is not reliably in care or
      is ART nonadherent and then recruiting all friends known by the seed to also be HIV+. A
      7-session group intervention will be undertaken with all members of the friendship groups in
      the experimental condition to increase care and adherence-related social support,
      problem-solving, and mutual assistance for care. Baseline to 6-month followup data will
      determine whether the intervention produces greater improvement than found in the comparison
      group in care attendance and treatment adherence, improved mental health, lower substance
      use, and lower HIV viral load.

    <description>Participants will be trained to give one another ongoing, theory-based but personally-tailored advice, recommendations, and support to encourage entry to HIV medical care, remaining in care, and adhering to medication regimens when they are prescribed.
