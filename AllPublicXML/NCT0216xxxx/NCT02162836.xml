    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of JNJ-56021927 in
      Japanese participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC- prostate
      cancer that is resistant to medical [for example. hormonal] or surgical treatments).

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label (participants will know the identity of study drug
      received) study in participants with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC).
      The study consists of 4 parts: Screening (28 days before study commences on Day 1),
      pharmacokinetic week (PK), Continuous daily dosing, Extension and Safety follow-up period. In
      PK week participants will receive a single oral capsule of JNJ-56021927 at a dose of 240
      milligram (mg) on Day 1 and will be monitored for 1 week. After Week 1, in continuous daily
      dosing period, participants will receive continuous daily therapy at the same dose for 4
      weeks (Cycle 1). After Cycle 1 participants, who will not meet the criteria for
      discontinuation listed such as progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity, will
      continue in safety follow-up period and will receive continuous daily therapy at the same
      dose up to cycle 13. Primarily dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be evaluated. Participants'
      safety will be monitored throughout.
