  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of supratherapeutic doses of
      RO7033877 (Part 1) and to investigate the effect of RO7033877 on the QTc interval in healthy
      volunteers (Part 2). Part 1 is a single ascending dose, randomized, observer-blind,
      placebo-controlled study to determine the safety tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a
      supratherapeutic dose to be used in Part 2. Participants will be randomized in up to 8
      cohorts to receive a single dose of either RO7033877 or placebo. Part 2 will be a single
      dose, randomized, double-blind, double dummy, placebo-controlled, positive control, 4-way
      crossover study. Part 2 will evaluate whether a single therapeutic or supratherapeutic dose
      of RO7033877 has a threshold pharmacologic effect on cardiac repolarization, as detected by
      changes in the QT/QTc interval measured by electrocardiogram (ECG). Pharmacokinetic
      parameters will be assessed for Parts 1 and 2, continuous ECG recordings will be evaluated in
      Part 2.
