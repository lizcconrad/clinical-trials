        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of written informed consent prior to any study related procedures

          -  Males aged 18 years or older

          -  ECOG performance status of less than or equal to 1

          -  Life expectancy of 10 years or more (using MSKCC nomogram)

          -  Pathological proven prostate carcinoma at intermediate to high risk of recurrence as
             defined by RTOG

          -  Clinically negative lymph nodes as established by imaging (pelvic CT / MRI), nodal
             sampling, or dissection within 60 days prior to registration, except patients with
             lymph nodes equivocal or questionable by imaging are eligible without biopsy if the
             nodes are less than or equal to 1.5cm; any node larger than this ion imaging will
             require negative biopsy for eligibility

          -  No evidence of bone metastases on bone scan within 60 days prior to registration.
             Equivocal bone scan findings are allowed if plain film x-rays are negative for
             metastasis.

               -  Haemoglobin greater than or equal to 10.0g/dl

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.8 × 10 to the power of 9/L

               -  Platelets ≥ 100 × 10 to the power of 9/L

          -  Systolic blood pressure &lt; 160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure &lt; 95 mmHg [Note:
             medically controlled hypertension is permitted]

             than or equal to 30 cm cubed at baseline

             LHRH agonist, anti-androgen, or bilateral orchidectomy; prior or concomitant
             chemotherapy for prostate cancer; prior radiotherapy including brachytherapy to the
             region of study cancer; radical local treatment [Exception: Transuretheral Resection
             of the Prostate (TRUP) / TRUS is allowed]

             failure, or Class II to IV heart failure of cardiac ejection fraction measurement of
             &lt;50%

          -  Major thoracic or abdominal surgery or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks
             prior to registration, or planned surgery during study participation / within 4 weeks
             from end of treatment [Note: patients with planned surgical procedures to be conducted
             under local anaesthesia are not excluded from the study]

          -  Gastrointestinal disorder interfering with study drug absorption

          -  Active or uncontrolled disease that may require oral corticosteroid therapy

          -  Positive serology for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody

          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity or intolerance to abiraterone acetate, prednisolone,
             GnRH agonists or their excipients

          -  Contraindications to the use of prednisolone or GnRH agonists per local prescribing
             information

          -  Evidence of any other significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that makes
             it undesirable for the patient to participate in the study

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the
             well-being of the patient or that could prevent, limit, or confound the
             protocol-specified assessments

          -  The patient has or had othe co-existing malignancies within the past 5 years, other
             than resected non-melanoma skin cancer

          -  Treatment with non-approved or investigational drug within 30 days before the first
             planned dose of study drug
