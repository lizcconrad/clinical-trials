    <textblock>
      The study goes on 24 months, with recruiting, treatment and follow period for all patients.
      The first day for each patient will be the first cellular administration. 3 doses will be
      administrated every 3 months from first dose.

      When the clinical trial finishes, it will be done a completed check of all obtained
      parameters.

      It is a clinical trial phase I, single center, non-randomized, uncontrolled, open prospective
      follow-up of a cohort of patients with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) .10 patients will be
      included with this injury.

      Primary objective: Analyze the possible clinical efficacy of administration of main adult
      mesenchymal autologous cells expanded &quot;in vitro&quot; in patients with incomplete and chronically
      established SCI.

      Secondary objectives: Confirm the safety of treatment, and study possible changes in the
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell
      line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), ciliary neurotrophic
      factor (CNTF), Nerve Growth Factor 3 and 4(NT3 and NT4) after subarachnoid administration of
      BMMC.
