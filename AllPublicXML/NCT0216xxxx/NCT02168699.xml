  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Localizing the musculocutaneous nerve for neural blockade is crucial to achieve complete
      anesthesia of the forearm. However, in pediatric anesthesiology, the musculocutaneous nerve
      is unable to be blocked in up to 40-50% of cases when only neurostimulation is used, while
      there is limited information regarding ultrasound imaging of the musculocutaneous nerve in
      children.

      The aim of this prospective imaging study is to investigate whether musculocutaneous nerve is
      visualized in childhood with the use of ultrasound imaging or not. A secondary aim of this
      study is to assess the percentage of its visualization according to the age.

      Parental written informed consent is obtained from all participants. The children are divided
      into three groups according to their age: Group 1, with infants aged less than 12 months;
      Group 2, with toddlers and preschoolers; and Group 3, with school-aged children (6.5-12
      years).

      Children are placed in the supine position with the involved arm abducted at 90° and the
      elbow flexed at 90°. The linear probe of a portable ultrasound machine is placed at the
      axillary region, perpendicularly to the axillary artery. The musculocutaneous nerve is
      searched near the axillary artery (proximally) and its course is followed distally (into the
      coracobrachialis muscle). Its sonographic detection is recorded in these two sites, both
      proximally and distally.
