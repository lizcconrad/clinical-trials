  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Analyze and evaluate the skeletal muscle of patients affected with hemophilia in the Region
      of Murcia.

        -  Describe the periarticular muscular deficit of the lower limbs, depending on the degree
           of injury: acute and chronic, or subacute.

        -  Identify the range of motion of joints with higher prevalence of hemophilic arthropathy.

        -  Detect the biomechanical changes of the lower limbs and their impact on gait in patients
           with hemophilia.

        -  Assess the factors that influence the perception of illness and quality of life of
           patients with hemophilia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Descriptive study of joint involvement in hemophilia patients with and without a history of
      hemarthrosis in lower limbs.

      Descriptive study of alterations in the strength of the periarticular muscles of lower limbs
      as a result of acute conditions or the development of chronic articular sequelae.

      Descriptive study of the biomechanical alterations in weight-bearing joints of lower limbs
      and their impact on gait in patients with hemophilia.

      Descriptive study of the relationship between skeletal muscle pathology in patients with
      hemophilia and their perceptions of it and their quality of life.
