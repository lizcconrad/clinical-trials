  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the safety and feasibility of an acellular dermal template (Novomaix), combined
      with split thickness skin grafts, for use in patients with full thickness skin defects, is
      tested. Results will be compared intra-patient with those obtained after conventional
      treatment with split thickness skin grafts. We expect this treatment to be safe, and to
      provide better outcome regarding scar quality.

      Using dermal substitutes in combination with a split-thickness skin graft (STSG) is a well
      acknowledged therapy in burns and reconstructive surgery. Nevertheless, the ideal substitute
      is not available yet. We therefore want to investigate the use of an acellular dermal
      template (Novomaix), in combination with STSG, to treat these defects. Adult patients with
      acute (burn) wounds (group 1) and scars (group 2) will be included in this study. This phase
      I study aims to investigate the safety and feasibility of the use of this dermal matrix, with
      regard to graft take, epithelialisation and complications after transplantation. Moreover,
      scar quality will be evaluated.
