      INTRODUCTION Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a life-saving treatment for end-stage renal disease
      patients. However, cardiovascular disease remains the major cause of morbidity and mortality
      in PD patients. It is now realized that chronic asymptomatic intravascular hypervolemia is an
      important cause of cardiovascular disease in PD patients.

      OBJECTIVES To determine the effects of treating asymptomatic fluid overload on blood
      pressure, hospitalization and cardiovascular morbidity in PD patients.

      HYPOTHESIS The investigators hypothesize that treating asymptomatic fluid overload could
      improve the clinical outcome of PD patients.

      DESIGN &amp; SUBJECTS This is an open label randomized control trial. The investigators plan to
      recruit 60 PD patients with asymptomatic fluid overload, defined as overhydration (OH) ≥ 2
      liters. Patients will be randomized to active fluid management (treatment arm) or
      conventional management (control arm).

      STUDY INSTRUMENTS Overhydration will be identified by bioimpedance spectroscopy.

      INTERVENTIONS For the treatment arm, active fluid management includes dietary counseling,
      diuretics, and intensive dialysis regimen. For the control arm, patients will only receive
      dietary counseling. Patients will be followed for one year.

      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Blood pressure control, number of hospital admission and duration of
      hospitalization for all cause, and hospitalization for cardiovascular disease during the
      study period.

      DATA ANALYSIS Blood pressure control will be compared by Student's t test. Hospitalization
      data will be compared by non-parametric Mann Whitney U test.

      EXPECTED RESULTS The study will determine the benefit of treating asymptomatic fluid overload
      in PD patients.

      The investigators plan to recruit 60 PD patients with asymptomatic fluid overload, which is
      defined as overhydration (OH) ≥ 2 liters as measured by bioimpedance spectroscopy. Patients
      with clinical symptoms of fluid overload (including, but not restricted to, dyspnea on
      exertion, peripheral edema, pulmonary congestion) will be excluded. The investigators will
      also exclude patients who are in overt pulmonary edema and required urgent medical care, who
      have cognitive impairment or problem of communication, unlikely to survive for more than
      three months, have mechanical problems of the dialysis catheter, or have active peritonitis
      or peritoneal failure.
