    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 3 prospective, randomised, parallel-group, active controlled, double
      blind, multicentre, international study with 2 coprimary endpoints designed to demonstrate
      equivalence in pharmacokinetics (Part 1), as well as noninferiority in efficacy (Part 2), of
      CT-P10 to Rituxan when coadministered with CVP and to assess efficacy and safety in patients
      with advanced (stage III-IV) FL. Part 1 and Part 2 of the study will run in parallel.

             vincristine.

          2. Patient has allergies or hypersensitivity to murine, chimeric, human or humanised
             proteins, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, or prednisone.

          3. Patient has evidence of histological transformation to high-grade or diffuse large
             B-cell lymphoma.

          4. Patient has known central nervous system involvement.

          5. Patient has received previous treatment for NHL:

               -  Previous treatment including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or
                  surgery (except previous biopsy)

               -  All doses of corticoid therapy for treatment of NHL

               -  Corticoid therapy during the previous 4 weeks from Day 1 of Cycle 1 with
                  prednisone &gt;20 mg per day for the treatment for any purpose
