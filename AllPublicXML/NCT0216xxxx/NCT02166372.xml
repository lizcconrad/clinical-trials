  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T2DM has become a major health burden for our society. More and more data support the
      relative effectiveness of gastrointestinal metabolic surgery, known as bariatric surgery, in
      the remission of T2DM of BMI less35. The metabolic surgery guidelines of IDF recommend BMI
      over 27.5 in Asia.

      The evidence reviewed above strongly points to the need for a large randomized, controlled
      trial to evaluate the risks and benefits of obesity surgery in the treatment of type 2
      diabetes Mellitus. This study is expected to provide very significant findings about the
      natural course of diabetes in obese diabetic patients.

      This study will recruit 200 obese T2DM patients at MSGH, for a total of 1000 in Taiwan. The
      inclusion criteria are those with T2DM more than 6 months, under medical management in
      diabetes center, BMI over 25, age between 20 and 67 years. The goals of this study are to
      evaluate the nature course of the diabetes for 10 years. The primary outcomes for the
      treatment will be assessed every year after intervention and will be composite of CVD risk
      factor; specifically, the proportion of patients with HbA1c &lt; 7%, LDL cholesterol &lt; 100 mg/dl
      and systolic blood pressure &lt; 140 mmHg.
