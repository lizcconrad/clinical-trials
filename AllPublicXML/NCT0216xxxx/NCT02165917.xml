  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a common disease of women in the reproductive age and is an important cause
      for female infertility. Endometriosis is often associated with the development of adhesions
      which further compromises the fertility of the affected women. The main purpose of this study
      is to investigate the pregnancy rate one year after excision of endometriosis and application
      of GnRH-analogues (Gonadotropin-releasing hormone) for 3 month. Half of the patients will
      receive traditional endometriosis treatment with the excision of the endometriotic lesions
      only. The other half will additionally receive a gel which can reduce adhesion formation
      (Hyalobarrier速). Further study objective is the investigation in the development of different
      types of endometriosis-associated pain over a period of one year. Potential study
      participants are women with endometriosis-associated pain and with a desire to have children.
      It will be investigated in the study if the use of Hyalobarrier速 will result in a higher
      pregnancy rate due to reduced adhesion development.

      Design: Prospective, monocentric, comparative, randomized, semi-blind.

      There will be 30 subjects in each arm, who will be followed 15 months after surgery.

      Half of the patients will receive standard laparoscopic excision of the endometriotic lesions
      only. The other half, after the excision of the endometriosis foci, will receive 10 cc of an
      antiadhesion agent which contents hyaluronic acid gel (Hyalobarrier速).The subjects will be
      hospitalized after surgery for at least 2 days.

      A Vas-Scala will be given to the subjects to estimate the pain before, after surgery and one
      year after treatment. The participants will record the values each three months after
      surgery.

      All subjects will be asked by telephone for the VAS-scala values and for pregnancy (Date of
      Initiation, clinical evolution)

      The participation ist voluntary and an Informed consent must be signed before surgery.
      Subjects are free to withdraw their consent anytime.
