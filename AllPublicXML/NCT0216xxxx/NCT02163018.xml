  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no effective causal treatment for peanut allergy. A chemically modified,
      aluminium hydroxide adsorbed peanut extract (HAL-MPE1) for subcutaneous administration has
      been developed. Results from in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies demonstrate the
      immunotherapeutic potential of HAL-MPE1. Therefore, a phase I, single-centre clinical trial
      has been designed to assess the safety and tolerability of HAL-MPE1 in peanut allergic
      patients.
