  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that women who use GIM pre-operatively will feel more prepared for surgery,
      have less anxiety on the day of surgery and have higher satisfaction scores 6 weeks after
      surgery compared to women who undergo our routine pre-operative care.

      Guided imagery (GIM) is a program of directed thoughts and suggestions that guide your
      imagination to a relaxed and focused state. In clinical settings, it was originally found
      effective in treating patients suffering primarily from emotional or psychological issues by
      using descriptive language and the five senses to help the patient visualize their desired
      change or outcome (1, 2). More recently, GIM has been incorporated into chemotherapy and
      surgical settings. While it has not been conclusively found to improve outcomes, patients who
      received GIM reported feeling less anxious, less nausea following chemotherapy, slightly
      shorter surgical recovery times and a higher quality of life (3-8). While these studies
      suggest exciting prospects for the incorporation of GIM into the normal pre-op routine, we
      believe that they have left out one integral piece of the puzzle. We have previously found
      that patients who feel &quot;unprepared&quot; for surgery have less post-operative satisfaction (9). We
      propose that the stress and anxiety of the unknown during a patient's surgical experience can
      make them feel unprepared for surgery. Therefore, the same techniques that have been
      previously shown to decrease these symptoms in chemotherapy treatment and surgery should help
      patients feel more prepared, and therefore more satisfied with their surgical experience.
      This key finding would give sufficient support for the incorporation of GIM into the pre-op
      routine of any surgical patient, and may prove to be a successful vehicle for increasing the
      overall satisfaction of any hospital's patient population.

    <time_frame>6 week</time_frame>
    <description>Patient anxiety will be measured at baseline, day of surgery and at 6 weeks post op to determine how GIM affected anxiety. It will be measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), which has been used extensively in research and clinical practice since its introduction in 1966 and is the most widely cited measure of anxiety.</description>

    <description>If randomized to GIM, they will then be given an audio Compact Disc. Patients will be instructed to listen to the recording least once per day in a calm location during the week leading up to surgery. They will then be seen prior to surgery in the surgical waiting area where they will evaluated for anxiety, preparedness and study compliance.</description>

    <description>Each participant will complete a baseline set of questionnaires. The Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI) is a 20 question self-administered questionnaire on the presence and both of pelvic floor symptoms .
The Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System (POPQ) measures the topography of the vagina and is considered to be gold standard for quantifying prolapse .
The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) has been used extensively in research and clinical practice since its introduction in 1966 and is the most widely cited measure of anxiety.
New measurements at the 6-week follow-up appointment will include the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGII), and a postoperative questionnaire eliciting overall satisfaction and development of new pelvic symptoms.</description>
