      Systematically compare the phenotype and genotype of epithelial odontogenic tumors in
      children and adults with a clinical, radiographic, pathologic and molecular level.

      Either:

      establish an observatory of this multidisciplinary tumor establish a tumor bank annotated
      scale unparalleled testing pathophysiological hypotheses search for prognostic factors.

      This is an observational study with retrospective and prospective parts. In retrospective
      part be included the Patients followed between 1992 and January 2011.

      In prospective part will follow the Patients will be included after the starting of study.

      There are 2 centers :

        1. st center is in the service of Stomatology and Maxillofacial Surgery in the Pitie
           Salpetriere Hospital.

        2. nd center is in the service of Maxillofacial Surgery in hospital Armand Trousseau.

      Number of patients include in the part retrospective :

      Center N°1-300adults Center N°2-90childrens

      Number of patients include in the part prospective :

      Center N°1- 90 Center N°2- 30

      Duration of study is 3 years Duration of inclusion is 32 months Each patient will be followed
      for 4 months and for further up to 3 years from the first patient included.

      We envision a next circuit : obtaining consent, preoperative consultation,surgery,
      postoperative consultation N°1, postoperative consultation N°2, genetics consultation and
      monitoring of patients in 6;12;18;24 months from surgery of tumor and limited in 3 years from
      th 1st patient included.
