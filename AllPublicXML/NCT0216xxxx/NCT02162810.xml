  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of administering a course of
      postoperative oral steroids in pediatric patients undergoing proximal hypospadias repair as
      prevention against complications. Specifically, the study aims to assess if the steroids i)
      decrease the incidence of wound breakdown, fistula formation, stenosis or stricture
      formation, and the need for subsequent redo-hypospadias surgeries and/or fistula repairs and
      ii) improve the quality of wound healing including the overall cosmetic appearance of the
      phallus (i.e. location of the urethral meatus).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypospadias repair is a surgery that is, unfortunately, fraught with a high complication rate
      with problems that include urethrocutaneous fistula formation, complete wound breakdown,
      glans dehiscence, urethral diverticulum formation, retraction of the urethral meatus,
      urethral stricture, and meatal stenosis . Failure of a proximal hypospadias repair (i.e. the
      development of a post-operative complication) is unpredictable, and few modifiable risk
      factors having been identified. Complications necessitate subsequent surgical intervention
      for pediatric patients, which must be carried out under general anesthesia. Evidence
      regarding the harms of multiple general anesthetics for children is increasing. Additionally,
      with each surgical revision comes the morbidity associated with another post-surgical
      convalescence. Thus, any measure that can be gained as a way to increase the rate of success
      of proximal hypospadias repair would be of help to all pediatric urologists and patients with
      hypospadias. The proposed intervention of administering a 5 day course of placebo versus oral
      steroids at a dose equivalent to what is given for outpatient treatment of asthma
      exacerbations, is expected to have very low risk. This would be the only variation from the
      current practice and one that has never been studied in the past. Thus, it would be
      worthwhile to perform use scientific methods to determine if the administration of a short
      course of oral steroids is of benefit to healing and minimization of post-operative
      complications for hypospadias patients.

    <description>Systemic high-dose steroids (30 mg/kg methylprednisolone) have been shown in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in humans not to negatively impact wound infection or dehiscence rates, instead benefitting patients in the postoperative period in ways such as decreasing pain. An acute course of oral systemic steroids has been routinely used in patients under the age of 12 with asthma exacerbations (liquid prednisolone at 1-2 mg/kg/day in 1-2 divided doses for up to 10 days, although usually given for 5 days, which is at least 19 times less than the dose proven to be safe in the randomized controlled trial mentioned above) and proven to be safe without adverse effects.
