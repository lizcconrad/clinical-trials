  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphedema is the result of accumulation of fluid and other elements in tissue spaces because
      of an imbalance between the production of fluid interstitial and transport. Lymphedema can
      cause significant physical and psychological morbidity. Prevalence of lymphedema in patients
      after breast cancer surgery is 12-60% and the incidence is 12-26%.Psychological and social
      consequences of secondary lymphedema related breast cancer have been little recognized and
      documented. Although, it have performed many studies related secondary lymphedema it not
      found sufficient evidence in the literature to suggest the most effective treatment. There is
      some evidence suggesting that compression therapy and manual lymphatic drainage can improve
      lymphedema but more studies are needed. The aim of this research is to to evaluate the
      clinical effect of multimodal treatment (compression bandaging and manual lymph drainage)
      versus applying manual lymphatic drainage in women with arm lymphedema after breast cancer
      surgery.

      This study has two sub research: a quantitative approach and a qualitative approach. The
      research will be carried out by a multicenter way

      Quantitative approach consist in carried out a single-blind randomized controlled trial of 44
      women with arm lymphedema. Patients will be distributed in two intervention groups by a
      randomized way. Participants will be given his assignment by closed envelope. Both treatments
      will be administered five days a week for six weeks. The experimental group (n=22) will
      receive multimodal treatment: combination of manual lymphatic drainage and compression
      bandaging. The control group (n=22) only will receive manual lymphatic drainage. We want to
      determinate the effect on volume arm decrease, quality of life, level of hand strength,
      degree of pain, fatigue level, and state of anxiety and depression. The influence on the
      lymphedema will be analyzed with lower limbs strength, physical activity, lung function,
      respiratory muscle strength by maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure measurements (MIP
      and MEP) and cardiorespiratory functional capacity. Patients adherence will be analyzed by a
      smartphone.

      Qualitative apprach: to know the perceptions and experiences of the participants in both
      interventions groups through a qualitative descriptive study. Data will be obtained with
      semi-structured depth interview.
