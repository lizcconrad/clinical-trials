    <textblock>
      In this research study, biopsy samples will be collected to provide more insight into the
      underlying cause of the motility disorders, help direct further investigation into the cause
      of the underlying condition, provide future prognosis and predict response to gastric
      electrical stimulation (GES).

  <detailed_description>

      Biopsies will be collected from patients that have been diagnosed with gastroparesis (having
      nausea, retching, bloating and fullness of stomach) and are undergoing surgery for the GES
      implantation. These patients will serve as our study group population. Biopsy samples of
      those who do not have gastroparesis but are undergoing surgery on the digestive system will
      be collected after the patients consent to be on the trial. These patients will serve as our
      control group population. Detailed medical history will be collected and the study group
      patients will be asked to complete two questionnaire to assess the severity of the symptoms.
      They will be followed in the clinic at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post implantation.
