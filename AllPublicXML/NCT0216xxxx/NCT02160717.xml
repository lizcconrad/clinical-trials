  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Turner Syndrome is a common genetic disorder. Seventy percent of adults with Turner Syndrome
      have abnormalities in glucose metabolism which can lead to diabetes. The current screening
      guidelines for diabetes in Turner Syndrome are not specific and involve a fasting blood sugar
      once a year. The objective of this study is to determine if there are abnormalities in
      glucose metabolism and pancreatic function in young girls with Turner Syndrome. The study
      hypothesis is that pancreatic dysfunction (specifically of the beta cells that make insulin)
      is more prevalent in girls with Turner Syndrome compared to healthy controls.

      The study will be conducted at Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati. The study will
      require 1 visit to the hospital where the subject will have an oral glucose tolerance test
      and a physical exam
