    <textblock>
      Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in
      high-risk patients, such as immunocompromised patients. Candida is currently the predominant
      fungal pathogen in these patient populations and is associated with significant morbidity and
      a high mortality.

      Micafungin (MCF) is a semisynthetic compound belonging to the new class of antifungal agents,
      the echinocandin lipopeptides, that has potent in vitro and experimental in vivo activity
      against a variety of pathogenic Candida species and Aspergillus species. Its applied
      indications are so the treatment and/or the prophylaxis of Candida and Aspergillus
      infections. MCF is currently licensed for the treatment of candidiasis at doses of either 100
      or 150 mg a day.

      The efficacy of MCF is linked to the area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h in the
      steady state divided by the MIC (AUC0-24/ MIC ratio).

      On one hand:

      - It was demonstrated that 98% of invasive candidiasis patients with a MCF AUC/MIC ratio
      between 3 and 12 achieve microbiological clearance, as opposed to only 85% of those with an
      AUC/MIC ratio &lt; 3. In the case of infections by Candida parapsilosis, which exhibits drug
      MICs that are 50- to100-fold higher, 100% of patients with an AUC/MIC ratio &gt;285 achieve
      microbiological clearance, as opposed to 82% of those below that exposure level.(1)

      On the other hand:

        -  It is well known that patients of intensive care units (ICU) are characterized by
           particular pharmacokinetic parameters with higher apparent volume of distribution (VC/F)
           and/or higher apparent systemic clearance (CL/F). In a population of healthy volunteers,
           it was observed that CL/F of MCF presents a high interpatient variability.(2)

        -  Whether most ICUs patients achieve optimal AUC/MIC ratio thresholds at standard doses
           has not been investigated so far. In particular, lower AUCs might be reached in patients
           having the highest VC/F values. Such patients would then be at risk of therapy failure
           and would benefit from individualized-dosing strategies.

      In this context, the study of the pharmacokinetics of MCF in critically ill patients seems to
      be necessary.
