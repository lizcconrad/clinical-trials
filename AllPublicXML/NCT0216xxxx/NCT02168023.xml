  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infections (SSIs) constitute an important medical and socioeconomic problem
      worldwide. Despite the fact that the risk factors for SSIs were identified and the
      continuously increasing medical knowledge in the fields of tissue engineering, molecular
      biology and microbiology facilitated the development of numerous new recommendations and
      methods for management, in many cases the available options for successful treatment of
      post-operative wound infections remain limited. Non-treated or inappropriately treated SSIs
      often lead to necrosis of the surrounding tissues, wound dehiscence, formation of fistulas,
      or become sites of origin for systemic infections. Patients are exposed to risk of further
      complications and hospitalization time extends resulting in increased total treatment costs.
      Treatment prolongation affects also the quality of life and psychosocial functioning of
      patients with impaired wound healing. Considering the arguments above, appropriate prevention
      and management of infected post-surgical wounds is currently one of the priorities for the
      majority of invasive medical disciplines.

      Obstetrics constitute a field of medicine in which the issues associated with wound healing
      are particularly relevant. According to the literature data wound infections occur in
      approximately 1.8-11.3% of women undergoing caesarean section.

      Dialkylcarbamoyl chloride (DACC) is a fatty acid derivative that irreversibly binds
      microorganisms to the dressing fibres as a result of hydrophobic interaction. As the
      mechanism of DACC action is solely physical no chemical agents are released into the wound
      bed and the dressing could be safely used by women during puerperal period.

      The purpose of this randomized controlled study is to compare the effect of DACC impregnated
      dressing and standard surgical dressing in the prevention of SSIs in adult women following
      caesarean section. This study will also evaluate pre-, peri- and postoperative risk factors
      of SSIs and analyze health economics of DACC impregnated dressings for prevention of
      post-cesarean wound infections.

      This is a single-blinded randomized controlled trial performed at the Department of
      Obstetrics and Gynecology of Medical University of Warsaw. The study will involve 518
      patients undergoing caesarean section who after giving their informed consent will be
      randomly divided into two groups: study (n=259) and control group (n=259). The study group
      will receive DACC impregnated dressing - Sorbact Surgical Dressing ® (ABIGO Medical AB,
      Sweden) and the control group will receive standard surgical dressing.

      In all participants transverse skin incision and low transverse uterine incision will be
      performed during caesarean section procedure.

      All participants will receive prophylactic dose of antibiotics prior to the start of surgery
      (1g cefazolin intravenously 0-30 minutes before surgery) and wound irrigation with octenidine
      prior to the subcutaneous tissue closure.

      For fascial incision, subcutaneous tissue and skin incision closure continuous antibacterial
      braided absorbable suture, single monofilament absorbable suture and subcuticular continuous
      monofilament non-absorbable suture will be used, respectively.

      Dressing will be left in place for the first 48 hours post caesarean section unless clinical
      reason exists to replace it. After the first 48 hours postoperatively all of the dressings
      will be removed and first wound evaluation will be performed. On post-operative day 3
      patients will be discharged and indicated to revisit on post-operative day 7 to remove the
      skin suture. During this follow-up visit second wound review will be performed for any signs
      of infection. Third, and final wound assessment will take place on post-operative day 14.

      To analyze overall treatment costs patients with SSI will be followed up until the end of
      treatment, up to 8 weeks post surgery.
