  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endotracheal intubation of the morbidly obese is often performed awake. Fiberoptic
      bronchoscope assisted endotracheal intubation, a commonly utilized technique for securing an
      airway while a patient is awake, has many limitations. The video laryngoscope is a device
      that is similar to a conventional laryngoscope but uses a video system to visualize the
      larynx. Because of its low cost, ease of use, and usefulness in the presence of edema or
      bleeding that may obstruct the airway, video assisted laryngoscopy has been shown to be
      useful for awake endotracheal intubations. However, a direct comparison of the fiberoptic
      bronchoscope with video assisted laryngoscopy has not been performed for awake endotracheal
      intubations in of obese patients. Patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypas
      andrecquiring awake intubations will be randomized for either fiberoptic bronchoscope or
      video assisted laryngoscopy. The investigators primary outcome will be the time required for
      successful intubation.
