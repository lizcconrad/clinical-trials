      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the dose-response relationship of two
      concentrations of A-101 solution when applied to individual seborrheic keratosis (SK) lesions
      (target lesions) compared with a matching A-101 Solution Vehicle.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the dose-response relationship of two
      concentrations of A-101solution when applied to individual seborrheic keratosis (SK) lesions
      (target lesions) compared with a matching A-101 Solution Vehicle.

      Each subject will have 4 target lesions on the trunk/extremities.

      A further objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two concentrations of A-101
      solution and its matching vehicle when applied to SK target lesions on the trunk/extremities.

               -  Have a longest dimension perpendicular to the longest axis that is ≥7mm and ≤15mm
                  (Section 6.1.3)

               -  Have a thickness that is ≤3mm

               -  Be a discrete lesion

               -  Be, when centered in the area outlined by the provided 3cm diameter circular
                  template, the only seborrheic keratosis lesion present

               -  Not be in an intertriginous fold

               -  Not be in an area where clothing, such as a bra, might cause physical irritation

               -  Not be pedunculated.

          4. If the subject is a woman of childbearing potential, she has a negative urine
             pregnancy test and agrees to use an active form of birth control for the duration of

          6. Subject is in good general health and free of any known disease state or physical
             condition which, in the investigator's opinion, might impair evaluation of any target
             lesion or which exposes the subject to an unacceptable risk by study participation

          7. Subject is willing and able to follow all study instructions and to attend all study
             visits
