  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During emergency anesthesia (rapid sequence induction) , a firm pressure is applied to the
      cricoid cartilage of the patient in order to prevent passive regurgitation of gastric content
      into the pharynx. This maneuver is called cricoid pressure.

      Cricoid pressure is often performed incorrectly, due to difficulties to locate the cricoid
      cartilage in many patients. Despite this, the effectiveness of an incorrectly applied cricoid
      pressure has not been investigated. In this study we have used high-resolution manometry
      (HRM) to evaluate pressures in the upper esophagus during correctly applied cricoid pressure
      (against the cricoid cartilage) compared to incorrectly applied cricoid pressure (against the
      thyroid cartilage and against the trachea) during a rapid sequence induction.
