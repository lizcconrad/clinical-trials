      The purpose of this study is to examine the different outcomes of breast reconstruction in
      women who are treated for breast cancer with mastectomy and subsequently have delayed breast
      reconstruction by one of two different surgical techniques both of which are based on the use
      of a tissue flap from the patient's back. These techniques are either a latissimus dorsi flap
      (LD-flap) or a thoracodorsal artery perforator flap (TAP-flap)

      The main objective of the study is to establish whether one of these techniques may result in
      a superior outcome and thus should be recommended as first choice treatment rather than the
      other.

    <textblock>
      Women, who are treated for breast cancer with mastectomy, are usually eligible for subsequent
      reconstruction of the breast. Depending on various conditions the reconstruction can be
      either immediate or delayed.

      Several different surgical techniques for delayed breast reconstruction have been described.
      An important factor that applies to delayed reconstruction is the lack of excessive, healthy
      skin in the area where the breast has been removed and the purpose of the surgical techniques
      developed for this are therefore to provide sufficient amounts of skin and/or other tissues
      to recreate the contour of the breast. The methods for this can broadly be classified as
      either expander/implant based or autologous-tissue based. Though full autologous
      reconstruction is preferred by many surgeons and patients due to the superior result this is
      not always possible why an implant can be needed in combination with the tissue flap to
      provide sufficient volume.

      In the irradiated patient simple expansion of the skin if often impossible and transfer of
      autologous tissue is normally required. A wide armamentarium of different methods are
      available utilizing either pedicled or free flaps for tissue transfer. The most widely used
      techniques for this in general are reconstruction with abdominal flaps . However, when these
      women are not eligible for either reconstruction with an abdominal flap or microsurgical
      reconstruction with other free flaps a well-known and much used technique for reconstruction
      is the Latissimus Dorsi-flap (LD-flap).

      Using this method an island of skin and subcutaneous tissue is provided from the upper part
      of the patient's back with blood supply deriving from the two main branches of the
      thoracodorsal artery, which are imbedded in the underlying Latissimus Dorsi muscle. A so
      called musculocutaneous tissue-flap is raised from the patient's back and tunnelled to the
      front of the thorax carrying the entire Latissimus Dorsi muscle and the paddle of overlying
      skin. At the front of the chest the muscle is usually used to drape a silicone implant, and
      the skin is used to recreate the breast mound. This method is very well-described in the
      literature, offers a safe and reliable option for breast reconstruction and is often used for
      this purpose.

      Donor site sequelae are however debated. A direct consequence of transferring the Latissimus
      Dorsi muscle during the procedure is loss of the muscles function in the shoulder and upper
      arm which involves extension, adduction and rotation of the shoulder joint. Partial
      impairment in the form of reduced strength and/or restricted movement is thus to be expected
      as is pain and weakness in the neck, shoulder and upper arm. Other muscles can replace the
      lost function of the Latissimus Dorsi, and with sufficient rehabilitation and training
      patients are expected to regain normal function over time. Long term sequelae in the form of
      chronic pain, discomfort, weakness and/or restricted range of motion have been described but
      the evidence on this particular area are ambiguous. There are no systematic reviews of the
      evidence in the published literature and most papers comprise case reports and retrospective
      cohort studies although a few prospective studies also exist. The different papers indicate
      varying rates of long-term morbidity associated with the shoulder and arm but the risk of
      some impairment and chronic pain cannot be ignored based on the available evidence.

      At Vejle Hospital in Denmark, we have adopted a new technique for total breast reconstruction
      as an alternative to the LD-flap in July 2011. This method makes use of a fasciocutaneous
      flap, which is also raised from the patient's back. Although the blood supply also derives
      from the Thoracodorsal artery imbedded in the Latissimus Dorsi muscle the flap only contains
      skin and subcutaneous tissue. The perfusion of blood is instead supplied through a perforator
      artery, normally arising from the descending branch of the main vessel. This flap is called a
      Thoracodorsal Artery Perforator-flap (TAP-flap/TDAP-flap) and was first described in the
      literature in 1995 .

      Use of the TAP flap as a pedicled perforator flap have been described in several cases aiding
      in the treatment of defects on the trunk, upper extremity, head and neck. In the field of
      breast surgery it has primarily been used for oncoplastic procedures, although a few papers
      describe the preliminary use of the TAP-flap in combination with an implant for total
      reconstruction of a breast. As this technique was only recently adopted none of the published
      studies examine the long term results nor the advantages of using the TAP-flap. A single
      retrospective study investigates shoulder function after harvest of the flap and finds no
      affection of the shoulder joint or the upper arm .

      We have chosen to perform a modified version of the technique combining the TAP-flap and
      implant with the use of an acellular dermal matrix (ADM). This matrix is used to drape the
      lower pole of the implant and in a sense creates an internal bra that supports the
      prosthesis. We presume that this in part replaces the supportive effect that is normally
      provided by the muscle when using the LD-flap. The ADM is thus used as a substitute for the
      patient's own tissue and will over time become integrated as a part of it.

      Applying this technique the upper part of the silicone implant is covered by the Major
      Pectoral muscle, while the lower part is draped by the ADM. The matrix is sutured to the
      free, lower edge of the muscle as well as to the chest wall at the desired level of the new
      inframammary fold. This covers and fixates the implant relieving pressure on the flap which
      is afterwards used to cover the reconstructed mound. We believe this enhances sufficient
      blood supply to the flap and thus provides the most optimal conditions in terms of obtaining
      complication-free healing.

      Harvest of the TAP-flap allows the Latissimus Dorsi muscle to be left undissected in most
      cases. When indicated a small cuff of muscle surrounding the dominating perforator can be
      included in the flap or a small back cut inferiorly to the perforator can be made to allow
      tension free rotation of the skin paddle. In all cases the procedure is expected to leave the
      muscle function intact.

      Though the TAP flap is well-described for several reconstructive purposes application of the
      flap as a tool for total breast reconstruction is a new endeavour and its importance has not
      yet been established. Based on the flaps properties and the more gentle dissection/harvest of
      the tissue which leaves the underlying Latissimus Dorsi muscle intact we presume the
      application of this new technique to facilitate a statistically significant reduction in the
      associated morbidity in terms of impairment and/or chronic pain in the shoulder, back and
      upper arm which can been experienced after LD-flap based reconstruction.

      Furthermore we expect the use of the TAP-flap to cause a decrease in the need for
      postoperative physical rehabilitation in terms of physiotherapy and training. The aim of this
      study is thus to test whether this hypothesis is true in order to establish whether the
      TAP-flap based reconstruction offers any advantages should be favoured above the conventional
      LD-based reconstruction.

      The main objective of this study is to determine whether any detectable difference in
      shoulder affection distinguishes these two techniques. For this purpose we have designed two
      separate trials:

      Retrospective Follow-up Trial This part of the study intends to examine and compare
      historical data on women who have already had a delayed breast reconstruction by one of the
      two methods. The main goal of this pilot study is to collect and analyse all existing
      information in order to provide a sound background knowledge that should serve as basis for
      the following RCT. Most importantly this study should provide sufficient data to perform an
      accurate calculation of the sample size.

      Randomized Clinical Trial This trial will be conducted as a confirmatory superiority trial.
      The intend is to collect, examine and compare data on the two surgical techniques in order to
      test superiority of the TAP-flap based reconstruction in accordance with our hypothesis as
      specified above.

      The trial is thus designed with two parallel study-arms as patients are allocated to
      reconstruction by either LD-flap or TAP-flap in the ratio 1:1. As the clinically most
      important parameter seems to be any objective change in shoulder function this will serve as
      the primary end-point. Patient reported discomfort/pain as well as the need for physical
      rehabilitation will also be investigated and analysed as supportive secondary end-points.

      In addition to the above data on a number of other patient-related outcomes will be collected
      as part of this trial. These issues will be addressed as tertiary end-points of a more
      exploratory nature. We expect these data to supply useful knowledge for further
      investigations in separate studies.

      Designed as multicentre trial patient enrolment and all collection of data will be performed
      at academic hospitals in Denmark and Norway. All Danish units specializing in plastic and
      reconstructive surgery who are familiar with both techniques used in this protocol have been
      invited to participate in this trial. In addition one centre in Skien, Norway, who adopted
      the TAP-flap technique prior to the initiation of the trial, was invited to participate.

      To avoid bias relating to the possible effect on the outcome measures caused by other
      surgical procedures such as mastectomy and axillary surgery performed simultaneously with the
      reconstruction only delayed procedures will be studied, as these are also most commonly the
      cases where autologous tissue transfer is required.

      A password protected, electronic database placed on a secure server will be established. This
      database will only be accessible to the primary investigator and members of the research
      group who will be involved in the analysis of data. Data are not blinded in relation to
      allocated treatment.

      This study will provide a better knowledge of the expected outcome of delayed breast
      reconstruction, when it is performed by one of these two surgical techniques. Thus the
      investigators expect that these results will help determine if the TAP-flap in combination
      with ADM may represent a better and gentler method for reconstruction of the breast with
      lower morbidity and better cost-effectiveness than the conventional LD-flap. In all cases the
      results of this trial will enable us to provide patients with better and more objective
      information, before they are subjected to delayed breast reconstruction.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The most important difference between the two procedures is the involvement of the muscle and change in shoulder function is the most relevant clinical measure to investigate.
For evaluation of shoulder function we use the internationally validated Constant Shoulder Score (CSS). This system assess pain, function in everyday-life, range of motion and strength and incorporates these parameters into one total score. It is the recommended scoring-system by the European Society of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery. Each variable in the system is evaluated separately.
For all patients scoring will be performed preoperatively as well as 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Shoulder function will be evaluated bilaterally at all stages. To avoid multiplicity-issues the primary end-point has been defined as the difference in the total score between the baseline evaluation preoperatively and the evaluation one year postoperatively.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Discomfort</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>As the pain-related outcome measure in the CSS only concerns pain in the shoulder an assessment of the patients experience of pain and/or tightening in the neck, back, arm or breast will be performed at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. For this the following frasing will be used:
&quot;Have you experienced either pain, tightening or discomfort in your neck, back, arm or the reconstructed breast during the last month?&quot;
All patients indicating any symptomatology will be asked the following:
&quot;On a scale from 1-10, where 1 indicates the lowest level of pain or discomfort and 10 the highest, please indicate the worst level of pain or discomfort you have experienced in the past month&quot;
A median value of the level of discomfort at each time-point will be calculated for each patient-group and tested for statistically significant difference as the most important supportive secondary end-points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rehabilitation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The patients need for physical rehabilitation and training will be addressed as the second most important supportive secondary end-point.
A patient reported quantification of the time spent weekly on either physiotherapy or training targeted on the shoulder, arm and/or back will be made at baseline. All patients will follow the same rehabilitation program in the postoperative phase and for the first 3 months after surgery. Hereafter the rehabilitation will be individual and based on their specific needs.
As for evaluation of the shoulder function, registration of average time spent weekly on physiotherapy/training will be made by the primary investigator in the outpatient clinic 6 and 12 months postoperatively. A median value of the time spent weekly on physiotherapy and shoulder-specific training at each time-point will be calculated for each patient-group and tested for statistically significant difference as supportive secondary end-points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality-of-life</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The patients' quality-of-life will be assessed before and after reconstruction using the international validated questionnaire developed The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) for assessment of life quality in cancer patients. Patients will be asked to complete the general questionnaire QLQ-30 in combination with the additional questionnaire QLQ-BR23 that has been specifically developed for cancer patients with breast-related diseases . The questionnaires will be completed in the outpatient clinic preoperatively and again 12 months after surgery.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Socio-economics</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>In order to evaluate the socio-economic aspects and cost-benefit associated with the use of each surgical technique we record the following parameters for all patients: Duration of operation, duration of hospitalization, duration of entire course of the breast reconstruction, duration of sick leave and need for revisional/correctional procedures. Based on the data collected we will perform an evaluation of the total expenditure associated with the two different types of delayed reconstruction. This evaluation will comprise an estimate of the costs associated with the procedures including expenses for utensils, implants and ADM as well as an estimate of the expenses related to hospitalization, sick leave and rehabilitation.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Aesthetic Outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>We wish to conduct an evaluation of the aesthetic result of the different reconstructions including a professional assessment and an assessment from the patient. Hence all patients will be asked to evaluate the appearance of their bosom on a scale from 1 to 10 indicating their satisfaction with the reconstruction.
Furthermore the patients will be subjected to a professional evaluation as all women will have their bosom photographed. Photographs will be evaluated by two unbiased medical consultants specializing in plastic surgery who are not associated with the department or the project. These specialists will be asked to perform the same evaluation as the patients.
Both the patient's and the specialist's evaluation will be performed before surgery and once again at the final consultation in the outpatient clinic 12 months following the reconstruction.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Complications</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Complications following the surgery will be recorded continuously during hospitalization and in the outpatient's clinic. They will include: skin necrosis and/or delayed healing, infection, seromas, bleeding, flap-necrosis and explantation. Complications will be classified as either major or minor depending on the need for surgical revision.</description>

        To avoid bias relating to the possible effect on the outcome measures caused by other
        surgical procedures such as mastectomy and axillary surgery performed simultaneously with
        the reconstruction only delayed procedures will be studied, as these are also most commonly
        the cases where autologous tissue transfer is required.

        Patients that should thus be assessed for eligibility will include all women referred to
        the participating centres for unilateral, delayed breast reconstruction in the inclusion
        period. The criteria for participation are as follows:

        Inclusion criteria:

        1) Women over 18 years of age who are referred in the period between 1st of September 2013
        and 30st of August 2015 for the purpose of unilateral, delayed breast reconstruction, and
        who are found best suited for reconstruction with a pedicled tissue flap from the back.

        Exclusion criteria

          1. Patients found better suited for reconstruction by another method i.e. abdominal or
             free flap-reconstruction or expander/implant-based reconstruction.

          2. Patients with severe dementia that makes it impossible to collect data or obtain
             informed consent

          3. Non-Danish speaking patients from whom informed consent cannot be obtained by
             interpreter

          4. Patients where a suited perforator of the Thoracodorsal artery cannot be identified by
             colour Doppler ultrasonography.

        All women referred for delayed breast reconstruction in the inclusion period will be
        assessed for eligibility and those meeting the criteria of the study population will be
        invited to participate in the study. The assessment will be conducted at the preliminary
        examination in the outpatient clinic by one of the centres consultants assigned to the
        trial.

        Invited patients will receive both oral and written participant information after which a
        period of minimum 14 days is required before the patient can be enrolled in the trial in
        accordance with the The Danish Health Act.

        Patients considering participation will be invited for a second consultation where written
        informed consent will be obtained from all who accept the invitation. Randomization will be
        performed immediately afterwards allocating the patient to reconstruction by either the
        LD-flap or the TAP-flap. Patients who do not which to be enrolled in the trial will be
        offered reconstruction with the LD-flap as this must be considered standard of care.
