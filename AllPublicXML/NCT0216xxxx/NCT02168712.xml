  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise therapy increase functional capacity improving the morbidity and mortality of
      patients with cardiovascular disease. Moderate continuous training is the best established
      training modality for this patients. However, a body of evidence has begun to emerge
      demonstrating that high intensity interval training obtained better results in terms of
      morbidity and mortality.

      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial was to determine the effect of two types of
      exercise training: moderate continuous training vs high interval training on functional
      capacity and quality of life as well as verify the safety in its application.

      We included 72 patients with coronary artery disease by assigning one of the training
      modality for 8 weeks. We analyzed cyclo-ergo-spirometry data, aspect related to quality of
      life as well as a record of adverse events.
