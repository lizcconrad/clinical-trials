  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 2003, that the first retrievable IVC filter was introduced in the U.S,improvements have
      been made in the filter design to resolve problems of structural integrity and increase the
      ability to remove the filter after longer periods of time.The FDA issued a communication in
      August 2010 advising physicians to remove retrievable filters whenever possible and updated
      that letter again in May 2014 due to concerns that these retrievable IVC filters, intended
      for short-term placement, are not always removed once a patient's risk for PE subsides. Known
      long term risks associated with IVC filters include but are not limited to lower limb deep
      vein thrombosis (DVT), filter fracture, filter migration, filter embolization and IVC
      perforation.

      Several studies have shown that approximately 80% to 85% of optional IVC filters are never
      retrieved. The successful removal of retrievable filters requires diligent patient follow-up
      and interdepartmental cooperation, and even so, successful removal is not always possible.
      American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines for IVCF placement indications
      advocates a close, structured follow-up of retrievable IVCFs to improve filter retrieval
      rates.

      Using a retrieval algorithm and pathway program, a score will trigger a secure email and text
      messages sent to both physician and patient at different timelines, for follow up so as to
      retrieve filter placed.
