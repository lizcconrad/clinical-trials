  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of TAK-137 when
      administered as multiple oral doses in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-137. TAK-137 is being tested to find a safe
      and well-tolerated dose and to assess how TAK-137 is metabolized in people with
      attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This study will look at side effects and
      lab results in people who take TAK-137. This study is designed as a randomized,
      sequential-cohort, multiple rising dose study.

      Therefore, the TAK-137 2 mg Cohort will not start until the TAK-137 0.5 mg Cohort has
      completed, etc.

      This trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 42 days. Participants will make at least 2 visits to the clinic, including one
      9-day period of confinement to the clinic. All participants will be contacted by telephone 7
      days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

      A decision was made to terminate this study so that emerging data from preclinical studies
      could be further assessed.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Experience at Least One Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE)</title>
        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
