    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of the trial is to investigate the pharmacokinetics
      (the exposure of the trial drug in the body), pharmacodynamics (the effect of the
      investigated drug on the body), safety and tolerability of oral semaglutide in healthy male
      Japanese and Caucasian subjects.

             longer, prior to Visit 2 (Day 1), non-prescription drugs within 1 week prior to Visit
             2 (Day 1). The use of vitamins and minerals, and the occasional use of paracetamol
             (acetaminophen) or acetylsalicylic acid are permitted

          -  Any blood drawn in excess of 25 mL in the past month, or donation of blood or plasma
             in excess of 400 mL within the 3 months preceding screening

             diagnostic procedures such as appendectomy, hernia surgery, polypectomy, biopsies, as
             wells as colonic and gastric endoscopy
