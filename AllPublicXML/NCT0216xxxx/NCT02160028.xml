  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Information about the effectiveness of treatment has been found to reduce pain, termed
      placebo analgesia. In this study it will be investigated whether this finding translates to
      the dental clinic. It will be investigated whether information that suggested that minimal
      pain will be experienced during filling therapy, can reduce the pain associated with that
      procedure compared to a group that receives standard information. All patients will receive
      the same amount of anesthesia and similar procedures during filling therapy. It is predicted
      that extended information should reduce pain, and that the reduction in pain should be
      associated with a reduction in stress.

    <description>Pain intensity and pain discomfort will be measured by a VAS (Visual Analog Scale). The patients will report their experience of these factors verbally, four times during the treatment session.</description>

    <measure>Reduction of stress</measure>
    <time_frame>One hour</time_frame>
    <description>Stress is also measured using the VAS, i.e. using the same method as for pain. Stress or sympathetic activation is measured by using scin conductance on fingers (V-Amp (Brain Products, Munich, Germany).</description>
