      This study represents the administration of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor DBPR108
      to humans to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic
      (PD) properties following multiple oral doses in healthy subjects.

      DPP4 is a validated drug target for the treatment of human type 2 diabetes. Objectives of the
      study will be to assess the safety and tolerability, PKs and PDs of DBPR108 at steady state
      after administration of multiple oral doses to healthy male subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male with suitable veins for cannulation or repeated venipuncture, and must be able to
             swallow the investigational product intact.

          -  Aged between 20 and 45 years (inclusive) at the screening visit.

          -  Able to provide written informed consent and willing to comply with the study protocol
             procedures and restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a body weight less than 50 kg and/or body mass index (BMI) less than 18.5 kg/m2 or
             greater than or equal to 24 kg/m2 at the screening visit. Body mass index is
             determined as total body weight/height2 (kg/m2).

          -  Has a creatinine clearance (Ccr) less than 80 mL/min at screening.

          -  Is not in good general health as judged by the Investigator based on routine medical
             history, vital signs, physical examination, ECG, laboratory tests, and urinalysis at
             the screening visit or at admission on Day -1. Normal ECG includes (1) sinus rhythm,
             (2) pulse rate between 45 and 90 bpm, (3) Corrected QT (QTc) interval equal to or less
             than 450 ms (corrected cf Bazett 1920), (4) QRS interval less than 110 ms, (5) PR
             interval less than 200 ms, and (6) morphology consistent with healthy cardiac
             conduction and function.

          -  Is not normoglycemic defined as fasting glucose at less than 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) and
             greater than 99 mg/dL (5.5 mmol/L), based on the laboratory tests at screening or at
             admission on Day -1, or has known diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (Re-testing
             of fasting glucose on the same sample collected from the subject with initial fasting
             glucose value of 100-105 mg/dL on Day -1 is acceptable. However, if the re-testing
             fasting glucose value is still greater than 99 mg/dL, the subject shall be excluded

          -  Use of drugs with cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducing or

          -  inhibiting properties within 4 weeks prior to the first administration of
