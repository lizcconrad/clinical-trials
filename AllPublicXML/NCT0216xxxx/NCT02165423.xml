    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to address a gap in knowledge needed for care of children with
      solid organ transplantation (SOT) and their parents by combining mHealth technology with an
      individualized family centered self-management intervention (referred to as myFAMI). This
      study is critical to the increased understanding of hospital to home transition and family
      management at home with the potential to transform the way clinicians approach the care of
      complex chronic illness children and families.

    <measure>Evaluate the effectiveness of myFAMI on 30-day post-discharge outcomes.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days following enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Hypothesis: Compared to parents who received standard discharge preparation (usual care), parents receiving myFAMI will report:
i) Better care coordination, ii) Higher quality of discharge teaching, iii) Greater readiness for hospital discharge, iv) Improved post-discharge coping, v) Improved family functioning, vi) Better self-management of medication and treatment regimens vii) Fewer emergency department visits and hospital readmissions</description>

    <measure>Examine the acceptability of myFAMI:</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment plus 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>2. Examine the acceptability of myFAMI: The content of the interview will focus on strengths and weaknesses of iPadÂ® technology in preparing parents for hospital discharge utilizing both survey and qualitative questions</description>
