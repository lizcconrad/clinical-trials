  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, the correlation between the psychopathological profile and sagittal balance
      unexplored to date spine will be studied. Indeed, a number of patients who benefited from
      well-conducted surgical treatment, targeted and tailored to their pathology, respond poorly
      to it. The investigators wonder if there are biomechanical factors or factors of
      psychopathological order which might influence the effectiveness of treatment. This seems
      logical for the entire medical community, but it has never been demonstrated in a clinical
      trial.

      The purpose of this study is to find a global diagnostic and standardized tool , easy to use,
      on psychopathological factors influencing the posture of the patients lombalgia so that in
      this will be used to use identify upstream surgery, the patients undergoing psychiatric
      treatment of mood rather than surgical treatment. And thus may economise a surgical operation
      and its complications and the related expenses.

    <measure>sagittal balance of the spine : - kyphosis in depressed or anxious patients- lordosis in patients with manic</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint was to compare the L1S1 lordosis measured in degrees relative to L1S1 lordosis expected, i-e the pelvic tilt +/- 10 ° and analyzed in relation to anxiety scores given by the Scale Hamilton Anxiety (HAM-A), depression with the Hamilton depression Scale (HAM-D) and hypomania using the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). regarding the HAM-A, greater than or equal to 17 score will be considered as indicative of anxiety. For the HAM-D greater than or equal to 13 score will be considered indicative of depression. For the YMRS, greater than or equal to 20 score will be considered as indicative of a manic syndrome. It is obvious that the higher the score, the higher the importance of the disorder will be.</description>
