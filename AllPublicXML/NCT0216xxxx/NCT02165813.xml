    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre (RDH and ASH), phase IV, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled
      trial of oral NTZ for the treatment of acute gastroenteritis requiring admission to hospital.
      Four hundred children aged between three months and less than five years of age will be
      enrolled. Study participation would be from the point of enrolment until 60 days after
      enrolment. Enrolment will occur within 48 hours of admission to hospital. Enrolled
      participants will be randomised 1:1 to Nitazoxanide (NTZ) or placebo. Other treatment and
      management will be as per the standard of care described in the admitting hospital's
      guidelines and will be ultimately the decision and responsibility of the named medical
      consultant. Stool samples will be collected at the point of admission. Solicitation of
      symptoms will be by review of routinely collected medical data recorded in the participant's
      medical record, and will be supplemented by completion of study specific diary cards until
      discharge. All participants will be followed up at day 7 after enrolment (by telephone if
      already discharged) to ascertain symptoms occurring in the intervening period. At days 30 and
      60 after enrolment a clinical record review will be conducted for all participants to
      ascertain health care attendances following discharge.
