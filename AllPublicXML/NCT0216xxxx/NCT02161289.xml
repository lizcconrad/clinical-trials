      Objectives

        1. To evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of &quot;standard HIV prevention package&quot; among
           Thai men who have sex with men (MSM)

        2. To conduct a pilot study to demonstrate the acceptability and feasibility of
           internet-based social networking, asymptomatic sexually transmitted infection diagnosis
           and treatment and pre-exposure prophylaxis strategies as &quot;potential HIV prevention
           methods&quot; among Thai MSM

        3. To use mathematical modeling to identify the most effective HIV prevention package
           optimized for Thai MSM

      Subject population: HIV-negative MSM clients of the Thai Red Cross Anonymous Clinic (TRC-AC),
      age â‰¥18 years old,Each participant will have a 12-month follow-up duration in the study.

      Study design and methodology:

      We will conduct a pilot study among 100 MSM participants who will be enrolled from the TRC-AC
      and will be followed up for 12 months. Participants will be followed at baseline, months 1
      and 3, and then every 3 months. Interventions in the &quot;standard HIV prevention package&quot; to be
      provided at every clinic visit include anti-HIV testing, risk reduction counseling,
      provisions of free condoms and lubricants and diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic sexually
      transmitted infections (STI). All participants will also have access to non-occupational
      post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) without charge as part of the standard HIV prevention
      package. In addition, we will test for acceptability and feasibility of the &quot;potential HIV
      prevention methods&quot; which include:

      1) Internet-based social networking to distribute and stimulate discussion of HIV prevention
      information (2) Asymptomatic STI diagnosis and treatment for every participant at baseline
      visit and every 6 months (3) Oral and topical pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) strategies
      using placebo tablet and gel.

      The meta-analysis of various behavioral and biomedical HIV prevention studies among MSM will
      be done in parallel with the pilot study in order to gather information for mathematical
      modeling and finally to inform the design of a larger study. Data acquired from the pilot
      study will be used for mathematical modeling of HIV transmission among MSM. The output from
      the modeling will directly inform HIV preventative interventions to be evaluated empirically
      among MSM in Thailand.
