  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multiple ascending dose study is to characterize the safety,
      tolerability, and the amount of GLPG0634 present in the blood and urine (pharmacokinetics) of
      once daily oral administrations of GLPG0634 at 3 different dose levels for 10 days in
      Japanese healthy subjects.

      Furthermore, the study will compare the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and effects
      of GLPG0634 on mechanism of action-related parameters in the blood (pharmacodynamics) of once
      daily oral administrations of GLPG0634 given at one dose level for 10 days in Japanese vs
      Caucasian healthy subjects.
