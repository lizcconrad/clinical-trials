    <textblock>
      The problem of the incontinence imposes considerable strain on the child and their parents.
      These patients suffer from a long-life handicap and they need support and follow-up. The cost
      associated with these diseases has clearly been illustrated to be a major component in the
      healthcare spending picture, may be adding hundreds of thousands of dollars to healthcare
      cost, as well as loss of productivity in the work force. Fecal incontinence treatment has
      been a difficult challenge for surgeons for several generations until now the current
      traditional surgical result is unsatisfactory. Mesenchymal Stem Cells injection may represent
      a new attractive treatment option for anal sphincter lesions. Moreover, experimental injury
      of muscle of anal sphincter in rats has been successfully treated with stem cells injections.
      In this study, the investigators will shed more light on the ability of Mesenchymal Stem
      Cells to induce myogenesis and regenerate anal Sphincter of patients with fecal incontinence.
      It will be very useful to many Egyptian patients.

      A stem cell is capable of forming various tissue under definite signals received from the
      body. Stem cell research in animals has been an ongoing program in the west with fruitful
      results. Current challenges with the use of stem cells in clinical practice will be solve the
      many unanswered queries. To study the potential therapeutic effects of local Mesenchymal Stem
      cell injection in children presenting with fecal incontinence (FI) after posterior sagittal
      ano-rectoplasty (PSARP) operation for high imperforate anus. Children whom suffering from FI
      after PSARP for high imperforate anus will included in this study. Autologous MSC from the
      upper posterior iliac crest bone marrow sample will be extracted from patients under general
      anesthesia, in a suitable clean operation room. Will be Cultured and injected into the
      external anal sphincter defect using direct pena stimulator or ultra sound guidance. Then
      followed up for 180 days post injection, to assess the ability of mesenchymal stem cells to
      induce myogenesis of the anal Sphincter of patients with FI after PSARP.

    <description>Stem cell isolation technique and Stem Cells Injection Technique The method of isolation of MSC from bone marrow will be carried out using the Ficoll-Paque technique for the isolation of mononucleated cells followed by the separation of MSC by adherence to plastic. Finally, the cells will be resuspended and counted using a hemocytometer.
Mononucleated cells will be cultured and incubated at 37Â°C in an atmosphere of 95% relative humidity and 5% CO2.</description>

    <description>Injection of MSCs for the treatment of anal sphincter insufficiency is a potential alternative therapy for imperforate anus patients who have undergone primary PSARP with post-operative FI. In this study a single dose of 1.2 ml MSC will be divided into 12 part of 0.1ml of MSC, doses will be injected into the anal sphincter all around in 12 injection sites according to the clock meridian under general anesthesia without giving muscle relaxant.</description>
