  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, two-arm study reviewing the healing of cavitary defects in patients
      treated with Vitoss alone versus those treated with Vitoss with bone marrow aspirate (BMA).
      There will be a prospective follow-up visit at 24+ months to evaluate lont-term healing in
      patients identified during the retrospective portion of the study. It is thought that the
      inclusion of BMA will facilitate the resorption of the graft material, leading to better
      long-term bone healing.
