  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to assess the effect of diets with different protein
      composition (20%, 27% and 35%), mainly coming from animal proteins such as lean red meat, on
      body weight and lipid profile in overweight and obese women. A dietary intervention is
      carried out during 3 months in 90 women who are individually randomized to an hypocaloric
      diet with three types of macronutrient composition: 1) 35% proteins, 30% fat and 35%
      carbohydrates; 2) 27% proteins, 30% fat and 43% carbohydrates and 3) 20% proteins, 30% fat
      and 50% carbohydrates. Around 50% of total proteins in diet come from lean red meat (leg or
      shoulder of lamb) by providing up to 15 different recipes to participants to use them as part
      of the diet. At the beginning of the study, after 6 weeks and at the end of the intervention,
      the following parameters are determined: anthropometric (weight, waist circumference, body
      mass index and body composition), blood pressure, dietary (72-hours dietary registry) and
      exercise assessments and biochemical analysis (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL
      cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B, iron, transferrin,
      ferritin, uric acid, glucose, HbA1c, insulin and adipokines). In 3-months visit, participants
      will be advised to follow the prescribed diets during the next 3 months. Monitoring visits
      with the nutritionist will not be performed. A follow-up visit will be done after 3-months of
      end of intervention (at 6-months after beginning the study) to assess the long-time efficacy
      on main endpoint of each diet. In this visit only anthropometric parameters (weight, waist
      circumference, body mass index and body composition) will be determined.
