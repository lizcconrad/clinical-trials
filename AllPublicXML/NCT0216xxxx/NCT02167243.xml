      The purpose of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of a behavioral economic intervention
      to improve self monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in adolescents and young adults with T1D.
      The intervention will reinforce patients for conducting SMBG, with escalating reinforcers
      provided when patients achieved sustained periods of testing at least 4 times/day at
      appropriate intervals. A 6-month trial will be conducted in which 60 patients will be
      randomized to: (1) standard care or (2) standard care plus the reinforcement intervention.

    <measure>To determine if the reinforcement intervention increases SMBG testing.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of SMBG tests will be assessed via glucometer uploads, and the proportion of days on which at least 4 tests occurred as well as the longest number of consecutive days on which SMBG tests occurred at frequencies of &gt;4 times/day will be calculated. The hypothesis is that patients assigned to the reinforcement intervention will conduct more SMBG tests, have greater proportions of days with &gt;4 tests, and have longer durations of appropriate testing frequencies than patients assigned to usual care.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. age 12-21 years old;

          2. diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) &gt;12 months via ADA guidelines

          3. receiving diabetes treatment at Yale Pediatric Diabetes Clinic and not meeting
             clinical care guidelines

          4. SMBG user with clinical recommendations to test &gt;4 times/day and using a device that
             allows for remote uploading (e.g., Aviva, Contour, Freestyle, Lifescan, etc.;
             equipment for uploading will be provided);

          5. access to a computer with internet for uploading and sending SMBG data;

          6. access to a cell phone with text messaging capabilities and willing to text after SMBG
             testing and receive messages about reinforcement;

          7. English speaking, able to read at &gt;5th grade level, and pass an informed consent quiz;
             and adequate knowledge of insulin dosing and dietary recommendations for managing T1D.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. have a major psychiatric or neurocognitive disorder (e.g., severe learning impairment)
             that would inhibit participation;

          2. have a major visual impairment;

          3. have a significant other medical condition that impacts diabetes management (e.g.,
             asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, or other condition that requires steroid treatment);

          4. plan to switch insulin delivery mode (injection to pump or vice versa) in the next 12
             months, or have recently switched;

          5. are participating in another clinical trial.
