      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject meets DSM 5 criteria for a primary diagnosis of ADHD (inattentive,
             hyperactive, or combined presentation) established by a comprehensive psychiatric
             evaluation that reviews DSM 5 criteria. Diagnosis is confirmed by CAADID Part 2 with
             checklist for DSM 5.

          -  Subject has an ADHD RS IV with adult prompts score of ≥ 22 at screening and baseline.

          -  Subject has agreed to participate by providing written informed consent and is willing
             and able to comply with the protocol, in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Subject is 18 to 55 years old, inclusive, at the time of informed consent.

          -  Subject is male or a non-pregnant, non lactating female.

             menopausal (defined as at least 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea) and those who
             have undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy will be exempted from the
             pregnancy test.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential and male subjects with female partners of
             childbearing potential must agree to use an effective and medically acceptable form of
             birth control throughout the study period.

          -  Subject has a negative breath alcohol test and a negative urine drug screen (UDS) for
             any illicit drug at screening.

          -  Subject is judged by the investigator to be suitable for participation in a 12 month
             clinical trial involving open-label dasotraline treatment.

          -  Subject can read well enough to understand the informed consent form and other subject
             materials.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a psychiatric disorder other than ADHD that has been the primary focus of
             treatment at any time during the 12 months prior to screening.

          -  Subject has a past history of, or current presentation consistent with, bipolar
             disorder (including bipolar I and bipolar II), schizophrenia, schizoaffective

             criteria.

          -  Subject has a history of substance abuse or drug dependence (excluding nicotine and
             caffeine) within the 12 months prior to screening, as defined by the DSM 5 criteria.

          -  Subject has a history of epilepsy, seizures (except childhood febrile seizures),
             unexplained syncope or other unexplained blackouts (except single incident), or head
             trauma with loss of consciousness lasting more than 5 minutes.

          -  Subject has a currently active medical condition (other than ADHD) that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the ability of the subject to
             participate in the study.

          -  Subject is currently taking or has taken within the previous 6 months an
             anticonvulsant medication (eg, phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, valproic acid,

          -  Subject is currently taking an alpha 2 adrenergic receptor agonist (including
             clonidine and guanfacine), or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI; eg,
             venlafaxine), or dopamine-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (DNRI; eg, bupropion), or
             monoamine oxidase [MAO] inhibitor. Note: Subjects who discontinue these medications
             and wash-out from them for a minimum of 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug
             will be allowed to enroll in the study.

             specific plan and intent) on the C SSRS assessment at screening (in the past month).

          -  Subject has a clinically significant abnormality on screening evaluation including
             physical examination, vital signs, ECG, or laboratory tests that the investigator
             considers to be inappropriate to allow participation in the study.

          -  The subject's screening ECG shows a corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula
             (QTcF) of ≥ 450 msec for male subjects or ≥ 470 msec for female subjects. Eligibility
             will be based on the core laboratory ECG interpretation report.

          -  Subject is currently participating or has participated in a clinical trial within the
             last 90 days or has participated in more than 2 clinical trials within the past year.

          -  Subject has a history of allergic reaction or has a known or suspected sensitivity to
