        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnostic CT or MRI of the tumor region within the previous 6 months prior to
             dosing day is available.

          -  A somatostatin receptor scan with results in the previous 6 months prior to dosing
             day.

          -  At least 1 lesion detected by the previous somatostatin receptor scan.

          -  Not exceeding 30 lesions / organ detected by the previous somatostatin receptor scan.

          -  Blood test results as follows (WBC: ≥ 3*109/L, Hemoglobin: ≥ 8.0 g/dL, Platelets: ≥
             50x109/L, ALT, AST, AP: ≤ 5 times ULN, Bilirubin: ≤ 3 times ULN)

          -  ECG: any abnormalities have to be clarified by a cardiologist.

          -  Serum creatinine: within normal limits or &lt; 120 μmol/L for patients aged 60 years or
             older.

          -  Calculated GFR ≥ 45 mL/min.

          -  Negative pregnancy test in women capable of child-bearing.

             below).

          -  Therapeutic use of any somatostatin analog, including Sandostatin® LAR (within 28
             days) and Sandostatin® (within 2 days) prior to study imaging. If a patient is on
             Sandostatin® LAR a wash-out phase of 28 days is required before the injection of the
             study drug. If a patient is on Sandostatin® a wash-out phase of 2 days is required
             before the injection of the study drug.

          -  Administration of another investigational medicinal product within 30 days prior to
             entry.

          -  Prior or planned administration of a radiopharmaceutical within 8 half-lives of the
             radionuclide used on such radiopharmaceutical including at any time during the current
             study.

          -  Current &gt; grade 2 toxicity from previous standard or investigational therapies, per
             US-NCI &quot;Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0&quot;.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women.

          -  History of somatic or psychiatric disease/condition that may interfere with the
             objectives and assessments of the study.

          -  Clinically significant illness or clinically relevant trauma within 2 weeks before the
             administration of the investigational product.

          -  Current history of malignancy; patients with a secondary tumor in remission of &gt; 5
             years can be included.
