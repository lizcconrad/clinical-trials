      The study examines the efficacy and safety of Analgecine in the treatment of chronic pain in
      patients with low back pain for 3 months after surgical treatment. It is a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double blind, multi-center phase III clinical trial. Patients with
      chronic low back pain for 3 months after surgical treatment is recruited (age between 18 and
      70; pain visual analysis scale (VAS) between 3 and 8). After randomization, subjects are
      divided into 3 groups: 1) Treatment with Analgecine (Experiment group); 2) Treatment with
      Neurotropin (positive control group); 3) Placebo group. Subjects will be undergone 4
      measurement time points on day 0, 7, 14, and 21. In each time points, subjects are required
      to score their pain with pain VAS and to have regular blood, urine, and renal/liver function
      tests. The changes of the pain VAS at day 21 are compared between groups.
