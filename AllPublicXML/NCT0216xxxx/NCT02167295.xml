  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer of the oral cavity is one of the fastest growing cancers among men in Taiwan. Previous
      research has established a strong link between betel quid chewing, a common practice among
      Taiwanese men, and oral cancer. However, despite the strong association, no attempt has been
      made to develop behavioral measures to facilitate betel quid cessation. This application
      extends upon existing collaboration between MD Anderson and China Medical University Hospital
      (CMUH) and seeks to characterize betel quid chewers and their withdrawal symptoms, in order
      to address an urgent cancer epidemiology issue in Taiwan.

      Cancer of the oral cavity is one of the fastest growing cancers among men in Taiwan. Previous
      research has established a strong link between betel quid chewing, a common practice among
      Taiwanese men, and oral cancer. However, despite the strong association, no attempt has been
      made to develop behavioral measures to facilitate betel quid cessation. This application
      extends upon existing collaboration between MD Anderson and China Medical University Hospital
      (CMUH) and seeks to characterize betel quid chewers and their withdrawal symptoms, in order
      to address an urgent cancer epidemiology issue in Taiwan. In a two phase study, we will use a
      qualitative approach (guided focus group and interviews), followed by assessment of betel
      quid withdrawal in current chewers: 1) 47 participants will be invited to participate in a
      qualitative study that includes focus group and in-depth structured interviews that examine
      the social and cultural context that surrounds continued use and cessation of betel quid
      consumption, 2) 30 male and female healthy individuals who currently both chew betel quid and
      smoke cigarettes will be invited to attend 4 separate sessions at CMUH and complete a
      self-report questionnaire specifically designed to measure betel quid withdrawal symptoms,
      and the relationship between betel quid chewing and cigarette smoking withdrawal. This
      application represents the first step in the development of a multi-phase, multidisciplinary
      betel quid chewing research program. This program will enhance our understanding of the
      cultural and bio-behavioral aspects of betel quid chewing. Furthermore, it will lead to
      translational research projects that link behavioral findings to clinical treatments, and the
      eventual creation of a large scale, population-based prevention and education program.

    <description>To know reasons for betel quid chewing or for quitting, pros and cons of betel quid chewing, barriers to and facilitators of abstinence, health beliefs and experiences about betel quid chewing and other issues.And then, we propose to develop a self-report questionnaire that examines betel quid withdrawal among Taiwanese chewers who are also current cigarette smokers.</description>

    <description>The focus groups will consist of 6 to 8 persons each (N = 32). The focus group discussions will last for about 60 to 90 minutes. The discussion topics will be based on previous literature and experience and will include reasons for betel quid chewing or for quitting, pros and cons of betel quid chewing, barriers to and facilitators of abstinence, health beliefs and experiences about betel quid chewing and other issues.</description>

    <description>We will conduct 15 one-to-one interviews, each lasts for about 45 to 60 minutes. Participants will be interviewed by a trained interviewer using a structured interview. The interview will be designed to collect information on socio-demographic background, current and/or former betel quid use, other substance use (smoking and/or alcohol consumption), as well as other variables including usage parameters, psychosocial and environmental influences on betel quid chewing, barriers to and interest in quitting, and knowledge of adverse effects on health.</description>

    <description>This study is expected to enroll 30 participants who have smoking and betel nut chewing behaviors.Participants will complete 4 separate visits to CMUH, during which they will complete the same self-report questionnaire designed to measure withdrawal symptoms relating to betel quid chewing. To better measure betel quid withdrawal symptoms and to distinguish the 6 symptoms from those of smoking withdrawal, Participants will be required to attend one visit regular cigarette smoking and betel nut chewing behavior without restriction (as control), one visit after 12 hours of overnight betel quid deprivation (no cigarette deprivation), one visit after 12 hours of overnight cigarette deprivation (no betel quid deprivation), and one visit after 12 hours of both overnight betel quid and cigarette deprivation.</description>
