  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending IV dose study
      conducted at one study center in the United States (US). One (1) cohort of 12 subjects (6
      active and 6 placebo) and two (2) cohorts of 8 subjects (6 active and 2 placebo) are planned
      for evaluation. Subjects will participate in only one cohort. Safety will be assessed
      throughout the study and serial blood samples and urine samples will be collected for the
      safety and PK assessment of GMI-1271.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy adult male and/or females, 19 to 60 years of age, inclusive.

          2. Medically healthy with no clinically significant screening results (e.g., laboratory
             profiles, medical histories, vital signs, ECGs, physical examination) as deemed by the
             PI.

          3. Females of childbearing potential must either be sexually inactive (abstinent) for 3
             months prior to dosing or be using an acceptable birth control method

          4. Females must have a negative pregnancy test at the time of screening and prior to
             dosing for inclusion in the study.

          5. Understands the study procedures in the informed consent form (ICF), and be willing
             and able to comply with the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated or has significant emotional problems at
             the time of screening visit or expected during the conduct of the study.

          2. History or presence of clinically significant medical or psychiatric condition or
             disease in the opinion of the PI.

          3. History of any illness that, in the opinion of the PI, might confound the results of
             the study or poses an additional risk to the subject by their participation in the
             study.

          4. Hemoglobin level below the lower limit of normal at screening or check-in.

          5. Any liver function test (e.g., AST, ALT, bilirubin) 1.5x the upper limit of normal at
             screening or check-in.

          6. Positive results at screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B
             surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C antibodies (HCV).

          7. Seated blood pressure is less than 90/40 mmHg or greater than 140/90 mmHg at
             screening.

          8. Heart rate is lower than 40 bpm or higher than 99 bpm at screening.

          9. QTc interval &gt;430 msec for males or &gt;450 msec for females, or history of prolonged QT
             syndrome.

         10. Estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 90 ml/min at screening or check-in.

         11. Blood donation or significant blood loss within 56 days prior to dosing.

         12. Plasma donation within 7 days prior to dosing.

         13. Participation in another clinical trial within 28 days prior to dosing. The 28-day
             window will be derived from the date of the last study procedure (such as last blood
             collection or dosing) in the previous study to Day 1 of Period 1 of the current study.

        Note: If an increase (&gt;1.5 x N) in bilirubin is present at screening additional liver
        function tests may be performed (such as ALT, AST, ALP, albumin, and direct and indirect
        bilirubin) to determine if the increase of bilirubin is due to Gilbert-Meulengracht
        syndrome. If consistent with Gilbert's syndrome, the Investigator and Sponsor may decide
        not to consider this as an exclusion. Any such decision will be documented in the study
        record.
