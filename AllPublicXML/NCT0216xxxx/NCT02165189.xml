      The purpose of this study is to evaluate sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the end
      of treatment (SVR12) following 12 weeks of simeprevir plus sofosbuvir with and without
      ribavirin (RBV) and 24 weeks of simeprevir plus sofosbuvir without RBV in post orthotopic
      liver transplant participants with recurrent hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) C virus
      (HCV) Genotype 1 infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study), partially randomized (study drug is assigned by chance), and
      open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) study to explore the safety and
      efficacy of simeprevir plus sofosbuvir. The study will consist of a screening period
      (Screening and Baseline), followed by randomization. First 33 non-cirrhotic participants will
      be randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1:1 into 1 of 3 treatment arms, and up to 12 cirrhotic
      participants will be enrolled and all will be assigned to Arm 3. All participants in
      treatment Arms 1 and 2 will return for treatment visits at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and
      post-treatment follow-up visits on Weeks 16 and 24. All participants in treatment Arm 3 will
      return for treatment visits at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24, and post-treatment
      follow-up visits on Weeks 28 and 36. Participants will receive simeprevir plus sofosbuvir and
      RBV for a 12-week treatment period in Arm 1, simeprevir plus sofosbuvir without RBV for a
      12-week treatment period in Arm 2 and simeprevir plus sofosbuvir for a 24-week treatment
      period in Arm 3. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by SVR12. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Viral Breakthrough</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 24 (for Arms 1 and 2) and Baseline up to Week 36 (for Arm 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Viral breakthrough is defined as confirmed greater than (&gt;) 1.0 Log10 increase in HCV RNA from nadir or confirmed HCV RNA &gt;100 IU/mL in participants who had previously achieved HCV RNA &lt;15 IU/mL.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Viral Relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 24 (for Arms 1 and 2) and Baseline up to Week 36 (for Arm 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be considered to have viral relapse if they meet the following conditions: 1) HCV RNA &lt;15 IU/mL (undetectable) at the end of treatment; and 2) HCV RNA greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 15 IU/mL during the post-treatment follow-up period.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Hepatitis C Symptom and Impact Questionnaire Version 4 (HCV-SIQv4) Score at Week 24 (for Arms 1 and 2) and Week 36 (for Arm 3)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24 (for Arms 1 and 2) and Week 36 (for Arm 3)</time_frame>
    <description>The HCV-SIQv4 is a self-administered questionnaire containing 33 items classified as 3 categories of scores: 1) Symptom severity score (sum of responses to 29 questions to assess severity or frequency of symptoms associated with HCV or its treatment; 2) Time missed from work/school (sum of responses to 3 questions regarding the impact of symptoms on work/school attendance); 3) Daily activity score (response to 1 question regarding the impact of symptoms on daily activities). Higher HCV SIQv4 scores indicate worse symptom severity, more time missed from work/school, and more impairment in daily activities, respectively. The total score is the sum of scores of these 3 categories.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in EuroQol 5 - Dimension (EQ-5D) Questionnaire Score at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 (for all treatment arms) and Week 36 (for Arm 3)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 (for all treatment arms) and Week 36 (for Arm 3)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D questionnaire is a brief, generic health-related quality of life assessment (HRQOL) that can also be used to incorporate participant preferences into health economic evaluations. The EQ-5D questionnaire assesses HRQOL in terms of degree of limitation on 5 health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) and as overall health using a &quot;thermometer&quot; visual analog scale with response options ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health). Lower scores indicate worsening. EQ-5D scores include EQ-5D valuation index score (a weighted scoring of the 5 dimension scores with a possible range from 0 to 1), EQ-5D visual analog scale (VAS) is a 20 centimeter (cm) vertical VAS with scores ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (perfect health), and EQ5D descriptive system scores (five scores reflecting each of the 5 EQ-5D health dimensions ranging from 0 [no limitation] to 4 [incapacity]).</description>

             (CTP) score &gt;=7

          -  Participant has (post-transplant) any underlying serious or life-threatening
             condition, such as severe uncontrolled cardiopulmonary disease, vascular disease,
             rheumatologic condition, renal failure, dialysis, ongoing systemic infection,
             uncontrolled malignancy, or other serious illness that would compromise adherence to
             medications and ability to comply with all aspects of the study protocol

          -  Any other active, clinically significant disease or clinically significant findings
             during the Screening period of medical history, physical examination, laboratory
             testing, or electrocardiogram (ECG) recording that, in the investigator's opinion,
             would compromise the participant's safety or could interfere with the participant
             participating in and completing the study. Retesting of laboratory results that lead
             to exclusion will be allowed once using an unscheduled visit during the Screening
             period to assess eligibility

          -  Participant is a woman who is pregnant, breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant
             while enrolled in this study or within 6 months after the last dose of ribavirin (or
