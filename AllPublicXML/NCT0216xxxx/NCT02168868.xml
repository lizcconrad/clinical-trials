      The purpose of this study is to analyze the immunological profile in blood of children with
      ASD.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is accumulating evidence that at least a subset of children diagnosed with ASD also
      have aberrant immune functions. This study will attempt to identify more specifically the
      nature of the potential immune abnormalities in children.

      The study will follow a case-control design. Only one blood drawing will be performed upon
      meeting the inclusion criteria and completing a questionnaire that includes detailed
      information regarding family history of immune aberrations. Five ml of venous blood will be
      drawn from all subjects (ASD and controls) and shall be separated into 2 vials:

        -  0.5 ml: for Complete Blood Count

        -  4.5 ml for serum separation. The serum will be aliquoted (0.5 ml vials) and frozen at
           -80º centigrade and sent to laboratory for detailed immune analysis. One aliquot will be
           sent for analysis. The others will be kept for further testing (±backup).

      Adverse events to blood drawing will be reported to the Data Coordinating Center using the
      appropriate Case Report Form (CRF).

      In cases of adverse effects (AE) related to the drawing of blood or performance of
      examination of patients in the course of standard examination procedures, the investigating
      team will proceed in accordance with local guidelines (to be inserted by the PI), reporting
      the incidents which occurred during the course of a clinical trial.

      Clinical data will be collected by the investigator, or a person appointed and appropriately
      trained by the investigator, and shall be entered into standardized CRFs and shared online
      with the sponsor. Source data will be retained for all data entered in the CRFs. Progress
      reports and the Final Report at the conclusion of the trial will be submitted to the
      regulatory authority and the Ethics Committee, as required.
