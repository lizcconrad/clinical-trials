  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The introduction of total mesorectal excision (TME) and the progress of neoadjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy has significantly reduced the risk of local recurrence in locally advanced
      rectal cancer. However, systemic recurrence rate is not being improved and that is considered
      as the cause of unsatisfactory overall survival of patients with rectal cancer. Relatively
      higher systemic relapse rate than local recurrence rate is probably due to the insufficient
      control of systemic micrometastasis during adjuvant chemotherapy. The efficacy of adjuvant
      combination cytotoxic chemotherapy after surgery in treatment of rectal cancer remains
      controversial. In addition, preoperative radiotherapy increases surgical complication such as
      anastomosis site leakage and radiotherapy itself worsen sexual and urinary function and bowel
      habit which result in aggravation of the quality of life. Furthermore the preoperative
      chemoradiotherapy upto 3 months not only extends treatment period but increases cost of care.
      To reduce the possibility of overtreatment, it is needed to confirm that the preoperative
      chemoradiotherapy is absolutely necessary to locally advanced rectal cancer patients with
      safe circumferential margin (CRM) resected curatively by standardized TME operation.

      In this study, investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy
      after TME without preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced rectal
      cancer having spared CRM are not inferior to that of current standard treatment.
