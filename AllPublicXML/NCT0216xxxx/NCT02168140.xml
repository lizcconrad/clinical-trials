    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of CPI-613 when given together with
      bendamustine hydrochloride in treating patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma or Hodgkin lymphoma. CPI-613 may kill cancer cells by turning off their
      mitochondria, which are used by cancer cells to produce energy and are the building blocks
      needed to make more cancer cells. By shutting off mitochondria, CPI-613 may deprive the
      cancer cells of energy and other supplies needed to survive and grow. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as bendamustine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping
      them from spreading. Giving CPI-613 with bendamustine hydrochloride may kill more cancer
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CPI-613 [6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic
      acid], when used in combination with bendamustine (bendamustine hydrochloride) in patients
      with relapsed and refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) or T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma
      (NHL) who have or have not received hematopoietic cell transplant.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate response rate (RR) and disease control rate (DCR), derived from the modified
      International Work Group (IWG) criteria and International Cutaneous Lymphoma (Olsen criteria)
      for cutaneous lymphomas.

      II. To evaluate overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and possible
      correlation between RR and DCR derived from modified IWF criteria vs. OS and PFS.

      III. To evaluate assessment of bone marrow biopsy, and possible correlation between complete
      response (CR) vs. bone marrow biopsy assessment (e.g., clear of infiltration of leukemic
      cells according to morphology, and/or negative on leukemic cells according to
      immunohistochemistry).

      IV. To evaluate safety of CPI-613 + bendamustine combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid.

      Patients receive 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1-4
      of week 1 and on days 1 and 4 of weeks 2 and 3. Patients also receive bendamustine
      hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 4 and 5 of week 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks
      for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.
