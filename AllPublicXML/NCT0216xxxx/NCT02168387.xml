    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a therapy that uses a machine called a
      continuous high frequency oscillator (CHFO) is more successful at removing mucus than
      medications that thin out the mucus.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both of these therapies (CHFO and medication) are currently used in the Pediatric Intensive
      Care Unit and Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. This research study is being done
      because the investigator is trying to learn if the mechanical removal of mucus with CHFO will
      effectively re-inflate the collapsed area of lung. Specifically, the study team will
      determine if CHFO can improve lung inflation with the same or improved vital signs (heart
      rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate), and the same or improved ability to help the lungs
      move oxygen into the blood.

      One of the problems with the medication approach is that while it thins out the mucus, actual
      removal from the lung requires a strong cough which is difficult for infants and children to
      produce when they are sedated and on a ventilator (breathing machine).

      Thus, the aim of this research study is to test whether children with atelectasis on a
      ventilator are more likely to improve with mechanical removal of their mucus with the CHFO as
      compared with medications that thin out the mucus. CHFO and all the medications used in this
      study are part of the standard of care for atelectesis. However, there is no information on
      which combination works best and no one agrees that one approach is more effective than
      another. Usually patients are evaluated for 48 hours after starting treatment, before adding
      or making any changes.

    <description>An atelectasis score (AS), as published by Deakins, et al. 2002, was assigned to each radiograph as follows:
0 Complete resolution of collapse
Partial collapse of 1 segment or lobe
Partial collapse of ≥ 2 segments or lobes
Complete collapse of 1 segment or lobe
Complete collapse of ≥ 2 segments or lobes
In the event of inter-rater disagreement, the scores were averaged. Improvement was defined as any decrease in AS ≥ 0.5. Worsening was defined as an increase in AS ≥ 0.5 or escalation of respiratory support modality (i.e. high frequency ventilation).</description>

    <description>The deadspace-to-tidal volume (Vd/Vt) ratio is a parameter that is measured in mechanically ventilated patients as a way to assess the severity of gas exchange impairment and to assist in determining whether a patient is ready to be weaned from the ventilator. The change from baseline was measured at 48 hours, with a decreasing ratio indicating improvement.</description>

        <description>The deadspace-to-tidal volume (Vd/Vt) ratio is a parameter that is measured in mechanically ventilated patients as a way to assess the severity of gas exchange impairment and to assist in determining whether a patient is ready to be weaned from the ventilator. The change from baseline was measured at 48 hours, with a decreasing ratio indicating improvement.</description>
