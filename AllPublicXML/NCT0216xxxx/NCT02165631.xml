    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to hypothesize that Simbrinza will achieve a decrease
      in intraocular pressure and increase in ocular perfusion pressure throughout the diurnal and
      nocturnal periods. The primary aim of this study will be to determine the effects of
      Simbrinza at multiple intervals throughout a 24-hour period. The secondary aim will be to
      compare these to those of timolol.

      Intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor for the development of glaucoma. In
      addition, it is the only modifiable factor in the prevention and subsequent treatment of
      glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Most clinicians only have access to a single IOP measurement
      during a patient visit that may only occur once every four months. These snapshots in time
      are probably not adequate for the optimal management of glaucoma. Diurnal IOP curves can
      provide a better estimate of each patient's individual IOP variation throughout the day.
      However diurnal curves do not typically cover another crucial time, the nocturnal period.
      Glaucomatous eyes have been shown to have different IOP curves during the nocturnal period
      compared to healthy controls. In addition, different classes of glaucoma drugs have variable
      IOP lowering effects during the nocturnal hours compared to the diurnal/wake period. For
      example, the betablocker timolol was shown to lower IOP during daytime hours but failed to
      lower IOP during the nocturnal period in the habitual position. Similarly, the alpha-agonist
      brimonidine failed to lower IOP overnight after significantly lowering IOP during the diurnal
      period. On the other hand, the prostaglandin analogues, including latanoprost and travoprost,
      lowered IOP throughout the diurnal and nocturnal periods although nocturnal lowering appears
      less than the daytime hours. Therefore it is crucial to determine an accurate IOP curve for
      each form of medication during both wake and sleep hours.
