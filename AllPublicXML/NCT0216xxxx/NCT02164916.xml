    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well irinotecan hydrochloride and cetuximab with
      or without vemurafenib works in treating patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to
      nearby tissue or lymph nodes, that has spread to other places in the body, or cannot be
      removed by surgery. Irinotecan hydrochloride and vemurafenib may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      cetuximab, may block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known
      whether irinotecan hydrochloride and cetuximab are more effective with or without vemurafenib
      in treating colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene
      homolog B (BRAF) mutant metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with irinotecan
      (irinotecan hydrochloride), cetuximab, and vemurafenib, compared to a control arm of
      irinotecan and cetuximab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicity associated with each of the treatment
      arms in this patient population.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall survival (OS) in treatment Arms 1 and 2. II. To evaluate the overall
      response rate (ORR), including confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial response, in
      treatment Arms 1 and 2 in the subset of patients with measurable disease.

      III. To estimate rates of OS, ORR, and PFS in patients who register to Arm 3 after disease
      progression on Arm 1.

      IV. To evaluate low-frequency Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) or
      neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-ras) oncogene homolog (NRAS) mutations as detected by high-depth
      sequencing as predictive biomarkers of efficacy.

      V. To evaluate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha
      (PIK3CA) pathway activation through PIK3CA mutations or phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)
      protein loss as a predictive biomarker of innate resistance to this regimen.

      VI. To evaluate gene expression signatures from screened patients with v-raf murine sarcoma
      viral oncogene homolog B wild type (BRAFWT) and BRAFV600E tumors.

      VII. To provide validation of BRAF immunohistochemistry (IHC) using complementary sequencing
      methodology from screened patients with BRAFWT and BRAFV600E tumors.

      VIII. To confirm the estimated sensitivity of detectable BRAF V600E circulating cell-free
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as a non-invasive biomarker for BRAF V600E mutation as detected
      by IHC in the primary tumor.

      IX. To correlate radiographic tumor response with change in quantification of BRAFV600E
      alleles in circulating cell-free DNA.

      X. To monitor for known mechanism of acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR) inhibition in circulating cell-free DNA (KRAS, NRAS mutations).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) and irinotecan hydrochloride IV on days
      1 and 14. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients with disease progression may cross over to Arm II.

      ARM II: Patients receive cetuximab and irinotecan hydrochloride as in Arm I and vemurafenib
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-6 months for 3 years.

      <textblock>
        -  STEP I INITIAL REGISTRATION: BRAFV600E TESTING:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically documented adenocarcinoma of the
             colon or rectum that is either metastatic, or locally advanced and unresectable

          -  Patients must have BRAFV600E mutant status documented by a Clinical Laboratory
             Improvements Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory on a pathology report prior to
             Step 2 registration; use of an Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved test is
             preferred although other BRAF tests at a CLIA-certified laboratory may also be
             accepted; if a BRAFV600E mutation is known, then the patient must be registered to
             Step 2 Randomization immediately following Step 1 Initial Registration; if testing has
             not been performed locally, BRAFV600E testing must be completed by the central lab
             prior to Step 2 Randomization; if the specimen does not have a BRAFV600E mutation, the
             patient is ineligible for Step 2 Randomization

          -  Brain metastases are allowed if they have been adequately treated with radiotherapy or
             surgery and stable for at least 90 days prior to Step 1 Initial Registration; eligible
             patients should be neurologically asymptomatic and without corticosteroid treatment
             for at least 7 days prior to Step 1 Initial Registration

          -  Patients must have had one or two prior regimens of systemic chemotherapy for
             metastatic disease; prior treatment with irinotecan is allowed; a maintenance regimen
             of 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine, with or without bevacizumab, should not be counted
             as a separate line of treatment; prior treatment for metastatic disease is not
             required for patients who experienced disease recurrence during or within 6 months of
             completion of adjuvant chemotherapy

          -  Patients must not have been treated with any of the following prior to Step 2
             Randomization:

               -  Cetuximab, panitumumab, or any other monoclonal antibody against EGFR or
                  inhibitor of EGFR

               -  BRAF inhibitor including, but not limited to, vemurafenib or dabrafenib;
                  regorafenib is not considered a BRAF inhibitor for the purpose of determining
                  trial eligibility

               -  Mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitor
                  including, but not limited to, trametinib or selumetinib

             (with the exception of CTCAE v4.0 grade 2 neuropathy) prior to Step 1 Initial
             Registration

          -  Patients must not have a tumor with a mutation detected in codons 12 or 13 in KRAS;
             patients must not have a tumor with a known mutation detected in codons 61, 117, or
             146 of KRAS or NRAS
