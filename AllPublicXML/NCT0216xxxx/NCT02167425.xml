    <textblock>
      To improve ART initiation among people who inject drugs, the investigators propose to develop
      and pilot a multi-component Integrated Methadone and Antiretroviral Therapy strategy (IMAT)
      in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. In doing so, the investigators anticipate building a functional
      model of methadone and ART integration that improves the effectiveness and efficiency of
      service delivery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of the proposed research is to develop and test an innovative
      implementation model (IMAT) for the effective integration of HIV care and treatment with
      methadone services in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The investigators will utilize the PRECEDE
      framework to inform the intervention to improve linkage of HIV-positive methadone patients to
      ART. This model suggests that strategies intended to improve health care delivery should
      consider a combination of three factors: 1) 'predisposing factors' - characteristics such as
      knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and motivation to change, 2) 'enabling factors' -
      characteristics that enable someone to act on their desired behavior and 3) 'reinforcing
      factors' - factors that encourage repetition or persistence of behavior. Therefore, our IMAT
      approach uses 1) targeted education and mentoring for providers that predispose them to
      timely ART initiation, 2) POC CD4 count platforms (PIMA, Alere) providing real-time screening
      and results that enable ART initiation and 3) an alerts and reminder dashboard (e.g., a
      summary of key indicators for improved decision making) for providers that reinforce ART
      initiation. Additionally, our approach will lay the foundation for developing implementation
      strategies for future point-of-care technologies such as viral load.

      The study will combine a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methodologies to inform and
      evaluate the IMAT intervention.

      A baseline qualitative study using in-depth interviews will be conducted among providers and
      methadone clients to understand predisposing, enabling and reinforcing factors related to
      integration of HIV care and treatment into the methadone clinic. Information gained from
      these qualitative assessments will inform and support the IMAT strategy. In addition,
      HIV-positive methadone clients will be randomly selected to complete a baseline
      cross-sectional survey to collect data on patient satisfaction, access to HIV care, current
      treatment navigation access, and HIV care literacy.

      The investigators will assess the effectiveness of IMAT with a quasi-experimental pre-post
      cohort design and a pre-post cross-sectional survey to examine changes in patient- and
      provider-level outcomes after implementation of IMAT compared to before IMAT. In addition,
      The investigators will assess the feasibility and acceptability of the IMAT strategy using a
      post-implementation cross-sectional survey with a particular emphasis on satisfaction with
      services; a time motion study to understand the timeliness of care provision; and in-depth
      interviews with patients and providers to understand experiences with the IMAT strategy.

    <description>The IMAT intervention will combine three main strategies: point-of-care (POC) CD4 screening, provider training and mentoring, and an alerts and reminder dashboard. The POC CD4 platform will provide real-time clinical staging, enabling providers within the methadone clinic to screen HIV-infected patients for ART eligibility. Coupled with this technology, appropriate training and mentoring will predispose providers to effectively link patients to ART and integration of an alert and reminder dashboard will reinforce behavior change and strengthen processes.</description>

        The study sites will include the methadone clinics at Muhimbili National Hospital,
        Mwananyamala Regional Hospital, and Temeke Regional Hospital. The study population includes
        methadone patients and the providers of clinical services at these facilities.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Methadone clients living with HIV but not linked to ART are the primary study population.
        Inclusion criteria for methadone initiation:

          1. opioid dependence

          2. positive urine screening for opiates.

             Additional inclusion criteria include:

          3. age ≥ 18 years of age

          4. HIV-positive. Individuals must also be willing to provide informed consent and be
             fluent in Kiswahili or English to participate in cross-sectional surveys and in-depth
             interviews

        Exclusion Criteria:

        We will exclude methadone clients from this study who have

          1. received ART prior to methadone initiation

          2. received a tuberculosis-positive diagnosis

          3. women who are pregnant. The investigators have excluded clients who have received ART
             in the past as their inclusion would bias our study results. The investigators have
             also excluded patients with a tuberculosis diagnosis or women who are pregnant as they
             have a unique and urgent need for treatment and should be initiated onto ART
             regardless of their CD4 count
