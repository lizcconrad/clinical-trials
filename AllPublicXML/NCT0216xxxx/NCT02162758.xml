    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the effect of dexlansoprazole once daily (QD) and twice
      daily (BID) dosing on the recurrence of intestinal metaplasia (IM) in participants who
      achieved complete eradication of Barrett's esophagus (BE) with high-grade dysplasia (HGD)
      following radiofrequency ablation (RFA).

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called dexlansoprazole. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate the effect of 12 months of treatment with dexlansoprazole 60 mg QD or
      dexlansoprazole 60 mg BID on the recurrence of IM in participants who have achieved complete
      eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CEIM) and dysplasia (CED) with RFA. The study will
      enroll approximately 150 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance,
      like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups which will remain undisclosed to the
      patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Dexlansoprazole 60 mg once a day and placebo (this is a capsule that looks like the
           study drug but has no active ingredient) once a day

        -  Dexlansoprazole 60 mg twice a day.

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule twice a day at the same time each day
      throughout the study.

      This randomized, double-blind, multi-center, parallel group trial will be conducted in North
      America. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 13 months. Participants will
      make 5 visits to the clinic, and will undergo a safety follow-up assessment 30 days after the
      last dose of study drug.

    <description>The GERD-HRQL score consisted of 10 questions, where participants were required to answer each question on a scale of 0 to 5 (0: no symptoms; 1: symptoms noticeable but not bothersome; 2: symptoms noticeable and bothersome but not every day; 3: symptoms bothersome every day; 4: symptoms affect daily activity; 5: symptoms are incapacitating to do daily activities). The total score was derived by simply adding the individual score of each question. The total score ranged from 0 to 50 where a higher score indicated more severe disease. The best possible total GERD-HRQL score was 0 (asymptomatic in all questions) and the worst possible score is 50 (incapacitated in all questions).</description>

        <description>The GERD-HRQL score consisted of 10 questions, where participants were required to answer each question on a scale of 0 to 5 (0: no symptoms; 1: symptoms noticeable but not bothersome; 2: symptoms noticeable and bothersome but not every day; 3: symptoms bothersome every day; 4: symptoms affect daily activity; 5: symptoms are incapacitating to do daily activities). The total score was derived by simply adding the individual score of each question. The total score ranged from 0 to 50 where a higher score indicated more severe disease. The best possible total GERD-HRQL score was 0 (asymptomatic in all questions) and the worst possible score is 50 (incapacitated in all questions).</description>
