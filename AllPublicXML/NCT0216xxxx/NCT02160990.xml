  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study was to determine the effect of exenatide on gastric emptying,
      satiety and satiation in obese participants. The hypothesis in this study was that exenatide
      retards gastric emptying in obese patients with baseline accelerated gastric emptying.

    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the effect of exenatide 5mcg subcutaneous (SQ) twice daily for 30-days
      versus placebo on gastric emptying, satiety, satiation and weight loss in obese participants
      with documented accelerated gastric emptying of solids.

      Visit 1: Screening - physical exam, questionnaires, pregnancy test. Participants were
      instructed to continue on the same diet and exercise routine during the entire study.

      Visit 2: Satiation Study Day - Subjects returned to the clinic after after fasting for at
      least 8 hours. A baseline satiation/nutrient drink test was performed on Day 0 prior to
      initiation of exenatide or placebo. The satiation/nutrient drink test involved drinking a
      liquid meal (Ensure) at a rate of one ounce per minute until no more could be ingested. At
      the same time, subject's symptoms were recorded while they drank the liquid meal and for 30
      minutes after they reached the maximum volume tolerated. Subjects were randomized to
      exenatide or placebo, then received 30 days' supply of blinded study medication.

      Visit 3: Satiation Study Day - (This test was performed in the last 5 days of the 30 days of
      medication administration.) Subjects returned to the clinic after after fasting for at least
      8 hours. Subjects were instructed to inject exenatide or placebo 30 minutes before the start
      of the satiation/nutrient drink test. The satiation/nutrient drink test was repeated.

      Visit 4: Gastric Emptying by Scintigraphy Day - (This test was performed in the last 5 days
      of the 30 days of medication administration.) Subjects returned to the clinic after after
      fasting for at least 8 hours. Subjects were instructed to inject exenatide or placebo 30
      minutes before the start of the gastric emptying test. Subjects were given a scrambled egg
      breakfast with toast and a glass of milk. The eggs contain a small amount of radioactive
      substance. At the completion of the breakfast test meal, subjects were instructed to stand in
      front of a special camera and pictures were taken at specific intervals. On the same day,
      subjects participated in an all you can eat meal. This meal consists of lasagna, pudding, and
      skim milk. Food containers were weighed after the meal and calories consumed were estimated
      using validated dietary software.

    <description>Gastric emptying of solids half-time is defined as the time for half of the ingested solids to leave the stomach. Subjects were given a scrambled egg breakfast with toast and a glass of milk. The eggs contained a small amount of a radioactive substance. Anterior and posterior gamma camera images were obtain immediately after radiolabeled meal ingestion, every 15 minutes for the first 2 hours, then 30 minutes for the next 2 hours (total 4 hours after the radiolabeled meal).</description>

    <description>Subjects were given a scrambled egg breakfast with toast and a glass of milk. The eggs contained a small amount of a radioactive substance. At the completion of the meal, subjects stood in front of a special camera and pictures were taken at specific intervals.

    <description>In the last 5 days of medication administration, subjects did a satiation/nutrient drink test. Participants recorded their sensations every 5 minutes using a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0-5, with level 0 being no symptoms, level 3 corresponding to fullness sensation after a typical meal, and level 5 corresponding to the maximal tolerated volume (maximum or unbearable fullness/satiation). This measure was the volume consumed when the fullness sensation reached level 3.</description>

    <time_frame>Visit 4, approximately 30 minutes after start of &quot;all you can eat&quot; meal</time_frame>
    <description>Five hours after the standard egg meal ingested to measure gastric emptying, subjects were invited to eat, over a 30 minute period, a standard &quot;all you can eat&quot; meal. This meal consisted of either meat or vegetable lasagna, vanilla pudding, and skim milk. Personnel from the study team weighed the food servings post-meal and reported the amount of food left from single portions partially consumed. The total kcal of the food consumed was analyzed by using validated software.</description>

    <measure>Aggregate Satiation Symptom Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 3, approximately 30 min after ingestion of nutrient drink test</time_frame>
    <description>Postprandial fullness, nausea, bloating, and pain were measured 30 minutes after the liquid meal using 100 mm horizontal visual analog scales (VAS). The subscale scores could each range from &quot;none&quot;(0) to &quot;worst ever&quot; (100) at the left and right ends of the lines for each symptom. These satiation symptom scores (postprandial fullness, nausea, bloating, and pain) were combined to generate a total scale score with a different total scale range (0 - 400 mm) with 0 mm indicating &quot;none&quot; and 400 indicating &quot;worst ever.&quot;</description>

        <description>Gastric emptying of solids half-time is defined as the time for half of the ingested solids to leave the stomach. Subjects were given a scrambled egg breakfast with toast and a glass of milk. The eggs contained a small amount of a radioactive substance. Anterior and posterior gamma camera images were obtain immediately after radiolabeled meal ingestion, every 15 minutes for the first 2 hours, then 30 minutes for the next 2 hours (total 4 hours after the radiolabeled meal).</description>

Participants recorded their sensations every 5 minutes using a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0-5, with level 0 being no symptoms, level 3 corresponding to fullness sensation after a typical meal, and level 5 corresponding to the maximal tolerated volume (maximum or unbearable fullness/satiation).

The subscale scores could each range from &quot;none&quot;(0) to &quot;worst ever&quot; (100) at the left and right ends of the lines for each symptom. These satiation symptom scores (postprandial fullness, nausea, bloating, and pain) were combined to generate a total scale score with a different total scale range (0 - 400 mm) with 0 mm indicating &quot;none&quot; and 400 indicating &quot;worst ever.&quot;</description>

          <title>Aggregate Satiation Symptom Score</title>
          <description>Postprandial fullness, nausea, bloating, and pain were measured 30 minutes after the liquid meal using 100 mm horizontal visual analog scales (VAS). The subscale scores could each range from &quot;none&quot;(0) to &quot;worst ever&quot; (100) at the left and right ends of the lines for each symptom. These satiation symptom scores (postprandial fullness, nausea, bloating, and pain) were combined to generate a total scale score with a different total scale range (0 - 400 mm) with 0 mm indicating &quot;none&quot; and 400 indicating &quot;worst ever.&quot;</description>
