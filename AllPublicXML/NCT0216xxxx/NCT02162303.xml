    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the effects of colchicine on vascular inflammation
      measured by (FDG)-PET imaging in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease. This effect
      will also be measured by soluble plasma biomarkers. Finally, an optional pharmacogenomic
      investigation will be performed to identify genetic biomarkers of patient response.

    <textblock>
      This is an interventional trial targetting patients 18 years old or older with a carotid
      artery or an ascending aorta to background ration (TBR) of â‰¥1.6 as determined by 18
      fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake measured by positron emission tomography (PET) as
      evidence of atherosclerotic plaque inflammation.

      Following randomization,patients will be followed over a period of 6 months (24 weeks),
      through 2 phone contacts at 6 and 20 weeks and 2 on-site visits at 12 and 24 weeks.

      Each on-site visits will include blood draws to monitor routine chemistry and hematology,as
      well as biomarkers and lipid profiles.

      Each phone contacts will include monitoring of patient's general health and well-being.

      PET imaging will be performed at baseline and at the 24-weeks visit.

      Safety in this study will be assessed by clinical laboratory parameters, physical
      examinations, ECGs, vital signs, and the frequency and intensity of clinical adverse events
      (AEs).

      The Montreal Health Innovations Coordinating Center (MHICC) will be responsible for
      processing and quality control of the data. Project management will be carried out as
      described in the MHICC standard operating procedures (SOPs) for clinical studies. The
      handling of data, including data quality control, will comply with all applicable regulatory
      guidelines, MHICC SOPs and the study Data Management Plan. As such, a MHICC medical monitor
      will be appointed to the trial as the serious adverse event reporting contact (24/7).
