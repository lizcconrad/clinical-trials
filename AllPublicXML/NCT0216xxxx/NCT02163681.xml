    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop rapid MRI techniques for imaging the lung with
      hyperpolarized helium-3 gas as an inhaled contrast agent. These techniques will be piloted in
      adults and older children before testing them in younger children and infants. The purpose is
      to enable imaging of non-sedated infants by imaging so fast as to freeze motion.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  MRI sequence development (n=40): Healthy subjects and patients with CF, BPD, or asthma
             will be used in the development of the rapid imaging techniques. These subjects will
             be age 4 months to 65 years old. Healthy subjects can have no history of chronic
             respiratory disease. The subjects with CF or asthma must have a physician diagnosis of
             their respective disease.

          -  Proof-of-Concept Study (n=30): Ten healthy infants,10 infants with CF, and 10 infants
             with BPD age 4-24 months will be imaged in the proof-of-concept study. Healthy infant
             must have had an uncomplicated term birth and have no history of chronic respiratory
             symptoms. The patients with CF must have a physician diagnosis of CF and be at their
             baseline clinical status on the day of imaging.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any condition for which a MRI procedure is contraindicated.

          -  Presence of any non-MRI compatible metallic material in the body, such as pacemakers,
             metallic clips, etc.

          -  Likelihood of claustrophobia

          -  Chest circumference greater than that of the helium magnetic resonance (MR) coil.

          -  Pregnancy, by report of subject. Clinically in the Department of Radiology at UVA,
             self report is used when screening patients for MR scans as well as CT scans and
             fluoroscopy studies. If the subject reports there is any chance of their being
             pregnant a urine pregnancy test will be performed prior to any imaging.
