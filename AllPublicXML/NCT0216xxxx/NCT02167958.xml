  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether stem cells collected from a donor's blood
      stream will be as safe and effective as using bone marrow collected from a donor's pelvic
      bone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to assess the safety and potential efficacy of haploidentical
      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation using a nonmyeloablative preparative regimen and
      post-transplant cyclophosphamide. The overall objective of this study is to collect the
      efficacy and safety data to provide the basis to decide whether a larger study of clinical
      efficacy is warranted in this setting.

    <description>Donors who consent to PBSC donation will receive 5 daily doses of G-CSF, 10 μg/kg/day by subcutaneous injection commencing on day -5. PBSC's will be collected in the afternoon of day -1, stored at 4C overnight, and infused as soon as possible on day 0. If the collection on day -1 contains less than 5.0 X 106 CD34+ cells per kg recipient weight, a second collection will be performed the following morning and infused on day 0. Quantitation of CD34 and CD3 cells will be performed by the Cellular Therapy Lab. For all patients, the target number of CD34 cells to be infused should be 5-6 X 106 cells per kg recipient weight. PBSC in excess of 6.0 x 106 CD34 cells/kg recipient weight may be cryopreserved.</description>

Tacrolimus will be changed to a PO dosing schedule once a therapeutic level is achieved and the patient is tolerating PO. Whole bloodblood levels of tacrolimus will be measured around Day 7 and then should be checked at least weekly thereafter and the dose adjusted accordingly to maintain a level of 5-10 ng/mL. Tacrolimus will be discontinued after the last dose around Day 180, or may be continued if active GVHD is present. Cyclosporine (target concentration 200-400 ng/ml) may be substituted for tacrolimus if the patient is intolerant of tacrolimus.</description>
