  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the use of the FloShield System with the FloShield 10mm reusable Cannula
      and Oburator during standard robotic laparoscopic single-site surgery. The study will
      evaluate the compatibility of the FloShield 10mm Cannula and Oburator with the daVinciÂ®
      Robotic Surgical System during single-site laparoscopic surgery.

    <time_frame>1 - 4hr (Initial insertion to final withdrawal of the laparoscope)</time_frame>
    <description>Completion rate is the percentage of users who successfully complete the task without critical errors. A critical error is defined as an error that results in an incorrect or incomplete outcome (Grade 1 and 2). In other words, the completion rate represents the percentage of participants who, when they are finished with the specified task, have an &quot;output&quot; that is correct (Grade 3 - 5). Note: If a participant requires assistance in order to achieve a correct output then the task will be scored as a critical error and the overall completion rate for the task will be affected. A completion rate of 90% is the goal for each task in this usability test.</description>
