  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the research are to assess the effects of increased protein and fiber
      intake at breakfast on neural activation in brain regions associated with appetitive drive
      and reward-driven eating, measures of subjective appetite, and ingestive behavior in
      overweight adults. Additional outcomes of interest include the effects of the breakfast
      intervention on blood sugar and cholesterol profiles.

      The objectives of the research are to assess the effects of increased protein and fiber
      intake at breakfast on neural activation in brain regions associated with appetitive drive
      and reward-driven eating, measures of subjective appetite, and ingestive behavior in
      overweight adults. Additional outcomes of interest include the effects of the breakfast
      intervention on 24-hour glucose profile as well as fasting and postprandial glycemic and
      lipemic regulation. The investigators will test the effects of consuming breakfasts with
      normal protein/normal fiber (NPNF), normal protein/high fiber (NPHF), high protein/normal
      fiber (HPNF), and high protein/high fiber (HPHF) for two weeks in a randomized cross-over
      study.
