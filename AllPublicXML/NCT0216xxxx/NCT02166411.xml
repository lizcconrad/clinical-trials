    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare operative data and early postoperative outcomes of
      laparoscopic myomectomy using barbed sutures with those of laparoscopic myomectomy using
      conventional sutures .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Uterine leiomayomas are the most common pelvic tumors in women. About 25% of uterine
           fibroids causes symptoms such as bleeding , pain ,infertility , recurrent abortion and
           pelvic pressure symptoms . Surgery is the main line of treatment of symptomatic uterine
           fibroids. Hysterectomy is the typical management for patients who do not desire
           fertility .Myomectomy is usually considered in patients who desire future fertility or
           decline hysterectomy . Myomectomy has been traditionally performed by laparotomy. During
           the past few decades , laparoscopic, hysteroscopic, and robotic myomectomy have largely
           replaced open myomectomy .

        -  A recent meta-analysis revealed that laparoscopic myomectomy was associated with less
           hemoglobin drop, reduced operative blood loss, diminished postoperative pain and fewer
           overall complications. On the other , the operative time was significantly longer with
           laparoscopic myomectomy . The main difficulties encountered during laparoscopy that
           causes prolongation of operative time are difﬁculties in knot tying and difficulties in
           maintaining adequate tension of the suture line .

        -  Recently, barbed suturing systems were used in gynecologic surgery . In barbed suturing
           systems , delayed-absorbable or non-absorbable material is interrupted with barbs that
           prevent slippage through tissues and is used to suture tissues without knots. With the
           barbed sutures , the wound tension is evenly distributed across the length of the
           filament rather than at the knots at the end of the suture. The absence of knots and the
           uniform tension of the thread on tissues lead to less ischemic damage, with subsequent
           reduction of pain and adhesions .

        -  A retrospective study comparing the perioperative outcomes of laparoscopic myomectomy
           using a bidirectional barbed suture (107 patients) with those of laparoscopic myomectomy
           using conventional smooth suture (31 patients) revealed that the use of bidirectional
           barbed suture was found to significantly shorten the duration of surgery and reduce the
           duration of hospital stay.

        -  Till now , there is only one small randomized controllrd study (n=22 in each arm) which
           compared the use of barbed suture with conventional suture in laparoscopic myomectomy
           .The myoma bed was closed with either conventional polyglactin suture or unidirectional
           barbed suture . The operative time was shorter in the barbed suture group (73.3 ± 21.4
           min Vs. 80.7 ± 18.6 min) but this difference failed to reach statistical significance
           because of small sample size . However, the time required to suture the myoma beds was
           significantly lower in the barbed suture group .

    <description>A transverse incision will be made over the myoma using unipolar hook and a cleavage plane between the myoma and uterus will be developed by sharp dissection. After the identification of the cleavage plane, the fibroid will be enucleated by means of adequate traction with a strong grasper and countertraction maneuvers with another grasping forceps . Bipolar forceps will be used to coagulate bleeding points . The myometrial edges will be reapproximated in one or two layers (according to the depth of the uterine wound) by using a 24-cm × 24-cm 0 polydioxanone double-armed suture on a 26-mm half-circle reverse cutting needle( STRATAFIX™ Spiral PDO Knotless Tissue Control Device, Ethicon Inc , Somerville, NJ, USA ).</description>
