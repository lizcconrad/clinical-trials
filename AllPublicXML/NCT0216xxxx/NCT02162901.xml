  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to evaluate the reach, effectiveness, and costs of two
      patient-centered, theory-based, technology-enhanced diabetes prevention programs to initiate
      and sustain weight loss among pre-diabetic adults (i.e. impaired fasting glucose or impaired
      glucose tolerance) within a health care setting. The overall aim is consistent with the
      NIDDK's Behavioral/Prevention Research Program's focus on individual, family, and
      community-based strategies for prevention of diabetes and its complications. While evidence
      of lifestyle interventions that increase physical activity and improve eating habits to
      achieve modest weight loss in delaying and preventing the onset of type 2 diabetes continues
      to mount, the translation of these interventions into effective programs to health care
      settings with modest resources remains a challenge. The proposed research project will
      conduct a pragmatic clinical trial that employs a hybrid Preference/Randomized Controlled
      Trial (RCT) designed to compare two technology-enhanced diabetes prevention programs in
      achieving objectively verified weight loss relative to a standard care control at
      comparatively lower costs. Adult patients (18 years of age and older) at risk for developing
      diabetes will be randomized to either the Choice group or the Randomization group. Those
      patients randomized to the Choice group (n=240) will have the opportunity to choose one of
      two programs to participate in: 1. A 2-hour Small-Group (SG) session, with automated
      interactive voice response (IVR) systems targeting personal action planning to support
      lifestyle change and weight loss over a period of 12 months; or 2. A DVD-based intervention
      with the same IVR follow-up. Those patients assigned to the RCT group (n=360) will be
      randomized to one of three groups: 1. SG/IVR; 2. DVD/IVR; or 3. Enhanced standard-care (SC).
      SC includes the referral to a currently offered pre-diabetes class. Primary outcome measures
      include weight loss, cost, and reach of each program. Secondary outcome measures include
      physical activity behavior; eating behavior; and process evaluation. It is hypothesized that
      both the SG/IVR and the DVD/IVR interventions will produce significantly greater amounts of
      weight loss at 6, 12, and 18 months following program initiation than SC but will not differ
      from one another. The investigators also hypothesize that the DVD/IVR will have broader reach
      and may be more cost-effective than SG/IVR or SC.
