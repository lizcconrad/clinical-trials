      Aim 1: The purpose of the study is to implement the Seventh Joint National Committee on the
      Diagnosis, Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension (JNC VII) recommendation for monthly
      visits for hypertensive patients with uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) using a
      theoretically-informed, empirically grounded, multimodal quality improvement (QI)
      intervention.

      Aim 2: To improve BP control and reduce disparity in BP through implementation of monthly
      visits.

      Aim 3: To assess potential mediators and moderators of the intervention.
