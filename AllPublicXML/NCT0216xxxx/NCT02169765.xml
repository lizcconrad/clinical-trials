    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading death cancer in the world. It is
      important to explore a safe and effective therapy for early-stage HCC. Previous studies
      reported that radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has higher efficacy and is associated with fewer
      complications and shorter hospital stays than hepatic resection (HR) for early-stage HCC.
      However, meta-analysis and systematic review found that RFA is associated with higher
      recurrence rate and lower long-term overall survival.
