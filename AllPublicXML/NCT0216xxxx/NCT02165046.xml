  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Budesonide + Procaterol HFA MDI is a novel asthma product containing both budesonide and
      procaterol in a single inhaler. Budesonide is a corticosteroid that treats underlying airway
      inflammation in asthma. Procaterol is a direct acting sympathomimetic with predominantly
      Beta-adrenoceptor stimulant activity selective to Beta-2 receptors (a Beta-2 agonist). It is
      used as a bronchodilator in the management of reversible airways obstructive pulmonary
      disease. Budesonide and Procaterol therefore have complementary effects, treating two
      different components of asthma.
