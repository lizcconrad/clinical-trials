  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In assisted reproductive technology (ART) semen needs to be processed. Commonly used methods
      rely on physical properties of the spermatozoa, such as the swim-up methods and density
      gradient centrifugation. It is now known that current processing of spermatozoa does not
      prevent the admixture of spermatozoa with damaged genetic material. The latter have a
      negative impact on the outcome of ART. The investigators developed a new method for the
      processing of spermatozoa with intact genetic material based on flow cytometry and sorting
      (FACS) and on staining using a deye, YoPro. The investigators aim at examining the effect of
      this novel method of sperm sorting on the outcome of ART.
