    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether providing additional intervention support to
      individuals with lower than expected weight loss within the initial stages of an
      internet-based behavioral weight loss program improves weight loss outcomes at Week 12,
      compared to the internet program alone.

    <description>Participants randomized to Early Intervention will receive the same internet-based weight loss program compared to the Standard group. In addition, Early Intervention participants achieving less than optimal weight loss following several weeks of treatment will be given the opportunity to come to the Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center for an individual visit. At this visit, an interventionist will discuss with the participant any barriers that he or she may be experiencing and recommend alternate strategies to assist in their weight loss. One such strategy would be to recommend the use of meal replacement products or portion controlled meals. In addition to this one-time visit, the interventionist will follow up with the participant via phone weekly, for 2 weeks following this in-person visit.</description>
