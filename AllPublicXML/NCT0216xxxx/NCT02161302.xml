  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the temperature pain threshold</measure>

The temperature starts at 32°C, and it heat at a 1.0 °C/sec rate and cools down after a button is pressed or whenever it reaches the max temperature of 52°C. The participant will be asked to press the button at the first sensation of pain to determine the pain threshold; to press the button whenever she can not stand the heat anymore for the pain tolerance determination and, for last, to press the button at the temperature she fells pain equivalent to 6/10 in the numeric scale of pain. The pain threshold and the temperature of pain 6/10 will be determined by the arithmetic mean of 3 evaluations each.

    <description>tDCS will be applied in the head of the patients in 20 minute sessions, daily from Monday to Friday for 2 weeks (10 sessions total). The stimulation will be administered with a pair of surface electrodes, sponge coated, soaked in saline. A battery-powered constant current stimulator will be used for this purpose (tDCS device Soterix 1X1). The stimulation is performed by placing the anodal electrode in the primary motor cortex (M1) and the cathodal one in the contralateral supraorbital area, and it will use a 2 mA current.</description>
