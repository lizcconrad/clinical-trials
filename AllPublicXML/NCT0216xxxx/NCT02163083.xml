  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate, whether the detection of lymph nodes by means of
      intraoperative fluorescence lymphography as part of lymphadenectomy in robot-assisted radical
      prostatectomy is higher than without the use of indocyanine green (ICG).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ICG is a fluorescent dye that fluoresces green bound to proteins under illumination in the
      near-infrared range. Using this dye allows to visualize lymphatic nodes, by being injected
      into the tumor or directly surrounding tissue.
