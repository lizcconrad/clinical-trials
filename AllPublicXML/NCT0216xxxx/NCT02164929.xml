    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of transversus abdominal plane (TAP)
      block, thoracic epidural or paravertebral block (PVB) for controlling postoperative pain when
      compared with opioid you self-administer in your vein using a PCA device. The primary outcome
      will be postoperative opioid consumption within 24 hours after surgery. A total of 120
      subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive a TAP block, PVB, TEA or no block
      (PCA alone).Patients in all groups will be cared for using an established enhanced recovery
      after surgery (ERAS) pathway incorporating a multimodal analgesic regimen using IV
      acetaminophen and postoperative PCA fentanyl.

    <description>Bilateral PVB will be placed between T7-T10 interspaces preoperatively. Patients will be in a sitting position which allows easy identification of landmarks, and the patients are often more comfortable. Ultrasound will be used to identify the paravertebral space. At the appropriate dermatome under aseptic precautions, the needle (22-gauge, 8-10-cm short beveled spinal needle) will inserted 2.5-3 cm lateral to the most cephalad aspect of the spinous process and advanced perpendicular to the skin in all planes to contact the transverse process 3 of the vertebra below at a variable depth (2-4 cm). A 10 mL ropivacaine 0.25% will be injected at both T7 and T9 levels on each side (40 mL in total).</description>

    <description>Bilateral posterior and subcostal TAP blocks guided by ultrasound will be performed in the preoperative holding area. A total of 80 mL ropivacaine 0.25% (4 injections, 20 mL per injection) will be injected evenly upon identification of the appropriate planes. In the event the placement of block is uncomfortable for the patients, it will be performed after induction of anesthesia. This approach is currently practiced in the OR. Extent and degree of anesthetic blockage will be measured using a 5-point sensation scale following the procedure at 4 areas on the anterior abdominal wall (above and below the umbilicus bilaterally).</description>

Extent and degree of anesthetic blockage will be measured using a 5-point sensation following the procedure and postoperatively at 4 areas on the anterior abdominal wall (above and below the umbilicus bilaterally).
A bolus does of epidural hydromorphone (400-800 mcg) will be given preoperatively. An infusion of bupivacaine 0.25% at 4-6 ml/hour will be commenced before incision, and if tolerated, continued throughout surgery. Adjustments that may be required secondary to specific patient hemodynamic status will be left to the discretion of the individual anesthesiologist and guided by the specific patient requirements.</description>

          <description>Bilateral PVB will be placed between T7-T10 interspaces preoperatively. Patients will be in a sitting position which allows easy identification of landmarks, and the patients are often more comfortable. Ultrasound will be used to identify the paravertebral space. At the appropriate dermatome under aseptic precautions, the needle (22-gauge, 8-10-cm short beveled spinal needle) will inserted 2.5-3 cm lateral to the most cephalad aspect of the spinous process and advanced perpendicular to the skin in all planes to contact the transverse process 3 of the vertebra below at a variable depth (2-4 cm). A 10 mL ropivacaine 0.25% will be injected at both T7 and T9 levels on each side (40 mL in total).

            <description>Bilateral PVB will be placed between T7-T10 interspaces preoperatively. Patients will be in a sitting position which allows easy identification of landmarks, and the patients are often more comfortable. Ultrasound will be used to identify the paravertebral space. At the appropriate dermatome under aseptic precautions, the needle (22-gauge, 8-10-cm short beveled spinal needle) will inserted 2.5-3 cm lateral to the most cephalad aspect of the spinous process and advanced perpendicular to the skin in all planes to contact the transverse process 3 of the vertebra below at a variable depth (2-4 cm). A 10 mL ropivacaine 0.25% will be injected at both T7 and T9 levels on each side (40 mL in total).

            <description>Bilateral PVB will be placed between T7-T10 interspaces preoperatively. Patients will be in a sitting position which allows easy identification of landmarks, and the patients are often more comfortable. Ultrasound will be used to identify the paravertebral space. At the appropriate dermatome under aseptic precautions, the needle (22-gauge, 8-10-cm short beveled spinal needle) will inserted 2.5-3 cm lateral to the most cephalad aspect of the spinous process and advanced perpendicular to the skin in all planes to contact the transverse process 3 of the vertebra below at a variable depth (2-4 cm). A 10 mL ropivacaine 0.25% will be injected at both T7 and T9 levels on each side (40 mL in total).

In the event the placement of block is uncomfortable for the patients, it will be performed after induction of anesthesia. This approach is currently practiced in the OR. Extent and degree of anesthetic blockage will be measured using a 5-point sensation scale following the procedure at 4 areas on the anterior abdominal wall (above and below the umbilicus bilaterally).
