  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study for patients who currently have or previously had an H. pylori
      infection and who plan to undergo an endoscopy as part of their care. The purpose of this
      study is to find out how and why H. pylori infections can cause progression to gastric cancer
      and if it's possible for intervention prior to this progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      H. pylori infection is a prevalent environmental cause of gastric cancer. The molecular
      mechanisms of carcinogenesis due to H. pylori remain unexplained and consequences of
      infection are variable and unpredictable. The aim of this research is to examine the RNA
      transcriptome of gastric cancer mucosa (gastric mucosa is the mucus membrane of the stomach),
      in patients with H. pylori infection and examine the spectrum of disease associated with
      infection. We will also examine bacterial content of samples to pinpoint the specific H.
      pylori strain(s) and the stomach microbial profile to correlate with the gastric mucosal
      transcriptome and predisposition of gastric cancer. Patients with prior or current active H.
      pylori infection who are planning to under endoscopic evaluation will be eligible for
      participation. From these patients, we plan to take up to four additional biopsies from each
      area of stomach already being sampled.

      The biopsies will be used for next-generation RNA and DNA sequencing and novel bioinformatics
      analyses. The analysis will be performed at Weill Cornell Medical College by Doron Betel,
      PhD. The sequencing will be performed in the Epigenetics Core laboratory under the
      supervision of Doron Betel, who will be working closely with the principal investigator,
      Manish A. Shah, M.D. Examination of the genetic impact of H. pylori infection in patients may
      expose genetic factors that influence gastric cancer carcinogenesis and give deeper insight
      into molecular pathways that serve as candidate biomarkers for gastric cancer carcinogenesis.
      Our goal is to distinguish patients with chronic H. pylori infection who are at risk of
      subsequently developing gastric cancer from the vast majority of patients with H. pylori
      infection who do not develop malignancy.

      To examine RNA tranome of gastric cancer mucosa, in patients with H. pylori infection &amp;
      examine spectrum of disease associated with infection. We will also examine bacterial content
      of samples to pinpoint specific H. pylori strain(s) &amp; stomach microbial profile to correlate
      with gastric mucosal tranome &amp; predisposition of gastric cancer. We plan to take 2-3
      additional biopsies from an area of stomach already being sampled. The biopsies will be used
      for next-generation RNA &amp; DNA sequencing &amp; novel bioinformatics analyses. Examination of the
      genetic impact of H. pylori infection in patients may expose genetic factors that influence
      gastric cancer carcinogenesis &amp; give deeper insight into molecular pathways that serve as
      candidate biomarkers for gastric cancer carcinogenesis.
