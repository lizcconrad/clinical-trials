  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In spite of major medical advances in heart transplant patients, psychiatric comorbidity
      remains very high in pre-and post-transplant phases. Anxiety and depression are especially
      frequent. They impact significantly morbidity and mortality. Especially because they are
      associated with poor therapeutic adherence and risks of infection and rejection. The
      inability to make beneficial therapeutic choice can be explained by the negative perception
      of events, associated with anxio-depressive disorders. This results in an important
      deterioration in quality of life of patients.

      The investigators assume that better management of emotions might reduce the stress of
      waiting situation and its psychopathological and somatic consequences pre-and
      post-transplant.
