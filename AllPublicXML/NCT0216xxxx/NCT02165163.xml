      The aim of the present study is to evaluate an innovative virtual reality-based balance
      training intervention for improving clinically relevant motor performances (balance and gait)
      in cancer patients.

      The investigators hypothesize that the virtual reality-based balance training intervention
      will improve balance and gait performances in cancer patients compared to a control group
      receiving usual care only.
