  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help overweight or obese children to maintain or reduce their
      body mass index (BMI) through the home-based parent training program the investigators
      developed called DRIVE. The investigators hypothesize that children from families that
      receive the DRIVE program will show greater maintenance or improvement in their BMIs than
      families who do not receive DRIVE.

    <textblock>
      The DRIVE program (Developing Relationships that Include Values of Eating and Exercise) is a
      home-based parent training program with 15 sessions focused on improve family nutrition and
      physical activity and promoting positive parent-child interactions. The aim of this study is
      to pilot-test the development of a childhood obesity program that includes parenting and
      health information. Participants in this study will be recruited through community
      organizations based upon their obesity health risk. Only families whose children's BMI
      percentile is greater than or equal to 75 will be eligible to participate in this study These
      participants will be randomly assigned to either the control group, in which participants
      will receive health information via mail only, or the experimental group that will
      participate in 15 DRIVE sessions focusing on parent-child interactions, health and nutrition,
      and physical activity. Both groups will complete a baseline assessment, mid-point assessment,
      and post assessment in their home, which will measure parent and child height, weight, and
      waist circumference; parent attitudes towards health and nutrition; and parent and child food
      consumption and physical activity levels. Results from this study will provide information
      regarding the feasibility of implementing the DRIVE curriculum as well as its impact on
      parent and child body mass indexes, and parents' knowledge, and attitudes related to
      nutrition.

    <measure>Change in child BMIz</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 9, Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>Body mass index z-scores (BMIz) will be calculated using a digital scale (calculate weight) and stadiometer (calculate height) at each assessment point (pre-, mid-, and post-assessment) from all family members that consent. BMI is calculated as a ratio of weight and height (kg/m) in order to estimate health risks associated with body fat. Correlations of .80 to .90 have been found between BMI and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, the most accurate measure of body fat.</description>

    <measure>Change in Neighborhood &amp; Home Environment Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire will be collected from the eligible parent. This form has been used by the Pennington research group in previous studies. This questionnaire will also gather information on current food in the home and neighborhood accessibility.</description>

    <measure>Change in Caregiver Feeding Styles Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>The Caregiver Feeding Styles Questionnaire (CFSQ) is a 19-item parent report of verbal and physical feeding strategies used by parents. The CFSQ will be collected from the eligible parent. This measure has been used with low-income families and African-American and Hispanic families. This questionnaire is included to evaluate parents' use of ineffective feeding strategies</description>

    <measure>Change in Behavior and Attitudes Questionnaire for Healthy Habits</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>The Behavior and Attitudes Questionnaire for Healthy Habits (BAQ-HH) is an instrument developed to assess parents' knowledge/awareness, attitudes/concerns, and behaviors around healthy foods and physical activity habits. This instrument has previously been used with parents of pre-school age children. The statements in items 6 and 7 will be used in this study. The BAQ-HH will be collected from the eligible parent.</description>

    <measure>Change in Screen-time Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>The screen-time questionnaire will be collected from the eligible parent. This form has been used by the Pennington research group in previous studies. It will be used to gather the average number of hours that parents report their children use computers, televisions, other electronics daily.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Food log</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 19</time_frame>

    <measure>Change in Food Intake Images</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>Parents will use smart phones if available to take pictures of their and their child's meals. They will take images for 1 week at pre- and 1 week at post-assessment. These images will be collected using the Pennington SmartIntake app.</description>
