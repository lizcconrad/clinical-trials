  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complementary and alternative medicine has been employed over thousands of years to relieve
      knee Osteoarthritis (OA) pain. Xinfeng Capsule, a patent Chinese herbal medicine, has been
      used in the treatment of Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) Some studies involving animal subjects may
      explored its mechanism. However, presently, there is a lack of large-sample, multicenter,
      randomized, controlled trials to evaluate the effects of Xinfeng Capsule treated for KOA.
      Therefore, the investigators designed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind,
      multicenter trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Xinfeng Capsule in the
      treatment of KOA.
