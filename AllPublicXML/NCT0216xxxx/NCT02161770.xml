  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part study in patients with advanced solid tumours. Part A will investigate the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD9291 in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment
      compared to patients with normal hepatic function; Part B will allow any patient with mild or
      moderate hepatic impairment or normal hepatic function, who completes Part A, continued
      access to AZD9291 after the PK phase and will provide additional safety data.

        must be met:

        1. Patients must have stable chronic hepatic impairment for at least 2 weeks prior to Day
        1, see Section 4.1.1. Patients with hepatic metastases and/or HCC are eligible for the
        study, providing the hepatic metastases or HCC are not the sole reason for any changes in
        liver function satisfying the criteria for mild or moderate hepatic impairment as defined
        by the Child Pugh criteria. Patients must have globally impaired hepatic function to
        participate in the study.

        For inclusion in the study as a patient with normal hepatic function, the following
        criteria must be met:

          1. Negative result for serum hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody

          2. Total bilirubin less than or equal to1.5 x institutional ULN, albumin and prothrombin
             time within normal limits and must not have ascites (unless related to disease under
             study) or encephalopathy.

          3. AST and ALT less than or equal to2.5 x institutional ULN unless liver metastases are
             present in which case it must be less than or equal to5 x ULN.

             tumour refractory or resistant to standard therapy or for which no suitable effective
             standard therapy exists. Tumours in which inhibition of the EGFR pathway is considered
             relevant by the Investigator are not mandated but are encouraged.

          3. ECOG performance status less than or equal to2.

          4. Patients must have a life expectancy of greater than or equal to12 weeks, as estimated

          5. Females should be using adequate contraceptive measures and must have a negative
             pregnancy test prior to start of dosing if of child-bearing potential or must have
             evidence of non-child-bearing potential by fulfilling one of the following criteria at
             screening: post-menopausal defined as aged more than 50 years and amenorrhoeic for at
             least 12 months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments; women under
             50 years old would be consider postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12

             access) w/in 4 weeks of the first dose; Radiotherapy with a limited field of radiation
             for palliation within 1 week of the first dose of study treatment, with the exception
             of patients receiving radiation to more than 30% of the bone marrow or with a wide
             field of radiation which must be completed within 4 weeks of the first dose of study
             treatment; Patients currently receiving (or unable to stop use prior to receiving the
             first dose of study treatment) medications or herbal supplements known to be potent
             inhibitors of CYP3A4 (at least 1 week prior) and potent inducers of CYP3A4 (at least 3
             week prior) (Appendix H). All patients in Part B and continued access must try to

             or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age or any concomitant medication known
