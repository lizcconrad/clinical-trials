  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence supports the use of two dimensional video analysis to assess the presence of dynamic
      knee valgus during generally used screening tasks, however there is limited evidence to
      support the use of the various smart phone applications as a time and money saving option for
      clinic use . Subjects that present to the clinic and display dynamic valgus at the knee
      during the lateral step down test will be given the option to participate in the study. If
      they consent to the study they will be evaluated with 2-Dimensional video analysis to
      determine the amount of valgus present at the knee during the lateral step down test. The
      subject will also have the smart phone attached to their lower leg and the amount of valgus
      will be concurrently measured by the selected application. The primary objective of this
      study is to determine the validity of an application on the smart phone to provide an
      objective measure of dynamic knee valgus. The secondary objective of this study is to
      determine the possibility of the use of the application as a source of feedback during
      neuromuscular re-education training in order to decrease or eliminate a subject's dynamic
      valgus collapse and subsequently decreased their risk for future injury.

    <description>Patient's dynamic lower extremity valgus during single leg squat will be measured using both 2-D video analysis and smart phone inclinometer analysis. Measurements of 2-D and smart phone will be taken at the same time. Analysis will be repeated at 2nd visit to assess the reliability of the measurements</description>

    <description>For the smart phone analysis we will be using the tilt meter application which is a digital inclinometer application available on the I phone. The phone will be placed in the vertical position utilizing the bubble level feature of the application. The application will be set to display measurements to the closest tenth of the degree, set to log measurements every 0.2 seconds. The subject will stand with knee extended to 0 degrees and quadriceps muscle activated and upper extremity support on opposite side of stance limb. The phone will be placed in the vertical position on the anterior portion of the middle third of the subject's thigh attached using double sided adhesive tape. Being placed as close as possible to level when attached to the anterior thigh with subject in single limb stance with a reading of less than 1 deg as minimum for correct set-up prior to testing. Immediately prior to testing recording will be initiated logging measurements for later assessment.</description>

    <arm_group_label>2-D video analysis</arm_group_label>
    <description>two dimensional video analysis by first placing markers on the subject at the midpoint of the femoral condyles, midpoint of the ankle malleoli, and the proximal thigh along a line from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) to the knee marker. Testing will take place in front of a digital video camera with tape on the floor to give a reference point for the subject being tested. Participants will be tested twice on day 1 and then again 5-9 days later. Subjects will be allowed 2-3 practice trials prior to each test in order to allow the subject to feel comfortable with each test. Following the practice trials the subject will perform 3 trials of each test on bilateral lower extremities. This set up was consistent with the set up by Munro et al.</description>
