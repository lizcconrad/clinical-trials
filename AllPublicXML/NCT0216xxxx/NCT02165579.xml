    <textblock>
      The investigator plans a cohort study of 80 subjects admitted to hospital with a diabetic
      foot infection in order to compare serial bone biopsies (the current &quot;gold standard&quot;) and
      procalcitonin to diagnose and monitor the effectiveness of therapy for osteomyelitis. The
      investigator will collect specimens as part of an existing trial to evaluate negative
      pressure wound therapy in diabetic infected wounds. A high proportion of these patients have
      osteomyelitis and will receive standard therapy including repeat bone biopsy and parenteral
      antibiotics. The investigator expects repeated measurement of procalcitonin will be highly
      correlated with repeated bone biopsy after antibiotic treatment has been completed to
      determine if therapy has been successful or if additional antibiotic therapy is needed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a world-wide epidemic of diabetes. As part of the epidemic lower extremity
      amputations are dramatically increasing. Soft tissue and bone infections are one of the most
      common reasons for amputation. It is often difficult to determine if diabetic foot ulcers
      have an underlying bone infection. Inaccurate diagnosis of osteomyelitis leads to unnecessary
      antibiotic treatment, surgery, and amputation. In addition, we do not have good diagnostic
      tools to determine when osteomyelitis has been treated successfully.

      The role of biomarkers specific to bone turnover (resorption and formation) in relation to
      bone infections is poorly understood. We know that remodeling is an essential function in
      bone physiology with increased osteoclast production leading to resorption of old bone
      coupled with increased osteoblast production associated with new bone formation. The balance
      between these two functions is known to be disrupted in disease states including
      osteoporosis, but has not been examined specifically in infected bone. Procalcitonin has been
      suggeasted as a tool to both diagnose and monitor the effectiveness of therapy for various
      infections, but there is very little work in diabetic foot osteomyelitis.

      Aim 1. To evaluate the role of procalcitonin as a screening tool to diagnose diabetic foot
      osteomyelitis using bone culture and histopathology as the &quot;gold standard&quot; to establish the
      diagnosis.

      Aim 2. To determine the role of procalcitonin as a management tool to determine osteomyelitis
      treatment success versus treatment failure (indicated by bone biopsy) after completing a
      standard course of antibiotics for 6 weeks.
