  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Lunar iXDA scanning with the use of a computer
      software program can make accurate measurements of the length of leg bones compared to
      conventional x-rays.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators would like to see how well the calculation of bone length using Lunar iDxa
      compares to conventional x-ray since the Lunar iXDA exposed patients to less radiation than
      conventional x-rays.

    <description>Tota body scan taken by the Lunar iXDA. During the scan, subject will be asked to lay on their back. Following the Lunar iDXA scan, the computer of the Luna iXDA will calculate bone length. The calculation of bone length will be compared to a calculation from the subject's conventional x-ray to determine accuracy.</description>
