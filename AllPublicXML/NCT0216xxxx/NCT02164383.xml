      The objective of this research is to determine whether smartphone games show promise for
      helping smokers increase their chances of quitting. The central hypothesis is that smokers
      who have access to smartphone games during their quit smoking attempt will smoke fewer
      cigarettes and report less craving than will smokers without such access.

    <description>Every day participants will report the number of cigarettes they smoked that day at baseline and for the first 4 weeks of the quit attempt (starting on the target quit day). This information will be used to calculate a participant's change in mean cigarettes smoked per day from baseline to the first 4 weeks of the quit attempt.</description>
