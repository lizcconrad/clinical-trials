  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the cross-sectional component of this study, our overall objective is to gather a large
      pool of data from which we can generate gait &quot;profiles&quot;. These profiles will consist of a
      constellation of gait (+/- electrophysiological) parameters associated with a particular
      neurological diagnosis or specific lesion(s) in neuroanatomical systems. Once developed,
      these profiles can be compared for differences and similarities; allowing insights into the
      specificity of the effect on gait of a given diagnosis or lesion in the case of the former
      and redundancy of neuroanatomical systems in that of the latter. A longitudinal component of
      the study will look at the evolution of gait parameters over time in a group of patients with
      spinal cord injury.
