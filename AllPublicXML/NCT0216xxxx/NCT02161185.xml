        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Has a competent, adult caregiver(s) who is able to recognize and observe the subject's
             seizure cluster episodes

          2. Has an established diagnosis of partial or generalized epilepsy that includes all the
             following:

               -  A documented history of seizure clusters lasting a minumum of 10 minutes, seizure
                  cluster pattern is observable, stereotyped, and recognizably different from the
                  subject's other non-cluster seizure activity (if any)

               -  A second seizure in the seizure cluster typically occurs within 6 hours from the
                  time of recognition

               -  A seizure cluster pattern composed of multiple (≥ 2) partial or generalized
                  seizures

               -  A seizure cluster pattern established &gt;3 months before Visit 1

               -  A frequency of ≥ 3 stereotyped seizure clusters during the year before Visit 1

               -  At least 1 stereotyped seizure cluster occuring ≤ 4 months before Visit 1

          3. Currently on a stable regimen of AED(s) that includes a benzodiazepine

          4. Weight is 40kg to 125 kg, inclusive

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has a neurological disorder that is likely to progress in the next year

          2. Has a severe chronic cardio-respiratory disease

          3. Has a psychogenic, non-epileptic seizure(s) within the 5 years before Visit 1

          4. Has a history of their stereotypical seizure cluster progressing to status epilepticus
             within 2 years before Visit 1

          5. Has a history of acute narrow-angle glaucoma

          6. Has had active suicidal plan/intent or active sucidal thoughts in the 6 months before
             Visit 1 or a suicide attempt in the past 5 years
