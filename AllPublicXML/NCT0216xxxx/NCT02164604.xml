  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a neovascular retinal disorder of premature born
      children, characterized by the development of retinal neovascularisation, macular dragging
      and eventually retinal detachment. ROP is a leading cause for childhood blindness, especially
      in developing countries. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays an important role in
      the development of the disease. Recently, the BEAT ROP study tested the efficacy of
      intravitreal bevacizumab for stage 3 plus ROP in a prospective, controlled, randomized,
      stratified, multicenter trial. Authors found that bevacizumab showed a significant benefit
      for Zone I but not Zone II disease, with continuation of peripheral retinal vessel growths
      after treatment. The authors also concluded that safety could not be assessed due to the
      small sample size. Other authors raised concerns regarding the results of the BEAT ROP study
      and the safety of bevacizumab.

      The investigators suspected a better safety profile for ranibizumab to treat stage 3 plus
      ROP. Here we present the outcome of 6 eyes with ROP stage 3 plus treated with a single
      injection of ranibizumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The outcome of six eyes with ROP stage 3 plus treated with one single intravitreal injection
      of ranibizumab is presented. Safety issues and side affects are discussed. Follow up was 6
      months.
