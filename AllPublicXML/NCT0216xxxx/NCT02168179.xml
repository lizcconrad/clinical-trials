      This pilot clinical trial studies KeraStat Skin Therapy in treating radiation dermatitis in
      patients with newly diagnosed stage 0-IIIA breast cancer. Radiation dermatitis is an itchy,
      painful skin rash that can occur following treatment with radiation. KeraStat Skin Therapy
      may be a better treatment for radiation dermatitis.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain a preliminary estimate the incidence of early adverse skin reaction (EASR)
      during radiation therapy (RT) and up to two months post RT after the application of the
      cosmetic cream KeraStat Skin Therapy during RT in breast cancer patients in a pilot study.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To associate personal characteristics (e.g., race/ethnicity, age, hormone therapy, smoking
      status, comorbidities, breast size) and treatment characteristics (e.g., RT dose) to
      incidence of EASR at any time point.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients apply KeraStat Skin Therapy topically twice daily (BID) during radiation therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 2 months.

    <time_frame>Up to 2 months after completion of radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>At each time point the proportion of women who have RT-induced EASR present will be estimated and a 95% confidence interval will be calculated around this estimate.</description>

    <description>A series of 2xr tables will be examined to determine the relationship between each of the categorical confounders and the primary endpoint. Chi-squared statistics will be estimated for each of these tables to give some preliminary descriptive data to identify potential variables that may be associated with the primary outcome.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed with breast carcinoma, stage 0-IIIA (including ductal carcinoma in
             situ [DCIS])

          -  Status post-lumpectomy, -quadrantectomy, or -mastectomy

          -  Plan to receive adjuvant radiation to the whole breast or chest wall +/- regional
             lymph nodes

          -  Total dose &gt;= 40Gy

          -  Dose per fraction &gt;= 1.8 use of 2-dimensional (2D), 3-dimensional (3D) conformal, or
             intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment techniques allowed; skin
             sparing IMRT patients excluded; a daily fraction of 2.7 Gy to the whole breast is
             suggested for hypofractionated regimens

          -  Concurrent and sequential boost techniques are allowed for both standard and
             hypofractionated regimens

          -  Adjuvant hormonal therapy will be allowed prior to, during and/or after RT at the
             discretion of a medical oncologist

          -  Targeted therapies such as Herceptin will be allowed prior to, during, and/or after RT
             at the discretion of the medical oncologist

          -  Patients who are able and willing to sign protocol consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior radiation to the involved breast or chest wall

          -  Concurrent chemotherapy; (patients may receive chemotherapy prior to radiation or

             the skin are allowed

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding
