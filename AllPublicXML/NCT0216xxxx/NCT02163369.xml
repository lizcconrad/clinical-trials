    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to introduce the use of aromatherapy/essential oils to
      medical oncology patients at Central DuPage Hospital to assess their perceived effectiveness
      to relieve symptoms of nausea or vomiting and/or anxiety.

      Peppermint oil will be used for nausea/vomiting and lavender oil will be used for anxiety.
      This study will involve administration of aromatherapy to a convenience sample of patients,
      who will then be asked to complete a brief questionnaire. The questionnaire will involve a
      simple likert scale to measure efficacy (in the opinion of the patient) and simple
      multiple-choice questions to determine patients' likeliness to use aromatherapy again.
