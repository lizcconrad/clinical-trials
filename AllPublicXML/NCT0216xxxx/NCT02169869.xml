    <textblock>
      The study will be a randomized clinical trial. Women with less than 10 prenatal visits and/or
      2 or more no show visits who desire an Intrauterine Device (IUD) will be considered for
      enrollment. If consented and meet inclusion criteria, they will be randomized after delivery
      to receive an IUD immediately postplacental or at their routine postpartum visit.

      Women who plan to deliver a live birth singleton via vaginal or cesarean delivery at Oregon
      Health and Science University (OHSU) hospital will be considered for inclusion in the study.
      Women who desire an IUD for postpartum contraception will be approached for study
      participation. The postpartum contraception plan is routinely documented during their
      prenatal course. It is also addressed by the obstetrical team upon admission to Labor &amp;
      Delivery at OHSU. The obstetrical team will identify subjects who present in labor who meet
      the criteria of poor prenatal clinic attendance and express interest in intrauterine
      contraception. Immediately after vaginal or cesarean delivery, consented subjects will be
      randomized to immediate postplacental IUD placement or IUD placement at their routine
      postpartum visit. Women randomized to the immediate postplacental IUD group will receive
      their IUD within 60 minutes of placental delivery. Prior to discharge from the hospital women
      who received a postplacental IUD will be assisted in scheduling a routine postpartum visit
      with their primary provider. Subjects who are randomized for IUD insertion at their
      postpartum visit will be assisted in scheduling a postpartum visit and IUD placement with
      their usual obstetrical care provider. All subjects in the delayed group will be provided
      with contact information for the Women's Health Research Unit (WHRU) at OHSU. If a subject
      cannot obtain an IUD at her usual place of care, the device will be placed at no cost through
      the WHRU.

      At 3 months after delivery, all subjects will be contacted by phone, text, or email to
      complete a questionnaire to determine whether they have had a known expulsion, pregnancy, or
      elective IUD removal. The questionnaire will include questions regarding ease of placement
      and overall satisfaction with the timing of placement. Subjects will be compensated for their
      participation in the study after the 3 month contact.
