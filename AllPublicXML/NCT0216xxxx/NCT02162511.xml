      The purpose of this protocol is to provide access to the CliniMACSÂ® System to hematopoietic
      cell transplant (HSCT) patients who do not have a matched related donor. The CliniMACS system
      is currently approved for use in patients who have AML, and a genetically matched sibling
      donor. Through this protocol, the investigators will be able to offer potentially life-saving
      transplants to patients who have genetically mis-matched donor, who have no other options for
      treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant age is 0 (newborn) to 35 years-old.

          -  Participant has a disorder affecting the hematopoietic system that are inherited,
             acquired, or a result from the myeloablative treatment that can benefit from
             alternative stem cell transplantation according to standard practice guidelines for
             including patients for transplant.

          -  Participant's medical screening clears s/he for allogeneic transplantation as per
             current institutional SOP based on standards of foundation for accreditation of
             cellular therapy and stem cell transplantation (FACT);

          -  Participant must lack a healthy, HLA-identical related or unrelated donor unless s/he
             has a borderline organ function that will preclude the recipient from receiving a
             curative therapy due to the need of post-HSCT immunosuppressive therapy.

          -  Participant must have a matched or mismatched-related donor who is:

          -  Able to receive granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and undergo apheresis
             either through placement of catheters in antecubital veins or a temporary central
             venous catheter OR agrees on a bone marrow harvest;

          -  Healthy as per donor selection screening (following current SOP based on standards of
             foundation for accreditation of cellular therapy and stem cell transplantation -
             FACT);

          -  Willing to participate and sign consent.

          -  Participant or Legal Authorized Representative is able to sign informed consent (and
             signed assent, if applicable) for transplant.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant does not qualify for an allogeneic transplant due to medical screening,
             underlying disease, or lack of alternative donors.

          -  Any condition that compromises compliance with the procedures of this protocol, as
             judged by the principal investigator.
