  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) occurrence is higher in rural than in urban populations of
      industrialized countries. Epidemiologic and human tissue studies suggest that pesticides may
      be responsible for causing dopaminergic cell death at increased rates. While many
      pathophysiologic pathways may be involved in the neurodegeneration responsible for PD,
      genetic factors are likely to determine a general susceptibility to neurodegeneration.

    <textblock>
      While many pathophysiologic pathways may be involved in the neurodegeneration responsible for
      PD, genetic factors are likely to determine a general susceptibility to neurodegeneration.
      There are a number of genetic polymorphisms of genes such as those coding for the cytochrome
      p450 super-family of genes referred to as 'susceptibility genes'. However, they are generally
      not sufficient to cause disease unless a person encounters exposure to an environmental
      toxin: the disease is caused by a gene-environment interaction. Thus, it is imperative to
      assess genetic susceptibility in individuals exposed to a toxin. We will test the
      gene-environment interaction hypothesis by conducting an epidemiologic population-based
      case-control study of newly diagnosed PD patients from three rural California counties: Kern,
      Fresno, and Tulare. Over a four year period, we expect to collect 400 cases referred to us by
      local neurologists, farm worker clinics, and Parkinson's foundations. For each case, one
      population control will be selected at random from residential parcel maps and Medicare
      databases and, in addition, one unaffected sibling control and - when possible - affected
      siblings to avoid potential biases and inefficiencies inherent in the use of each type of
      control. For each study subject, an environmental and occupational pesticide exposure
      estimate will be derived using California pesticide-use reporting (PUR) data and information
      about pesticide application on crops in combination with crop patterns shown in satellite
      images and aerial photographs; in addition, extensive exposure interviews will be conducted
      with all study subjects. In a three-tiered approach to examine the effects of
      gene-environment interactions we will: 1) test for association (and linkage) of PD to
      selected loci associated with PD in earlier studies using multiallelic repeat markers and
      genotyping; 2) test for association using intragenic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      of 50 candidate genes arrayed to create &quot;the PD array&quot;; and 3) use future technical
      possibilities to screen for genome wide associations using array technology to scan
      5,000-10,000 SNPs throughout the genome. Data analysis will employ hierarchical modeling
      procedures to take into account multiple comparison issues and to incorporate prior knowledge
      such as increased neurotoxicity due to the interaction of gene products and chemicals.

        Our case population consists of patients with newly diagnosed idiopathic Parkinson's
        disease living in central California; they will be patients who have elicited care from
        health care providers. Controls will be randomly selected from Medicare records and matched
        to cases according to age, race, and sex.

        Case population inclusion criteria:

          -  first Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis after January 1998

          -  currently living in one of the three target counties (Kern, Tulare, Fresno)

          -  have lived in California for at least 5 years

        Case population exclusion criteria:

          -  have not been diagnosed with idiopathic PD

          -  first PD diagnosis before January 1998

          -  currently living outside of Kern, Tulare, or Fresno counties

          -  have lived in California for fewer than 5 years

        Control population inclusion criteria:

          -  have never been diagnosed with PD

          -  currently living in one of the three target counties (Kern, Tulare, Fresno)

          -  have lived in California for at least 5 years

        Control population exclusion criteria:

          -  have been diagnosed with PD

          -  currently living outside of Kern, Tulare, or Fresno counties

          -  have lived in California for fewer than 5 years

        For each patient, one or more unaffected sibling controls and one population control will
        be recruited. The population control are being selected randomly from Medicare records (95%
        of all controls) and residential parcel listings (for those patients younger than 65 years
        of age only). The controls are being marginally matched to cases according to 5-year age
        categories (e.g. 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, etc.), race (white, African-American, Asian,
        Hispanic, other), and sex. All study cases by definition will be patients who elicited care
        from health care providers. We are aiming to enroll every newly diagnosed PD patient into
        our study and expect patient population participating in our study that is as diverse as
        the rural population.
