  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, use different ways to stop tumor
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Mistletoe may slow the growth of tumor cells
      and may be an effective treatment for solid tumors.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining gemcitabine with mistletoe in
      treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine and mistletoe in patients with
           advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic effects of gemcitabine with and without mistletoe in these
           patients.

        -  Determine tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to neutrophil count recovery in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and mistletoe subcutaneously
      daily starting on day 8 of course 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 3 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine and mistletoe in 2 stages.

        -  Stage I: Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of mistletoe in combination
           with a constant dose of gemcitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of mistletoe
           is determined.

        -  Stage II: Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine in combination
           with the MTD of mistletoe as determined in stage I until the MTD of gemcitabine is
           determined.

      In both stages, the MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45-51 patients will be accrued for this study.
