  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 12-week study will evaluate the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) of the brain, followed by citalopram (CelexaÂ®), for treatment of
      depression associated with small vascular lesions in the brain (vascular depression).

    <textblock>
      Vascular depression is a condition that typically affects the elderly and is associated with
      small vascular lesions. It is more resistant to treatment and has a poorer outcome than
      nonvascular depression. By altering excitability in the cortical area of the brain, rTMS may
      be an effective treatment neuropsychiatric conditions, particularly depression.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to 15 treatments of either rTMS or sham
      rTMS for 3 weeks. Following treatment, participants will receive citalopram for 9 weeks.
      Response rates to treatment; relapse rates; the size, number, and location of the vascular
      lesions; and the amount of regional brain atrophy will be measured. Improvements in
      activities of daily living, quality of life, and cognitive function will also be also
      measured.
