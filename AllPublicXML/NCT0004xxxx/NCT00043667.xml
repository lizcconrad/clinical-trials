      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of a monoclonal antibody called
      daclizumab in treating uveitis, an eye inflammation. Monoclonal antibodies are genetically
      engineered proteins made in large quantities and directed against a specific target in the
      body. Daclizumab is designed to prevent a specific chemical interaction needed for immune
      cells called lymphocytes to produce inflammation. In an ongoing NIH study of 10 adults with
      uveitis, 8 patients were able to decrease corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive
      medicines they were taking while receiving daclizumab for months or even years. The study
      will be conducted at three different sites, including the NIH Clinical Center.

      Patients 6 years of age and older with non-infectious uveitis of at least 3 months' duration
      who require treatment with immune suppressing medicines, such as prednisone,
      cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate, or others, may be eligible for
      this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination,
      blood tests, complete eye examination, and a questionnaire about the patient's vision and
      daily activities.

      Participants will come to the study center every 2 weeks for treatment and evaluation.
      Daclizumab treatments are given by injection under the skin, usually in the arm. Patients
      will receive a maximum of 28 treatments over a 1-year period. Treatment may be extended for a
      few months while other participants reach their 1-year mark. The first two induction
      treatments are at a higher dose (2 mg/kg of body weight) than the maintenance dose of 1
      mg/kg. After the first daclizumab treatment, other uveitis medications will be tapered, one
      at a time. If the disease remains quiet, these drugs may eventually be stopped completely.

      For the first 6 months, all patients will receive daclizumab injections and evaluations every
      2 weeks. After that, if other medications have been reduced and vision has remained stable,
      treatments and evaluations may be spread out to every 3 or 4 weeks. Over time, fewer tests
      may be required during the biweekly examinations if the patient is doing well, but nearly all
      the examinations done at screening will be repeated at 3-month intervals. If inflammation or
      vision loss occurs during drug tapering, appropriate treatment will be administered. If the
      vision loss is too great, the patient will be treated with steroids or other medicines and
      taken off the study.

      Additional, special tests done at selected study centers include the following:

        -  Fluorescein angiography: This test is done to check for abnormalities of eye blood
           vessels. A yellow dye is injected into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in
           the eyes. Pictures of the retina are taken with a special camera that flashes a blue
           light into the eye. The pictures show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the
           retina, indicating possible abnormalities.

        -  Pelvic ultrasound and urine test: These tests are done at enrollment and after 1 year to
           check the kidneys, lymph nodes, and pelvic area.

        -  Blood tests: Additional blood tests are done at enrollment and every 3 to 6 months for
           laboratory and immunology study.

      Uveitis refers to intraocular inflammatory diseases that are an important cause of visual
      loss. Standard systemic immunosuppressive medications for uveitis can cause significant
      adverse effects. Consequently, an effective treatment with a safer side effect profile is
      highly desirable. Daclizumab is a humanized anti-Tac monoclonal antibody directed against the
      high affinity IL-2 receptor CD25 or Tac subunit. The IL-2 receptor system plays a central
      role in the induction of immune responses via activated T and B-lymphocytes, observed both in
      uveitis animal models and on the surface of human cells in patients with uveitis. Blocking
      this system impedes immune responses and can inhibit the development of local inflammatory
      responses. Previous studies using intravenous daclizumab treatments suggest that continuing
      daclizumab treatments at 1 mg/kg every 2-4 weeks may effectively control uveitis even after
      the complete withdrawal of standard immunosuppressive medications. Subcutaneous (SC)
      daclizumab injections at 1 and 2 mg/kg in healthy volunteers are well tolerated and have been
      shown to produce serum daclizumab trough levels comparable to intravenous treatments.

      This is an open-label, multi-center Phase II trial of SC daclizumab designed to provide
      information on current trial design feasibility as well as preliminary safety and efficacy
      data on 15 participants at 3 sites who are 6 years of age or older and who require standard
      systemic immunosuppression to control their non-infectious posterior or intermediate uveitis.
      The SC daclizumab treatments are given every 2 weeks for up to 6 months unless a safety
      endpoint requires study exit. A re-induction of SC daclizumab therapy may be permitted after
      an initial efficacy failure. Therapy begins with two induction treatments at 2 mg/kg (limit
      of 200 mg), followed by maintenance therapy at 1 mg/kg (limit of 100 mg). Beginning with the
      first SC daclizumab treatment, the initial immunosuppressive medication load will be tapered
      in a staggered fashion to a target level of 50% or less of the original dose within an 8 to
      12-week period, if tolerated. After a preliminary efficacy evaluation at 12 weeks, further
      tapering and continued SC daclizumab therapy may continue as clinically indicated through the
      duration of the trial. The primary efficacy outcome is the maintenance of visual acuity with
      the simultaneous reduction of original immunosuppressive medication load. Primary safety
      measures are visual acuity and the occurrence of adverse events. Secondary outcome measures
      include anterior chamber and vitreous cells, vitreous haze, and questionnaire results.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Participant is 6 or more years of age (there is no upper age limit).

        Participant has a diagnosis of non-infectious intermediate or posterior uveitis of at least
        three months duration prior to enrollment, requiring treatment during that period to
        control their intraocular inflammatory disease and avoid sight-threatening complications
        due to inflammation, with a prescribed dose averaging at least 20 mg/day (or greater then
        or equal to 0.25 mg/kg/day) of systemic prednisone (or equivalent) or any combination of
        two or more anti-inflammatory treatments for uveitis, or a regimen that includes one of the
        following or related compounds: cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate
        mofetil, or methotrexate. Participants are anticipated to have, but are not restricted to
        the following conditions known to cause intermediate or posterior uveitis: intermediate
        uveitis of the pars planitis subtype, sarcoidosis, the Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome,
        birdshot retinochoroidopathy, retinal vasculitis and sympathetic ophthalmia.

        Participant's uveitis is considered stable on current medications at the time of
        enrollment. The prescribed dosage(s) for the current medications at enrollment must not
        have been increased in the 6 weeks prior to enrollment, and there are no symptoms or
        history of 'attacks' or exacerbation of intraocular inflammation during that 6 week period.

        Participant has uveitis with no worse than a grade of 1+ for anterior chamber cells or
        vitreous haze at enrollment.

        Participant has best-corrected distance visual acuity in at least one eye of 20/400 or
        better (ETDRS logMAR less than 1.34).

        Participant agrees not to undergo elective ocular surgery (e.g., cataract extraction) for
        the first 26 weeks of the study.

        Participant is not currently pregnant or lactating.

        Participant with reproductive potential and who is sexually active agrees to use acceptable
        birth control methods throughout the course of the study and for 6 months after completion
        of the protocol treatment period. (Acceptable methods must be discussed by the participant
        with the Investigator, and may include use of condoms, diaphragms, IUDs, progesterone
        implants or injections, or double barrier methods.)

        Participant, or their parent or guardian if younger than 18 years at enrollment, is able to
        understand and sign an approved consent form before entering into the study; any minor
        participant must also sign an assent if required by the local Institutional Review Board or
        Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Participants under the age of 6 years.

        Participants who have received previous treatment with an IL-2 directed monoclonal
        antibody.

        Participants who are currently enrolled in another clinical trial or who are using a
        therapy for a non-uveitis condition that would likely affect immune responses or interfere
        with trial logistics, or who have received any investigational therapy within the 30 days
        prior to enrollment.

        Participants with a history or diagnosis of Behcet's disease (since tapering or withdrawal
        of concomitant immunosuppressive medications is not a standard of care for Behcet's
        patients) or a primary diagnosis of anterior uveitis (e.g., juvenile rheumatoid arthritis
        (JRA) or HLA-B27 associated uveitis, ocular conditions usually treated with local and not
        systemic medications).

        Participants with a significant, systemic infection requiring medical treatment at the time
        of enrollment.

        Participants with a history of cancer (other than a non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ
        cervical cancer) diagnosed within the past 5 years.

        Participants with non-ocular, medically significant co-morbid conditions that impair normal
        activities, require immunosuppression, or who have a condition with a prognosis that
        indicates a significant risk of disability or death if the condition were to continue or be
        exacerbated during the study period, or a medical condition that would likely have an
        impact on the participant's ability to comply with the visit schedule. Such conditions may
        include, for example, recent heart attack, significant COPD, brittle diabetes, kidney
        disease, severe emphysema, organ transplant (requiring corticosteroids or other
        immunosuppressive medications), hepatitis or other liver disease, or uncontrolled
        psychiatric illnesses.
