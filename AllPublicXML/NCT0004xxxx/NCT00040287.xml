  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine a new theory for understanding the processes that
      govern behavior change by observing how people’s beliefs and feelings about smoking cessation
      or weight loss change as they participate in smoking cessation or weight control programs.
      This study also seeks to improve the ability of treatment programs to help people maintain
      changes in their behavior.

      The goal of this clinical trial is to examine a new theory for understanding the processes
      that govern short-term versus long-term behavior change. The study will examine how people’s
      beliefs and feelings about smoking cessation or weight loss change as they participate in
      either a smoking cessation program or a weight control program. Also, the study will improve
      the ability of treatment programs to help people maintain changes in their behavior. The
      project involves a series of two parallel investigations.

      Study 1 tests the hypothesis that intervention methods that influence cost/benefit
      expectations related to quitting smoking and losing weight will have different effects on
      long-term smoking cessation and weight loss. The participants are randomly selected to
      treatment programs that induce heightened or realistic outcome expectations.

      Study 2 tests the hypothesis that intervention methods that influence perceived satisfaction
      with behavior change will have different effects on long-term smoking cessation and weight
      loss. The participants are randomly selected to treatment programs that induce them to
      evaluate the consequences of behavior change either in comparison to past or ideal outcomes.

      All of the intervention programs used in these studies are based on highly effective
      treatment procedures. The programs differ in how information about weight loss and smoking
      cessation is presented, how the participants are encouraged to think about their achievements
      during the treatment programs, and how much help is given to the participants in organizing
      their thoughts during the programs.

        Eligibility criteria for the smoking cessation studies were: between 18 and 60 years old, a
        minimum 2-year history of smoking, a current level of smoking &gt; 10 cigarettes per day, and
        agreement to participate in the study.

        Eligibility requirements for the weight loss studies were: between 18 and 60 years old,
        body mass index (weight/height2) &gt; 27.0, 20 percent or more above desirable weight
        according to medical standards, and consent to participate.

        Smokers and overweight persons were excluded if currently being treated by a physician for
        a serious physical or psychological disorder (e.g., heart disease, cancer, depression).
        Women were excluded if currently pregnant, pregnant in the last 6 months, or intending to
        become pregnant in the next 18 months. People who were overweight and who also smoked were
        considered eligible for participation in either weight loss or smoking cessation programs.
        However, they received treatment only for the particular behavior problem targeted by the
        study they chose to participate in.
