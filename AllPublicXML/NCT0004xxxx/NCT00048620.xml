      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of two dose
      levels of weekly intravenous infusions of recombinant human N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase
      (rhASB) for a minimum of 24 weeks in patients diagnosed with MPS VI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient consent

          -  Patient must be five years of age or older

          -  Patient must have documented diagnosis of MPS VI, confirmed at screening by measurable
             clinical signs and symptoms of MPS VI

          -  Leukocyte ASB enzyme activity level less than 20% of the normal range

          -  Clinical evidence of significant MPS VI disease that provides adequate opportunity to
             achieve quantitative, short-term therapeutic benefit in three or more of the following
             parameters: endurance (as measured by a six-minute walk test), forced vital capacity
             (as measured by spirometry), joint range of motion, urinary glycosaminoglycans, and
             hepatomegaly.

          -  Ability to perform all protocol tests

          -  Ability to stand independently for six minutes

          -  Sexually active subjects must agree to use an adequate form of contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of bone marrow transplantation

          -  Pregnant or lactating patient

          -  Use of an investigational drug or device within 30 days prior to study participation.

          -  A medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or other extenuating circumstances
             that may significantly decrease study compliance including prescribed follow-up

          -  Known hypersensitivity to rhASB or to components of the study drug

          -  History of cancer (except low grade and fully resolved skin malignancy)
