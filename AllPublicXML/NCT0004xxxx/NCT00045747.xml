      RATIONALE: UCN-01 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for
      tumor cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining UCN-01 with chemotherapy may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining UCN-01 with fluorouracil in
      treating patients who have metastatic pancreatic cancer that has not responded to treatment
      with gemcitabine.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate, time to progression, and overall survival of patients with
           gemcitabine-refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with UCN-01 and
           fluorouracil.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive fluorouracil IV over 24 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients
      also receive UCN-01 IV continuously over 72 hours (course 1 only) beginning on day 2. In
      subsequent courses, UCN-01 is infused over 36 hours. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-13
      months.
