      The purpose of this study is to test the use of time-released bupropion (Wellbutrin) in
      patients receiving treatment for alcohol abuse/dependence as an aid to stop smoking. Patients
      will receive either a time-released bupropion or placebo. Both groups will receive nicotine
      replacement therapy during the 9 week study. A final followup assessment will be conducted 6
      months from the start of treatment.
