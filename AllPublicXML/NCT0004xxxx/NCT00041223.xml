      RATIONALE: IH636 grape seed extract may lessen hardening of breast tissue caused by radiation
      therapy and may help patients live more comfortably.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of IH636 grape seed extract in
      treating hardening of breast tissue in women who have undergone radiation therapy for early
      breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract for the treatment of
           radiation-induced fibrosis after high-dose radiotherapy in women with a history of early
           breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to time since prior radiotherapy. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract three times daily
           for 6 months.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive an oral placebo three times daily for 6 months. Patients are
           followed at 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients (48 for arm I and 24 for arm II) will be accrued
      for this study.
