      To assess the safety, feasibility, and rate of donor engraftment for patients with primary or
      secondary engraftment failure after treatment with fludarabine and CAMPATH 1H used as a
      preparative regimen for HLA-identical sibling blood stem cell transplantation (SCT).

      To assess the safety, feasibility, and rate of donor engraftment for patients with primary or
      secondary engraftment failure after treatment with fludarabine and CAMPATH 1H as a
      preparative regimen for matched unrelated or single antigen mismatched family donor marrow
      transplantation.

      Study participants will receive the following treatment:

      Day -5 to -2...Fludarabine 30mg/m2* and CAMPATH** 1H 10mg IV

      Day -1.........Day of rest

      Day 0..........Stem cell transplant (infusion)

      Where possible, patients will receive peripheral blood stem cells. When peripheral stem cells
      are unavailable (e.g. from some unrelated donor centers) or insufficient, bone marrow will be
      substituted. If peripheral blood stem cell collection is performed, the donor will be
      stimulated with G-CSF for 5 days and cells collected and frozen until the stem cell target
      number is obtained prior to the patient beginning the therapy. If a bone marrow harvest is
      performed, this will be performed on Day 0 (infusion day). After transplantation, G-CSF 5
      micrograms/kg/day will be administered SC from day 7 until granulocytes &gt;1000/ul.

      Because CAMPATH-1H infusions will provide a persisting level of antibody over the transplant
      period, it will contribute to anti-GvHD activity. Additional GVHD prophylaxis will consist of
      FK506 administered IV via continuous infusion over 24 hours from Day-2 until engraftment or
      when the patient is able to take by mouth, every 12 hours. This is continued until 6 months
      post-transplantation. The dose is then tapered every 2 weeks until discontinued. All patients
      will receive supportive care (prophylaxis for antimicrobial, antiviral, antifungal and
      Pneumocystis Pneumonia, transfusions of blood products and intravenous gamma globulin and
      routine laboratory testing of chemistry and complete blood counts) as per Cell and Gene
      Therapy Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).

      Donor engraftment will be evaluated via standard bone marrow studies (cytogenetics/DNA
      studies for chimerism) on days 30, 60, 100, 180 and 365 post transplantation. If these
      studies reveal loss of donor cells on two consecutive studies and/or evidence of relapsing
      disease, the donor will undergo a peripheral blood stem cell harvest via G-CSF stimulation.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Diagnosis of engraftment failure either primary or secondary, following allogeneic
             transplantation. Graft failure is defined as absolute neutrophil count &lt; 500/mm3
             and/or platelet count &lt; 20,000/mm3. Primary graft failure is defined as failure to
             maintain absolute neutrophil count &gt; / = 500/mm3 for 3 consecutive days following
             allogeneic transplantation. Secondary graft failure is defined as failure to sustain
             an absolute neutrophil count &gt; / = 500/mm3 after attainment of primary engraftment or
             failure to sustain platelet count &gt; / = 20,000/mm3 despite neutrophil engraftment. For
             SCID patients, graft failure is defined as failure to recover &gt; / = 500/mm3 T-cells
             and/or failure to generate satisfactory response to in vitro mitogen stimulation. For
             patients with genetic diseases, engraftment failure is defined as donor chimerism
             insufficient to correct or overcome the genetic or metabolic deficiency.

          -  Available Healthy Donor without any contraindications for donation (5/6 or 6/6 related
             donor or 5/6 or 6/6 unrelated donor (molecular typing for DRB1)

          -  For women of childbearing potential, negative pregnancy test

          -  Active Hepatitis or cirrhosis with total bilirubin, SGOT, or SGPT greater than 3 x
             normal.

          -  Concurrent solid organ malignancy not in remission, except for Stage 0 or A prostate
