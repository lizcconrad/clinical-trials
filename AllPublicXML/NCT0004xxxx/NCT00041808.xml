  <brief_title>Magnetic-Targeted Doxorubicin in Treating Patients With Cancer Metastatic to the Liver</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase I/II Single Dose Trial to Determine The Safety, Tolerance, Pharmacokinetic Profile, and Preliminary Activity of Intrahepatic Delivery (Via Hepatic Artery Catheterization) of Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Adsorbed to Magnetic Targeted Carriers ( MTC-DOX) in Patients With Metastatic Cancer to the Liver .</official_title>

      MTC-DOX is Doxorubicin or DOX, a chemotherapy drug, that is adsorbed, or made to “stick”, to
      magnetic beads (MTCs). MTCs are tiny, microscopic particles of iron and carbon. When DOX is
      added to MTCs, DOX attaches to the carbon part of the MTCs. MTC-DOX is directed to and
      deposited in the area of a tumor, where it is thought that it then &quot;leaks&quot; through the blood
      vessel walls. Once in the surrounding tissues, it is thought that Doxorubicin becomes &quot;free
      from&quot; the magnetic beads and will then be able to act against the tumor cells. The iron
      component of the particle has magnetic properties, making it possible to direct MTC-DOX to
      specific tumor sites in the liver by placing a magnet on the body surface. It is hoped that
      MTC-DOX used with the magnet may target the chemotherapy drug directly to liver tumors and
      provide a treatment to patients with cancers that have spread to the liver.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patients with a Karnofsky (or equivalent) performance status &gt; 60 and an expected
             survival of &gt; 2 months

          -  Patients agreeing to use a medically effective method of contraception

          -  Patients able to understand and give written informed consent

          -  The center of the tumor mass must be &lt; or = 14 cm from the anterior or lateral
             abdominal wall as determined by cross sectional imaging measured at baseline. This is
             required for optimal retention of MTC-DOX by the magnetic field. If more than one
             tumor mass is present, all of the treated tumor masses must meet this criterion

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Patient’s with metastatic liver cancer, or other primary liver cancer excluding HCC,
             with diffuse disease that does not have focal area(s) conducive to local regional
             therapy

          -  Patients with the following laboratory abnormalities:Hemoglobin &lt; 10.0
             g/dL;Granulocyte count &lt; 1,500 per mm3;Platelet count &lt; 50,000 per mm3; Lymphocyte
             count &lt; 0.5 x 10 to the 9th per L; Total bilirubin &gt;/= 3.0 mg/dL;AST or ALT &gt;/= 5x the
             upper limit of normal;INR &gt;/= 1.3; Creatinine &gt;/= 2.0 mg/dL

          -  Patients with either significant cardiovascular disease or any other organ system
             dysfunction which, in the opinion of the investigator, would either compromise the
             patient's safety or interfere with the evaluation of the test material. Patients with
             evidence of a myocardial infarction within six (6) months prior to this trial will be
             excluded.

          -  Patients with an indwelling cardiac pacemaker, cerebral aneurysm clips, or any other
             indwelling device or appliance that could be adversely affected by the use of the
             external magnet

          -  Patients at the time of study entry with a second invasive cancer other than basal
             cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix

          -  Patients with documented evidence of hemachromatosis or hemosiderosis

          -  Patients with CT or ultrasound evidence of portal vein invasion or thrombosis

          -  Patients who have had prior anthracycline therapy with a left ventricular ejection
             fraction (LVEF) &lt;50%, as measured by either multigated radionuclide angiography (MUGA)
             scan or echocardiogram.
