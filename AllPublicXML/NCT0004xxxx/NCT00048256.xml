  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at how people cope with an upcoming bone marrow transplant and how
      personality characteristics influence coping styles in stressful medical situations.
      Personality traits, such as extraversion, optimism and self-esteem have been related to
      active, problem-focused coping styles, whereas neuroticism has been related to increased
      psychological distress and denial as a way of coping. Coping styles, in turn, have been
      related to disease outcome. For example, a fighting spirit and avoidance have been correlated
      with longer survival, whereas fatalism, anxious preoccupation and feelings of helplessness
      and hopelessness were related to a poor disease outcome. A better understanding of the
      relationship between coping styles and personality may help improve supportive care for
      people undergoing bone marrow transplants. This study will:

        -  Explore the relationship between personality traits, coping styles and psychological
           stress in patients awaiting bone marrow transplantation

        -  Identify what coping styles people use to prepare for bone marrow transplantation

        -  Identify what personality traits are related to particular coping styles in patients
           awaiting bone marrow transplantation

        -  Identify the relationship between personality factors and level of psychological
           distress in patients awaiting bone marrow transplantation

      Cancer patients 18 years of age and older who are scheduled for bone marrow transplant are
      eligible for this study.

      Participants will fill out pencil-and-paper questionnaires providing demographic information
      (such as age, gender, marital status, ethnicity, and so forth) and answering questions about
      their opinions and preferences. The information will be used to assess the participants'
      personality characteristics, coping styles, and psychological distress. The questionnaires
      take about 45 to 50 minutes to complete.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last decade, more and more focus has been placed upon the psychological adjustment
      of patients who have undergone bone marrow transplants (BMT). There have been studies that
      focused on the coping styles and levels of psychological distress in patients immediately
      after transplantation. Studies have been done based on a specific point during the process or
      at multiple points throughout the course of the procedure and still other studies have
      focused on assessment points several months post transplant. However, very little attention
      has been focused on patients' psychological functioning prior to transplantation. The purpose
      of the present study is to examine the relationship between personality traits and coping
      styles among patients awaiting BMT.
