  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ramipril is an ACE inhibitor that has been marketed in the US for the treatment of
      hypertension since 1991. It has been shown to be effective in reducing both systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure in adults when used once daily. ACE inhibitors are frequently used
      to treat hypertension in children, however ramipril has not been extensively tested in
      children, and information regarding the efficacy and safety would therefore be of benefit to
      children. This study is designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of ramipril in the
      treatment of hypertension in children ages 6 through 16 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In adults, common side effects include persistent dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue, and
      headache. Rare cases of angioedema have been reported. When used in pregnancy during the
      second and third trimesters, ACE inhibitors can cause injury and even death to the developing
      fetus. When pregnancy is detected, ramipril should be discontinued as soon as possible.
      Ramipril is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to the product or have a
      history of angioedema related to previous treatment with an ACE inhibitor.

          -  Sitting systolic blood pressure or sitting diastolic blood pressure ≥ the 95th
             percentile for age, gender and height; or diabetes mellitus or chronic renal
             insufficiency (as evidenced by GFR 40-70 mL/min/1.73 m2) and a sitting systolic blood
             pressure or sitting diastolic blood pressure ≥ the 90th percentile for age, gender,

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Severe hypertension documented by (1) Sitting systolic blood pressure or sitting
             diastolic blood pressure more than 20 mmHg above the 95th percentile for age, gender,
             and height without antihypertensive therapy, (2) Sitting systolic blood pressure or
             sitting diastolic blood pressure more than 12 mmHg above the 95th percentile for age,
