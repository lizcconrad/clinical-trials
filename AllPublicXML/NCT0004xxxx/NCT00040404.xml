    <description>Number of participants with disability sufficient to require dopaminergic therapy was assessed according to the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Parts I and II are historical data and are designed to rate mentation, behavior and mood; Part III is done as a motor examination at the time of a visit. The UPDRS measures patient status on a scale 0, which is normal or none, to 4, which is severe or the worst scenario.</description>

          -  Received treatment within 6 months before the baseline visit with agents that may
             induce Parkinson's disease

          -  Are expected, within the next 3 months, to reach a level of disability sufficient to
             require dopaminergic therapy

          -  Have BECK depression score ≥ 15

          -  Have known or suspected sensitivity to the investigational study drugs, including
