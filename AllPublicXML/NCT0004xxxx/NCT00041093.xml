  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel in treating patients who have
      persistent or recurrent cervical cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to
      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the antitumor activity of docetaxel in patients with persistent or recurrent
      squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
