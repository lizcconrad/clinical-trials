      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of tipifarnib when given
      together with temozolomide and radiation therapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed
      glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma. Tipifarnib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage
      tumor cells. Combining tipifarnib, temozolomide, and radiation therapy may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish MTD for R115777 in combination with Temozolomide with radiation in patients not
      on EIAEDs.

      II. To define the safety of R115777 in combination with Temozolomide with radiation in this
      patient population.

      III. To assess for evidence of antitumor activity in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of tipifarnib. Patients are stratified
      according to concurrent use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (yes [closed to accrual as
      of 3/15/05] vs no).

      COMBINATION THERAPY: Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within
      5-9 days after beginning tipifarnib, patients receive oral temozolomide once daily for 6
      weeks and concurrently undergo partial brain radiotherapy daily 5 days a week for 6 weeks.
      After completion of radiotherapy, patients proceed to adjuvant therapy.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tipifarnib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 10 patients are
      treated at the MTD.

      ADJUVANT THERAPY: Patients continue to receive tipifarnib as above. With the initiation of
      the next planned course of tipifarnib, patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-5.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses OR 1 year (whichever is longer) in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients with progressive disease are followed at 10 weeks
      and then every 4 months. Patients who complete therapy are followed every 2 months for 1
      year, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months
      thereafter until disease progression.

             used throughout the period of protocol treatment for tumor measurement; if the
             surgical procedure was a resection, cranial MRI or contrast CT performed with 96 hours
             of resection is preferred but not required; patients without measurable or assessable
             disease are eligible

          -  Patients must have a plan to begin partial brain radiotherapy within 5-9 days after
             beginning R115777, and within 35 days (5 weeks) of the surgical procedure that
             established the diagnosis; radiotherapy must be given at the Radiation Oncology
             Department of the registering ABTC institution; radiotherapy must be given by external
             beam to a partial brain field in daily fractions of 2.0 Gy, to a planned total dose to
             the tumor of 60.0 Gy; stereotactic radiosurgery and brachytherapy will not be allowed

          -  Patients must be willing to forego other drug therapy against the tumor while being
             treated with R115777 and temozolomide

          -  All patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study; patients must sign an authorization for the
             release of their protected health information; patients must be registered with the
             Adult Brain Tumor Consortium Central Office (ABTC CO) prior to treatment with study
             drug

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 8 weeks

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of &gt;= 60

          -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow function and the test must be performed within
             14 days prior to registration; eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by
             transfusion

          -  WBC &gt;= 3,000/µl

          -  Patients must have adequate liver function and the test must be performed within 14
             days prior to registration

          -  SGOT &lt; 2 times ULN

          -  Bilirubin &lt; 2 times ULN

          -  Patients must have adequate renal function before starting therapy and the test must
             be performed within 14 days prior to registration

          -  Creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL

          -  Patients must not have any significant medical illnesses that in the investigator's
             opinion cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or would compromise
             the patient's ability to tolerate this therapy; patients must not have any disease
             that will obscure toxicity or dangerously alter drug metabolism

          -  Patients with a history of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or
             carcinoma in-situ of the cervix), unless in complete remission and off of all therapy
             for that disease for a minimum of 3 years are ineligible

          -  This study was designed to include women and minorities, but was not designed to
             measure differences of intervention effects; males and females will be recruited with

             will actively be recruited to participate

          -  Patients must not have active infection

          -  Women must not be pregnant or Breast-feeding, and women with reproductive potential
             must practice adequate contraception; the anti-proliferative effects of the
             investigational agent may be detrimental to the developing fetus or nursing infant

          -  Patients must not be on chronic coumadin therapy for prior medical problems (e.g.
             cardiac valve prophylaxis); this is due to a presumed interaction with coumadin and
             ZARNESTRA leading to a significant increase in INR; patients who develop or have
             recently developed a deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism who are on or will
             take coumadin will be allowed to participate; however, the investigator should be
             prepared to monitor patients INR closely
