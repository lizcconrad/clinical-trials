      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well ixabepilone works in treating patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine any antitumor activity of ixabepilone, in terms of objective response rate, in
           patients with incurable, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior taxane
      therapy (yes vs no).

      Patients (with or without prior taxane exposure) receive ixabepilone IV over 1 hour on days
      1-5. An additional cohort of 37 patients who have received prior taxane therapy are then
      accrued to receive ixabepilone IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 at a higher starting dose. For all
      patients, courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients who receive more than 6 courses with satisfactory response may be treated
      every 4-5 weeks.

      Patients removed for unacceptable toxicty are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 105 patients (at least 74 with and 21 without prior taxane
      exposure) will be accrued for this study within 26 months.
