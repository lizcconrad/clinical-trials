  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Virulizin is an immunotherapy drug preparation that is thought to stimulate the patient's
      immune system, which in turn may slow the growth of tumors. It is presented in vials as a
      sterile preparation for IM injection. The purpose of the trial is to investigate if Virulizin
      in combination with gemcitabine provides better efficacy than gemcitabine alone (with
      placebo) against pancreatic cancer.Virulizin® efficacy will continue to be assessed if
      chemotherapy is changed to 5-Fluorouracil.

      A Phase III, Double-blind, Multicenter, Randomized Study in Chemonaive Patients with Locally
      Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer to Compare a Combination Therapy of Virulizin® plus
      Gemcitabine versus Placebo plus Gemcitabine; Optional Secondline Therapy may Include
      Continuation of Virulizin® or Placebo, Alone or in Combination with 5-Fluorouracil.

      Patients who have not received any prior chemotherapy will be randomized to receive
      Gemcitabine plus Virulizin® versus Gemcitabine plus placebo in a double blind fashion. On
      disease progression patients may be switched to 5-Fluorouracil and continue to receive
      Virulizin® or placebo. Patients may continue Virulizin® alone, if clinically indicated when
      5-Fluorouracil is discontinued.
