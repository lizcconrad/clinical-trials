      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as doxorubicin use different ways to stop tumor
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Oblimersen may increase the effectiveness of
      doxorubicin by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining oblimersen with doxorubicin
      in treating patients who have locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic hepatocellular
      carcinoma (liver cancer).

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oblimersen and doxorubicin in patients with
           advanced hepatocellular carcinoma or other incurable solid tumor (closed to accrual as
           of 11/7/03). (Phase I completed as of 1/16/04.)

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of objective response rate, in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression, response duration, progression-free survival, median
           survival, and overall survival rates in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. (Phase I completed as of 1/16/04.)

      Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-7 and doxorubicin IV over 5 minutes on
      day 5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oblimersen and doxorubicin until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is
      determined, additional patients*, including 6 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
      are treated at the recommended phase II dose. (Phase I completed as of 1/16/04.)

      NOTE: *Other solid tumors closed to accrual as of 11/7/03; only accruing HCC patients

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-18 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this
      study within 6 months (phase I completed as of 1/16/04). A total of 30 patients will be
      accrued for the phase II portion of this study within 10-15 months.
