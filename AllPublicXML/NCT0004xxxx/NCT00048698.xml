  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of direct current (DC) electrical polarization of the
      brain on thinking speed, reaction time, mood, and brain waves in healthy individuals. The
      results will provide information for designing further studies to examine the safety and
      effectiveness of this technique in treating certain brain diseases involving impaired
      cognition (thought processing). The study consists of three experiments; participants will
      take part in either one or two of the experiments.

      Healthy right-handed volunteers between 18 and 80 years of age with 12 or more years of
      education may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical and
      educational history and a brief neurological examination. Participants in experiments 2 and 3
      will also be screened with a verbal fluency test in which they will be asked to say as many
      words beginning with certain letters as they can in 1 minute.

      Participants will undergo the following procedures for the experiment(s) in which they
      participate:

      Experiment 1

      While resting quietly, subjects receive 20 minutes of weak electrical current stimulation or
      sham stimulation with no current. For the stimulation, two gauze pads soaked with a
      conducting salt solution are placed on the head-one on the left side and one above the right
      eye. The current is passed between the pads and may cause an itching or tingling sensation
      under the electrodes. Before and after the stimulation, the participant's reaction
      time-tested by moving a finger as fast as possible at the sound of a tone-and mood are
      evaluated. Some participants also have an electroencephalogram, or EEG (brain wave recording)
      during the experiment. After the stimulation, participants take two brief tests of thinking
      speed, and the mood and reaction time tests are repeated.

      Experiment 2

      The participant sits in a chair with electrodes attached to the muscles that control movement
      in a finger on the right hand. Reaction time is tested as described in experiment 1. Then,
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is used to test the activity of the brain's motor
      cortex (the part of the brain that controls movement). For TMS, an insulated wire coil is
      placed on the subject's scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil,
      creating a magnetic pulse that travels through the scalp and skull and causes small
      electrical currents in the brain cortex. The stimulation may cause twitching of the right
      hand or arm or produce a mild snapping sensation on the scalp. During the stimulation, the
      electrical activity of muscles in the right hand is recorded on a computer. Following the
      TMS, DC stimulation is applied, as described in experiment 1. The stimulation begins at a low
      level and is followed by repeat TMS and DC stimulation at increasingly higher levels. This
      continues until there is a clear effect on the muscle response to the magnetic pulses, or
      until the stimulation becomes uncomfortable. At the end of the electrical stimulation,
      reaction time is tested again.

      Experiment 3

      This experiment uses the average DC level that produced a change in the size of the responses
      to magnetic stimulation in experiment 2. Thinking speed and reaction time are tested during
      the DC stimulation, and the mood test is given before and during the stimulation. This test
      does not use TMS or EEG recording.

    <textblock>
      The passage of weak DC currents across the head (DC polarization) has been done for centuries
      with various effects reported. Many of the reports and studies of DC effects in humans are,
      however, archaic, anecdotal, uncontrolled, or scientifically baseless. Recently, it has been
      shown by objective means, in controlled experiments, that this type of treatment has robust
      and lasting effects on the excitability of the motor cortex in healthy humans. In vitro and
      animal experiments have revealed little about the mechanism of this effect, but neither has
      convincing evidence of toxicity been found at moderate doses. Therefore, we are becoming
      interested in whether this type of treatment can be used to improve cognitive processing in
      individuals with brain lesions, particularly of the prefrontal cortex. The purpose of this
      project is to prepare the way for clinical trials by beginning to establish the safety of
      this technique in humans and then to look for preliminary evidence of potentially useful
      effects on cognition when moderate doses are applied to the prefrontal cortex. First, we
      propose to test the safety of 20 min of anodal and cathodal DC applied the left prefrontal
      area, at 1 mV, by looking for clinical-level effects on verbal fluency, cognitive processing
      speed, EEG, mood, or motor reaction speed after exposure. The duration of exposure in this
      study will match the time required to gather preliminary efficacy data in healthy controls
      and patients. Then, in a dose-finding study, we propose to find the anodal DC amperage
      necessary for producing a clear effect on excitability, as measured by an increase in the
      amplitude of the motor evoked potential to transcranial magnetic stimulation. Then, if no
      significant adverse effects are in the first two studies, a preliminary efficacy study will
      look for differences in these measures between groups receiving anodal, cathodal, and sham DC
      of the left prefrontal cortex during stimulation.
