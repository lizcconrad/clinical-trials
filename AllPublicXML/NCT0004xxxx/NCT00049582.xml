  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of decitabine in treating
      patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy
      use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of decitabine in patients with high-risk
      myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukemia.

      II. Determine the minimum effective dose of this drug that produces demethylation of DNA with
      tolerable toxicity in these patients.

      III. Determine the minimum effective dose of this drug that augments in vitro responses to
      retinoids.

      IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. V. Determine the clinical
      response rate of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive decitabine IV over 3 hours twice daily OR IV over 1 hour once daily on days
      1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of decitabine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
