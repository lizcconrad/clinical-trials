  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Juvenile secondary Raynaud’s (ray-knows) Phenomenon is a disorder of the blood vessels in the
      fingers and sometimes can affect the toes, nose, or ears. Children with secondary Raynaud’s
      Phenomenon have an underlying condition such as systemic lupus, scleroderma, or mixed
      connective tissue disease. When children with secondary Raynaud’s are exposed to chilly or
      cold conditions from weather, cold temperatures, or even holding cold items from the
      refrigerator, their fingers may become cold, numb, hurt, and/or turn purple or white. The
      investigational drug, Pletal(cilostazol), which has been approved for other conditions,
      inhibits the ability of one type of blood cell, platelets, to form blood clots, and also
      widens narrowed blood vessels. It has been used in a variety of other conditions in which
      blood flow is decreased. This study will test the safety and effectiveness Pletal(cilostazol)
      to lessen the severity of the symptoms and decrease the number of secondary Raynaud’s
      episodes in juvenile patients.
