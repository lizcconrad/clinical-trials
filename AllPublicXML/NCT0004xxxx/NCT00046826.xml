  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Thalidomide may stop the growth of prostate cancer by stopping blood flow to the
      tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with thalidomide may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining docetaxel and estramustine
      with thalidomide in treating patients who have prostate cancer previously treated with
      hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with hormone-refractory prostate
           cancer treated with docetaxel, estramustine, and thalidomide.

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen for pain control in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral estramustine on days 1-3 and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 2
      for 3 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for at least 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients also receive oral thalidomide once daily beginning on day 1 and continuing for 1
      year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
