      The study is a 14-day study with a 21-day follow-up period. During the 14-days of active
      study period, participants will receive Racivir once daily in combination with efavirenz and
      stavudine. Following the administration of the first and last dose of study medication,
      patients will remain in the clinic overnight. During the study there will be medical and
      medication histories taken, physical examinations, vital sign measurements, EKGs, and routine
      clinical laboratory tests.
