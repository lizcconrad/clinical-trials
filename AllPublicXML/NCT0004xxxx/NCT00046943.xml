      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of atrasentan in treating patients
      who have prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety of atrasentan in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral atrasentan once daily for 3 years in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 1,400 patients will be accrued for this study.
