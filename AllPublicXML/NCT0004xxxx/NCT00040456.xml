    <textblock>
      Subjects have a form of sickle cell disease, called hemoglobin SC disease. This results in
      abnormally shaped red blood cells that get 'stuck' in blood vessels and then results in
      episodes of severe pain (pain crises). Patients with the more common form of sickle cell
      disease, called hemoglobin SS disease, also suffer from pain crises. Treatment with the drug
      hydroxyurea is available to help prevent the pain crises in hemoglobin SS disease, but there
      is no good treatment to help prevent the pain crises in hemoglobin SC disease.

      It has been shown that one of the reasons for the formation of the abnormally shaped red
      blood cells in patients with SC disease is the fact that these cells do not contain enough
      water; they are dehydrated. Drinking more water will not increase the amount of water in the
      cells. Certain salts and minerals can however have an effect on the amount of water in the
      red blood cells. One of the most important minerals influencing this is called magnesium.
      Magnesium is present in food and also in certain medications used to treat heartburn.
      Magnesium has been used successfully both in animals and people to increase the amount of
      water in the red blood cells and is very well tolerated by most people.

      Investigators are using a new form of magnesium known as magnesium pidolate because this form
      of magnesium may help with the symptoms of disease without causing diarrhea (a common side
      effect of magnesium products).

      Purpose The purpose of this study is to find out whether treatment with magnesium pidolate
      will increase the amount of water in the red blood cell and result in fewer painful crises in
      patients with hemoglobin SC disease while not causing diarrhea.

      The study will last for about 64 weeks (about 16 months).

    <textblock>
      This is a placebo-controlled study which means that the effectiveness of the magnesium
      medication (the chemical form of which is known as Mg pidolate) will be compared to placebo.
      A placebo looks like the drug that is being studied (in this case magnesium) but does not
      contain any active drug of any kind. Comparing magnesium with placebo will help decide
      whether magnesium is better than treatment with placebo.

      The study lasts for 64 weeks (about 16 months) and is divided into 2 parts, each part lasting
      for 32 weeks (8 months). During the first part study medication (magnesium or placebo) will
      be taken twice daily for 24 weeks (about 6 months), followed by no study medication for 8
      weeks. These 8 weeks are called a washout period, during which time the effects of the study
      medication are 'washed-out' of the body. After the washout 8 weeks, patients will enter the
      second part of the study. During this second part, the study medication (magnesium or
      placebo) will again be taken twice daily for 24 weeks. During the second part of the study
      participants will receive whichever study medication that was not taken during the first part
      of the study. Following the second 24 weeks, there will be an observation period of 8 weeks
      (during which time no study medication is taken). The study is completed at the end of the
      8-week observation period. Participants will take magnesium for 24 weeks and placebo for 24
      weeks. The decision whether participants will receive magnesium or placebo first will be made
      randomly by a computer. This is a double-blind study which means that neither the participant
      nor the study doctor will know which study medication is taking during each part of the
      study. However, the study may be unblinded for safety issues if necessary.

      If the participant responds to the study medication, it can be continued after completion of
      the 24 weeks.

      The study medication is in the form of a liquid, taken two times a day (morning and evening)
      with the actual amount taken depending on the participant's weight.

      During this study the participant will be seen in clinic on a regular basis; initially every
      2 weeks, later once a month. There will be a total of 21 clinic visits during the study.
      Three of these are clinic visits that would normally take place in the routine management of
      this disease. The other 18 visits are required for this study. At each visit participants
      will have blood tests to measure the amount of magnesium in the blood, especially the red
      blood cells, but also to look for any other changes that might occur. The total amount of
      blood collected during the 16 month study is 120 ml (24 teaspoons), which is a safe amount.
      Three ml (half teaspoon) will be drawn at 13 visits, 5ml (1 teaspoon) at 4 visits, and 15ml
      (3 teaspoons) at a further 4 visits. At 4 of the clinic visits a urine test will be
      performed.

      During the study participants will be asked to keep a record of all episodes of pain, or any
      other changes that are noticed, in the form of a diary.

    <description>A computer-generated randomization list will be created by a Baylor College of Medicine statistician (unrelated to study) prior to the study.
Patients are randomly assigned to either start with Mg pidolate or placebo and will continue that therapy for 24 weeks. Then, after a 2 month wash-out period, they will be switched to the other arm and continue on that arm for another 24 weeks, followed by 8 weeks of observation off study drug. Both patient and medical care provider(s) will be blinded to treatment assignment. Mg pidolate and placebo will be distributed through the pharmacy with labels that do not indicate the assignment.</description>
