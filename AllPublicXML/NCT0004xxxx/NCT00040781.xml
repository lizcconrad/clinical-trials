      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of gefitinib in treating children who have
      refractory solid tumors. Gefitinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the
      enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of gefitinib in children with refractory solid
      tumors.

      II. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor
      activity of this drug in these patients.

      V. Correlate the pharmacogenetic polymorphisms of this drug with pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. If myelosuppression is found to be the
      dose-limiting toxicity, patients are stratified according to prior therapy (more than 2
      multiagent chemotherapy regimens or radiotherapy to more than 20% of the bone marrow or stem
      cell transplantation with or without total body irradiation vs more than 2 single-agent phase
      I or phase II agents) and extent of disease (bone marrow involvement vs meeting none of the
      stratum I criteria).

      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gefitinib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-45 patients will be accrued for this study.
