  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective cohort study assesses the effects of exposure to organophosphate (OP)
      pesticides on adverse reproductive outcomes in both male and female agricultural workers in
      China. We will enroll women and their spouses, who are attempting to become pregnant, and
      observe reproductive endpoints including (1) semen parameters (concentration, total count,
      motility, progression and morphology), (2) menstrual disorders (oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea,
      polymenorrhea, intermenstrual bleeding, prolonged menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, and
      irregular menstruation); (3) alterations in hormone patterns including reduced estrogen
      excretion (REE), anovulation, abnormal luteal phase (ALP), and abnormal follicular phase
      (AFP) in women and abnormalities of LH, FSH, TSH, SHBG, inhibin-B and testosterone in men;
      (4) fecundability; and (5) pregnancy outcomes including spontaneous abortion, preterm
      delivery, low birth weight, and intrauterine growth retardation.
