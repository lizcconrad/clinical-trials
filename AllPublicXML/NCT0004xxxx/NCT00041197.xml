  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial is studying imatinib mesylate to see how well it works
      compared to placebo in treating patients with primary gastrointestinal stromal tumor that has
      been completely removed by surgery. Imatinib mesylate may interfere with the growth of tumor
      cells and may be an effective treatment for patients with primary gastrointestinal stromal
      tumor that has been completely removed by surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether patients with resected primary gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)
      who are randomized to the STI571 (imatinib mesylate) Arm have longer recurrence-free survival
      as compared to the patients randomized to the placebo Arm.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To ascertain whether patients with resected primary GIST who are randomized to the STI571
      Arm have longer survival as compared to the patients randomized to the placebo Arm.

      II. To obtain from patients with GIST: tumor tissue (before therapy with STI571 and if the
      patient develops recurrence), blood specimens (before therapy with STI571), and serum
      specimens (before therapy with STI571, after completing therapy with STI571, and if the
      patient develops recurrence) for scientific correlative analyses.

      III. To assess the safety/efficacy of oral STI571 therapy in the adjuvant setting.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; STI571) once daily. Treatment
      continues for 1 year in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients who develop a
      recurrence during the year of initial treatment receive imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; STI571)
      at an increased dose. Patients who develop a recurrence after the year of initial treatment
      restart imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; STI571) and continue taking the drug at the discretion of
      the principal investigator.

      ARM II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily. Treatment continues for 1 year in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients who develop a recurrence at any time discontinue
      placebo and crossover to arm I. Treatment on arm I continues at the discretion of the
      principal investigator.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 10 years.

             informed consent or in a separate authorization form and must be obtained from the
             patient prior to study registration (non-US sites are exempt from HIPAA regulations)

          -  If patient is a cancer survivor, ALL of the following criteria apply:

               -  Patient has undergone potentially curative therapy for all prior malignancies

               -  No evidence of any prior malignancies for at least 5 years with no evidence of

             of the abdomen or pelvis

          -  Patient, if female and breastfeeding; NOTE: It is not known whether STI571or its
             metabolites are excreted in human milk; however, in lactating female rats administered
             100mg/kg, a dose approximately equal to the maximum clinical dose of 800mg/day based
             on body surface area, STI571 and /or its metabolites were extensively excreted in
             milk; it is estimated that approximately 1.5% of a maternal dose is excreted into
             milk, which is equivalent to a dose to the infant of 30% the maternal dose per unit
             body weight; women should be advised against breastfeeding while taking STI571
