      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of VNP40101M in treating patients who have
      advanced or metastatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the toxic effects of VNP40101M in patients with advanced or metastatic solid
           tumor or lymphoma.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the antitumor effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive VNP40101M IV over 15 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every
      28 days.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of VNP40101M until the maximum tolerated
      dose is determined.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
