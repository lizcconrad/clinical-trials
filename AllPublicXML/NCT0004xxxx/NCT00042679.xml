  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to determine the following:

      Whether LY900003 plus gemcitabine and carboplatin can make your tumor smaller or disappear,
      and for how long.

      If treatment with LY900003 plus gemcitabine and carboplatin can help you live longer.

      The safety of LY900003 plus gemcitabine and carboplatin and any side effects that might be
      associated with the combination of these three drugs.

      How LY900003 is distributed and broken down by your body when it is given with carboplatin
      and gemcitabine.

      Whether LY900003 affects the way gemcitabine and carboplatin are distributed and broken down
      by your body.

      Definition: The phase 2 study will provide important information regarding effects of
      LY900003 on safety and efficacy of patients treated with gemcitabine and carboplatin.
      LY900003 will be given at approximately 2 mg/kg/day for the first 14 days of a 21-day cycle.
      The dose and schedule for LY900003 administration are based on results of prior studies of
      LY900003 and are currently being used in other studies of LY900003. Gemcitabine will be
      administered on Days 1 and 8 at 1250 mg/m2 and carboplatin will be given on Day 1 at AUC 5.
