  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research is to evaluate benzene metabolism after exposure at levels that can be found in
      the environment, such as the higher end concentrations in the air inside cars and buses while
      being driven in heavy traffic and inside private and public parking garages. To do so breath,
      urine, and blood samples prior to, during and after being exposed to benzene as well as
      benzene levels and benzene metabolites present are measured.

      The research is to evaluate benzene metabolism after exposure at levels that can be found in
      the environment, such as the higher end concentrations in the air inside cars and buses while
      being driven in heavy traffic and inside private and public parking garages. To do so breath,
      urine, and blood samples prior to, during and after being exposed to benzene as well as
      benzene levels and benzene metabolites present are measured. The exposures take place in the
      Controlled Environmental Facility operated by the Environmental and Occupational Health
      Sciences Institute (EOHSI). This allows us to control the exact benzene air level and to use
      benzene containing 13C, a stable (non-radioactive) form of carbon, one of the atoms that make
      up benzene. Isotopes are different forms of the same atom. Using 13C will allow us to tell
      the difference between the benzene and the compounds it changes to in the body that come from
      our experiment compared to what is present in your body from other sources. In addition to
      just benzene exposure on some days the subject is also be exposed to methyl tertiary butyl
      ether (MTBE), another component of gasoline, to take an iron supplement pill and/or to take
      vitamins C and E pills. How benzene is metabolized or changed in the body will be compared
      for these differences to better understand how the body deals with benzene.
