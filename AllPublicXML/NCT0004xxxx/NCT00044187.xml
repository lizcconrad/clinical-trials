  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Olanzapine is currently marketed for the treatment of schizophrenia and acute manic episodes
      with bipolar 1 disorder. This Anti-obesity Agent is currently marketed for the management of
      obesity. In this study, the Anti-obesity Agent is being tested to see if it can treat weight
      gain that may be associated with taking olanzapine.

      The purposes of this study are to determine the safety of olanzapine when given in
      combination with the Anti-obesity Agent and any side effects that might be associated with it
      and whether weight-gain agent can help treat weight gain that may be associated with taking
      olanzapine.
