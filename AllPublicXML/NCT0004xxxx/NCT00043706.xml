  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic Sclerosis (also known as Scleroderma) is a chronic, autoimmune disease of the
      connective tissue generally classified as one of the rheumatic diseases. Systemic Sclerosis
      causes fibrosis (scar tissue) to be formed in the skin and internal organs. The fibrosis
      eventually causes the involved skin to harden, limiting mobility, and can also damage other
      organs. Excess Transforming Growth Factor Beta-1 (TGF-beta1) activity may result in the
      abnormal fibrosis characteristic of Systemic Sclerosis. An antibody against TGF-beta1 may
      modify pathologic processes characterized by inappropriate fibrosis. Genzyme Corporation is
      currently investigating a human monoclonal antibody (CAT-192) that neutralizes active
      TGF-beta1. This study is being conducted in the U.S. and Europe to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of repeated treatments with CAT-192 in patients with early
      stage diffuse Systemic Sclerosis.
