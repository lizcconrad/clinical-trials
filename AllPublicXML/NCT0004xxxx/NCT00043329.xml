  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish a registry of all children with severe, malignant
      osteopetrosis who are treated with Actimmune (IFN-g 1b or Interferon gamma-1b) to monitor the
      effects of IFN-g 1b on preventing progression of this disease and to follow the safety of
      patients receiving it on a long-term basis. In addition, evaluation of the possible effect of
      Actimmune therapy on the humoral response to normal childhood vaccinations in this same
      patient population will be examined.Interferon gamma is a substance that the body makes
      naturally.

      It is made by white blood cells and appears to be involved in regulating the body's ability
      to fight off infection. Actimmune is a synthetic form of Interferon gamma which is similar to
      that normally made by white blood cells.

      IFN-g 1b (ActimmuneÂ®) is currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for the treatment of patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) to reduce the
      frequency and severity of serious infections. It is also approved in patients with severe,
      malignant osteopetrosis to delay the time to disease progression. In research trials, IFN-g
      1b has been given to over 2,000 patients in diseases such as CGD, osteopetrosis, atopic
      dermatitis, pulmonary fibrosis, atypical mycobacteria and various cancers.
