      This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to examine the relationship
      between cognitive processing and motor control by determining whether a part of the brain
      called the premotor cortex is essential to imagining movement. TMS, described below, is a
      method of brain stimulation that can temporarily inhibit brain functions of the area
      underlying the stimulator.

      Healthy right-handed normal volunteers may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be
      screened with a medical history, neurological examination, and test of finger dexterity.

      Participants will perform a sequential finger tapping movement in response to a series of
      numbers (stimuli) displayed on a computer monitor. After 10 stimuli, they will be asked which
      finger they tapped last. They will then imagine the same finger tapping movement and will be
      asked which finger they tapped last in their imagination. During these exercises,
      participants will undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation. For this procedure, the subject
      is seated comfortably in a chair. A wire coil is placed on the scalp and a brief electrical
      current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that passes into the brain.
      This generates a very small electrical current in the brain, which briefly disrupts the
      function of the brain cells in the stimulated area. The stimulation may cause twitching in
      arm or leg muscles. During the stimulation, the electrical activity of muscles is recorded
      with a computer or other recording device, using electrodes attached to the skin with tape.

      Subjects will complete eight experimental blocks of testing. One block consists of 20
      experimental trials, with each trial lasting about 10 seconds. Five pairs of TMS stimuli are
      given per trial, with pulses delivered in short bursts of one second each. After each block,
      subjects draw a mark on a line on paper, showing how much attention they are paying, how much
      fatigue they are experiencing, and how well they think they are executing the tasks. Each TMS
      session takes up to 3.5 hours.

      Before the TMS session, participants will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for use in
      determining proper placement of the TMS coil. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio
      waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. For this procedure, the subject lies still
      in a narrow metal cylinder (the scanner) for about 30 minutes during the scan.

    <textblock>
      A high-level of motor control often requires complex processing of sensory information, which
      likely corresponds to the neural correlates for mental imagery of movement. Such cognitive
      aspects of motor control may underlie other cognitive functions, such as mental calculation.
      The present transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) study is aimed to characterize the
      relation between cognitive processing and motor control. Based on our previous results from
      neuroimaging experiments, we hypothesize that the ability to process information for motor
      imagery would primarily be associated with the dorsal lateral premotor context (PMd) as well
      as the posterior parietal cortex. TMS will be used to disrupt neural processes in the limited
      brain structures under the coil for a short period of time (virtual lesion study). For this
      proposal, 15 healthy subjects will perform number-guided motor execution/imagery tasks. Both
      tasks will be guided by 10 visual number stimuli presented at a rate of 1.0 Hz. For the test
      TMS stimuli, a paired TMS stimulation will be delivered to either M1 or PMd100 (to) 150
      milliseconds after 5 of the visual number stimuli. The frequency of TMS stimulation will be
      1.0 Hz on average for a short period of time (10 seconds). Measurement will be accuracy of
      the task performance under the TMS stimulation as compared with a sham condition. We expect
      that the TMS stimulation to PMd will interfere with the performance of motor imagery more
      than the performance of motor execution. The present study will clarify the neural correlates
      underlying the ability of imagining movement, which is now drawing growing attention in the
      neuroscience community.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        We will only recruit right-handed subjects as assessed by Edinburgh handedness inventory
        (Oldfield, 1971). We will also administer a simple version of the tapping task and assess
        their dexterity to select subjects consistent with the digit skills required.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Contraindications for TMS: pacemakers, implanted medical pumps, metal plate in skull, metal
        objects inside the eye or skull, history of seizures.

        Contraindications for MRI: pacemakers, brain stimulators, dental implants or metallic
        braces, aneurysm clips (metal clips on the wall of a large artery), metallic prostheses
        (including metal pins and rods, heart valves, and cochlear implants), permanent eyeliner,
        insulin pump, or shrapnel fragments. Welders and metal workers are also at risk for injury
        because of possible small metal fragments in the eye of which they may be unaware. Subjects
        will be screened for these contraindications prior to the study.

        Subjects with previous or current neuropsychiatric disorders will be excluded. Patients
        with MRI findings consistent with organic brain lesions such as brain tumors, stroke, or
        trauma will be excluded. Patients with a history of significant medical disorders such as
        cancers will be excluded. Subjects not capable of giving informed consent will be excluded.

        We will not scan pregnant women with MRI because safety of high magnetic field to fetus is
        not established. Therefore, we will administer a urine pregnancy test for any female
        subject of childbearing potential prior to MRI scan.

        Brain functions at a development stage are out of scope of this particular experiment, and,
        therefore, subjects under age 21 will be excluded.

        Subjects who show evidence of unusually increased cortical excitability that may lead to
        seizure activity detected by surface EMG recording will be excluded from the study.
        Subjects who always reveal muscle activity during the motor imagery task will also be
        excluded from the study.
