      RATIONALE: Celecoxib may be effective in preventing colorectal cancer in patients who have a
      history of rectal polyps or colorectal neoplasia.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of celecoxib in preventing
      colorectal cancer in patients who have a history of rectal polyps or colorectal neoplasia.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the effects of celecoxib vs placebo on the number of rectal aberrant crypt foci
           in patients with premalignant rectal polyps or prior sporadic colorectal neoplasia.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the effects of these drugs on proliferation index, apoptotic index, and gene
           expression patterns in ascending and descending colon tissue from these patients before
           and after treatment.

        -  Assess gene expression patterns in normal mucosa from the ascending vs descending colon
           in patients referred for screening, surveillance, or diagnostic colonoscopy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, chemoprevention study.
      Patients are stratified according to age (18 to 49 vs 50 and over) and number of rectal
      aberrant crypt foci (5-9 vs 10 or more).

      All patients undergo a baseline biomarker assessment and full colonoscopy to resect all
      neoplasms, quantitate rectal aberrant crypt foci, and biopsy rectal mucosa.

      Depending on the results of the biomarker assessments, patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms. Patients with no adenomas of 5 mm or greater receive no further treatment.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. In both arms, treatment continues for
           6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      All patients undergo an endoscopic exam of the colorectum at completion of study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for the baseline biomarker
      assessment and a total of 40 patients (20 per arm) will be accrued for the chemoprevention
      study within 1 year.
