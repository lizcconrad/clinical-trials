      Title: Progesterone Treatment of Blunt Traumatic Brain Injury Principal Investigator(s):
      Arthur Kellermann, M.D., M.P.H. Institution: Emory University Biostatistician: Vicki
      Hertzberg, Ph.D. Institution: Emory University Project phase or primary methodology: Phase II
      pilot, double blind, 4:1 randomized controlled, clinical trial Target disease: Blunt
      traumatic brain injury Intervention: Intravenous progesterone infused over three days Number
      of patients to be enrolled: 100 Number of clinical centers: One (Grady Memorial Hospital)
      Primary Hypothesis: Dose: Intravenous infusion of progesterone at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/hr
      produces a steady state of 450 +/- 100 nmol/L in male and female subjects.

      Safety: Compared to study subjects who receive placebo, subjects who receive IV progesterone
      do not have an increased risk of mortality or an increased incidence of adverse effects.

      Efficacy: Administering IV progesterone shortly following TBI produces any or all of the
      following effects, including:

        -  Reduction of the intracranial pressure therapeutic intensity level (ICP-TIL).

        -  Decreased duration of coma.

        -  Decreased inpatient mortality.

        -  Improved neurological outcome one month post-injury.

      Secondary Hypotheses: Benefit: The benefits of IV progesterone for TBI are evident across a
      range of clinically relevant treatment subgroups, regardless of:

        -  Time from injury to drug administration: (i.e., &lt;2 hrs. vs. 2-4 hrs. vs. 4-6 hrs.).

        -  Victim gender.

        -  Presence or absence of severe extracranial trauma.

        -  Presence or absence of premorbid confounders of outcome (e.g., alcohol intoxication,
           alcoholism, stroke, etc.).

        -  Incidence or lack of confounding neurological insults (e.g., hypoxemia, hypotension).

        -  Severity of the traumatic brain injury - moderate (index GCS 9-12) versus severe (index
           GCS 4-8).

        -  Severity of non-brain injuries (AIS, ISS scores).

      Description of methodology and design: Double blind randomized controlled, clinical trial.
      Block randomization will be used to insure that moderate and severely injured patients of
      both genders and races (black and nonblack) have an equal chance of allocation to either
      treatment group.

      Patient selection criteria: Age &gt; 18; blunt traumatic brain injury; moderate to severe brain
      injury (iGCS 4-12); arrival &lt; 11 hours after Injury

      Description of pre-randomization procedures or process: Potential study subjects will be
      identified by Emergency Medical Service (EMS) personnel and Emergency Medicine attending
      physicians and residents in the ECC of GMH. EMS (ambulance) personnel will notify ECC
      personnel that they are bringing a blunt trauma patient with a Glasgow Coma Score (iGCS) of
      12 or less. On arrival, the attending emergency physician on duty will conduct a primary and
      secondary trauma survey and note the patient's post initial resuscitation or i GCS. If the
      patient has a iGCS of 4 - 12 and meets criteria for presumptive eligibility, the ECC
      attending will page the investigator on-call (IOC) and ask Hospital Social Services to
      initiate aggressive efforts to contact the patient's family. To insure prompt administration
      of progesterone/placebo, a &quot;door to needle time&quot; of â‰¤ 2 hours has been established as our
      performance goal. To meet this deadline, a member of the research team will immediately
      respond to the ECC and determine if the patient meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
      Time from injury will be established as clearly as possible from the EMS report, police
      report or witness interview. Block randomization will be used to insure that moderate and
      severely injured patients of both genders and races (black and nonblack) have an equal chance
      of allocation to either treatment group. To accomplish this goal, the GMH pharmacy will be
      given block sets of randomly ordered packets with sequential study numbers for subjects with
      moderate TBI (presenting GCS 9-12) and severe TBI (presenting GCS 4-8). Inside each packet
      will be instructions to prepare an infusion of progesterone or a comparable volume of
      placebo. When the pharmacist receives a copy of the randomization request, he/she will open
      the next packet in sequence based on the patient's severity of brain injury (moderate versus
      severe), gender, and race. Following treatment group assignment, the pharmacist will record
      the patient's name, medical record number, dose, and time the medication was prepared in a
      confidential log for use by the Safety Committee.

      Precise treatment dose description for protocol: Our goal is to initiate treatment within 2
      hours of injury as documented from an EMS report, police report or witness interview. We will
      accept patients up to 11 hours post-injury. We will attempt to achieve serum levels of
      progesterone in human subjects that are similar to those normally observed in the third
      trimester of pregnancy (i.e., 450 +/- 100 nmol/L).

      To determine the infusion rate needed to achieve a SSSPC of progesterone of 450 +/-
      100nmol/L, we will conduct a dose-escalation study. The first 12 subjects randomized to
      progesterone will receive a loading dose of 0.714 mg/kg over 60 minutes followed by a
      continuous infusion of 0.50 mg/kg/hr for three days. Because study personnel will be blinded
      to group assignment, an unblinded pharmacologist will analyze the SSSPC data from these 12
      patients. If the target concentration of 450 +/- 100nmol/L is not achieved in 90% of these
      subjects, the infusion rate will be modified and applied to the next ten subjects randomized
      to progesterone therapy. This will be performed a third time if necessary. If pharmacokinetic
      variability precludes the achievement of the target concentration in 90% of subjects using a
      fixed infusion, we will adopt an individualized dosing strategy based on real-time serum
      concentration data. If this is required, adjustments will be made to the placebo infusions as
      well to maintain blinding of the study investigators. The total dose given to any patient
      over the three day dosing period should not exceed 7.5 grams.

      Plan for Follow-up:

      The GOS, DRS, and GOAT will be assessed at one month post-injury. At the time of hospital
      discharge, each patient's disposition will be noted (morgue, nursing home, rehabilitation
      facility, another acute care hospital, patient's home, relative's home), so plans can be made
      for a follow-up exam one month post-injury. Subjects who are still hospitalized at GMH, an
      inpatient rehabilitation facility, a skilled nursing home, or an acute care hospital other
      than GMH one month post-injury will be tested on site. We will visit patients who are
      homebound at the time of follow-up. All other subjects will be asked to come to a study
      clinic at GMH for testing. Patients who are too severely impaired to test at one month
      post-injury will be classified as &quot;not testable&quot;. This category will be considered a
      surrogate marker for a poor outcome. We will utilize reliability codes to record all possible
      reasons for the non-administration of a particular measure, such as physical impairment
      (e.g., hemiparesis) cognitive impairment (e.g., did not understand instructions), or
      intoxication.

      During the follow-up visit, the study subject (or a proxy respondent) will be asked questions
      about their physical and mental health, any medical complications (e.g., seizure disorder,
      and headaches), their functional status, their occupational status, their level of sexual
      function, and their current living situation. Information on other variables that influence
      outcome, such as access to rehabilitation services, will be collected as well. To encourage
      participation, subjects will be reimbursed $25 for the follow-up visit, plus additional money
      for travel-related expenses.

      Extent and type of blinding/masking: Hospital pharmacy personnel will know each patient's
      group assignment, but this information will be withheld from the patient, the study team, and
      the clinical team responsible for the patient's care. Both study drug and placebo will be
      suspended in a lipid base, and will be indistinguishable by color or injection
      characteristics.

      Endpoints and outcomes: Four measures will be used to monitor each patient's clinical
      response to treatment. The first three will be tracked daily by our study nurses. The fourth
      will be assessed one month post-injury. These four measures are:

        1. Reduction in ICP, reflected by a decline in the patient's therapeutic intensity level
           (ICP-TIL) a measure of the intensity of treatment needed to reduce increased
           intracranial pressure;

        2. Duration of coma (i.e., total hours from injury to awakening);

        3. Death prior to hospital discharge;

        4. Neurological outcome at one month post -injury, as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale
           (GOS), the Disability Rating Scale (DRS), and the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test
           (GOAT).

      Statistical design and sample size calculations: Our data analysis strategy is designed to
      accomplish our three primary and one secondary goals: 1) achieve and maintain a predetermined
      steady state concentration of progesterone in 90% of our study patients, 2) confirm the
      safety of the study drug, 3) test the hypothesis that administration of progesterone within 6
      hours of TBI improves clinical and neurological outcomes, and the secondary; determine if the
      benefit of IV progesterone is equally evident across a range of clinically relevant treatment
      subgroups. In the process of achieving these goals, we will quantify our ability to identify
      and enroll TBI patients, administer the study drug within strict time restraints, and adhere
      to the study protocol.

      To assess the efficacy of progesterone for treatment of TBI, we will employ a systematic
      statistical analysis strategy. Our first analytic step will be to compile descriptive
      statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, range, proportion) of patient
      demographics. This activity, while not directly addressing any of the study hypotheses, will
      serve to describe the central tendencies and variability of the outcome variables and
      covariables.

      The second step will be to compare treatment groups with respect to suspected important
      covariates, specifically patient age, gender, cause and type of brain injury, presence or
      absence of intracranial mass lesions, presence/absence of extracranial trauma,
      presence/absence of premorbid confounders (e.g., alcohol intoxication, alcoholism, stroke,
      etc.), presence/absence of confounding neurological insults (e.g., hypoxemia, hypotension),
      severity of TBI, and time to initial drug administration. This will assess the balance
      achieved through randomization. The third step will be to analyze the data according to our
      specific aims.

      To estimate the sample size needed to establish efficacy, we needed to specify the effect
      size to be detected by our outcome measures. We do not have any human data to definitively
      establish the effect size expected as a result of treatment. Based on animal models, we
      conservatively posit that progesterone will improve neurological outcome (i.e., dichotimized
      GOS, DRS, GOAT at one month post-injury) by 25%. We expect to enroll 100 subjects at a 4:1
      randomization (80 treated and 20 controls) into our pilot study. With respect to duration of
      coma, the number of patients that would allow us to achieve 80% power to detect a difference
      of at least 0.6 standard deviation between treatment groups at the two-sided 0.05
      significance level was 50 treated and 50 controls. For this outcome, a difference of 0.6
      standard deviation units translates into a difference of + 1.1 days, or 29%, based on the
      findings of Stambrook, et al.6 However, since we have changed our protocol to a 4:1
      randomization, we no longer have the power to detect this difference. Similarly, in the
      subgroup of patients monitored for differences in the ICP-TIL, in the original 1:1
      randomization scheme we would have been able to achieve 80% power to detect a difference of
      at least 1.0 standard deviation between treatment groups at the two-sided 0.05 significance
      level, but with the 4:1 scheme no longer have the power to detect a difference. With respect
      to mortality, our pilot will have insufficient power (&lt;50%) to definitively detect an effect
      size equal to 25% reduction in the rate of death. Similarly there is insufficient power to
      detect a &quot;good&quot; neurological outcome at hospital discharge or at one month post-injury using
      a dichotomized GOS (good or moderate recovery versus severe disability), with the expectation
      of 50% with good outcome in the placebo group, based on the findings of Levin, et al.
      However, this study should allow us to perceive trends in the data as well as determine the
      range and prevalence of outcomes that we might anticipate for a multi-center study of this
      therapy. This will allow us to refine our future power calculations appropriately.

      Initially, there will be a dose escalation component within the progesterone group, but the
      differences in the level of circulating progesterone between the subgroups will be minimal
      compared to the control group. Hence, all progesterone treated patients are assumed to
      respond similarly to the treatment. (2) At the completion of the pilot phase at least 100
      patients will be randomized into this study. GMH's trauma registry indicates that at least
      145 potentially eligible TBI patients (age â‰¥ 18, GCS 4-12, blunt mechanism, and &lt;11 hours
      from injury) will come to GMH during the study interval. Every effort will be made to obtain
      informed consent from a proxy in order to administer the study drug within the specified time
      limit (2 hours).

      Proposed safety and efficacy monitoring boundaries:

      Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB): In accordance with standard procedures for NIH
      sponsored clinical trials, the DSMB chair and members have been selected by the NIH-NINDS.
      This committee will be informed of each subject's group assignment (A versus B), but will be
      blinded with respect to which group received the study drug.

      This committee will have three responsibilities: 1) monitor identification, enrollment, and
      randomization procedures to detect any evidence of bias; 2) monitor adverse events to
      determine if they occur disproportionately in one group, and 3) monitor key clinical outcomes
      to determine if one group does significantly better than the other. To assist the DSMB in its
      work, our statistician, Vicki Hertzberg, will monitor the progress of the study on a monthly
      basis. The DSMB will have no role in the day-to-day conduct of the trial. The study
      statistician will report to the DSMB at quarterly meetings.

      Safety Monitoring: A study nurse and/or the research program coordinator will round on
      subjects daily to track their clinical progress and the occurrence of any serious adverse
      events (SAE) or adverse events (AE). All SAEs will be reported to the IRB, DSMB, and FDA
      within 24 hours. All other adverse events will be reported to the PI, IRB, and FDA on a
      weekly basis. Specific events potentially related to the study drug, based on prior knowledge
      of the pharmacology of progesterone, combination agents that include progesterone, and the
      Intralipid carrier, will be closely monitored by the study team. These events include: a)
      phlebitis at the injection site; b) sedation unexplained by administration of other CNS
      medications; c) an increase in liver enzymes; d) unexplained hyperglycemia; e) hypotension or
      hypertension not known to be associated with increased intracranial pressure; f) unexplained
      fever; g) thromboembolic disease; and h) sepsis. Baseline metabolic parameters will be
      determined from the initial blood draw prior to study drug administration. Blood sampling
      will be performed at least once per day during drug administration for monitoring. In
      addition, hourly vital sign measurements and other parameters will be obtained from ICU
      charting forms. Patients will be examined daily by team members for any signs of adverse
      reactions. Team members will also review charting, laboratory reports and treating physician
      notes daily. In addition, all trauma deaths are reviewed by an interdisciplinary Trauma
      Outcome Review Committee (TORC) to determine if the death was non-preventable, potentially
      preventable, or preventable. A member of our study team will attend all of these meetings.
      If/when TORC reviews a death involving a participant in the study, their findings will be
      shared with the DSMB as well as the P.I. and co-P.I. The DSMB will closely monitor the
      incidence of death and other serious adverse events such as sepsis or thromboembolic disease.
      If they have concerns about the incidence of any of these events as linked to the study drug,
      they will immediately report these concerns to the National Institute for Neurological
      Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), as well as to the Emory IRB. Furthermore, all occurrences of
      death (regardless of cause) and unexpected serious adverse events will be reported to the
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

      Efficacy: To assess the efficacy of the drug on an interim basis, there will be a comparison
      of the study groups with respect to the endpoints (mortality, duration of coma, ICP-TIL, and
      neurological status indicators at one month) at the time when 12, 24, and 48 patients have
      been entered into the trial. Comparisons at these interim points which exceed a z-score of
      2.782 (associated p-value of 0.0054) will be considered significant, using the
      O'Brien-Fleming procedure.

      To determine if one treatment group does better than the other, the team's study nurses will
      obtain the following outcome measures: 1) ICP-TIL, 2) duration of coma, 3) in-hospital
      mortality, 4) Glasgow Outcome Score, 5) Disability Rating Scale, and 6) Galveston Orientation
      and Amnesia Test. The DSMB will monitor these outcomes by treatment group (A versus B) in
      order to promptly identify any between-group differences. If significant differences are
      noted, the code will be broken and our findings will be immediately reported to the Emory
      IRB, the FDA, the NINDS and DSMB.

      Patient accrual plan:

      We will enroll the first 100 eligible patients over a two year enrollment period.

      Ethical and consent considerations:

      Since our study involves treatment of patients with acute neurological impairment, they are
      not competent to give informed consent. We will therefore seek proxy consent from the
      patient's family or next-of-kin or legally authorized representative (LAR). If an LAR is
      subsequently located that objects to the study, the process will be halted and the patient's
      participation will be terminated. Only the IOCs, or the study coordinator, will be permitted
      to approach family members to request consent.

      A written form that complies with the polices and procedures of Emory University's IRB has
      been developed and approved. This form includes the following elements: title of the
      protocol, the name of the PI, study objectives and purpose, a detailed description of the
      procedure and interventions, explanation of the responsibilities of the subject and of the
      family member(s) who act as proxy respondents during follow-up interviews, any and all
      foreseeable risks, anticipated benefits, available alternatives, an explicit statement of
      confidentiality, non-compensation for participation, the right to withdraw at any time, a
      signature section, and a number to contact the PI or a member of the study team with any
      questions.

      Given the sudden, unanticipated nature of traumatic brain injury, and the potential time
      delays involved in getting a family member to the hospital, we have been authorized by the
      IRB to obtain proxy consent for participation over the telephone. When this is necessary, the
      on-call investigator will contact the family member, provide a brief explanation of the
      situation, read the consent form verbatim, and request verbal consent over the telephone. A
      third party will listen in to confirm that the family member understands and has provided
      proxy consent. On the signature line of the form, the witness will print the name of the
      consenting proxy, write their own name immediately below this name, note the time and date of
      the telephone call, and check a box labeled &quot;telephone consent&quot;.

      Before recruiting the first patient in this study, we will undertake a comprehensive process
      to notify and consult the target communities that use GMH as their trauma center. The Emory
      University News and Information office has pledged its support. On the advice of Emory
      Healthcare marketing, we have allocated $40,000 to support marketing and community outreach
      activity during the first 6 months of the study. Lesser amounts have been allocated to keep
      the community informed in years 2 and 3. An independent interdisciplinary Safety Committee
      has been created to provide additional monitoring for study safety.

      In addition to designating a Safety Committee, we will convene an independent citizen
      advisory committee. Two influential Atlantans have agreed to co-chair this group. One is Rev.
      Gerald Durley, Pastor of Providence Missionary Baptist Church, one of Atlanta's largest
      African-American congregations. Rev. Durley is also a key member of Concerned Black Clergy, a
      local activist group. The other co-chair is Sandy Teepen, a TBI survivor, safety advocate,
      and wife of a national newspaper columnist and former editorial page editor for the Atlanta
      Constitution, the largest circulation newspaper in the Southeastern United States.

      Progesterone has been used for many years to treat a variety of medical conditions. Side
      effects ascribed to its use alone are minimal. Minor adverse reactions include temperature
      elevations of 1 degree Fahrenheit, mood changes (depression following drug withdrawal),
      vaginal, cervical and uterine lining changes, irregular vaginal bleeding or amenorrhea,
      hyperventilation, mild fluid retention, a transient increase in low density lipoprotein
      (LDL), a transient decrease in high density lipoprotein (HDL), interference with lactation
      during breast feeding, nausea, abdominal cramping, dizziness, headaches, breast pain, and a
      delay in fertility. Most of these effects are associated with prolonged administration of
      progesterone (i.e., weeks to months). They are unlikely to be experienced during short-course
      administration (i.e., 3 days).

      Throughout the pilot trial, subjects will be monitored for potential side effects of drug
      therapy (i.e. hyperglycemia, hypertension unexplained by increases in ICP, unexplained fever,
      local phlebitis, thromboembolic disease, abnormal vaginal bleeding). The Safety Committee
      will meet quarterly to review group-specific clinical outcomes and side effects. If they are
      concerned that one group is doing significantly better (or worse) than the other, they have
      the authority to break the code and order premature termination of the trial.

      Significance of the Research and Impact on Medical Care: If the therapeutic benefits observed
      in animals are replicated in humans, administration of intravenous progesterone should
      produce several benefits, including: a) reduction of intracerebral pressure; b) decreased
      duration of coma; c) decreased mortality; and d) improved neurological function at one month
      post-injury. If these findings are verified, it will represent a major advance in the
      treatment of traumatic brain injury.
