      This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine against HIV and examine whether it
      induces an immune response to HIV. A vaccine is a substance given to try to create resistance
      or immunity to a disease or infection. The vaccine in this study is made from DNA (genetic
      material) of four HIV proteins called gag, pol, Nef, and Env. Injected into a human, the
      viral DNA instructs the body to make small amounts of some HIV proteins. This study will see
      if the body then creates an immune response to these proteins. Study participants cannot
      catch HIV or AIDS from the DNA vaccine or any proteins made from it.

      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age may be eligible for this study.
      Candidates will provide a medical history, including information on sexual behaviors and drug
      use. They will have a physical examination and blood and urine tests. Women will also have a
      pregnancy test. Women enrolled in the study must either be infertile (e.g., due to menopause
      or hysterectomy) or must agree either to abstain from heterosexual sex or to practice birth
      control for at least 21 days before beginning the study and throughout its duration.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the experimental vaccine or a
      placebo (a control substance made up of an inactive salt solution) and will be divided into
      three groups, based on their entry into the study. Of the first seven people enrolled (Group
      1), five will receive a 2-mg dose of vaccine and two will receive placebo. If the vaccine is
      safe at this dose, then in Group 2, five people will receive a 4-mg dose of vaccine and two
      will receive placebo. If this dose is safe, then in Group 3, thirty people will receive an
      8-mg dose of vaccine and six will receive placebo.

      All participants will receive three injections in an upper arm muscle-one injection a month
      for three months-with a needle-less device called a Biojector 2000Â® (Registered Trademark).
      At the time of each injection, participants will be observed for at least 1 hour after
      immunization. At home, they will record their temperature and any symptoms they may
      experience, including any effects at the injection site, for at least 2 days, or as long as
      the symptoms remain. If symptoms occur, participants will report them immediately to the
      clinic staff and, if necessary, come to the clinic for an examination.

      Participants will have about 10 clinic visits during the study. Most visits will last about 2
      hours; those on vaccination days will last about 4 hours. At each visit, participants will be
      checked for health changes or problems and will be asked about medications they are taking.
      Blood will be drawn for immune system testing. Additional laboratory tests may be requested
      between visits. Participants will be tested several times for HIV, will be questioned about
      their sexual behavior and drug use, and about social effects they may have experienced from
      their participation in the study.

      Some of the blood drawn for this study will be used to test for HLA type-a genetic test of
      immune system markers. For research, HLA testing is sometimes used to try to identify factors
      associated with the progression of HIV disease or related conditions.

      This is a Phase I, randomized, controlled, double-blinded, dose-escalation study to examine
      tolerability, dose, and immune response of an HIV DNA plasmid vaccine. The hypothesis is that
      this vaccine will be safe for human administration and elicit immune responses to HIV. The
      primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability in humans of VCR-HIVDNA006-00-VP
      and secondary objectives are to evaluate the immuogenicity of the vaccine and social impact
      of participating in an HIV-1 vaccine trial. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will
      review protocol results twice prior to dose escalation to the 8 mg dose level.
