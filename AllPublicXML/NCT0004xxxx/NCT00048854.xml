      This study will determine whether characteristics of women with Premenstrual Syndrome
      influence response to treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors and whether SRIs can
      alleviate premenstrual symptoms.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Moderate to severe premenstrual disturbances afflict up to 20 percent of women. Studies have
      shown the use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) during the luteal phase of the
      menstrual cycle to be effective in improving symptoms in women with premenstrual dysphoric
      disorder (PMDD). Unfortunately, SRI treatment has only been evaluated in controlled clinical
      trials, and evidence suggests that patients in these clinical trials are not representative
      of women commonly seen in clinical practice. Thus, the real-world feasibility of intermittent
      dosing is questionable.

      Patients in this study receive sertraline (Zoloft) during the luteal phase of their menstrual
      cycle every month for 6 months. The dose may be modified based on structured interviews with
      the patients. Assessments include questionnaires and interviews which take place at study
      start, at midpoint, and at the end of the study.

    <description>At the TAU baseline visit, patients will be told of their diagnosis of PMS/PMDD. Those patients who decide to seek treatment outside of the study protocol or do not wish to seek treatment will be asked to participate in the TAU part of this protocol. Patients in TAU will be contacted monthly to obtain monthly information about how they have been feeling (blinded ratings) using the study measures.</description>

             (PMDD)

          -  For a diagnosis of PMS but not PMDD, patients must have 3 to 4 symptoms, complain of
             functional impairment as a result of their symptoms, and identify symptoms as
             problematic enough to warrant treatment

          -  Symptoms of PMS/PMDD in at least 9 of 12 menstrual cycles during the year prior to
             screening

          -  Symptom-free during the follicular phase and impairment during the luteal phase

          -  Regular menstrual cycles

          -  Adequate methods of birth control

        Exclusion Criteria:

             inhibitors must be prescribed

             disorder, or psychotic disorders

          -  Co-existing condition that renders the patient unsuitable for the study

          -  Risk of suicide

          -  Hypersensitivity or adverse reaction to sertraline

          -  Pregnancy, breast-feeding, or plans to become pregnant during the course of the study

          -  Depot hormonal preparation or any other medication that would lead to lack of menses
             or markedly irregular menses
