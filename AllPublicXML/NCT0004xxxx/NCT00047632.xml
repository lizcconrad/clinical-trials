  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to determine: 1) if treatment with interferon gamma-1b plus
      standard chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) can increase the overall survival of
      patients with advanced ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma compared with chemotherapy
      alone; 2) how effective interferon gamma-1b plus standard chemotherapy is in preventing the
      progression or return of cancer; 3) the effects on quality of life; and 4) the safety of
      interferon gamma-1b combined with standard chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone.

      Approximately 800 patients will receive either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus
      Interferon gamma-1b. Chemotherapy will be paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 over 3 hours) followed by
      carboplatin (AUC 6) every 3 weeks. Only those patients in the treatment arm will receive
      interferon doses. Interferon gamma-1b 100 mg will be administered subcutaneously 3 times per
      week (every other day; no more than 3 doses in a 7-day period) continuously while patients
      are treated with carboplatin / paclitaxel (including for the 3 weeks following the last dose
      of chemotherapy). A total of 6 cycles of chemotherapy will be given unless disease
      progression or liming toxicity occurs or patients refuse further treatment. Each patient will
      receive a total of 54 doses over a period of 18 weeks. Each patient's participation will be
      from 3-8 years in duration.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma, FIGO
             Stage III or IV disease. Patients with either optimal (&lt;= 1 cm residual disease) or
             suboptimal residual disease following initial surgery are eligible. Unstained slides
             of the primary tumor, a primary tumor block, or cytological preparation must be
             available for review.

          -  Patients with the following histologic epithelial cell types are eligible: serous
             adenocarcinoma, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated
             carcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, transitional cell
             carcinoma, malignant Brenner's Tumor, or adenocarcinoma N.O.S.

          -  &lt;= 12 weeks after initial surgery with adequate recovery from surgery.

          -  Candidate for first-line chemotherapy

          -  Adequate bone marrow function (ANC &gt;= 1,500/mL; platelets &gt;= 100,000/mL; hemoglobin &gt;=
             10 gm/dL)

          -  Adequate hepatic function (AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase &lt;= 2.5 x upper limit of
             normal; bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 x upper limit of normal).

          -  Adequate renal function (creatinine &lt;= 1.5 x upper limit of normal).

          -  Adequate neurologic function (sensory and motor neuropathy &lt;= NCI CTC Grade 1).

          -  Negative urine pregnancy test in women of child-bearing potential (within 14 days of
             the initiation of the first chemotherapy cycle).

          -  Zubrod / ECOG / GOG performance score 0-2.

          -  Able to give informed consent.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Epithelial ovarian tumors of low malignant potential (borderline carcinomas). If
             diagnosis is based on cytology alone [(e.g., fine needle aspiration (FNA)], slides
             must be available, and confounding carcinomas such as non-ovarian mucinous,
             colorectal, Fallopian tube, and other adenocarcinomas of non-ovarian origin must be
             ruled out.

          -  Prior therapy for ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma other than primary surgical
             debulking.

          -  Patients for whom therapy for ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma in addition to
             protocol therapy is planned.

          -  Prior biological response modifier (BRM) for any reason within the previous 5 years.

          -  Prior malignancy within the previous 5 years other than basal cell or squamous cell
             carcinomas or in situ carcinoma of the cervix. Patients who have had a malignancy &gt; 5
             years previously may be eligible for this trial if they have not received any
             anti-neoplastic treatment within the previous 5 years an dif they have been without
             any evidence of disease for the previous 5 years.

          -  Uncontrolled infection.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women are excluded. Women of child-bearing potential must agree to
             use a chemical or barrier contraceptive during the dosing portion of the study.

          -  Any illness or condition that in the opinion of the investigator may affect safety of
             treatment or evaluation of any of the study's endpoints.
