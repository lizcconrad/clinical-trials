      To better understand the determinants of nutrient intake in black and white adolescent girls
      and to examine the effects of nutrient intake and eating behaviors on obesity, a significant
      risk factor for CVD.

      BACKGROUND:

      Studies have documented the importance of eating behavior as a modifiable risk factor for the
      development of obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The burden of obesity and CVD is not
      equally distributed in the population; women from ethnic minority populations are
      particularly likely to be obese and to have higher rates of CVD and stroke than white women.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study determines the extent to which psychological and familial factors contribute to
      nutrient intake in black and white girls, beyond the well-established effects of ethnicity
      and socioeconomic factors. Specifically, the aims of the project are the following: 1) to
      provide a detailed developmental description of eating behaviors and nutrient intake in black
      and white girls and to examine the &quot;clustering&quot; of certain eating behaviors (e.g., skipping
      meals and snacking) into eating patterns; 2) to determine the clinical significance of eating
      behaviors and eating patterns by examining their contribution to nutrient intake and the
      development of obesity; 3) to examine the role of psychological and familial factors as
      determinants of eating behaviors, eating patterns, nutrient intake, and obesity in black and
      white girls. Capitalizing upon the availability of extensive data collected prospectively
      among an exceptionally well-maintained cohort of 2,379 black and white females over a 12-year
      period (from ages 9-10 to ages 21-23), the study applies innovative analytic procedures to
      further the scientific understanding of the determinants of nutrient intake and eating
      behaviors in adolescent girls. Participants were assessed annually for ten years as part of
      the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Growth and Health Study (NGHS) with measurements
      of anthropometry, food intake, eating and weight related attitudes and behaviors and family
      cohesion. Parents also provided information about weight, eating, and family environment at
      two assessments. In a subsequent study with the same sample, structured clinical interviews
      were conducted to determine history of psychiatric disorders and risk factors for eating
      disorders. Adult weight was also measured.
