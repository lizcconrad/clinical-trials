      RATIONALE: UCN-01 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for
      cancer cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining UCN-01 with prednisone may kill more cancer
      cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining UCN-01 with prednisone in
      treating patients who have refractory solid tumors or lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of UCN-01 in combination with prednisone in
           patients with refractory solid tumors or lymphomas.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess any tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of UCN-01.

      Patients receive oral prednisone daily on days 1-5 and UCN-01 IV over 36-72 hours on days
      3-5. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of UCN-01 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3
      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the
      recommended phase II dose.

      Patients are followed every 3-12 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
