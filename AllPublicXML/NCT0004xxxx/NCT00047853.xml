  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use brain imaging technology to investigate brain changes in
      people exposed to predictable versus unpredictable unpleasant stimuli. Unpleasant events that
      can be predicted evoke a response of fear, whereas unpredictable, unpleasant stimuli cause
      chronic anxiety not associated with a specific event. Information gained from this study may
      help in the development of more effective treatments for anxiety disorders.

      When confronted with fearful events, people eventually develop fear of specific cues that
      were associated with these events as well as to the environmental context in which the
      fearful event occurred. Evidence suggests that cued fear and contextual fear model different
      aspects of anxiety. However, studies that examine the way the brain affects expression of
      contextual fear have not been conducted. This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      or Magneto-encephalography (MEG) to compare the brain activity underlying fear brought on by
      predictable and unpredictable aversive stimuli.

      This protocol examines the neurobiology of fear and anxiety using various approaches. During
      fear conditioning in which a phasic explicit cue (e.g., a light) is repeatedly associated
      with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (e.g., a shock), the organism develops fear to the
      explicit cue as well as to the environmental context in which the experiment took place.
      Experimental evidence suggests that cued fear and contextual fear model different aspects of
      anxiety. Studies in patients indicated that contextual fear may model an aspect that is
      especially relevant to anxiety disorders. However, the neural basis for the expression of
      contextual fear has not previously been elucidated in human imaging studies.

      One important determinant of contextual fear is predictability: contextual fear increases
      when a threat (e.g., electric shock) is unpredictable, as opposed to when the threat is
      predictable. The aim of this study is to compare the neural substrates underlying fear evoked
      by predictable versus unpredictable shocks. Animal studies have indicated that conditioned
      responses to predictably cued threat and to less explicit threat are separate processes
      mediated by distinct brain structures. Psychophysiological data suggest that the proposed
      procedure can differentiate between these two responses. Hence, we anticipate that this
      procedure will allow us to compare brain correlates of these responses in humans.

      Another objective is to study effects of threat of shock on processing and learning of threat
      cues in the amygdala, the visual and auditory systems, and motivation/reward systems. This
      will be investigated by means of event-related magneto-encephalography (MEG) and fMRI
      measurements using various paradigms.

      Finally, a last project will examine how pharmacologic manipulation of gamma-aminobutyric
      acid (GABA) levels with the benzodiazepine alprazolam affects the relationship between GABA
      concentration (quantified with magnetic resonance spectroscopy, MRS), visual-and
      auditory-induced gamma oscillations (measured with MEG), and fMRI BOLD response.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All screening procedures described in this section are conducted under screening protocol
        01-M-0254. Subjects must meet the following inclusion criteria in order to participate in
        the study:

          1. Male or female volunteers ages 18-50 years old.

          2. Judged to be in good physical health on the basis of medical history, a clinical MRI
             scan, and physical examination. Physical exams will be conducted by a NIMH
             credentialed physician or nurse. Clinical laboratory tests will be ordered based on
             his/her discretion.

          3. Healthy subjects judged to be in good psychiatric health on the basis of the
             Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR. The SCID will be administered by a
             credentialed NIMH clinician.

          4. Able to understand procedures and agree to participate in the study by giving written
             informed consent.

          5. This protocol (02-M-0321) will include patients with a primary diagnosis (under the
             clinical responsibility of Dr. Daniel Pine) of generalized anxiety disorder, panic
             disorder, SAD, PTSD, specific phobia, and major depression according to DSM-IV.

          6. Subjects will not be asked to completely stop smoking or drinking coffee during this
             study because they may experience withdrawal symptoms, which could affect our study
             results. However, they will be asked to abstain from drinking caffeinated beverage
             including coffee, tea and caffeinated soft drinks and from smoking for at least 1 hour
             prior to testing. They will also be instructed not to drink alcohol on the night prior
             to testing and on the day of testing.

          7. Speaks English or Spanish fluently (subjects with Major Depressive Disorder, healthy
             volunteers)

          8. Speaks English fluently (subjects with Anxiety Disorder)

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects will be excluded from the study if they meet the following exclusion criteria:

          1. Clinically significant organic disease, e.g., cardiovascular disease.

          2. Clinically significant abnormalities in physical examination.

          3. Any medical condition that increases risk for fMRI (e.g. pacemaker, metallic foreign
             body in eye).

          4. History of any disease, which in the investigators opinion may confound the results of
             the study, including, but not limited to, history of organic mental disorders,
             seizure, or mental retardation.

          5. Have a current diagnosis of alcohol or substance abuse ACCORDING TO DSM IV CRITERIA

          6. Have a lifetime diagnosis of alcohol or substance dependence ACCORDING TO DSM IV
             CRITERIA.

          7. Unless subject is enrolled as a patient, subjects should not have current Axis I
             psychiatric disorders as identified with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV,
             non-patient edition (SCID/NP).

          8. If a healthy volunteer, past bipolar depression and any history of psychosis or
             delusional disorders.

          9. If a healthy volunteer, first degree relative with history of psychotic disorder such
             as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder

         10. If a healthy volunteer, psychotropic medication within 4 weeks of scanning

         11. Medications that act on the central nervous system (e.g., Lorazepam, Codeine) and thus
             may interfere with the interpretation of study results. Specific exclusionary drug
             classes include but are not limited to: (opioid analgesics, DA receptor agonists,
             anticholinergics, MAO inhibitors, COMT inhibitors, as well as any illicit substances).

             session.

         13. Current or past history of cubital tunnel syndrome or carpal tunnel syndrome for shock
             studies that use the wrist for placement of electrodes. Cubital tunnel and carpal
             tunnel syndrome are exclusionary only for diagnosis on same arm as electrodes and are
             not exclusionary for studies that place shocks on ankles or feet.
