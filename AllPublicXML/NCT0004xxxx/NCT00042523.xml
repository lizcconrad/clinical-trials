      This study will examine the possible relationship between certain antibodies found in
      patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cognitive (thought processing)
      impairment in these patients. Antibodies are proteins produced by cells of the immune system
      to fight foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. In autoimmune diseases like SLE,
      however, the immune system produces antibodies against the body's own healthy tissues.
      Antibodies targeting the brain may cause cognitive dysfunction. Many patients with SLE have
      mild to severe cognitive impairment involving, for example, short- or long-term memory,
      thought processing and relating objects in time and space.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with SLE may be eligible for this study. Participants will
      undergo the following tests and procedures:

        -  Medical history and physical examination, including blood and urine tests

        -  Psychiatric interview and questionnaire to assess depression

        -  Neuropsychological tests - answering questions given by an examiner or filling out a
           test form or questionnaire

        -  Tests of cognitive function - answering questions given by an automated computer program
           or performing tasks using a computer mouse

        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain - a test that uses strong magnetic fields
           and radio waves to generate images of the brain. The patient lies still on a stretcher
           inside a cylinder containing a magnetic field. The patient's head is stabilized with a
           plastic strap and foam pads. During the imaging, a substance called gadolinium-DTPA is
           injected into an arm vein through a catheter (thin plastic tube). This substance is used
           to enhance the images.

      Patients may also be asked to undergo an optional procedure called a lumbar puncture (spinal
      tap) to examine the relationship between cognitive impairment and the amount of antibodies in
      the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)- fluid that circulates around the brain and spinal cord. For
      this procedure a small area of skin on the lower back is numbed with a local anesthetic. A
      needle is then inserted in the space between the bones in the lower back, and about 2
      tablespoons of CSF is withdrawn through the needle.

    <textblock>
      Cognitive dysfunction is common in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), observed
      in as many as two-thirds of patients. Cognitive dysfunction of long duration or with
      deterioration can have a significant impact on occupational functioning of SLE patients and
      also compromise compliance to treatment.

      The pathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction in SLE patients is likely multifactorial, including
      vascular origin, direct neuronal damage due to autoantibodies or cytokines, metabolic
      effects, or effects of certain medications. More than one half of SLE patients have anti-DNA
      antibodies, and it was recently demonstrated that a subset of anti-DNA antibodies
      cross-reacts with a pentapeptide consensus sequence (residues 283-287) of the human
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor NR2a and NR2b subunits and can cause excitotoxic death
      of neurons. NMDA receptors are important in memory function and learning, and thus such
      antibodies may mediate cognitive dysfunction in SLE.

      In this cross-sectional study, up to 60 patients with SLE may be enrolled. Participants will
      undergo neuropsychological testing, neuroimaging studies, and blood tests for antibody with
      the reactivity to the pentapeptide consensus sequence of the human NMDA receptor NR2a and
      NR2b subunits (anti-pentapeptide Ab).

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the association between cognitive
      dysfunction and serum anti-pentapeptide Ab. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be
      performed for evaluation of potentially confounding central nervous system (CNS) disease such
      as cerebral infarction, and of blood brain barrier breakdown by employing gadolinium
      enhancement. Furthermore, in participants who agree, a lumbar puncture will be performed and
      cerebrospinal fluid will be obtained for preliminary evaluation of the intrathecal levels of
      the anti-pentapeptide Ab associated with cognitive dysfunction.

      If the anti-pentapeptide Ab is associated with cognitive dysfunction, therapeutic
      interventions via NR2 receptor blockade or the blockade of the anti-pentapeptide Ab may be
      considered in a future study.
