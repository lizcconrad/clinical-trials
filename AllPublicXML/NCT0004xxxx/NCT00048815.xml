    <textblock>
      This 6-month study will compare the effectiveness of citalopram (Celexa®), hypericum (St.
      John's Wort), and placebo for the treatment of minor depression.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Minor depression is highly prevalent, causes substantial morbidity and disability, presents a
      serious risk factor for the development of major depressive disorder, yet is under recognized
      and under treated. Researchers have determined that patients with minor depression frequently
      seek treatment from general practitioners and are often treated with prescription
      antidepressants. There is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of St. John's Wort in the
      management of minor depression. If the proposed study demonstrates the efficacy of St. John's
      Wort and/or citalopram, it will suggest treatment paradigms that can be tested and applied in
      primary care settings.

      Subjects participated in a 12-week double-blind randomized study comparing St. John's Wort,
      citalopram, and placebo. Subjects were recruited through clinical referrals and community
      advertising. Data were obtained at the baseline visit (just prior to randomization) and at
      postrandomization visits conducted at 2-week intervals for the next 12 weeks, for a modified
      intent-to-treat sample consisting of all 73 subjects with at least 1 post-randomization visit
      (evaluable sample).

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>We expect that subjects with minor depression treated for 12 weeks with St. John's Wort or citalopram will have significantly greater reduction in depressive symptom severity than those treated with placebo. This will be measured by blind ratings on the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Clinician Rated (IDS-C) which has a total score range from 0 to 84 with 0 being not depressed at all and 84 being the most depressed. The change will be calculated by subtracting the Week 12 score from the Baseline score.</description>

    <measure>Number of Adverse Events (Physical Symptoms) Emerging or Worsening During 12 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>We expect that subjects treated for Minor Depression for 12 weeks with either St. John's Wort or citalopram will have similar safety profiles to subjects treated with placebo, and will not differ by more than 20% in rates of adverse side effects (e.g., nausea, headache, insomnia, hypersomnia, diarrhea) from subjects treated with placebo. This was measured by the number of adverse events (physical symptoms) emerging or worsening during 12 weeks of treatment.</description>

        <title>Efficacy Assessed Using the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Clinician Rated (IDS-C)</title>
        <description>We expect that subjects with minor depression treated for 12 weeks with St. John's Wort or citalopram will have significantly greater reduction in depressive symptom severity than those treated with placebo. This will be measured by blind ratings on the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology – Clinician Rated (IDS-C) which has a total score range from 0 to 84 with 0 being not depressed at all and 84 being the most depressed. The change will be calculated by subtracting the Week 12 score from the Baseline score.</description>

      <desc>The Patient-Rated Inventory of Side Effects (PRISE; Rush et al., 2004) was administered at baseline and all subsequent visits. This obtained information not only about the presence or absence of 32 specific adverse events (and the opportunity to write in “others”), but whether those were present at a tolerable or distressing level or constituted a serious adverse event. Vital signs and medication compliance were also assessed at each visit during treatment.</desc>
