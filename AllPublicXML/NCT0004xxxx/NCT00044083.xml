  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether Tolcapone improves cognition in healthy volunteers as well
      as patients with schizophrenia. Talcapone is a drug that has been FDA approved for Attention
      Deficit Disorder and allegedly increase the amount of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the
      frontal cortex of the brain.

      Psychopharmacological modulation of the catecholaminergic system can enhance some aspects of
      cognitive function. For example, COMT inhibitors can slightly improve working
      memory/executive function. Differences in the response between individuals might be related
      to a number of factors, including variations in the genes. The recent finding that a
      polymorphism in the catechol-o-methyl-transferase (COMT) gene, which produces a 4 fold change
      in enzyme activity, accounts for 4 percent of the variance in performance of working memory
      tasks in humans suggest that COMT genotype may predict response to COMT inhibitors. In the
      present investigation our goal is to examine, in normal controls and patients with
      schizophrenia, the effect of a centrally acting (tolcapone) and of a peripherally acting
      (entacapone) COMT inhibitor on cognitive function. We predict that both normal controls and
      patients with schizophrenia with the val/val genotype will have a significant, though
      transient, improvement in working memory in subjects treated with tolcapone but not in those
      treated with entacapone. Furthermore, in conjunction with other NIMH imaging protocols, we
      would like to examine the neurophysiological correlates related to working memory. We
      predict, in tolcapone treated subjects, improved measures in prefrontal 'efficiency' in
      subjects and patients specifically with the val/val genotype. The present protocol will
      provide new insights on the importance of this genetic polymorphism in the regulation of
      aminergic-controlled cognitive function in normal individuals. Furthermore, this protocol
      will test whether COMT inhibitors offer a new treatment-based on genotype - for cognitive
      impairment in schizophrenia. No IND is required for the present study.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Prior participation under NIH protocol number 95-M-0150, or new normal volunteers
                  or schizophrenic patients that meet criteria for NIH protocol number 95-M-0150.

               2. No Axis I or Axis II diagnosis in normal volunteers.

               3. Age range: 18-50 years.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Normal volunteers with an Axis I or Axis II disorder obtained either from prior SCID
             interview in Protocol 95-M-0150 or through a screening interview will be excluded.

          2. Subjects with a history of cardiovascular disease, liver disease and other medical
             illnesses, and untreated or uncontrolled hypertension will be excluded. An
             electrocardiogram, blood pressure, pulse rate and metabolic panel including LFTs will
             be checked on all subjects prior to participation in the study. Individuals with
             persistent tardive dyskinesia or abnormal LFTs, or individuals with significant
             history of alcoholism or liver enzyme elevation will be excluded from the study.

          3. Schizophrenic patients taking clozapine, a COMT inhibitor, any illicit drugs of abuse,
             or MAO inhibitors will be excluded.

          4. Normal control subjects taking any medications other than occasional NSAI will be
             excluded.

          5. Pregnant women. Women of childbearing potential will undergo a urine pregnancy test
             the day the study initiates and screened by history for the possibility of pregnancy.
