  <brief_title>Erlotinib and Radiation Therapy With or Without Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Mouth or Throat Cancer</brief_title>

    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining erlotinib with radiation therapy with
      or without cisplatin in treating patients who have advanced mouth or throat cancer. Erlotinib
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth.
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy
      use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining
      erlotinib with radiation therapy with or without cisplatin may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determination of the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of daily oral
      OSI-774 and standard fractionation external beam radiation therapy in patients with oral
      cavity (OC) or oropharyngeal (OP) squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), stage II and III.

      II. Determination of the MTD of daily oral OSI-774, low dose daily cisplatin at 6 mg/m^2/day
      and standard fractionation external beam radiation therapy in patients with oral cavity or
      oropharyngeal SCC stage III and IV.

      III. Determination of the safety of chronic oral dosing of OSI-774 after radiation therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determination of biological markers of activity of OSI-774 in tumor biopsy specimens from
      patients with SCC of OC and OP pre and post therapy.

      II. Determination of the ability of (18F)-FDG-PET scan to demonstrate biological activity of
      OSI-774 in previously untreated patients with SCC of the OC and OP and to predict for
      clinical response.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of erlotinib. Patients are assigned to
      1 of 2 regimens according to disease stage.

      Regimen A (patients with stage II [T2, N0] or III [T1-2, N1] disease): Patients receive oral
      erlotinib once daily. Beginning on day 15, patients also undergo intensity-modulated
      radiotherapy (IMRT) once daily 5 days a week for 7 weeks.

      Regimen B (patients with stage III [T3, N0-1] or IV [T1-4, N2-3, M0 or T4, N0-1, M0]
      disease): Patients receive oral erlotinib and undergo IMRT as in regimen A. Patients also
      receive cisplatin IV over 20 minutes on each day of radiotherapy.

      Patients in both regimens continue to receive erlotinib until the last day of IMRT (patients
      already in the maintenance phase of this study as of 5/11/04 continue to receive erlotinib
      once daily for up to 2 years) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      In both regimens, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 30 days and then every 3 months for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-48 patients (12-24 per regimen) will be accrued for this
      study within 6-24 months.

          -  No known malabsorption syndrome

          -  G-tube dependent patients are eligible

          -  The effects of OSI-774 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic
             dose are unknown; for this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) for the
             duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known brain involvement should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to OSI-774 or other agents used in study

          -  Major surgery or significant traumatic injury occurring within 28 days prior to
             treatment

          -  Abnormalities of the cornea based on history (e.g., dry eye syndrome, Sjögren's
             syndrome), congenital abnormality (e.g., Fuch's dystrophy), abnormal slit-lamp
             examination using a vital dye (e.g., fluorescein, Bengal Rose), and/or an abnormal
             corneal sensitivity test (Schirmer test or similar tear production test)

          -  Gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral or enteral
             medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting
             absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, untreated
             or new cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because OSI-774 is an epidermal growth
             factor inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects based on
             the data suggesting that EGFR expression is important for normal organ development;
             because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with OSI-774, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with OSI-774

          -  Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible
             pharmacokinetic interactions with OSI-774; appropriate studies will be undertaken in
             patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated

          -  Patients on Coumadin are excluded from the study because of reports of interactions
             between the study drug and Coumadin
