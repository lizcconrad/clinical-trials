      This phase I study will evaluate the experimental drug Romidepsinin patients with advanced
      cancer. The study will: 1) determine how well patients tolerate Romidepsin; 2) measure blood
      levels of Romidepsin during treatment; 3) analyze the cellular and molecular effects of the
      drug; and 4) determine if Romidepsin can shrink tumors. Romidepsin has been shown to kill
      cancer cells growing in the laboratory and to shrink tumors in animals with various tumor
      types. In preliminary studies, several patients with a type of lymphoma and one patient with
      kidney cancer responded to treatment.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with advanced cancer (excluding acute leukemia) may be
      eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical
      examination, x-rays and CT scans, and blood and urine tests. Patients with thyroid cancer may
      also have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test uses a magnetic field instead of x-rays
      to obtain images or body organs and tissues.

      Participants receive three infusions of Romidepsin administered through an intravenous line
      over 4 hours on days 1, 3 and 5 of a 21-day treatment cycle. The intravenous line is a
      catheter (plastic tube) placed in a vein and may be a peripheral line, inserted in a vein in
      the arm, or a central line, in which the tube is placed under the skin of the chest or neck
      into a major vein. Patients are hospitalized for the first 6 days of the first cycle to
      monitor heart rate. Those who tolerate the treatment well may continue as an outpatient.

      In addition to drug therapy, participants undergo the following procedures:

        -  Blood tests: Small amounts of blood are drawn frequently during the first five days of
           treatment to measure Romidepsin levels and to see how the body uses and excretes the
           drug. A heparin lock (an indwelling device to keep the vein open) may be put in the vein
           to prevent the need for repeated needle sticks.

        -  Biopsies (removal of a small sample of tumor tissue): Tumors that are accessible may be
           biopsied at the start of the study and at different times during treatment. Biopsies are
           done no more than three times per cycle, and no more than nine biopsies are done within
           a year. The samples are examined for the effects of Romidepsin on proteins that control
           the way cells divide and stay alive.

        -  Apheresis: This procedure is done to collect white blood cells and cancer cells for
           research. Blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and directed into a machine
           that separates it into its components by centrifugation (spinning). The white cells are
           removed and the red cells are returned to the patient through the same needle or through
           another needle in the other arm.

        -  Scans and x-rays: Imaging studies are usually done before starting treatment. Some of
           them are repeated at every 2 cycles (6 weeks), and some at the end of the patient's
           participation in the study. The tests may include chest x-rays, plain x-rays of affected
           bones, CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, bone scans, and a MUGA scan (special
           X-ray of the heart) or echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to test heart function
           before and during the study. MRI or positron emission tomography (PET) scans may also be
           done to detect tumors. PET scans use a small amount of a radioactive substance injected
           into a vein. The radioactivity is detected by a special camera during scanning to detect
           cancer cells.

        -  Other tests include an electrocardiogram (recording of the electrical activity of the
           heart) before and after each dose of depsipeptide. Eye exams are done if there are
           vision changes or if the doctor recommends an eye test.

      BACKGROUND:

      Romidepsin (NSC 630176, FR901228, FK228, formerly referred to as depsipeptide) is a histone
      deacetylase inhibitor with potent cytotoxic activity against human tumor cell lines and in
      vivo efficacy against both human tumor xenografts and murine tumors (1-3).

      Laboratory studies suggest that longer exposure to non-toxic doses of romidepsin can enhance
      its molecular effects to a greater degree than short toxic doses that rapidly cause cell
      death.

      NIS is responsible for enabling uptake of RAI in thyroid cancer, with decreased levels in
      tumors resistant or refractory to RAI therapy.

      Our group has demonstrated that NIS expression is upregulated by romidepsin, resulting in
      increased sensitivity to RAI.

      OBJECTIVES:

      To determine the MTD of romidepsin when administered on days 1, 3 and 5.

      To examine the effect of a multi-day regimen of romidepsin on surrogate markers and the
      expression of molecular targets.

      To determine whether thyroid cancers that do not have detectable uptake of RAI will have
      detectable uptake after treatment.

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Age 18 and over

        -  Evaluable disease

        -  Performance status ECOG 0-2

        -  Excluding patients that are pregnant, HIV positive, have CNS metastasis, or acute
           leukemia

        -  Left ventricular ejection fraction within normal limits. Additional cardiac criteria are
           noted in protocol

      DESIGN:

        -  Phase I

        -  Romidepsin administered as a 4-hour intravenous infusion on days 1, 3 and 5

        -  Dose escalation

                  beta blocker or calcium channel blocker. Patients in whom digitalis cannot be
                  discontinued are excluded from study.

               -  Patients with Mobitz II second degree heart block who do not have a pacemaker.
                  Patients with first degree or Mobitz I second degree heart block,
