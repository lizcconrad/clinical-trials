  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate whether administration of nitric oxide (NO)gas
      by oxygen hood at 20 ppm significantly increases PaO2, as compared to placebo gas (oxygen),
      within one hour of initiation and with no significant adverse effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is possible that administration of inhaled NO to neonates with abnormal gas exchange
      earlier, rather than later as a rescue therapy in a moribund state, might accelerate the
      transition of the circulation from the fetal to neonatal physiology and improve oxygenation.
      This may in turn decrease the need for mechanical ventilation, its associated morbidity and
      perhaps even ECMO.

      This study is designed as a pilot study to evaluate the physiologic efficacy (rather than
      effect on clinical outcomes) of NO administered by hood in improving oxygenation of neonates
      with elevated A-a DO2.
