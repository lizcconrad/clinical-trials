          -  Histologically documented, unresectable, inoperable, locally advanced, recurrent or
             metastatic Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)

          -  A cytologic diagnosis is acceptable (i.e., FNA or pleural fluid cytology)

          -  Measurable or non-measurable disease

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Life expectancy of &gt;=3 months

          -  &gt;= 3 weeks since any prior surgery or radiotherapy (&gt;=2 weeks for patients who receive
             &lt;=30 Gy of radiotherapy involving &lt;25% of the marrow reserve)

          -  Use of an effective means of contraception (women of childbearing potential)

          -  Able to comply with study and follow-up procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of small cell, carcinoid, or mixed small cell/non-small cell histology

          -  Malignancies within 3 years except for adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the
             cervix or basal or squamous cell skin cancer

          -  Symptomatic or untreated brain metastases

          -  Prior systemic chemotherapy for NSCLC

          -  Prior exposure to agents directed at the HER axis (e.g., ZD1839 [Iressa], C225
             [Cetuximab], Trastuzumab [Herceptin])

          -  Unstable systemic disease, including active infection, uncontrolled hypertension,
             unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within 6 months
             prior to Day 1, or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication (patients with
             chronic atrial arrhythmia, i.e., atrial fibrillation or paroxysmal supraventricular
             tachycardia, are eligible)

          -  History of other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that might affect the
             interpretation of the results of the study or render the patient at high risk from
             treatment complications

          -  Gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication or a
             requirement for intravenous (IV) alimentation, or prior surgical procedures affecting
             absorption

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

        Any of the following abnormal baseline hematologic values:

          -  Serum bilirubin &gt;1.5× upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Serum ALT and AST &gt;=2.5× ULN (&gt;5× ULN if due to liver metastases)

          -  Alkaline phosphatase &gt;=2.5× ULN

        Other baseline laboratory values:

          -  Serum creatinine &gt;1.5× ULN or creatinine clearance &lt;60 mL/min

          -  Uncontrolled hypercalcemia (&gt;11.5 mg/dL)
