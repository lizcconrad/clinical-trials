      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as epratuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill
      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of epratuzumab in treating
      patients who have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate of patients with diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
           treated with epratuzumab.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive low-dose epratuzumab IV over 1 hour once weekly for 4 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive low-dose epratuzumab IV over 1 hour once weekly for 8 weeks.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive high-dose epratuzumab IV over 1 hour once weekly for 4 weeks.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
