      RATIONALE: Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop
      tumor cells from growing. Treating a person's white blood cells in the laboratory and
      reinfusing them may cause a stronger immune response and kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of biological therapy in treating patients
      who have metastatic melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of autologous CD4+ antigen-specific T-cells for
           cellular adoptive immunotherapy in patients with metastatic melanoma.

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred CD4+
           antigen-specific T-cell clones in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the antitumor effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis to collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells. CD4+
      antigen-specific T-cell clones are generated over the next 2-3 months using immunogenic
      peptides MART1, tyrosinase, or gp100.

      Patients receive autologous CD4+ antigen-specific T-cells IV over 30 minutes.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of autologous CD4+ antigen-specific T-cells
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed on days 1 and 3 post T-cell infusion, and then once weekly for 12
      weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-18 patients will be accrued for this study.
