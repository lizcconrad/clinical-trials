      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of 4
      weeks therapy with FK788 in subjects with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Also, to
      assess the effect of FK788 on serum ALT concentration and hepatitis C viral level during
      therapy and for four weeks following therapy.
