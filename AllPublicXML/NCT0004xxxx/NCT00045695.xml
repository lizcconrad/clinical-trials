      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer by blocking the enzymes necessary for
      tumor cell growth.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bortezomib in treating patients who
      have untreated or relapsed Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of bortezomib, in terms of response rate, in patients with
           previously untreated or relapsed Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression, stable disease duration, and response duration in
           patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks. Patients with complete or partial response or stable
      disease are followed every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5-2
      years.
