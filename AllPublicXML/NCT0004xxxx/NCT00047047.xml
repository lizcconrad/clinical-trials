      This phase I trial studies the side effects, best way to give, and best doses of tanespimycin
      with or without gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin in treating patients with advanced
      solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as tanespimycin, gemcitabine hydrochloride,
      and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Using more than one drug (combination
      chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of 17-AAG (tanespimycin) when given on
      days 1 and 8 of every 3 weeks cycle in combination with Gemzar (gemcitabine hydrochloride)
      and CDDP (cisplatin) (cohorts A, B, and E).

      II. To determine the MTD of 17-AAG plus Gemzar when Gemzar is given on days 1 and 8 and
      17-AAG is given on days 2 and 9 every 3 weeks (cohort C).

      III. To determine the MTD of 17-AAG plus CDDP when given on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks
      (cohort D).

      IV. To define the dose-limiting toxicity of 17-AAG when used in combination with Gemzar and
      CDDP.

      V. To assess the effect of 17-AAG on surrogate markers when used in combination with Gemzar
      and CDDP.

      VI. To report any responses observed.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment cohorts.

      Cohort A (closed to accrual as of 3/2/04)*: Patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes, tanespimycin IV over 1 hour, and cisplatin
      IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 8. NOTE: *The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of this 3-drug
      combination has been determined as of 3/2/04.

      Cohort B (closed to accrual as of 3/2/05): Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride** IV
      over 30 minutes, tanespimycin IV over 1 hour, and cisplatin** IV over 2 hours on days 1 and
      8.

      Cohort C: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride** IV over 30 minutes and tanespimycin IV
      over 1-2 hours on days 2 and 9.

      Cohort D: Patients receive cisplatin** IV over 2 hours and tanespimycin IV over 1-2 hours on
      days 1 and 8.

      Cohort E: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride***, tanespimycin***, and cisplatin*** as
      in cohort B.

      In all cohorts, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.

      NOTE: **Gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin dosage is constant, while 17-AAG is escalated
      in cohorts B, C, and D.

      NOTE: ***Gemcitabine hydrochloride dosage is constant, 17-AAG is started at a higher dose
      level than all other cohorts, and cisplatin dosage is escalated in cohort E.

    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after completion of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The number and severity of all adverse events (overall, by dose-level, and by tumor group) will be tabulated and summarized within each cohort. The grade 3+ adverse events will also be described and summarized in a similar fashion. This will provide an indication of the level of tolerance for this treatment combination within each cohort. Overall toxicity incidence as well as toxicity profiles by dose level, patient and tumor site will be explored and summarized. Frequency distributions and other descriptive measures will form the basis of the analysis of these variables.</description>

    <description>Descriptive statistics and simple scatterplots will form the basis of presentation of these data. The expression levels of these proteins will be summarized at the different time points as well as percent change in their levels compared (overall and within each patient) between the different time points to assess potential drug interaction.
