      RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as beta alethine use different ways to stimulate the
      immune system and stop cancer cells from growing.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of beta alethine in treating patients
      who have Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the antitumor effects of low-dose beta alethine in patients with Waldenstrom's
           macroglobulinemia.

        -  Determine the effects of this drug on anemia, performance status, and disease symptoms
           in these patients.

        -  Determine the effects of this drug on the immune system of these patients.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive beta alethine subcutaneously on days 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, and 71. Courses
      repeat every 85 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-37 patients will be accrued for this study.
