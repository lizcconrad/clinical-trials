      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining flavopiridol with docetaxel in
      treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of flavopiridol when administered in combination
           with 2 different doses of docetaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the clinical pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the therapeutic activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of flavopiridol.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes followed at least 4 hours later by flavopiridol
      IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of flavopiridol until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Separate MTDs of flavopiridol are determined
      when flavopiridol is combined with 2 different doses of docetaxel. A total of 10 patients are
      treated at each flavopiridol MTD.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-56 patients will be accrued for this study.
