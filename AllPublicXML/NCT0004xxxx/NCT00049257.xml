      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining paclitaxel with carboplatin
      in treating patients who have metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone
      therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate and time to PSA progression
           in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer treated with paclitaxel
           and carboplatin.

        -  Determine the objective response rate, time to measurable or evaluable disease
           progression, and overall survival in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin IV on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 4 weeks for 12 weeks and then every 2 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 60 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>PSA response is defined as a decline from the baseline value of &gt;=50% confirmed by a second PSA value 4 or more weeks later.</description>

    <measure>Time to PSA Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluated every 28 days during Treatment Period</time_frame>
    <description>In patients whose PSA has not decreased, progressive disease is a 25% increase over the baseline value and an increase in the absolute value PSA level by &gt;=5ng/ml, confirmed by a second value at &gt;=4 week intervals. In patients whose PSA has decreased but has not reached response criteria, progressive disease is defined as an increase in PSA by 25% over the nadir, provided that the increase is &gt;=5ng/ml and is confirmed by a second value at &gt;=4 week intervals.</description>

    <description>Complete response:Complete disappearance of all clinically detectable malignant disease for at least 4 weeks.Partial Response:Definite improvement in evaluable disease estimated to be in excess of 50% and agreed upon by 2 investigators. Response must last for at least 4 weeks.Stable disease:No significant change in disease for at least 4 weeks. Includes an estimated decrease of &lt;50% and lesions with an estimated increase of &lt;25%.Progressive disease(PD):Definite increase in area of any malignant lesion estimated to be &gt;=25% or appearance of new lesions.
