  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if giving tipifarnib after standard treatment will
      prevent leukemia from coming back (relapsing). Tipifarnib belongs to a class of drugs called
      Farnesyl Transferase Inhibitors (FTI). It blocks proteins that make leukemia cells grow.

    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label evaluation of treatment with tipifarnib in approximately 127
      subjects, 60 years and older, with AML in complete remission (CR) after consolidation
      therapy. Prior to enrollment, patients will receive 1 or 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy.
      Patients who attain a CR will receive 1 or 2 cycles of consolidation chemotherapy. Patients
      in postconsolidation complete remission who meet the eligibility criteria are offered
      enrollment in the study. Subjects enrolled in the study are treated with tipifarnib A
      dose-modification scheme is followed to maintain adequate specified laboratory values and to
      minimize other adverse events. Postconsolidation treatment with tipifarnib continues until
      the time of relapse, death, completion of 24 cycles of treatment, or discontinuation as
      advised by study doctor.

      Tipifarnib, film coated, compressed tablets containing 100 mg active drug, will be
      administered orally at a dose of 300 mg (three 100 mg film coated tablets) taken twice a day
      for 21 consecutive days on a 28-day cycle schedule for up to 24 months.
