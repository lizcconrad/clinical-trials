      Primary Objective:

        -  To determine response rate (RR; complete and partial response[CR,PR] and duration after
           therapy with Aroplatin (Liposomal NDDP, L-NDDP) in subjects with locally recurrent,
           unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer refractory to 5-FU/leucovorin or
           capecitabine, and irinotecan.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To determine safety and tolerability of the Aroplatin therapy.

      This is a single-arm, open-label phase II study. Subjects refractory to 5-FU/leucovorin or
      capecitabine, and irinotecan therapies will be enrolled. Dosing will be every four weeks with
      individual dose escalations and adjustments for toxicity.
