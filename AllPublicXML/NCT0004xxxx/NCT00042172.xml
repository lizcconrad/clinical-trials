  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of donepezil (Aricept) for the
      treatment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in elderly adults. This study will also
      determine whether adding ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) enhances the effects of donepezil.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognition involves important thinking processes such as perception, learning, and reasoning.
      There are currently no definitive treatments for cognitive deterioration. This study focuses
      on elderly individuals with MCI because people at a pre-dementia stage may sustain the
      greatest and most lasting benefit from cognitive-enhancing agents.

      Patients receive either donepezil or placebo for the first 6 months of the study. In the
      second 6 months of the study, patients are randomized to receive either donepezil plus GBE or
      donepezil alone. Positron Emission Tomography (PET), which provides a color-coded image of
      the brain's blood flow in a particular area, is used to assess brain activity during memory
      tasks. A PET scan is performed at study entry, 6 months, and 1 year. A vasodilator (a drug
      that dilates the blood vessels) is administered during the PET imaging procedure to determine
      whether vascular disease affects memory function. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is
      also taken to view the brain.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Display impairment on at least 2 of 3 memory tests

          -  Meet the following criteria for mild cognitive impairment: subjective complaint of
             memory problems; no impairment in activities of daily living; general cognitive
             function in the normal age-adjusted range; abnormal memory function for age; and

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a history of major neurological, metabolic, psychiatric or cardiovascular disease

             insufficiency

          -  Are sensitive to carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, antibacterial sulfonamides, thiazide
             diuretics, or other sulfonamide-derivative diuretics

          -  Have taken donepezil or GBE products prior to enrollment

          -  Have taken medications, including herbal agents (exceptions will be made for routine

             therapy [not to exceed 200 percent RDA for any particular vitamin], thyroid
             replacement therapy, hormone replacement, and ophthalmic medications for glaucoma and
