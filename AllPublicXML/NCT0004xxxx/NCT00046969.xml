      RATIONALE: Epoetin beta may stimulate red blood cell production to prevent or control anemia
      in patients treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase IV trial to determine the effectiveness of epoetin beta in treating
      anemia in patients who are receiving cisplatin and radiation therapy for stage IIB, stage
      III, or stage IVA cervical cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the effectiveness of epoetin beta vs standard care for anemia management, in
           terms of increased hemoglobin levels and the correlation with reduced relapse/treatment
           failure rate, in patients with stage IIB, III, or IVA cervical cancer treated with
           cisplatin and radiotherapy.

        -  Compare the safety of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the relapse-free and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the frequency and localization of relapses and metastases in patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the type, frequency, and degree of adverse events in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the overall response rate in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter study. Patients are
      stratified according to country, disease stage, and brachytherapy technique. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Patients also undergo
           high-dose rate, low-dose rate, or boost brachytherapy. Patients receive cisplatin IV
           beginning on day 1 of radiotherapy and continuing weekly for 6 weeks. Patients also
           receive epoetin beta subcutaneously 3 times a week beginning 2 weeks before radiotherapy
           and continuing for 8 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy and brachytherapy and receive cisplatin as in arm
           I.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after the last treatment, and at 3 months.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80-450 patients will be accrued for this study within 4-22.5
      months.
