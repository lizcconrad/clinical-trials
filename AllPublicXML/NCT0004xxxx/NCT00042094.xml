  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of both Dryvax® and the new cell-cultured
      vaccine (CCSV) in a comparative fashion. Across 3 cohorts, 150 vaccinia-naive volunteers will
      be randomly assigned to receive either CCSV (100 volunteers) or Dryvax® (50 volunteers) in a
      blinded fashion. Subjects will be followed closely for up to 6 months and a subgroup of
      volunteers will be followed up to 3 years in order to evaluate the duration of immunity
      following vaccination. Another cohort will enroll 100 vaccinia-experienced volunteers and
      randomly assign them to receive either CCSV (50 volunteers) or Dryvax® (50 volunteers) and a
      sub group will be followed up to 3 years. A fifth cohort will enroll 100 vaccinia-naive
      volunteers and randomly assign them to receive different dilutions of CCSV (1:1, 1:5, 1:25,
      and 1:50).
