    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to work out design issues prior to conducting a definitive phase
      3 trial to determine whether treating sleep-related breathing disorders in people with
      epilepsy results in improvement in seizure control or an improvement in alertness during the
      day.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite appropriate treatment with medications, individuals with epilepsy often continue to
      have seizures, and many suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness and poor quality of life.
      Evidence from case studies suggests that treatment of coexisting obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA)-stoppage in breathing during sleep-can reduce the frequency of seizures in people with
      epilepsy that is resistant to antiepileptic medication.

      In this study, individuals with symptoms of OSA and 2 or more seizures a month who meet study
      criteria will undergo polysomnography, a test that continuously monitors normal and abnormal
      physiological activity during sleep. Those individuals who test positive for OSA will be
      randomized to either therapeutic or placebo continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)-a mask
      treatment for sleep apnea-for 10 weeks, during which time seizure frequency, daytime
      sleepiness, health-related quality of life, and CPAP compliance will be assessed.

    <measure>CPAP Adherence/Tolerance as Measured by Proportion of Nights Used</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This measure quantifies how well patients use their CPAP. The standard unit of measurement is proportion of nights that the CPAP is used by a participant (total nights used/total nights the device could have been used), averaged across all participants . Data were downloaded by a card placed in the CPAP machine reflecting use over the entire 10 weeks.</description>

             participation.

          -  Evidence of medical instability (e.g., congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias,

      <pre_assignment_details>Epilepsy clinic patients initially meeting trial eligibility on the basis of chart review completed a validated instrument that assesses the likelihood of having obstructive sleep apnea, and underwent a sleep and epilepsy evaluation by the site investigator. 68 patients consented, 33 not randomized due to not meeting criteria or declined.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>CPAP Adherence/Tolerance as Measured by Proportion of Nights Used</title>
        <description>This measure quantifies how well patients use their CPAP. The standard unit of measurement is proportion of nights that the CPAP is used by a participant (total nights used/total nights the device could have been used), averaged across all participants . Data were downloaded by a card placed in the CPAP machine reflecting use over the entire 10 weeks.</description>

However, there is a large leak that prevents the subject from receiving adequate pressurized air to keep the airway open.</description>
