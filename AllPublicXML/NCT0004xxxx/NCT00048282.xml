  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide researchers with information that will help them
      prepare for a future study to test the efficacy of two anti-HIV vaginal gels. This study will
      also estimate how likely people living in certain areas are to become infected with HIV and
      other infections passed during sex.

      This study is designed to prepare for the implementation of a second study, HPTN 035: A Phase
      II/III Safety and Effectiveness Study of the Vaginal Microbicides BufferGel and PRO 2000/5
      Gel (P) for the Prevention of HIV Infection in Women. HPTN 035 requires an average HIV
      seroincidence rate of 5-6 percent among enrolled participants. The primary objective of the
      present study is to estimate the rates of HIV seroincidence among women targeted for
      inclusion in HPTN 035.

      Women will be enrolled in this study for 6 to 12 months. Study visits will take place
      monthly. At each visit, participants will complete a medical/menstrual history and undergo
      pregnancy testing. Each quarter, participants will undergo a structured interview about
      sexual practices and will receive HIV and STD tests, education, and counseling. Participants
      will also undergo a pelvic exam with wet mount testing for bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis,
      and trichomoniasis. Colposcopic evaluations will be performed at selected sites. Pap smears
      will be performed at sites with the capacity and expertise to prepare and interpret the
      smears and provide appropriate follow-up care to participants with abnormal results.

          -  Non-therapeutic injection drug use in the 12 months prior to screening.

          -  Vaginal intercourse more than an average of 2 times per day in the 2 weeks prior to
             screening.

          -  Plans to travel away from the study site for more than 3 consecutive months in the
             next 12 months.

          -  Plans to relocate away from the study site in the next 12 months.

          -  Pregnancy or plans to become pregnant in the next 12 months.

          -  Pregnancy within 42 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Enrollment in any other study of a vaginally-applied product.

          -  Clinically apparent pelvic exam finding involving deep epithelial disruption.

          -  Diagnosis with a current STD and/or other reproductive tract infection requiring
             treatment.

          -  Conditions that would preclude provision of informed consent, make participation in
             the study unsafe, complicate interpretation of study outcome data, or otherwise
             interfere with achieving the study objectives.
