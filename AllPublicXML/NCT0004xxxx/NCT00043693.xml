      This study will evaluate a family intervention program for individuals with bipolar disorder,
      schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorder and co-occurring substance use disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Substance use disorder (SUD) in persons with severe mental illness may worsen the course of
      psychiatric illness. The loss of family support for individuals with mental illness is a
      major contributing factor to housing instability, homelessness, and other problems. Despite
      progress toward integrating mental health and substance abuse services, interventions that
      improve the course of mental illness while helping the families of the mentally ill are not
      currently available. Enhancing skills for coping with mental illness may be an effective
      strategy for treating SUD, decreasing caregiver burden, and improving the long-term outcomes
      for people with mental illness.

      Patients and their families are randomly assigned to either the Family Intervention for Dual
      Diagnosis (FIDD) program or family psychoeducation. The FIDD program lasts for up to 3 years
      and includes both single and multiple-family group formats. The family psychoeducation
      program consists of 6 weekly sessions. Routine assessments are conducted on all patients, and
      relatives are evaluated on a wide range of outcomes, including substance abuse,
      hospitalizations, psychiatric symptoms, legal problems, aggression, housing and homelessness,
      family burden, social support, and quality of life. To determine the effectiveness of the
      FIDD program, knowledge of mental illness and problem-solving skills are assessed in the
      families following treatment.
