  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This drug is being developed to treat a type of brain cancer, glioma. This study was designed
      to determine a safe and well tolerated dose. Patients must have had prior treatment for their
      glioma and be eligible for removal of their recurring tumor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label single-dose study to be conducted in 18 evaluable patients with
      recurrent high-grade glioma. Patient will undergone debulking surgery and ventricular access
      device placement into the tumor cavity for administration of 131I-TM-601. High-grade glioma
      includes glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligo-astrocytoma and
      gliosarcoma. The amount of 131I will remain constant. Three doses of TM-601 will be
      administered using a dose escalating scheme.
