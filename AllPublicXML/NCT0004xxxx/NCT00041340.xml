      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of imatinib mesylate in treating patients who have
      stage IV colorectal cancer. Imatinib mesylate may interfere with the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking certain enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine response to Gleevec (Imatinib Mesylate) in patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer and with c-Kit, Arg, Abl, or PDGF-R expression.

      II. To determine the side effects of Imatinib Mesylate in patients with colorectal cancer.

      III. To study the biologic effects of Imatinib Mesylate on the c-Kit and PDGF-R system and
      downstream signaling in metastatic colorectal cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily. Treatment continues for 8 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease or
      better continue therapy until disease progression or 1 year after complete response.
