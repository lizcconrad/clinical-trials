      BACKGROUND:

      Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heritable, genetically heterogeneous disorder causing
      congestive heart failure. Current medical therapy has minimal impact on prognosis and cardiac
      transplantation is the only definitive treatment for end-stage disease. The molecular and
      cellular mechanisms underlying DCM are poorly defined, but the importance of single gene
      defects in disease pathogenesis is becoming increasingly apparent.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The genetic epidemiology study will identify novel dilated cardiomyopathy genes using genetic
      linkage and mutational analyses. The first aim is to determine the chromosomal location of
      novel familial dilated cardiomyopathy genes. This will be accomplished by genome-wide
      genotyping and genetic linkage analyses in three large families with autosomal dominant
      dilated cardiomyopathy. Previously identified dilated cardiomyopathy genes have been excluded
      in these families. The second aim is to identify mutations in novel genes that cause familial
      dilated cardiomyopathy by linkage and sequence analyses of candidate genes mapping to dilated
      cardiomyopathy loci. Once novel genes for familial dilated cardiomyopathy are identified, the
      third aim will be to determine the role of these genes in a large cohort of unrelated
      patients with familial and sporadic dilated cardiomyopathy. High throughput DNA sequence
      analyses will be performed to identify additional inherited and de novo mutations.
