      The purpose of the study is to assess the rate of elimination of bacteria by levofloxacin in
      middle ear fluid of children with a rapid and severe onset of infection and inflammation of
      the middle ear who are at high risk for infections that are difficult to treat.

    <textblock>
      Rapid and severe onset of middle ear infection is a common bacterial infection in children.
      These infections, particularly when they occur early in life and are recurrent, are
      associated with considerable disease and can lead to increasingly serious infections. This is
      a multicenter study to determine the effectiveness of levofloxacin in eliminating bacteria in
      the middle ear fluid of children between 6 months and 5 years of age with a rapid and severe
      onset of infection and inflammation of the middle ear (who are at high risk for infections
      that are difficult to treat). The study consists of a 1-day screening period when patients
      will be tested for eligibility for the study; a 4 to 6-day treatment, blood collection,
      possible collection of fluid from the middle ear, and assessment period; and a post-treatment
      period to assess the status of the middle ear infection. All patients will receive
      levofloxacin 2 times daily (up to a maximum daily dose of 500 mg) mixed with liquid and taken
      by mouth for 10 days. Safety evaluations will include laboratory tests, physical
      examinations, vital sign measurements, and recording of adverse events, including any report
      of joint pain or signs and symptoms of joint disease. Effectiveness will be assessed by the
      rate of elimination of the bacteria identified at the start of the study and by signs and
      symptoms, as well as microscopic evidence that the patient is cured of the middle ear
      infection. The study hypothesis is that levofloxacin will be effective in eliminating
      bacteria in the middle ear fluid of children with a rapid and severe onset of infection and
      inflammation of the middle ear and who are at high risk for infections that are difficult to
      treat. Levofloxacin 10 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg) 2 times daily (up to a maximum daily dose
      of 500 mg) mixed with liquid and taken by mouth for 10 days

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with signs and symptoms of rapid onset of severe infection of the middle ear
             defined as: either fluid draining from the middle ear (with a minimum of 2 of the
             following: decreased or absent eardrum mobility seen on physical examination

          -  yellow or white discoloration of the eardrum

          -  opaque eardrum) and (a minimum of 1 of the following: ear pain within 24 hours of the
             start of the study including the child's unexpected tugging or rubbing of the ear

          -  marked redness of the eardrum

          -  distinct fullness or bulging of the eardrum) or rapid onset of severe drainage of pus
             from the external ear lasting less than 48 hours and not due to inflammation of the
             external ear

          -  At risk for difficult-to-treat middle ear infection defined as having a minimum of 1
             of the following: recurrent middle ear infection (defined as &gt;=3 episodes, including
             the current episode, of rapid onset of rapid onset of severe middle ear infection
             during the 6 months before the study or &gt;=4 episodes, including the current episode,
             of rapid onset of rapid onset of severe middle ear infection during the year before
             the study), persistent middle ear infection defined by signs and symptoms of rapid
             onset of severe middle ear infection on the third day after starting any antibiotic
             treatment (with the exception of amoxicillin/clavulanate that included &gt;=90
             milligrams/kilograms/day [mg/kg/day] of amoxicillin)

          -  Currently taking antibiotic medication to prevent middle ear infection (must be
             discontinued when beginning the study)

          -  Completed treatment with an antibiotic intended to treat middle ear infection within
             30 days before the start of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of a previous sensitivity or serious adverse reaction to the
             type of antibiotic used in this study

          -  Tubes in place in the affected ear to allow drainage of fluid from the middle ear

          -  Requirement of antibiotic therapy that affects the whole body, other than the study
             drug

          -  A serious bacterial infection in addition to middle ear infection that may interfere
             with assessment of the patient's response to study medication

          -  Diagnosis of bacterial meningitis

          -  Abnormal kidney function, as determined by blood test (serum creatinine)

          -  History or presence of joint disease or disease of the tissues surrounding joints, or
             any other signs or symptoms in muscles or bones that may make it difficult to evaluate
             any future complaints concerning muscles or bones

          -  Chronic use of corticosteroids
