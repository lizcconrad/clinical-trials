      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of arsenic trioxide and
      radiation therapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma. Drugs such as
      arsenic trioxide may stop the growth of malignant glioma by stopping blood flow to the tumor.
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining arsenic trioxide
      with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Arsenic Trioxide (ATO) when administered
      on a once a week schedule and a twice a week schedule in conjunction with radiation therapy
      to patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

      II. To determine the toxicity of ATO when it is administered on a once a week schedule and a
      twice a week schedule in conjunction with radiation therapy in patients with newly diagnosed
      glioblastoma multiforme.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the survival of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme
      receiving ATO when it is administered on a once a week schedule and a twice a week schedule
      in conjunction with radiation therapy.

      II. To evaluate the effect of ATO on tumor vasculature by using perfusion MRI. III. To
      describe the pharmacokinetics of ATO following weekly and twice weekly injection.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of arsenic
      trioxide. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      Group A: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 2 hours once weekly for 6 weeks.

      Group B: Patients receive arsenic trioxide at a lower dose IV over 2 hours twice weekly for 6
      weeks.

      Patients in both groups also undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 6 weeks.

      In both groups, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of arsenic trioxide until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which at least 2 of 3 or 3 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed weekly for 4 weeks and then every 2 months thereafter.
