      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of four oral antibiotic
      treatment regimens for bacterial infections in patients with chronic bronchitis. The study
      goals are to demonstrate that 1) levofloxacin 750 mg once daily for three days is no worse
      than azithromycin 250 mg twice a day for one day and then 250 mg once a day for four more
      days, and 2) levofloxacin 750 mg once daily for five days is no worse than amoxicillin/
      clavulanate (875/125 mg) twice daily for 10 days.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter treatment study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of high-dose, short-course oral levofloxacin treatment versus treatment with other
      oral antibiotics in acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (ABECB). This study
      evaluates the use of high-dose (750 milligrams) and short-course (3 or 5 days) levofloxacin
      compared with conventional doses and schedules of other effective antibiotics for controlling
      acute bacterial infections in patients with chronic bronchitis, The study will divide the 700
      patients into two groups--one group with less severe (uncomplicated) chronic bronchitis, and
      one with more severe (complicated) chronic bronchitis. Patients with uncomplicated disease
      will receive levofloxacin 750 mg once daily for 3 days or azithromycin 250 mg twice a day for
      1 day and then 250 mg once a day for 4 more days. Patients with complicated disease will
      receive levofloxacin 750 mg once daily for 5 days or amoxicillin/ clavulanate (875/125 mg)
      twice daily for 10 days. All patients will take study medication orally. Effectiveness will
      be measured by comparing the patient's signs and symptoms present at the Test-of-Cure Visits
      (study days 13 - 22) with those observed at the Study Entry Visit. Safety will be evaluated
      throughout the study on the basis of the occurrence and severity of unexpected and
      undesirable events as well as by laboratory tests and physical examinations. The hypothesis
      of the study is that a shorter course (3 days) of 750 mg levofloxacin will be at least as
      effective and well tolerated as azithromycin for 5 days for uncomplicated ABECB, and that 750
      mg of levofloxacin for 5 days will be at least as effective and well tolerated as
      amoxicillin/ clavulanate for 10 days for curing complicated ABECB cases.

      Uncomplicated ABECB: Oral doses of levofloxacin 750 mg once daily for 3 days, or azithromycin
      250 mg twice daily on day 1, then 250 mg once daily on days 2 - 5. Complicated ABECB: Oral
      doses of levofloxacin 750 mg once daily for 5 days, or amoxicillin/clavulante 875/125 mg once
      daily for 10 days.
