      BMS-275291 may stop the growth of prostate cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by
      blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. Randomized phase II trial to study the
      effectiveness of BMS-275291 in treating patients who have prostate cancer that has not
      responded to hormone therapy

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the time to disease progression in patients with hormone-refractory prostate
      cancer treated with two different doses of BMS-275291.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall survival of patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer treated
      with two different doses of BMS-275291.

      II. To assess the rate of response to BMS-275291, using both PSA and measurable disease.

      III. To evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this agent in this patient
      population.

      IV. To investigate the correlation of tumor response with changes in the levels of serum
      osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, procollagen I carboxy-terminal propeptide (PICP),
      procollagen I amino-terminal propeptide (PINP), and N-telopeptide; and the correlation of
      tumor response with changes in the levels of urine pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      Gleason score (2-4 vs 5-7 vs 8-10), PSA level (less than 10 ng/mL vs 10-50 ng/mL vs 51-100
      ng/mL vs more than 100 ng/mL), and concurrent bisphosphonate therapy (yes vs no). Patients
      are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oral BMS-275291 once daily on days 1-28.

      ARM II: Patients receive oral BMS-275291 twice daily on days 1-28.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 2 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR)
      receive 2 additional courses beyond CR.

      Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-68 patients (12-34 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 5-14 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have a histologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate stage
             D2 that is unresponsive or refractory to hormone therapy; patients must have
             metastatic prostate cancer deemed to be hormone refractory by one or more of the
             following (despite androgen deprivation and anti-androgen withdrawal when applicable):

               -  Progression or unidimensionally measurable disease assessed within 28 days prior
                  to initial administration of drug

               -  Progression of evaluable but not measurable disease assessed within 28 days prior
                  to initial administration of drug for PSA evaluation and within 42 days for
                  imaging studies (e.g. bone scans)

               -  Rising PSA, defined as at least two consecutive rises in PSA to be documented
                  over a reference value; the first rising PSA should be taken at least 7 days
                  after the reference value; a third confirmatory PSA measure should be greater
                  than the second measure, and it must be obtained at least 7 days after the 2nd
                  measure; if this is not the case, a fourth PSA is required to be taken and be
                  greater than the second measure

          -  All patients must have pre-study PSA within 28 days prior to initial administration of
             drug

          -  Patients who have measurable disease must have mad x-rays, scans or physical
             examinations used for tumor measurement completed within 28 days prior to initial
             administration of drug; patients must have non-measurable disease within 28 days (for
             PSA level) or 42 days (for imaging studies) prior to initial administration of drug;
             soft tissue disease that has been radiated within the two months prior to registration
             is not assessable as measurable disease; soft tissue disease that has been radiated
             two or more months prior to registration is assessable as measurable disease provided
             that the lesion has progressed following radiation; as the biology of previously
             irradiated tumor may be different from non-irradiated tumors, patients must have at
             least one measurable lesion outside the previously irradiated region in order to be
             considered to have measurable disease

          -  Patients must have bone metastases as documented by x-ray, bone scan, MRI, or biopsy

          -  Patients must agree to have serum and urine samples taken approximately every eight
             weeks and submitted for correlative studies

          -  All patients must have had a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis within 28 days prior to
             initial administration of drug; bone scans must be performed within 42 days of initial
             drug administration

          -  Patients must have been surgically or medically castrated; if the method of castration
             was LHRH agonists (leuprolide or goserelin), then the patient must be willing to
             continue the use of LHRH agonists

          -  If the patient has been treated with non-steroidal anti-androgens (flutamide,
             bicalutamide or nilutamide) or other hormonal treatment (such as ketoconazole), these
             agents must have been stopped at least 28 days prior to enrollment for flutamide or
             ketoconazole, and at least 42 days prior to enrollment for bicalutamide or nilutamide;
             and the patients must have demonstrated progression of disease since the agents were
             suspended

          -  Prior radiation therapy is allowed; at least 21 days must have elapsed since the
             completion of radiation therapy, and the patient must have recovered from the side
             effects of the radiation; if the patient has received strontium 89 or samarium 153, at
             least three months must have elapsed since completion of therapy, and the patient must
             have recovered from side effects of therapy, and the AGC and platelets must meet the
             parameters specified

          -  No more than one prior chemotherapy regimen is allowed; at least 3 weeks must have
             elapsed since the completion of the chemotherapy, and the patient must have recovered
             from the side effects of the therapy

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of 60-100%

          -  Platelet count of &gt;= 100,000/uL

          -  Serum bilirubin =&lt; the institutional upper limit of normal

          -  SGOT and SGPT =&lt; 2 x institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 mg/dl or a calculated creatinine clearance of &gt;= 60mL/min

          -  No other chemotherapeutic agents, biological response modifiers, radiation therapy,
             corticosteroid or hormonal concomitant therapy (other than continuing LHRH treatment)
             may be given during protocol treatment; bisphosphonates may not be given during
             protocol treatment except under the circumstances outlined; no unconventional therapy
             (e.g. St. John's Wort, PC-SPES, or any other herbal remedies taken for the purpose of
             treating prostate cancer) may be given during protocol treatment

          -  Patients must not be planning to begin bisphosphonates; patients already receiving
             bisphosphonates may continue and are eligible provided that they have progressive
             disease documented while on bisphosphonate therapy

          -  Patients with a history of brain metastases, or who currently have treated or
             untreated brain metastases, are not eligible

          -  Patients must have recovered from major infections and/or surgical procedures and, in
             the opinion of the investigator, not have significant active concurrent other medical
             illness precluding protocol treatment

          -  Men of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective contraceptive method

          -  No prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated basal cell
             or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ carcinoma of any site, adequately treated stage
             I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any other
             cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years

          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must
             sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal
             guidelines
