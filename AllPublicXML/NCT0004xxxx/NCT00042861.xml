      RATIONALE: UCN-01 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for
      tumor cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining UCN-01 with chemotherapy may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining UCN-01, fluorouracil, and
      leucovorin in treating patients who have metastatic or unresectable solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of fluorouracil when given in combination with
           UCN-01 and leucovorin calcium in patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors.

        -  Determine the clinical toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of these drugs in these patients.

        -  Correlate, if possible, the pharmacokinetics of these drugs with clinical toxicity in
           these patients.

        -  Assess the pharmacodynamic effects of these drugs in these patients.

        -  Assess any clinical activity of this regimen in patients with measurable disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of fluorouracil (5-FU).

      Patients receive leucovorin calcium (CF) IV over 2 hours and 5-FU IV (at the midpoint of CF
      administration) on day 1, followed by UCN-01 IV over 36-72 hours, on weeks 1-3. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 5-FU until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3
      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. The recommended phase II dose (RPIID)
      is defined as the dose preceding the MTD. At least 6 additional patients are treated at the
      RPIID.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 16 months.
