  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study if to investigate the effect of lonafarnib (SCH66336) in
      combination with Gleevec in the treatment of CML.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Existing pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that SCH66336, a farnesyl transferase
      inhibitor,exhibits significant activity against CML cells, and in fact may have synergistic
      activity in combination with imatinib mesylate. Thus, the objectives to the study are (1) to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of lonafarnib
      (SCH66336), a farnesyl transferase inhibitor, in combination with imatinib mesylate (Gleevec)
      in patients with chronic phase, accelerated phase, and blast crisis CML; (2) to assess the
      pharmacokinetics of the combination of lonafarnib and Gleevec in these patients; and (3) to
      assess in a preliminary way the biologic activity of the combination of lonafarnib and
      Gleevec in these patients.

    <description>Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) defined as grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity (NCI common criteria, version 2.0). Grade 3 or 4 nausea and vomiting considered DLT only if uncontrolled by antiemetics. Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea considered DLT only if uncontrolled for 48 hours despite adequate antidiarrheal therapy.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        1. Patients with Philadelphia chromosome (ph) positive CML in any of the following
             categories:

               1. Chronic phase patients must have failed therapy with Gleevec. Failure will be
                  defined as: (i) Patients who have not achieved or have lost their hematologic
                  response at 3 months from the start of therapy with Gleevec, or (ii) Patients who
                  have not achieved or have lost their cytogenetic response after 6 months of
                  therapy with Gleevec, or (iii) Patients who have not achieved or have lost their
                  major cytogenetic response after 12 months of therapy with Gleevec.

               2. Patients in accelerated phase, defined as the presence of any of the following
                  features: (i) blasts in peripheral blood (PB) or bone marrow (BM) &gt;/= 15% (but &lt;
                  30%), (ii) blasts + promyelocytes in PB or BM &gt;/= 30%, (iii) basophils in PB or
                  BM &gt;/= 20%, (iv) platelets &lt; 100 x 10e9/L unrelated to therapy, (v) clonal
