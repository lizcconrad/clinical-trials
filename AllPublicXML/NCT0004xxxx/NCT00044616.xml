  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 62-week study will compare the safety and effectiveness of fluoxetine (ProzacÂ®),
      lithium, the combination of these two medications, and placebo in treating and preventing
      recurrent depressive episodes in people with bipolar type II disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar II (BP II) disorder is characterized by a high recurrence of major depressive
      episodes (MDE), and it is associated with substantial illness and deaths. Unfortunately,
      relatively little attention has been given to treatment of BP II. Concern that patients may
      switch from depressed to manic states during treatment of MDE has impeded the development of
      effective treatments for BP II MDE.

      BP II MDE patients are treated initially with fluoxetine for 10 weeks. Patients who recover
      from MDE are then randomized to receive a relapse-prevention treatment of fluoxetine,
      lithium, a combination of fluoxetine and lithium, or placebo for 1 year. Patients undergo
      clinical and laboratory evaluations, including physical examinations, bloodwork, thyroid
      function tests, electrocardiogram (ECG), urinalysis, and HAM-D, YMR, CGI-S, CGI-I, and
      adverse events scales.
