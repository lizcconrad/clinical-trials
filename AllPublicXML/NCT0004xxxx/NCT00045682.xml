    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of CT-2103 in treating patients who have recurrent
      or persistent ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the antitumor activity of polyglutamate paclitaxel (CT-2103) as third-line
      treatment for patients with recurrent or persistent ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal
      cancer.

      II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive polyglutamate paclitaxel (CT-2103) IV over 10-20 minutes on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
