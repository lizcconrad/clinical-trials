  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of SCH-58235 (Ezetimibe) in lowering
      sitosterol, plant sterol and cholesterol blood levels in patients with homozygous
      sitosterolemia when added to the patients' current treatment regimen. Homozygous
      sitosterolemia is an inherited disorder of sterol metabolism in which an excess of many plant
      sterols, including sitosterol, is absorbed and not enough excreted. (Sterols are substances
      used to form hormones, vitamins and membranes found in animal and plant lipids.). Patients
      can develop atherosclerosis with coronary heart disease as early as childhood, as well as
      other problems including arthritis, arthralgia, and tendon xanthomas (lipid deposits).
      Current sitosterolemia treatments may include a low sterol diet, medications, intestinal
      surgery, or a combination of these. Ezetimibe is a member of a new class of drugs called
      &quot;specific cholesterol absorption inhibitors&quot; that may lower cholesterol, sitosterol and other
      plant sterol blood levels.

      Patients with homozygous sitosterolemia 10 years of age and older may be eligible for this
      study. Participants will have a medical history and physical examination and will be randomly
      assigned to one of two treatment groups. One group, which will include about 80 percent of
      all study participants, will take 10 mg of Ezetimibe a day, and the second group (20 percent
      of participants) will take a placebo (an inactive look-a-like pill).

      Patients will have 7 clinic visits during the 12-week study, when some or all of the
      following procedures and tests will be done:

        -  Measurement of vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate and temperature)

        -  Dietary maintenance - interview about how well that patient is adhering to the diet

        -  Medication review - interview about other medications the patient is taking

        -  Blood draw for tests

        -  Urine sample for tests

        -  Pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential

        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG) to measure the electrical activity of the heart

        -  Blood draw to determine sitosterol, other plant sterol levels, and lipid levels
           (cholesterol and other blood lipid concentrations)

        -  Xanthoma measurement (with a ruler and X-ray of the foot)

    <textblock>
      Homozygous sitosterolemia is an autosomally inherited recessive disorder of sterol
      metabolism. Patients with homozygous sitosterolemia can present with accelerated
      atherosclerosis with initial CHD events occurring in childhood. In addition, these patients
      can have tendon xanthomas, hemolytic episodes, as well as arthritis and arthralgias. Plasma
      levels of sitosterol and other dietary sterols are markedly elevated in homozygous
      sitosterolemic patients, and are diagnostic of this disorder. A low sterol diet provides only
      limited reduction in sitosterol levels and currently available medical treatments, such as
      bile salt binding resins, are usually insufficiently effective or poorly tolerated.

      SCH-58235 is a member of a new class of therapeutic agents, specific cholesterol absorption
      inhibitors, being developed to treat hypercholesterolemia. Preclinical animal studies and
      clinical studies in humans have demonstrated significant reductions in serum cholesterol
      levels with SCH-58235 treatment. In the current study, the efficacy and safety of SCH-58235
      will be studied in patients with homozygous sitosterolemia, an inherited condition in which a
      wide range of plant sterols, including sitosterol, are excessively absorbed and inadequately
      excreted, leading to dramatic increases in tissue deposition. SCH-58235 may lower sitosterol
      levels by directly inhibiting sitosterol absorption (since plant sterols and cholesterol are
      structurally similar sterols) and/or by inhibiting cholesterol absorption and indirectly by
      increasing hepatic uptake of plasma LDL with increased cholesterol and sitosterol excretion.
      These mechanisms of action could lead to reductions in both plant sterol and LDL cholesterol
      levels in these patients, thereby providing important clinical benefits. The current study
      will determine if SCH-58235 will be safe and well tolerated and provide significant
      reductions in plant sterols (plasma sitosterol and campesterol) and low-density
      lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations in patients with homozygous sitosterolemia.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study lasting 12 weeks.
      Patients with a diagnosis of homozygous sitosterolemia who have an elevated plasma sitosterol
      level on their current regimen will be studied. Patients will be eligible to enroll in the
      study whether their current regimen is medication(s), surgical (prior ileal bypass),
      apheresis, a combination of treatments, or no active regimen. The primary objective of this
      study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 10 mg/day of SCH-58235 in patients with
      homozygous sitosterolemia who continue to have an elevated plasma sitosterol level.
