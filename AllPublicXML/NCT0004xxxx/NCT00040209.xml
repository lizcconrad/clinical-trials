  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of an experimental drug called JP-1730 on Parkinson's
      disease symptoms and on dyskinesias (involuntary movements) that develop as a result of
      long-term treatment with levodopa. JP-1730 affects chemical messengers believed to affect
      Parkinson's disease symptoms.

      Patients between 30 and 80 years of age with relatively advanced Parkinson's disease may be
      eligible for this 3-phase study.

        -  Phase 1 - Baseline evaluation

      Participants will be evaluated with a medical history, physical examination, detailed
      neurologic evaluation, routine blood tests, urinalysis and an electrocardiogram. They will
      also have a 24-hour holter monitor (heart monitoring) and cardiology consultation. A chest
      X-ray and MRI or CT scan of the brain will be done if needed. Patients will, if possible,
      stop taking all antiparkinsonian medications except levodopa (Sinemet) for one month before
      the study begins and throughout its duration. (If necessary, patients may use short-acting
      dopamine agonists, such as Mirapex and Requip.)

        -  Phase 2 - Dose Finding Phase

      For 2 to 3 days, patients will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for a levodopa (a
      dopamine agonist) dose-finding procedure. For this procedure, patients stop taking Sinemet
      and instead have levodopa, and subsequently apomorphine, infused through a vein. During the
      infusions, the drug dose is increased slowly until either 1) parkinsonian symptoms improve,
      2) unacceptable side effects occur, or 3) the maximum study dose is reached. Symptoms are
      monitored frequently to find the optimal dose. (Patients who have had dosing infusions in the
      last 3 months will not have to undergo this phase of the study.)

        -  Phase 3 - Active Study Phase

      Within 3 months of the dose-finding phase, treatment will begin. Patients will receive seven
      doses of JD-1730 or placebo (an inactive substance) via puffs from an oral spray together
      with levodopa infusions over a 3-week period. The doses are given on days 1, 2, and 3 of the
      first week and then approximately twice a week for the next 2 weeks. For these doses,
      patients are hospitalized 4 days the first week and 2 days each for the next 2 weeks. All
      participants will receive placebo at some time during the study, and a few patients, selected
      at random, will receive only placebo the entire 3 weeks. The procedure for the infusions is
      the same as that for the dose-finding phase, with frequent evaluation of symptoms. Also,
      small blood samples are drawn up to three times each study day. At the end of the third week,
      patients will be discharged from the hospital. Their anti-parkinsonian medications may be
      readjusted, as needed. Patients will be contacted 2 weeks after the end of the study for a
      check on side effects and, if necessary, will be scheduled for a follow-up evaluation at the
      clinic.

      In addition to the above procedures, patients will be asked to have an optional lumbar a
      puncture (spinal tap) on the first and last days of the study to measure various brain
      chemicals and drug levels that cannot be measured in blood and urine. For this procedure, a
      local anesthetic is given and a needle is inserted in the space between the bones (vertebrae)
      in the lower back. About 2 tablespoons of fluid is collected through the needle.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of selective alpha-2 adrenergic
      receptor antagonism on the severity of parkinsonian signs and dopaminomimetic drug-associated
      motor response complications in patients with mild to moderately advanced Parkinson's
      disease. In a controlled proof-of-principle clinical study, the acute efficacy of JP-1730
      will be assessed through the use of validated motor function scales. Safety will be monitored
      by means of frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients who meet all of the following inclusion criteria at Day 0 will be eligible to
        participate in the study:

        Patient is between the ages of 30 and 80;

        Patient has an intact oral mucosa;

        Patient has been diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease based on the presence of a
        characteristic clinical history and neurologic findings;

        Patient has relatively advanced disease with levodopa-associated motor response
        complications, including peak-dose dyskinesias and wearing-off fluctuations;

        Patient is willing to adhere to protocol requirements as evidenced by written, informed
        consent.
