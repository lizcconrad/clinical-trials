      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill
      them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining
      chemotherapy with monoclonal antibody therapy may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining pentostatin and
      cyclophosphamide with rituximab in treating patients who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia or
      lymphocytic lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab, in terms of
           response rate, time to treatment failure, time to disease progression, durability of
           response, and overall survival, in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia or
           small B-cell lymphocytic lymphoma.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen, in terms of acute, subacute, and chronic toxicity,
           in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy
      (no prior chemotherapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia vs prior purine analog-based therapy
      [fludarabine or cladribine] but no alkylator therapy vs prior alkylator-based therapy
      [chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide] but no prior purine analog therapy vs prior therapy with
      alkylators and purine analogs, but not as combination therapy).

        -  First course: Patients receive rituximab IV over 1-4 hours on days 1-3 and pentostatin
           IV over 10-30 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1.

        -  All subsequent courses: Patients receive rituximab IV over 60 minutes, pentostatin IV
           over 10-30 minutes, and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment
           repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 160-240 patients (40-60 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study.
