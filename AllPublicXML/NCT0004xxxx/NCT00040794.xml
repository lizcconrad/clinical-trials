  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical trial studies how well combining different regimens of chemotherapy
      and gefitinib with radiation therapy work in treating patients with stage III non-small cell
      lung cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Biological therapies
      such as gefitinib may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of
      non-small cell lung cancer. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
      Giving different regimens of combination therapy together with gefitinib and radiation
      therapy may be an effective treatment for non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether ZD1839 (gefitinib) at 250 mg orally every day administered
      concomitantly with radiotherapy after induction treatment consisting of paclitaxel,
      carboplatin, and ZD1839 among patients with inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer
      and Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) performance status 2 or poor risk performance status
      0-1 is tolerable.

      II. To determine whether ZD1839 at 250 mg orally every day administered concomitantly with
      paclitaxel, carboplatin, and radiation after induction treatment consisting of paclitaxel,
      carboplatin, and ZD1839 among patients with inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer
      and CTC performance status 0-1 is tolerable.

      III. To determine the overall response rate, failure-free survival, and survival after
      treatment with induction chemotherapy with daily ZD1839, concomitant radiotherapy and daily
      ZD1839, and post-radiotherapy single agent daily ZD1839 among patients with CTC performance
      status 2 or poor risk performance status 0-1 and inoperable stage III non-small cell lung
      cancer.

      IV. To determine the overall response rate, failure-free survival, and survival after
      treatment with induction chemotherapy and daily ZD1839, concomitant chemoradiotherapy and
      daily ZD1839, and post-radiotherapy single agent daily ZD1839 among patients with CTC
      performance status 0-1 and inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer.

      V. To determine if elevated circulating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) levels prior
      to treatment, as determined by either quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or direct
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measurement, may predict for response to therapy
      with EGFR inhibitors.

      OUTLINE:

      All patients receive induction therapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses.
      Patients then receive therapy based on their assigned stratum.

      STRATUM I: Patients receive gefitinib orally (PO) daily for 7 weeks. Patients also undergo
      concurrent radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 7 weeks.

      STRATUM II: Patients receive gefitinib and radiotherapy as in stratum I concurrently with
      paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed by carboplatin over 30 minutes once weekly for 7 weeks.

      Patients then receive gefitinib PO daily in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months for 2 years.

               -  Generally, patients entered must be considered unresectable or inoperable;
                  patients with T1 or T2, N2 disease are eligible; patients with T3, N2 or T4,
                  N0-N2 disease are eligible if based on the closeness to the carina, invasion of
                  the mediastinum or invasion of the chest wall; patients with T3, N0-N1 disease
                  are not eligible; patients must be M0 (M1 patients are not eligible)

                    -  Patients with direct invasion of vertebral body are ineligible

                    -  Patients with tumors adjacent to a vertebral body are eligible, unless there
                       is demonstrable bone invasion, as long as all gross disease can be
                       encompassed in the radiation boost field in accordance with the homogeneity
                       criteria

                    -  Patients with contralateral mediastinal disease (N3) are eligible if all
                       gross disease can be encompassed in the radiation boost field in accordance
                       with the homogeneity criteria; patients with scalene, supraclavicular, or

          -  No patients with chronic gastrointestinal disorders including liver disease, diarrheal
             or emetic disorders, or malabsorptive conditions which could worsen toxicity or limit
