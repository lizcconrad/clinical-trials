      Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for
      tumor cell growth. Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of imatinib mesylate in treating
      patients who have progressive, refractory, or recurrent stage II or stage III testicular
      cancer or stage II or stage III ovarian cancer following cisplatin-based chemotherapy

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the activity of imatinib mesylate in patients with progressive, refractory, or
      recurrent pure testicular seminoma or ovarian germ cell dysgerminoma after cisplatin-based
      chemotherapy.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in this patient population. III. Determine KIT
      expression and identify mutations in the c-kit gene in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a partial response or
      stable disease with normalization of human chorionic gonadotropin may undergo surgical
      resection of residual lesions at each tumor status assessment. If residual viable germ cell
      tumor is present in the resected specimen, patients may resume imatinib mesylate. If no
      viable germ cell tumor is present in the resected specimen, then no further therapy is
      administered.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued for this study within 32-38 months.
