    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining bortezomib with docetaxel in treating
      patients who have advanced solid tumors. Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy use
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining
      bortezomib with docetaxel may kill more tumor cells

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib and docetaxel in patients with advanced
      solid tumors.

      II. Determine the toxicity and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine
      the biologic correlates of proteasome inhibition of bortezomib and determine the effects of
      this inhibition on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel in these patients.

      IV. Determine the antitumor efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      For course 1, patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8 and bortezomib IV
      over 3-5 seconds on days 9 and 12. Patients then receive 1 week of rest. For course 2 and all
      subsequent courses, patients receive docetaxel on days 1 and 8 and bortezomib on days 2, 5,
      9, and 12. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 2-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib and docetaxel until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no
      more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
