    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to determine:

        1. Whether drotrecogin alfa (activated) helps children with severe sepsis survive their
           condition more often or recover faster than children who do not receive drotrecogin alfa
           (activated).

        2. Whether drotrecogin alfa (activated) minimizes long term disabilities associated with
           severe sepsis.

        3. The side effects that might be associated with drotrecogin alfa (activated)
           administration to children with severe sepsis.

      The primary objective was to demonstrate that drotrecogin alfa (activated) compared with
      placebo reduced severe-sepsis-induced organ dysfunction as assessed by time to complete
      resolution of a composite of cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal organ failure in
      pediatric patients with severe sepsis.

      Secondary objectives included: (1) to assess whether treatment with drotrecogin alfa
      (activated) reduced 28-day all-cause mortality in pediatric patients with severe sepsis
      compared with placebo patients, (2) to evaluate the effects of drotrecogin alfa (activated)
      on individual organ dysfunction (cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic, hematologic,
      neurologic, and cutaneous), (3) to demonstrate that drotrecogin alfa (activated) improved
      patient outcome as assessed by the Pediatric Overall Performance Category (POPC) scale, (4)
      to demonstrate that drotrecogin alfa (activated) reduced major amputations (at or above the
      wrist, at or above the ankle, face, and genitals) in pediatric patients with Neisseria
      meningitidis (proven or suspected) and/or purpura fulminans, (5) to demonstrate that
      drotrecogin alfa (activated) had antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties. The safety
      objective was to evaluate whether drotrecogin alfa (activated) had an acceptable safety
      profile when administered to pediatric patients with severe sepsis.
