      This study will determine whether magnesium replacement during apheresis can decrease side
      effects that donors commonly experience. Apheresis is a method of collecting large numbers of
      certain blood cells, such as white cells, stem cells, or platelets. In this procedure, whole
      blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein, similar to donating blood. The blood is
      separated into its components by centrifugation (spinning), the required cells are extracted,
      and the rest of the blood is returned to the body, either through the same needle or through
      another needle in the other arm.

      When healthy people donate cells by apheresis, a blood thinner called citrate is added to
      prevent the blood from clotting in the apheresis machine. Citrate works by reducing calcium
      in the blood. When the blood is returned to the donor, citrate from the machine is also
      returned, lowering the donor's calcium levels. As a result, donors often feel tingling around
      the mouth, hands, and feet. Some of these symptoms can be prevented by giving calcium
      intravenously (through a vein) during the procedure. Even with the added calcium, however,
      some donors still have symptoms. Magnesium levels are also lowered by citrate, but it is not
      known if this causes symptoms. This study will examine whether the decrease in magnesium
      levels also contributes to the side effects of apheresis and whether magnesium replacement
      can reduce these symptoms.

      Healthy apheresis donors 18 years of age or older who are enrolled in NIH protocols may
      participate in this study.

      Donors will undergo the apheresis procedures required by the NIH protocol they are enrolled
      in. Throughout the procedure, they will receive an intravenous infusion of a salt solution
      that may or may not contain magnesium. Blood samples of 5 milliliters (1 teaspoon) each will
      be taken from the apheresis machine at the beginning and end of the procedure and at 30- to
      60-minute intervals during the procedure. No more than 50 ml (3 tablespoons) will be taken
      during any single apheresis. The last sample will be drawn 60 minutes after completion of the
      apheresis. In addition, donors will:

        -  Provide a urine sample at the beginning and end of each apheresis procedure.

        -  Donate an additional urine sample and an additional 5 ml blood sample the morning after
           apheresis

        -  Describe any symptoms experienced during apheresis to the apheresis nurse

      Large volume leukapheresis (LVL) is increasingly used to collect peripheral blood stem cells
      (PBSCs) and other mononuclear cells (MNC) for hematopoietic and immune reconstitution, with
      recent emphasis on increased processing volumes. Decreases in divalent cation levels caused
      by administration of citrate anticoagulant during LVL can be associated with severe donor
      reactions, and may limit the rate at which blood can be processed. Several donors at NIH
      experienced citrate-related hypocalcemic tetany during LVL, in response to which we developed
      standard operating procedures for the routine administration of prophylactic intravenous
      calcium solutions during longer apheresis procedures. Other centers have utilized heparin to
      reduce the amount of citrate returned to the donor, however, this exposes the donor to
      systemic anticoagulation and may be associated with hematomas or clumping of the apheresis
      product.

      We previously determined that citrate administration during apheresis results in significant
      excretion of calcium and magnesium in the urine during the procedure, and that performance of
      prolonged or repeated LVL causes significant depletion of blood calcium and magnesium levels.
      Decreases in calcium levels were ameliorated during procedures performed with prophylactic
      calcium administration. Our preliminary studies also demonstrated that ionized magnesium
      levels were markedly reduced during LVL as well as plateletpheresis procedures. The clinical
      impact of severe, acute decreases in ionized magnesium levels in healthy apheresis donors is
      not clear, however. Since most of the adverse effects related to citrate administration can
      be prevented by prophylactic calcium administration, it is unknown what aspect of the
      remaining discomfort may be attributable to hypomagnesemia. This protocol will focus on
      determining the contribution of acute hypomagnesemia to citrate-related symptoms during
      large-volume apheresis, and establishing the role of and indications for prophylactic
      intravenous magnesium replacement in this setting. The study plan will consist of a
      prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Healthy allogeneic donors
      will be assigned to one of two treatment groups. One group will receive intravenous magnesium
      infusions throughout scheduled LVL procedures; the other group will receive equivalent volume
      infusions of normal saline. Symptoms and blood samples will be obtained by apheresis nurses
      and laboratory assays will be performed by associate laboratory investigators, all in a
      blinded fashion.
