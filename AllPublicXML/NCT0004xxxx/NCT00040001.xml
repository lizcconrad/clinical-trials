    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety of DTI-0009 in patients with atrial
      fibrillation and to find the dose of DTI-0009 that lowers heart rates in patients with atrial
      fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Primary diagnosis of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response of any
             duration as documented by an ECG

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Presence of other significant cardiac disease or history of significant neurological,
             hepatic,cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, thyroid, respiratory, rheumatologic,
             or hematologic disease or impairment that in the investigatorâ€™s judgment is serious
             enough to preclude the patient from safely participating in the study
