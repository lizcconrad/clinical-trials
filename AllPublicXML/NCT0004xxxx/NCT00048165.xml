    <measure>Number of Participants Who Developed Acute Rejection Episode Within 6 Months Post-Transplant</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months PT</time_frame>
    <description>The acute rejection episode was a composite end-point of acute rejection and treatment failure within 6 months post-transplant (PT). Participants with acute rejection included participants with a biopsy histology of International Society of Heart and Lung Transplant (ISHLT) Grade IIIA, IIIB, or IV and participants with hemodynamic compromise (HDC) who were treated for acute rejection (whether or not a biopsy was done and regardless of the grade of the biopsy). Participants who had treatment failure included participants who died within 6 months of transplantation before experiencing acute rejection or who were re-transplanted within 6 months of the primary transplantation and who did not experience an acute rejection or who were lost to follow-up.</description>

Tapered to 0.2 mg/kg/d by Day 28, 0.1-0.15 mg/kg/day from Days 36 to 90, and 0.1-0.15 mg/kg/day from Days 120 to 180)at 6 and 12 months PT were reported.

    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A marked reference range was predefined by Roche. The marked reference range is broader than the standard reference range. Values falling outside the marked reference range (low or high) that also represent a defined change from Baseline were considered marked laboratory abnormalities (i.e. potentially clinically relevant).

    <measure>Number of Participants With Marked Laboratory Abnormalities: Biochemistry Parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A marked reference range was predefined by Roche. The marked reference range is broader than the standard reference range. Values falling outside the marked reference range (low or high) that also represent a defined change from Baseline were considered marked laboratory abnormalities (i.e. potentially clinically relevant). Biochemistry included blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), phosphorous, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, glucose, alkaline phosphatase, low density lipoprotein (LDH), uric acid, carbon dioxide, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, LDL, HDL, total cholesterol, and triglycerides.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events and Any Serious Adverse Event, and Adverse Events Leading to Premature Withdrawal</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Pre-existing conditions which worsened during this study were reported as AEs. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Developed Acute Rejection Episode Within 6 Months Post-Transplant</title>
        <description>The acute rejection episode was a composite end-point of acute rejection and treatment failure within 6 months post-transplant (PT). Participants with acute rejection included participants with a biopsy histology of International Society of Heart and Lung Transplant (ISHLT) Grade IIIA, IIIB, or IV and participants with hemodynamic compromise (HDC) who were treated for acute rejection (whether or not a biopsy was done and regardless of the grade of the biopsy). Participants who had treatment failure included participants who died within 6 months of transplantation before experiencing acute rejection or who were re-transplanted within 6 months of the primary transplantation and who did not experience an acute rejection or who were lost to follow-up.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants Who Developed Acute Rejection Episode Within 6 Months Post-Transplant</title>
          <description>The acute rejection episode was a composite end-point of acute rejection and treatment failure within 6 months post-transplant (PT). Participants with acute rejection included participants with a biopsy histology of International Society of Heart and Lung Transplant (ISHLT) Grade IIIA, IIIB, or IV and participants with hemodynamic compromise (HDC) who were treated for acute rejection (whether or not a biopsy was done and regardless of the grade of the biopsy). Participants who had treatment failure included participants who died within 6 months of transplantation before experiencing acute rejection or who were re-transplanted within 6 months of the primary transplantation and who did not experience an acute rejection or who were lost to follow-up.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Worst ISHLT Biopsy Grade Within First 6 Months and 12 Months PT</title>
        <description>The number of participants with Worst International Society of Heart and Lung Transplant (ISHLT) grade within first 6 months and 12 months PT were reported. ISHLT is a standardized grading method to determine the acute cellular rejection on endomyocardial biopsy ; where 0= no rejection, IA= focal (perivascular or interstitial) infiltrate without necrosis, IB= diffuse but sparse infiltrate without necrosis, II=one focus only with aggressive infiltration and/or focal myocyte damage, IIIA=multifocal aggressive infiltrates and/or myocyte damage, IIIB= diffuse inflammatory process with necrosis, IV= diffuse aggressive polymorphous and/or infiltrate and/or edema and/or hemorrhage and/or vasculitis, with necrosis</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Marked Laboratory Abnormalities: Biochemistry Parameters</title>
        <description>A marked reference range was predefined by Roche. The marked reference range is broader than the standard reference range. Values falling outside the marked reference range (low or high) that also represent a defined change from Baseline were considered marked laboratory abnormalities (i.e. potentially clinically relevant). Biochemistry included blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), phosphorous, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, glucose, alkaline phosphatase, low density lipoprotein (LDH), uric acid, carbon dioxide, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, LDL, HDL, total cholesterol, and triglycerides.</description>

        <population>Safety population included all participants who received at least one dose of study drug (daclizumab or placebo) or commercially available daclizumab and have at least one post-baseline safety assessment (eg. any laboratory data, adverse event, etc).

        <title>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events and Any Serious Adverse Event, and Adverse Events Leading to Premature Withdrawal</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Pre-existing conditions which worsened during this study were reported as AEs. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>
