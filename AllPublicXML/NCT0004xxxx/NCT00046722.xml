      To evaluate whether smoked marijuana reduces pain in people with HIV-related peripheral
      neuropathy.

      The study will include subjects with peripheral neuropathy caused either by HIV-disease or
      antiretroviral medication for the treatment of HIV. A neurologist will conduct a neurological
      and pain evaluation to determine eligibility for the study. Subjects who meet all eligibility
      criteria will be admitted to the General Clinical Research Center at San Francisco General
      Hospital for seven days. Subjects will be randomized (like a toss of a coin) to smoke
      marijuana or a placebo (cigarettes with no THC).
