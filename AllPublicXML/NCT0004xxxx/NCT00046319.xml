  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if treating patients suffering from moderate to
      severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with BSF 208075 will improve the patients' ability to
      exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind study evaluating the effectiveness of BSF 208075 in
      treating patients with moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension. A four-week Screening
      Period will be followed by 12 weeks of Treatment. After a subject qualifies for the study,
      the subject will be randomized to one of four doses of BSF 208075 (1.0, 2.5, 5.0 or 10.0 mg
      po qd). Subjects randomized to the 1.0 or 2.5 mg dose groups will receive their respective
      doses of BSF 208075 each day throughout the 12-week Treatment Period. Subjects in the two
      other dose groups will begin treatment at 2.5 mg per day for two weeks and then their dose
      will be increased to 5.0 mg for an additional two weeks. After two weeks of treatment at 5.0
      mg, subjects randomized to the 10.0 mg dose group will undergo a final up-titration. After
      reaching the randomized dose level, subjects will receive their assigned dose throughout the
      Treatment Period. Subjects will remain on the randomized treatment through Week 12. In the
      event that a subject is not tolerating study drug, dose adjustment is permitted during the
      Treatment Period. Upon completion of the 12-week Treatment Period subjects will either
      complete a four-week Down-titration Period or enter an optional 12-week Open-label Extension.
      All subjects that choose to participate in the Open-label Extension will be unblinded and
      have their dose of BSF 208075 optimized based on the subjects response during the Treatment
      Period.

        --Disease Characteristics--

          -  Current diagnosis of either PPH or PAH secondary to the scleroderma spectrum of
             disease (e.g., mixed connective tissue disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic
             sclerosis, or overlap syndrome), anorexigen use, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             infection at the time of screening

          -  By means of a right heart catheterization, completed prior to Screening Visit subjects
             must meet all of the following hemodynamic criteria:

               -  Mean pulmonary arterial pressure of &gt;/= 25 mmHg

               -  Pulmonary vascular resistance &gt;3 mmHg/L/min

               -  Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or left ventricle end diastolic pressure of
                  &lt;15 mmHg

          -  Stable on conventional therapy for PAH, including diuretics, digoxin, or supplemental
             oxygen, for at least one month prior to the Screening Visit

          -  Subjects with a diagnosis of HIV must have stable disease status at the time of
             screening. The subject may be enrolled if they meet the definition of a stable HIV
             status defined as:

               -  No addition of medications for treatment of HIV in the last two months

               -  No active opportunistic infection at the time of screening

               -  No hospitalizations due to HIV within the past four weeks

          -  Able to walk at least 150 meters, but no more than 450 meters, in a six minute walk
             test at the time of the Screening Visit

          -  No pulmonary arterial hypertension due to or associated with congenital heart disease,
             interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or chronic
             thrombotic and/or embolic disease, as documented by a historical echocardiogram, chest
             X-ray, ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan, and/or pulmonary arteriogram

          -  No subjects who have, as measured by a historical pulmonary function test:
