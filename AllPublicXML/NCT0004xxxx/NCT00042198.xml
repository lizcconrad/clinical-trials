      This randomized controlled trial will test the efficacy of (1) cognitive behavior therapy and
      (2) supportive stress management as treatments for depression in people who have recently
      undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a very common problem for people who have had CABG surgery, and recent studies
      have shown that it may increase the risk of additional medical problems and death during the
      first few years after surgery. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been shown to be
      efficacious for depression in otherwise healthy individuals, and supportive stress management
      (SSM) interventions have also been shown to improve depressive symptoms. These therapies have
      not, however, been tested for depression in individuals who have undergone CABG surgery.

      Participants will be screened for depression within 1 year after CABG surgery. Those who have
      depression will return for additional testing 1 week later. Eligible participants will be
      randomized to receive CBT, SSM, or usual care (UC), with no restrictions on nonstudy
      antidepressants, for 12 weeks. Patients will be monitored for worsening depression referred
      for additional care if needed. Depression, anxiety, and health-related quality of life will
      be assessed at baseline, 12 weeks after randomization, and 6 months after surgery (2 months
      after termination of CBT or SSM).
