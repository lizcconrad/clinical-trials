      This study will compare the effectiveness of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) to a minimal
      attention control (AC) condition for treatment of pediatric trichotillomania (TTM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TTM is a persistent impulse control disorder in which the individual acts on urges to pull
      out his or her own hair. Onset typically occurs by adolescence, and TTM is often associated
      with significant functional impairment and distress. CBT is a type of psychotherapy designed
      to change problematic behaviors and thinking. It includes self-monitoring of hair-pulling
      urges and homework assignments to practice the use of cognitive and behavioral strategies.

      Participants are assigned randomly to receive either CBT or AC for 8 weeks. Participants
      assigned to CBT receive weekly 1-hour sessions of CBT for 8 weeks; participants assigned to
      AC receive 6 telephone contacts and 2 in-person sessions for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, CBT
      participants who respond to treatment enter Phase II, which lasts an additional 8 weeks and
      includes 4 in-person maintenance sessions. AC participants who are still symptomatic after 8
      weeks are offered CBT.
