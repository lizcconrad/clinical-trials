    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to compare the impact of somnolence (sleepiness) on cognition
      (awareness) as well as the safety and effectiveness of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules
      versus Zanaflex® (tizanidine hydrochloride tablets) taken while in the fed state (just after
      a meal) and in the fasted state (before a meal) in patients with moderate to severe
      spasticity.
