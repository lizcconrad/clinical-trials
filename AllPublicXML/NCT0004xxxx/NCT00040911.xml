      RATIONALE: Electroacupuncture may help to reduce or prevent delayed nausea and vomiting in
      patients treated with chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying the effectiveness of electroacupuncture
      in treating delayed nausea and vomiting in patients who are receiving chemotherapy for newly
      diagnosed childhood sarcoma, neuroblastoma, nasopharyngeal cancer, germ cell tumors, or
      Hodgkin lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of electroacupuncture, in terms of reducing acute and delayed
           chemotherapy-induced nausea, in patients with newly diagnosed pediatric sarcoma,
           neuroblastoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or germ cell tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the efficacy of this therapy, in terms of reducing delayed
           chemotherapy-induced emesis, in these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this therapy, in terms of altering salivary cortisol levels
           and fasting serum glucose and insulin levels as stress parameters, in these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this therapy, in terms of improving the quality of life, in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this therapy, in terms of reducing acute nausea and emesis, in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified
      according to planned treatment with cisplatin-based chemotherapy (yes vs no) and gender.
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo electroacupuncture to specific acupuncture points on the arms
           and legs over 25 minutes twice daily on days 1 and 2 and then once daily on days 3-7
           during week 1 of chemotherapy course 1 (9 acupuncture treatments total).

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo electroacupuncture to sham points on the arms and legs as in
           arm I.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, on days 1 and 8 of each treatment course, and then
      after completion of the study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 65 patients (approximately 32 per arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 2.5-3 years.
