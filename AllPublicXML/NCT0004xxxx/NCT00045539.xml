      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as methotrexate and thiotepa, work in different
      ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one
      drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining methotrexate with thiotepa in
      treating patients who have newly-diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the complete radiographic response in patients with newly diagnosed primary
           CNS lymphoma treated with methotrexate and thiotepa.

        -  Determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival of patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine whether tumor expression of BCL-6 is associated with response to this
           chemotherapy regimen and survival of these patients.

        -  Describe the relationship between initial response to steroids (if administered),
           response to this chemotherapy regimen, and survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive thiotepa IV over 15 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive methotrexate IV
      over 4 hours on days 1 (8 hours after thiotepa) and 14. Beginning 24 hours after the start of
      methotrexate infusion, patients receive leucovorin calcium IV or orally every 6 hours until
      rescue is achieved. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving disappearance of enhancement
      of disease on MRI receive an additional 28-day course followed by maintenance therapy
      comprising thiotepa and methotrexate once a month for 11 courses.

      Patients undergo neuro-ophthalmologic exams annually for 2 years.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-39 patients will be accrued for this study within 8-20
      months.
