      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill
      them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Biological
      therapies such as CpG 7909 use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer
      cells from growing. Combining CpG 7909 with rituximab may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of CpG 7909 plus rituximab in treating
      patients who have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of subcutaneous and IV CpG 7909 when administered
           with rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the disease response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of CpG 7909. Patients are sequentially
      assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

        -  Group A: Patients receive rituximab IV over 4-5 hours followed by CpG 7909 IV over 2
           hours on day 1. Courses repeat weekly for 4 weeks.

        -  Group B: Patients receive rituximab as above followed by CpG 7909 subcutaneously on day
           1. Courses repeat weekly for 4 weeks.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CpG 7909 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3
      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-48 patients (3-24 per treatment group) will be accrued for
      this study.
