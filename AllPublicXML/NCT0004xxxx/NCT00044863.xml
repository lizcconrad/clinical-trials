  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, multicenter, target enrollment of 250 evaluable patients, open-label
      study of cetuximab in patients with refractory, metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Based on
      prior studies, we predict that 70 to 75% of patients will be EGFR-positive. Patients must
      have documented failure after receiving either at least two chemotherapy regimens for
      metastatic disease or adjuvant therapy plus one chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease
      provided that the patient progressed within 6 months of completing adjuvant therapy. Prior
      chemotherapy must have included irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine.

      Patients will receive an initial dose of cetuximab, 400 mg/m2, intravenously (i.v.) over 120
      minutes, followed by weekly treatment with cetuximab, 250 mg/m2 i.v. over 60 minutes.
      Patients who experience unacceptable toxicity or who have progressive disease will not
      receive further cetuximab therapy.

      Patients will be evaluated for a tumor response at a minimum of every 6 weeks while on
      cetuximab therapy. Patients with stable disease or a partial or complete response may
      continue to receive weekly cetuximab therapy, unless they are dose-delayed or discontinued
      because of toxicity. Patients who have a partial or complete response must have a
      confirmatory tumor assessment no less than 4 weeks after the initial evaluation demonstrating
      a response.

      In addition, there is a pharmacokinetic companion protocol which will determine the trough
      and peak levels of cetuximab in 25 patients enrolled in the study at four to eight centers. A
      pharmacologic serum sample for the determination of levels of cetuximab will be obtained
      prior to the initial, fourth and sixth cetuximab infusions and 1 hour following the
      completion of the initial, fourth and sixth cetuximab infusions in the first course; and
      prior to and 1 hour post the completion of the first cetuximab infusion of each subsequent
      course of therapy. A course of therapy is defined as six weekly infusions of cetuximab
      monotherapy. ImClone will perform the pharmacokinetic analyses.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provided signed written informed consent.

          -  Histologically- or pathologically- confirmed metastatic colorectal carcinoma;

          -  Documented progressive disease after receiving either:

               1. at least two chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease or

               2. adjuvant therapy plus one chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease provided
                  that the patient progressed within 6 months of completing adjuvant therapy.
                  Progressive disease will be defined as progression while on treatment or within 3
                  months after receiving the last dose of therapy in a given regimen;

          -  Prior chemotherapy must have included irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine;

          -  Measurable disease as defined in Section 3.3.2;

          -  Immunohistochemical evidence of EGFr expression. Patients will be considered eligible
             if their tumors demonstrate any EGFr staining, regardless of the intensity, the
             cellular localization of the staining, or the percentage of cell staining. Patients
             who do not have tumor tissue available for EGFr testing will undergo biopsy of
             accessible tumor;

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 to 1 at study
             entry;

          -  Adequate recovery from recent surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. At least 4
             weeks must have elapsed from major surgery, prior chemotherapy, prior treatment with
             an investigational agent, or prior radiation therapy;
