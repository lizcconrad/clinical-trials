      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of daclizumab (also called Zenapax or
      anti-CD25) in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, a type of vasculitis (blood vessel
      inflammation). Wegener's granulomatosis can affect many parts of the body, including the
      brain, nerves, eyes, sinuses, lungs, kidneys, intestinal tract, skin, joints, heart, and
      other sites. Standard treatment is a combination of prednisone and a cytotoxic agent (a drug
      that interferes with cell growth), usually cyclophosphamide or methotrexate. However, many
      patients treated with this regimen have a disease relapse, and others cannot take these drugs
      because of severe side effects. This study will focus on the effectiveness of daclizumab in
      preventing disease relapse.

      The Food and Drug Administration approved daclizumab in 1997 for preventing kidney transplant
      rejection, and the drug has also been studied in people with an eye infection called uveitis.
      The drug works by binding to a protein on T lymphocytes (white blood cells of the immune
      system) called CD25. This prevents another protein, called interleukin-2, from binding to
      this site, thereby preventing a series of events that normally results in inflammation.

      Patients between 10 and 75 years of age with Wegener's granulomatosis may be eligible for
      this study.

      Participants will have a medical history review and physical examination, including
      laboratory studies. If medically indicated, x-rays, consultations and biopsies (surgical
      removal of a small tissue sample) of affected organs will also be conducted. All patients
      will begin treatment with prednisone and cyclophosphamide daily. Those who improve on this
      regimen will reduce the prednisone gradually and continue with cyclophosphamide until their
      disease is in remission. While taking cyclophosphamide, patients must have blood and urine
      tests done every 1 to 2 weeks. Those who achieve disease remission will stop cyclophosphamide
      and start taking methotrexate once a week, usually by mouth but possibly by injection into
      the muscle or skin. Blood and urine tests will be conducted once a week for 4 weeks while the
      dosage is being adjusted and then once a month for the duration of treatment. Patients on
      methotrexate whose prednisone dose is reduced to 10 to 30 mg every other day will be randomly
      assigned either to receive or not receive daclizumab in addition to the methotrexate.
      Daclizumab is given intravenously (through a plastic tube inserted into a vein) the day after
      the randomization, then again in 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and once a month for 18 months.

      All patients will continue to taper their prednisone dose until it is stopped. Methotrexate
      will continue for 2 years. Patients whose disease remains in remission at this time will
      decrease the methotrexate dose. If there is no active disease when both prednisone and
      methotrexate have been stopped, no further treatment will be given. If disease recurs at a
      later time, treatment will be reinstituted. The treatment will be determined by the severity
      of disease, other medical conditions, and history of side effects. Patients not randomized to
      daclizumab who relapse while still taking methotrexate may be offered re-treatment with
      daclizumab.

      Patients will be evaluated in the outpatient clinic every 4 to 8 weeks until randomization.
      Patients not taking daclizumab will be followed every 4 to 12 weeks; those taking the drug
      will be seen every 2 weeks for the first month, every month after that during the 18-month
      treatment period, and every 4 to 12 weeks until all medications stop. Follow-up evaluations
      include a physical examination, blood draws and, if medically indicated, X-rays. The total
      study duration is 60 to 70 months.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of daclizumab as an adjunctive
      treatment to methotrexate in maintaining remission that has been induced by cyclophosphamide
      and glucocorticoids in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. In this study, all patients
      will initially receive daily cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids and then at disease
      remission, cyclophosphamide will be discontinued and patients will receive methotrexate for
      remission maintenance. Following the switch to methotrexate and when the prednisone dose has
      been tapered to 20mg QOD (plus or minus 10mg QOD), patients in remission will be randomized
      to receive daclizumab or not receive daclizumab. Those randomized to receive daclizumab will
      be treated with 1 mg/kg intravenously on day 0, week 2, week 4 and every month thereafter for
      a total of 18 months (20 doses). Regardless to which arm the patient is randomized, they will
      continue to receive methotrexate. Two years after the methotrexate was started, if the
      patient remains in remission, this will be tapered and discontinued. Patients will be
      prospectively monitored for evidence of disease relapse and drug toxicity. Specific
      parameters that will be obtained include the time to disease remission, the rate and time of
      disease relapse, and the incidence of drug-related adverse events.
