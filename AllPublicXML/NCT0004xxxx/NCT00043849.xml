  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of quetiapine
      (Seroquel) for the treatment of psychosis and/or agitation in patients with primary dementia
      complicated by coexistent parkinsonism, or patients with Parkinson's disease with dementia
      [PDD] who have episodes of agitation or psychosis. The secondary aim is to determine the
      safety and tolerability, particularly the influence on parkinsonism, of quetiapine when used
      to treat psychosis and/or agitation in patients with dementia complicated by coexistent
      parkinsonism.

    <textblock>
      Psychosis and agitation often occur in the course of dementia and are a major source of
      patient disability and caregiver stress. For the common situation in which extrapyramidal
      (parkinsonian) motor dysfunction accompanies dementia, there is a therapeutic dilemma since
      the most frequently used drugs to treat the behavioral problems, neuroleptic antipsychotics,
      can worsen parkinsonism and have been associated with severe extrapyramidal reactions in some
      types of dementia. To date, the efficacy and tolerability of a promising alternative
      medication class to treat psychosis and agitation, namely atypical antipsychotics, has not
      been tested in patients with a primary dementia selected for coexisting parkinsonism.

      This is a multicenter double-blind, controlled clinical trial in which 60 subjects with a
      primary dementia (probable Alzheimer's disease [AD] or probable dementia with Lewy bodies
      [DLB]) and coexisting parkinsonism, or Parkinson's disease with dementia [PDD] will be
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups: (1) quetiapine (QUET); an atypical antipsychotic with
      a favorable extrapyramidal side effect profile), or (2) placebo. Each subject participates in
      the trial for 10 weeks and systematic ratings of behavior, motor function, cognition, adverse
      events and other outcomes occur at baseline and after 6 and 10 weeks of assigned treatment.

          -  Meets NINDS/ADRDA diagnostic criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease [AD] or
             Consortium diagnostic criteria for probable dementia with Lewy bodies [DLB] or
             diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease with dementia [PDD].

             visits.
