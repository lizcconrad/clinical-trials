  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is among the most common cancers in the world and its incidence continues to
      increase. Chemotherapy for patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) has been under
      investigation for several decades and several new drugs with activity in NSCLC have been
      identified. These include the taxanes, which are among the most commonly used class of
      chemotherapy agents in clinical oncology today. The usefulness of the taxanes is limited by
      the development of tumor resistance to these agents. This phase II trial with BAY 59-8862
      will be conducted to determine the anti-tumor efficacy of BAY 59-8862 in taxane-resistant
      NSCLC.
