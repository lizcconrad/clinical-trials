      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Infusing chemotherapy drugs directly into the bladder may kill more
      cancer cells. It is not yet known if surgery followed by chemotherapy is more effective than
      chemotherapy alone in treating bladder cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of chemotherapy alone with
      that of transurethral resection followed by chemotherapy in treating patients who have
      bladder cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the efficacy of chemoresection with 4 weekly intravesical instillations of
           mitomycin vs transurethral resection followed by 1 instillation of mitomycin in patients
           with low-risk superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.

        -  Compare the disease-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the response rate at 6 weeks in patients treated with chemoresection.

        -  Determine the percent of patients with tumor at 6 weeks treated with transurethral
           resection.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the side effects of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease status (primary vs recurrent) and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo chemoresection with intravesical instillation of mitomycin once
           weekly for 4 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo transurethral resection followed within 1-6 hours by
           intravesical instillation of mitomycin.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at week 1 (arm II only), at week 5 (arm I only), and
      then at week 6.

      Patients are followed at weeks 6 and 19, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 2
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,000 patients (500 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 5 years.
