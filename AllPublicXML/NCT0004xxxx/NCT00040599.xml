        Disease Characteristics:

          -  Patients with a documented histologic or cytologic diagnosis of a colonic or rectal
             malignancy.

          -  Patients with recurrent, advanced and/or metastatic disease, who have either failed
             standard therapy or are not eligible for any alternate therapies of higher therapeutic
             priority.

          -  Patients with at least one identified (confirmed) and measurable tumor site* with no
             tumor site &gt; 5 cm in the greatest dimension.

        Prior/Concurrent Therapy:

          -  Surgery: Patients are excluded if they have had major surgery either during or within
             four weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Chemotherapy: Patients must have failed standard therapy or are not eligible for any
             alternate therapies of higher therapeutic priority. Patients must have completed
             chemotherapeutic agents four weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Biologic Therapy: Patients who have received a chimeric, CDR-grafted (humanized), or
             human IgG will be eligible provided pre-study evaluations demonstrate no significant
             reactivity with hMN-14 IgG (i.e., HAHA).

          -  Radiotherapy: No prior radiotherapy within four weeks of study entry. No prior
             external beam irradiation to a field that includes more than 30% of the red marrow. No
             prior radiation to maximal tolerable levels for any critical organ (e.g., 3,000 cGy
             for the liver, and 2,000 cGy for the lungs and kidneys). Patients who have had
             standard pelvic field radiation as adjuvant therapy for rectal carcinoma will be
             eligible only after the MTD is established.

          -  Other: Any experimental therapy (i.e., drugs, biologicals, procedures) for the primary
             malignancy, either during or within four weeks prior to study entry.

        Patient Characteristics/Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age Range: Male or Female at least 18 years of age

          -  Performance Status: Patients with a Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70% (or equivalent,
             ECOG 0-1) and expected survival of at least 3 months.

          -  Hematopoietic: Hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dL; WBC &gt; 3000 per mm3; Granulocyte count &gt; 1,500 per
             mm3; Platelet count &gt; 100,000 per mm3

          -  Hepatic: Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal (IULN)AST
             or ALT &lt; 2 x IULN

          -  Renal: Creatinine &lt; IULN

          -  Cardiovascular: Patients with LVEF &gt;/= 50% by required MUGA/2D-ECHO study.

          -  Pulmonary: Patients with DFCO and FEV1 &gt;/= 60% by required Pulmonary Function Tests.

          -  Other: Patients who have had a prior imaging study with a murine monoclonal antibody
             may be included. Patients agreeing to use a medically effective method of
             contraception during and for a period of three months after the treatment period. A
             pregnancy test will be performed on each premenopausal female of childbearing
             potential immediately prior to entry into the study. Patients able to understand and
             give written informed consent.
