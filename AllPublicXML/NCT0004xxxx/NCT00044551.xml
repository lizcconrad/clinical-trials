  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost two-thirds of lymphoma cases are Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (NHL). NHL is a malignant
      process that affects lymphoid cells found both in the lymph nodes and extranodally. Incidence
      and mortality rates from NHL are highest in developed countries. While many patients with
      aggressive NHL are curable with initial anthracycline-containing regimens, the majority of
      patients will relapse or prove refractory to initial therapy. The prognosis of patients with
      disease recurrence following a multidrug regimen is also limited. The current protocol is
      designed to test the safety and efficacy of BAY 59-8862 in patients with Aggressive
      Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
