      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of chemotherapy and a combination of vaccines to
      treat metastatic breast cancer (breast cancer that has spread beyond the breast) in patients
      whose cancer cells have a protein called carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) on their surface.
      Patients who require surgery or radiation therapy, or both, will receive these treatments as
      well.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with previously untreated metastatic breast cancer may be
      eligible for this study. Newly diagnosed patients may not have received prior chemotherapy.
      Patients previously diagnosed with local disease may have received chemotherapy or radiation
      therapy at least 18 months before entering the current study. Patients may have received
      hormonal therapy for stage IV disease. Candidates are screened with a medical history and
      physical examination, blood and urine tests, x-rays, heart and lung tests, and a test to
      determine the presence of CEA on their tumor cells.

      Participants undergo the following procedures:

        1. Central venous line: Under local or general anesthesia, an intravenous catheter (plastic
           tube) is inserted into a major vein in the chest. It is used to give chemotherapy and
           other medications and to withdraw blood samples.

        2. Apheresis: Before beginning treatment and at various times before and after
           chemotherapy, patients undergo apheresis to collect white blood cells for later
           re-infusion at the time of immunizations and to evaluate the body's response to the
           vaccines. For this procedure, blood is collected through the central venous catheter and
           circulated through a machine that separates the white cells from the rest of the blood.
           The white cells are removed and frozen for later use. The rest of the blood is returned
           to the patient through the catheter.

        3. First vaccine: Before starting chemotherapy, patients receive one subcutaneous (under
           the skin) injection of a vaccine called rV-CEA-Tricom, along with subcutaneous
           injections of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Sargramostim),
           a drug that stimulates the bone marrow to release white blood cells and white cell
           precursors into the bloodstream.

        4. Chemotherapy:

             -  Taxol (paclitaxel)/Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide): Patients receive three to five
                cycles of Taxol and Cytoxan. Taxol is given as a continuous 72-hour intravenous
                (intravenous (IV), through a vein) infusion and Cytoxan is given daily for 3 days,
                intravenously, over 1 hour. Cycles are 21 to 42 (usually 28) days. After each
                cycle, patients also receive growth colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (a drug that
                helps boost white cells.

      BACKGROUND: Metastatic breast cancer remains to this day a mostly incurable disease, with
      less than 10% of patients reaching a long-term disease free survival. This study proposes
      using an immune-depleting chemotherapy as platform for immunotherapy. It is based on the
      following hypotheses and understanding:

        -  The combination of dose-intensive followed by immune-depleting chemotherapy provides a
           platform for subsequent immunotherapy by:

             1. Lengthening the progression-free survival period, thus allowing time for a slow
                acting therapy such as vaccination to be effective.

             2. Maximally decreasing the patient's tumor burden. This has been shown both in
                clinical and experimental settings to be desirable if not necessary for
                immunotherapy to be effective.

             3. Decreasing the tumor burden which may also decrease a tumor-induced
                immuno-suppressive effect linked to tumor bulk.

             4. Providing tumor antigen exposure following immune depletion in the form of repeated
                immunizations. This may take advantage of the pattern of immune reconstitution
                following immune depleting therapy at early time points (antigen-driven peripheral
                expansion of T-cells) and the renewal of a T-cell repertoire biased towards tumor
                antigens and anti-tumor responses at later time points.

        -  Low antigenicity of tumor antigens and immune tolerance may be overcome in a clinically
           relevant fashion by providing exposure to the tumor antigens (the carcino-embryonic
           antigen CEA) in a more immunogenic presentation along with added co-stimulatory signal
           (in the form of two poxvirus-based recombinant vaccines).

        -  Due to the post immune depletion defects and delay in immune reconstitution, an adequate
           immune response to vaccines may not occur unless the patients are provided, following
           immune depletion, with unaltered T-cells in the form of re-infusion of pre-chemotherapy
           lymphocytes.

      The late recovery of thymic function (18 to 24 months) with reappearance of naive T-cells may
      play a determinant role in the prevention of later disease progression. It is the rationale
      for a late series of immunizations.

      ELIGIBILITY: Patients with metastatic breast cancer untreated with chemotherapy or radiation
      in the previous 18 months with CEA positivity in either the tumor or the serum.

      OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives are to evaluate biologically this immunization strategy by
      assessing CEA specific T-cell responses as well as clinically by comparing the patient event
      free survival (EFS) to our historical control (protocol 96-C-0104) in which patients have
      received the same conventional therapy but no immunization

      DESIGN: Before any chemotherapy patients will be immunized with one of two tumor-specific,
      recombinant, poxvirus-based deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) Tricom vaccines and sensitized
      lymphocytes will be cryopreserved. Patients will then receive conventional induction therapy
      with Paclitaxel, Cyclophosphamide and Doxorubicin, surgery and / or radiation as indicated
      for local control, then immune depleting chemotherapy with Fludarabine &amp; Cyclophosphamide.
      Following immune depletion, patients will receive 9 immunization boosts over the next 30
      months. Patients whose disease progress through the vaccination schedule, may, under certain
      circumstances, receive further vaccinations under a more intensive schedule (monthly).

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All patients must have a diagnosis of metastatic infiltrating carcinoma of the breast
        including hormone receptor testing. At least one site of metastatic disease must have been
        confirmed by pathologic or cytologic material. In the choice of a biopsy site, the PI will
        weigh the morbidity the diagnostic procedure against the probability of positive yield of
        the diagnostic procedure.

        All pathologic material must be reviewed by the Pathology Laboratory of the National Cancer
        Institute (NCI) before treatment.

        The tumor MUST stain positive for CEA, by standard immuno-histochemistry performed at the
        Pathology Laboratory of the NCI.

        --Method: 5 microM formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections are deparaffinized and blocked
        with methanol-30% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). After antigen retrieval by boiling in citrate
        buffer, or heating in a microwave oven for 10 minutes, slides are incubated with monoclonal
        antibodies anti-CEA (diluted 1/1000 Dako). Then, slides are immunostained with
        avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex and developed with diaminobenzidine. Harris' hematoxylin
        was used to counter stain the slides. Positivity is defined as greater than 30% of cells
        staining.

        Patients may be newly diagnosed with metastatic breast carcinoma or known to have breast
        carcinoma.

             before entry on study.

          -  If previously treated for breast cancer, patients may have received chemotherapy or
             radiation as adjuvant treatment for non-metastatic disease or metastatic disease but
             not in the previous 18 months.

          -  Patients may have been on hormonal therapy for stage IV disease. Patients with disease
             progression on hormonal therapy alone are eligible.

        Group (ECOG) 0 or 1)

        Ejection fraction by multi-gated acquisition scan (MUGA) or 2-dimensional (2-D)
        echocardiogram within normal institutional limits. In case of insufficient ejection
        fraction, a stress echocardiogram will be performed. In case of an ejection fraction
        greater than 35 % but less than 45%, the patient will remain eligible for the study if the
        increase of ejection fraction with stress is estimated at 10% or more.

        Creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 cc/min

        Normal urinalysis; if proteinuria is present it must be quantified at less than 1 g / 24 h
        on a measured 24 h urine collection

        Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than 3 times the
        upper limit of normal except if believed to be due to tumor involvement of the liver prior
        to induction therapy.

        Bilirubin less than 1.5 (except if due to tumor involvement prior to induction therapy or
        in cases of Gilbert's disease).

        administration). Patients must agree to make specific arrangements, if necessary, in order
        to comply and be eligible.

        Patients must be able to give informed consent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Age less than 18 years

        Patients in whom an urgent or emergent clinical situation does not safely allow for the
        short delay in initiating the Concurrent Therapy (as defined in protocol) necessary for the
        pre-treatment immunization and lymphocyte collection (at the discretion of the PI).

        Patients requiring chronic immunosuppressive therapy (including corticosteroids) for any

        antibody (ANA), anti-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4),
        thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) after review with appropriate consultant. Patients with
        endocrine disease that is controlled by replacement therapy including, diabetes, thyroid
        and adrenal disease or vitiligo may be enrolled.

        Patients with active inflammatory bowel disease

        Patients with clinically significant cardiomyopathy requiring treatment or symptomatic
        congestive heart failure (CHF), symptomatic arrhythmia that is not controlled by
        medication, unstable coronary artery disease (CAD) such as unstable angina who require
        active intervention, and patients with a recent infarction or cerebrovascular accident
