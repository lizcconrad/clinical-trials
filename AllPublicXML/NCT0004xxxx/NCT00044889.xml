    <textblock>
      Clofarabine (injection) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
      treatment of pediatric patients 1 to 21 years old with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia
      (ALL) who have had at least 2 prior treatment regimens.

      This is a single arm, open-label, Phase II study of CLOFARABINE in adult patients with
      refractory or relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Qualified patients must be
      refractory to one or two induction regimens, or have relapsed &lt; one year from the date of
      confirmation of the initial complete remission (CR). There will be two phases in this study -
      an Induction phase and a Consolidation phase.
