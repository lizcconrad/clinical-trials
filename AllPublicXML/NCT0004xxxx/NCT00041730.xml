      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of patients treated with Rituxan® plus
      FavId™ and GM-CSF to mount an immune response (humoral and/or cellular) to KLH and their
      idiotype.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of patients treated with Rituxan® plus
      FavId™ and GM-CSF to mount an immune response (humoral and/or cellular) to KLH and their
      idiotype. Secondary objectives are the determination of overall objective response rate,
      duration of response and time to progression. B-cell malignancies express a unique antigen,
      the immunoglobulin idiotype (Id), on their surface. Each B-cell harbors a unique genetic
      sequence used in production of unique Id protein. No normal B-cells possess that Id on their
      cell surface. Hence, Id protein should serve as an ideal target for individualized active
      immune therapy of NHL. Many of the antigens expressed by tumors (including Id) are only weak
      immunogens. To augment the immune response against Id, the Id protein must be chemically
      coupled to a strongly immunogenic protein. keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) is a commonly used
      protein carrier capable of augmenting the body's immune reaction against Id protein. For
      vaccines which produce primarily an antibody response, there is a concern that combining
      immunotherapy with Rituxan®, which produces a rapid and sustained (up to 6 to 9 months
      post-treatment in 83% of patients) depletion of circulating and tissue-based B-cells, would
      blunt any antibody response. For vaccines that induce strong T-cell responses like Id-KLH
      plus GM-CSF, there is evidence in mice that depleting the host of B-cells could actually
      increase the T-cell response to the vaccine. GM-CSF is a hematopoietic growth factor that
      stimulates T-cell proliferation. T-cell response to both the patient's Idiotype and KLH will
      be measured during this trial.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Patients that are treatment naive OR

          -  Relapsed or refractory following chemotherapy OR

          -  Relapsed following a prior response to Rituxan(R) Note: Rituxan (R) may have been
             given as second-line therapy following an initial response to chemotherapy or in
             combination with chemotherapy for initial therapy of their disease.

          -  Tumor accessible for biopsy or previously existing recent biopsy material

          -  Measurable disease after node biopsy

          -  Histologically confirmed grade 1 or 2 follicular B-cell lymphoma (WHO classification)

          -  Performance status (ECOG) of 0, 1 or 2

          -  Absolute Granulocyte count &gt; 1,000/mm3

          -  Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3

          -  Total Bilirubin &lt;2 mg/dL

          -  AST and ALT &lt;2x Upper Limit of Normal

          -  Creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patients who are refractory to Rituxan(R) Note: Patients who did not attain a CR or PR
             are considered to be refractory

          -  More than 2 prior treatment regimens (e.g. CHOP plus Rituxan(R) is one treatment
             regimen; CHOP followed by Rituxan(R) at initial relapse equals two treatment regimens)

          -  Treatment w/Fludarabine within 9 months of study entry

          -  Patients with &gt; 5,000 lymphocytes

          -  Prior tumor-specific idiotype immunotherapy using the identical idiotype (patients
             whose idiotype has changed are eligible for retreatment with new idiotype)

          -  Concurrent immunosuppressive therapy (high-dose steroids; ect.)

          -  Known history of CNS lymphoma or meningeal lymphomatosis

          -  HIV positive

          -  Serious non-malignant disease (e.g., psychiatric disorders, compromised pulmonary
             function (e.g. active asthma, COPD, pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans), congestive
             heart failure, or active uncontrolled bacterial, viral or fungal infections), or other
             conditions which, in the opinion of the investigator would compromise protocol
             objectives

          -  Prior malignancy (excluding non-melanoma carcinomas of the skin and in situ cervical
             carcinomas) unless in remission for &gt;2 years

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 8 weeks prior to study entry

          -  Pregnant or nursing women NOTE: Women of childbearing potential should be advised to
             avoid becoming pregnant while receiving study treatment.
