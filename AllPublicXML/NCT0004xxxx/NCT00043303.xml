  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and effectiveness of Interferon
      gamma-1b (IFN-g 1b) injected subcutaneously (under the skin) for the treatment of advanced
      liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C infections.

      IFN-g 1b is not currently approved for the treatment of liver fibrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of IFN-g 1b in patients with advanced
      liver fibrosis and cirrhosis due to hepatitis C. This study will also evaluate whether IFN-g
      1b is effective in reducing the amount of fibrosis in the liver.
