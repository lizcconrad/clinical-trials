  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the drug daclizumab for treating patients with
      chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), a disease in which the immune system destroys
      platelets (blood cells involved in the clotting process). Patients with ITP have abnormal
      bruising and bleeding; severe disease can be life-threatening. For many patients, standard
      drug treatments are not effective, and many of the drugs used may have significant side
      effects with long-term use. Daclizumab is a genetically engineered antibody that suppresses
      the immune system and has been used primarily to prevent rejection in patients who have had
      organ transplants. Daclizumab has fewer side effects than other immune suppressant drugs.

      Patients with ITP 18 years of age or older who have platelet counts less than
      30,000/microliter and have not responded to prednisone treatment may be eligible for this
      study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood
      tests.

      Participants will have a 15-minute infusion of daclizumab every 2 weeks for five doses. They
      will be seen by a physician at least once every 2 weeks while receiving the drug and then at
      weeks 12, 20, and 32 of the study. Blood will be drawn at the 4- and 8-week visits during
      treatment for diagnostic tests, and at each follow-up visit after treatment to assess the
      response to therapy.

      Patients who respond well to treatment will have their pre-study immunosuppressive medicines
      tapered gradually one at a time starting with the 1-month follow-up visit. If their platelet
      count falls to pre-treatment levels at any time during the tapering, the dose reduction will
      stop and pre-study medications will be re-started, if necessary.

    <textblock>
      Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired blood disease in which the individual's immune
      system destroys platelets, the blood cells responsible for clotting. A number of standard
      treatments exist to decrease the destruction of platelets, including drugs such as the
      steroid hormone prednisone, or removal of the spleen. Over a third of adult patients will not
      maintain adequate platelet counts with these treatments. Alternative treatments may be
      indicated due to bleeding symptoms or baseline platelet counts less than 20,000/ul, a level
      at which spontaneous serious bleeding can occur. Therapy for chronic ITP is generally
      effective in less than 30-50% of patients, however, and most of these agents have significant
      toxicities with long-term use, are expensive, or their administration interferes with daily
      activities.

      Daclizumab is a humanized anti-interleukin-2 receptor monoclonal antibody that works by
      targeting and impairing activated T lymphocytes, a subset of white blood cells that has been
      thought to be involved in the development and maintenance of ITP. Daclizumab is a
      well-tolerated and time-limited therapy, and is easily administered on an outpatient basis.
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of daclizumab as either a sole agent in the
      treatment of chronic, symptomatic ITP, or as a treatment that might allow a decrease or
      discontinuation of medications such as prednisone.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Male or female greater than or equal to 18 years old

        Immune thrombocytopenia, and all of the following:

        at least three months since initial diagnosis

        lack of sustained response to initial treatment with prednisone, characterized by failure
        to maintain a platelet count of at least 30,000/ul for at least six weeks using prednisone
        at a dose of at least 10 mg per day

        baseline platelet count (as determined by an average of platelet count values over two
        months immediately prior to study entry) of less than 30,000/ul

        *Note: In patients receiving IVIG or anti-D, platelet values immediately prior to infusion
        of the drug (i.e., at platelet nadir) will be considered in the determination of the
        baseline platelet value.

        Splenectomy or prior use of second-line immunomodulatory treatments (such as, but not
        limited to, CSA, danazol, azathioprine or cyclophosphamide) will not be considered a
        requirement for inclusion.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        ECOG performance status greater than 1

        Concurrent symptomatic autoimmune hemolysis (Evans syndrome) characterized by hemoglobin
        less than 10 gm/dl or requirement for more than two units red cells within three months of
        enrollment, due to hemolysis

        Concurrent autoimmune disorders requiring treatment for involvement of organ systems other
        than cytopenias

        Initiation of any new immunomodulator agent, or increase in dose or frequency of any
        existing immunomodulator agent (such as, but not limited to, CSA, danazol, azathioprine or

        positive hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], or anti-hepatitis C virus [anti-HCV]
        antibody)

        History of active M. Tuberculosis infection

        Diagnosis of malignancy (with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer and other
