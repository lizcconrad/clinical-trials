  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of erlotinib in treating patients who have
      unresectable liver cancer and liver dysfunction. Biological therapies such as erlotinib may
      interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of the tumor

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of OSI-774 in
      patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with moderate liver dysfunction.

      II. Establish the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of OSI-774 in HCC patients with
      moderate liver dysfunction.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess possible anti-tumor effects of OSI-774 in patients with advanced hepatocellular
      carcinoma in terms of partial response (PR) and complete response (CR) as assessed by tumor
      shrinkage by RECIST criteria.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

    <description>PK parameters characterized by use of descriptive statistics. Nonparametric statistical test for several unrelated (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA) or related (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test) parameters used. Relationships between drug dose and indices that reflect drug exposure (Cmax, AUC, Cssmin) evaluated with Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test. Extent of drug exposure (Cmax, AUC, Cssmin) compared among patients with various grades of toxicity using nonparametric statistical tests for two (Mann-Whitney U test) or several (Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA) independent samples.</description>
