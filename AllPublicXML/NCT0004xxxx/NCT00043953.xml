      The objectives of this study are to explore the metabolic toxicities associated with
      lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) plus saquinavir mesylate (INV) versus LPV/r plus Combivir in
      antiretroviral naïve subjects and to assess the overall safety, tolerability and efficacy of
      LPV/r plus INV versus LPV/r plus Combivir in antiretroviral naïve subjects and to assess the
      pharmacokinetics of 400 mg INV taken twice a day (BID), 600 mg INV BID and 800 mg INV BID in
      combination with 400 mg lopinavir/100 mg ritonavir plus 150 mg lamivudine/300 mg zidovudine
      BID.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is naïve to antiretroviral treatment (subjects may not have more than 7 days
             of any antiretroviral treatment).

          -  Subject is at least 18 years of age, inclusive.

          -  If female, subject is either not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal
             for at least 1 year or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral
             oophorectomy or hysterectomy), or is of childbearing potential and practicing one of
             the following methods of birth control:condoms, sponge, foams, jellies, diaphragm or
             intrauterine device(IUD), a vasectomized partner, total abstinence from sexual
             intercourse

          -  If female, the results of a urine pregnancy test performed at screening (urine
             specimen obtained no earlier than 28 days prior to study drug administration) is
             negative.

          -  Subject is not breast-feeding.

          -  Vital signs, physical examination and laboratory results do not exhibit evidence of
             acute illness.

          -  Subject has no significant history of cardiac, renal, neurologic, psychiatric,
             oncologic, endocrinologic, metabolic or hepatic disease that would in the opinion of
             the investigator adversely affect his/her participating in this study.

          -  Subject does not require and agrees not to take any of the following medications for
             the duration of the study: midazolam, triazolam, terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride,
             pimozide, propafenone, flecainide, certain ergot derivatives (ergotamine,
             dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine), rifampin, lovastatin,
             simvastatin, and St. John's wort.

          -  Subject agrees not to take any medication during the study, including over-the-counter
             medicine, alcohol or recreational drugs without the knowledge and permission of the
             principal investigator.

          -  Subject has not been treated for an active AIDS-defining opportunistic infection
             within 30 days of screening.

          -  Subject has a plasma HIV RNA level of greater than 400 copies/mL at screening.

          -  Subject agrees to take all doses of the study drug from the bottles provided by the
             sponsor (rather than other containers, i.e., &quot;pill box&quot;).

          -  Subject has voluntarily signed and dated an informed consent form, approved by an
             Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), after the nature
             of the study has been explained and the subject has had the opportunity to ask
             questions. The informed consent must be signed before any study-specific procedures
             are performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a history of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to LPV/r, INV
             or Combivir.

          -  Subject has a history of substance abuse or psychiatric illness that could preclude
             adherence with the protocol.

          -  Screening laboratory analyses show any of the following abnormal laboratory results:

               -  Hemoglobin ≤ 10.0 g/dL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≤ 1000 cells/µL

               -  Platelet count ≤ 50,000 per mL

               -  ALT or AST ≥ 3.0 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)

               -  Creatinine ≥ 1.5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)

          -  Subject has received any investigational drug within 30 days prior to study drug
             administration.

          -  For any reason, subject is considered by the investigator to be an unsuitable
             candidate for the study.
