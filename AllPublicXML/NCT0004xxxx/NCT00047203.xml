      Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die. Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of flavopiridol in treating
      patients who have relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma
      treated with flavopiridol.

      II. Determine the disease-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this
      drug.

      III. Correlate disease response with t(11;14)(q13;q32) rearrangement, p16 methylation status,
      and BCRP expression in patients treated with this drug.

      IV. Correlate disease response and drug treatment with cell cycle status and effects on
      apoptosis and apoptosis regulatory proteins in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Courses repeat every 21 days for up
      to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 12 months,
      patients achieving at least a partial response may continue treatment in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 1 year.
