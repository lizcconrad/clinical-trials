      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may make the body build an
      immune response to kill tumor cells. Combining vaccine therapy with chemotherapy may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy followed by adenovirus
      p53 vaccine therapy in treating patients who have extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of autologous dendritic cell-adenovirus p53
           vaccine, administered after standard chemotherapy, in patients with extensive stage
           small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the development of an anti-p53-specific immune response in these patients
           after treatment with this regimen.

        -  Determine the tumor response rate, time to progression, and overall survival of patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the frequency of anti-adenovirus immune responses in these patients after
           treatment with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of autologous dendritic cell-adenovirus p53 vaccine.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis and dendritic cells are cultured. Adenovirus carrying p53 gene
      particles are added to the dendritic cells to make the vaccine. Leukapheresis is performed
      before chemotherapy or 8 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy if the patient has already
      started chemotherapy.

      Patients receive standard chemotherapy before receiving the vaccine. The recommended regimen
      is carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with progressive disease (PD) at 6 weeks after chemotherapy are removed from the
      study.

      Patients are followed at day 140 and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 43-58 patients (3-18 for phase I and 40 for phase II) will be
      accrued for this study within 3 years.

    <measure>Rate of Toxicity of the Ad-p53 DC Vaccine</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the toxicity of the Ad-p53 dendritic cell (DC) vaccine. While there is no expected toxicity from the Ad-p53 vaccine, there may be unforeseen adverse effects. Patients will be monitored for toxicity, particularly for evidence of autoimmunity. Complete blood counts (CBCs) to monitor for hematologic toxicity, serum creatinine to monitor for renal toxicity, liver function tests (LFTs) to monitor for hepatic toxicity, and a standard clinical toxicity will be performed every other week throughout the period of immunization. In addition, a medical history and physical examination will be performed on a monthly basis.</description>

    <description>• Phase I: Beginning 9 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients receive autologous dendritic cell-adenovirus p53 vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 14, and 28. Patients without PD may undergo repeat leukapheresis on day 49. Patients receive vaccine SC again on days 56, 84, and 112 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of autologous dendritic cell-adenovirus p53 vaccine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
• Phase II: Patients receive autologous dendritic cell-adenovirus p53 vaccine at the MTD determined in phase I.</description>
