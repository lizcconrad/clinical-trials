      1. To assess the treatment related mortality of allogeneic stem cell transplantation with
           non-myeloablative therapy incorporating the lymphodepleting MAb CAMPATH-1H, in patients
           with hematological diseases and renal cell carcinoma not eligible for conventional
           (myeloablative) therapy.

        2. To assess the time to engraftment and incidence of graft failure in patients receiving
           this transplant regimen.

        3. To assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and immunologic activity of CAMPATH-1H when used
           as part of a subablative conditioning regimen.

      This is a two arm study in which outcomes will be assessed independently in recipients of HLA
      matched sibling transplants and recipients of unrelated or mismatched family donor
      transplants, although both groups will receive identical treatments.

      The following will be given to the patient after admission:

      Day - 6: Total body irradiation

      Day - 5 to - 2: Fludarabine and Campath 1H

      Day - 1: Day of rest

      Day 0: Stem cell transplant (infusion)
