        Disease Characteristics:

          -  Patients with a documented histologic or cytologic diagnosis of a pancreatic
             malignancy

          -  Patients with recurrent, advanced and/or metastatic disease, who have either failed
             standard therapy or are not eligible for any alternate therapies of higher therapeutic
             priority.

          -  Patients with at least one identified (confirmed) and measureable tumor site.

        Prior/Concurrent Therapy:

          -  Surgery: Patients are excluded if they have had major surgery either during or within
             four weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Chemotherapy: Patients must have failed standard therapy or are not eligible for any
             alternate therapies of higher therapeutic priority.

          -  Biologic Therapy: Patients who have received a chimeric, CDR-grafted (humanized), or
             human IgG will be eligible provided pre-study evaluations demonstrate no significant
             reactivity with hMN14 IgG (i.e., HAHA)

          -  Radiotherapy: No prior radiotherapy within four weeks of study entry. No prior
             external beam irradiation to a field that includes more than 30% of the red marrow. No
             prior radiation to maximal tolerable levels for any critical organ (e.g., 3,000 cGy
             for the liver; 2,000 cGy for the lungs and kidneys).

          -  Other: Any experimental therapy (i.e., drugs, biologics, procedures) for the primary
             malignancy, either during or within four weeks prior to study entry.

        Patient Characteristics/Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Performance Status: Patients with a Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70% (or equivalent,
             ECOG 0-1) and an expected survival rate of at least 3 months

          -  Hematopoietic: Hemoglobin &gt; 10g/dL; WBC &gt; 3000 per mm3; Granulocyte count &gt; 1500 per
             mm3; platelet count &gt; 100,000 per mm3

          -  Hepatic: Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal (IULN);
             AST or ALT &lt; 2 X IULN

          -  Renal: Creatinine &lt; IULN

          -  Cardiovascular: Patients with LVEF &gt;/= 50% by required MUGA/2D-ECHO study

          -  Pulmonary: Patients with DF and FEV1 &gt;/= 60 % by required Pulmonary Function Tests

          -  Gastrointestinal:Patients with severe anorexia or other related symptomology are
             excluded

          -  Central Nervous System: Patient with known metastatic disease to the CNS are excluded

          -  Other: Patients who have had a prior imaging study with a murine antibody may be
             included. Patients agreeing to use a medically effective method of contraception
             during and for a period of three months after the treatment period. A pregnancy test
             will be preformed on each premenopausal female of childbearing potential immediately
             prior to entry into the study. Patients able to understand and give written informed
             consent.
