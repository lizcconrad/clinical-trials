          -  A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of:

          -  a. non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
             including any female who is pre-menarchial); or,

          -  b. child-bearing potential with a negative serum pregnancy test at screen, a negative
             urine pregnancy test on Day 1 and who agrees to use one of the following methods of
             contraception (any contraception method must be used consistently and correctly, i.e.,
             in accordance with both the product label and the instructions of a physician). Note:
             hormonal contraceptives are not considered a sufficient form of contraceptive for this
             study.

          -  Complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of study
             drugs, throughout the study and for 2 weeks after discontinuation of all study
             medications. Should a female subject of childbearing potential decide to become
             sexually active during the course of the study, she must be counselled and be willing
             to use one of the methods listed below:

          -  Double barrier contraception (male condom/spermicide, male condom/diaphragm,
             diaphragm/spermicide)

          -  Any intrauterine device (IUD) with published data showing that the expected failure
             rate is less than 1% per year (not all IUDs meet this criterion)

          -  Any other method with published data showing that the lowest expected failure rate for
             that method is less than 1% per year. All subjects participating in this study should
             be counselled on the practice of safe/safer sex.

          -  Parent or legal guardian (and subject whenever possible) has the ability to understand
             and provide written informed consent for the subject to participate in the trial.
             Verbal witnessed assent must be obtained from the subject whenever possible.

          -  Screening plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt; or =400copies/mL.

          -  Subject's who, in the investigator's opinion, and following resistance testing where
             appropriate, are able to construct an active NRTI backbone regimen consisting of 2
             NRTIs.

          -  Subjects must meet one of the following criteria:

          -  ART-naïve subjects are defined as having had &lt; 4 weeks (28 days) therapy with an NRTI,
             no previous therapy with an NNRTI and &lt; 1 week therapy with an HIV PI.

          -  ART-experienced subjects are defined as having had greater than 4 weeks (28 days)
             therapy with any NRTI(s) and any length of therapy with any NNRTI(s) and/or a PI.
             PI-experienced subjects will be eligible if they have previously been treated with &lt;
             three PIs, excluding AGENERASE. Prior therapy with a RTV boosted PI regimen will be
             considered as only 1 prior PI as long as the RTV dose was below that recommended for
             use of RTV as an antiretroviral agent. This specific criterion is not applicable to
             subjects in screening and/or enrolling after approval of Amendment No. 4. - For
             subjects screening and/or enrolling after the approval of Amendment No.4, PI naive
             subjects are defined as ART experienced subjects having less than one week of therapy
             with a PI and no prior experience with AGENERASE. Prior treatment with NNRTIs and
             NRTIs is permitted (however, subjects will NOT be permitted to receive concurrent

        <description>A blood sample was drawn to determine the amount of HIV-1 RNA virus in copies per milliliter (mL) at Weeks 12, 48, 96, and 196. The percentage of participants with HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 copies/mL at Weeks 12, 48, 96, 168 was determined by the TLOVR algorithm with stratification by the six randomization strata. TLOVR analysis categorizes participants by treatment response. Responders were participants with confirmed viral load &lt;400copies/mL on two consecutive visits.</description>

        <title>Least Squares Mean of Plasma APV Parameter: AUC0-tau</title>
        <description>A blood sample was drawn on Week 4 over 24 hours (at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours post dosing). Ratio of geometric least squares mean (90% CI) are presented. Ctau=trough concentration. PK Parameters for QD and BID are compared with Historical adult data. Least squares mean (LSM) are the group means after having controlled for a covariate (i.e., holding it constant at some typical value of the covariate, such as its mean value). LSM is calculated by taking the average of the means within a treatment.</description>
