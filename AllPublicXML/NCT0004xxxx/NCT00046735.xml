    <description>The planned doses for investigation are as follows: 5, 10, and 25 mg/day. Lenalidomide will be administered as a single daily dose for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week rest period. Dosing will be in the morning at approximately the same time each day, at least 1 hour before the morning meal. Patients will be assigned to dose level in the order of study entry. No dose adjustments or suspensions are allowed during the first cycle, except discontinuation for DLT</description>

          6. Approximate life expectancy greater than 3 months.

          7. Laboratory tests within these ranges:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/μlL

                  metastases present

          8. The following prior treatments are allowable under this protocol:

          9. Radiation, if discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to treatment under this protocol
             Chemotherapy, if discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to treatment under this protocol,
             and at least 6 weeks prior to treatment under this protocol for prior nitrosurea or
             mitomycin-C treatment

         10. Hormonal therapy for cancer, if discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to treatment under
             this protocol

         11. Other investigational drugs, if discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to treatment under
             this protocol

         12. Surgery, if minor surgery occurred at least 2 weeks prior to treatment under this
             protocol, or at least 4 weeks since major surgery

         13. Patient must be able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.

         14. Women of childbearing potential (WCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test within 7 days prior to baseline. In addition, sexually active WCBP must agree to
             use adequate contraceptive methods (oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal
             contraceptive; tubal ligation; intra-uterine device; barrier contraceptive with
             spermicide; or vasectomized partner).

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months, unstable angina,symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, or other significant uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia.

          2. Cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, pulmonary embolism, deep vein
             thrombosis or other significant thromboembolic event in the previous 6 months.

             acquired-immunodeficiency-syndrome (AIDS)-related illness.

             neurologically stable.

          5. Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality or psychiatric illness that
             would prevent the patient from signing the informed consent or limit survival to less
             than 3 months.

          6. Pregnant or nursing females.Female patients of childbearing potential who are
             unwilling to use reliable contraceptive methods.

          7. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which in the
             opinion of the Investigator places the patient at unacceptable risk if he/she were to
             participate in the study.
