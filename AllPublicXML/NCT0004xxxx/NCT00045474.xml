      RATIONALE: Brachytherapy uses radioactive material to kill cancer cells remaining after
      surgery.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of brachytherapy in treating patients who
      have recurrent malignant glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of brachytherapy using an intracavitary applicator
           and liquid iodine I 125 in patients with recurrent malignant glioma.

        -  Determine the acute and chronic toxicity of this therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Within 3-21 days after surgical resection, patients receive brachytherapy using an
      intracavity balloon application (GliaSite) with iodine I 125 solution for a total of 5-7
      days.

      Cohorts of 5-10 patients receive escalating doses of brachytherapy until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at
      least 2 of 10 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 2 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
