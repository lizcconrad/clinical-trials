  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The monoclonal antibody J591 is being investigated as therapy for patients with prostate
      cancer, in combination with recombinant interleukin-2 (Proleukin, Aldesleukin). The study is
      an open-label, non-randomized phase II study for patients with documented hormone refractory
      prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this Phase II, open label study, patients will receive daily low-dose subcutaneous rIL-2
      (1.2 x 10^6 IU/m^2/day) continuously beginning on day 1. Patients will receive 3 weeks of
      IL-2, and on day 22 will receive the monoclonal antibody huJ591 via I.V. (25mg/m^2) for 3
      consecutive weeks. Il-2 will be continued for 2 additional weeks for a total of 8 weeks. The
      8 week regimen will constitute 1 cycle of therapy. Patients who have responded to therapy or
      have stable disease will be eligible for additional cycles of therapy.
