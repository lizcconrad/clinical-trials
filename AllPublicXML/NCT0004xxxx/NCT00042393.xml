  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this early access protocol is to provide access to adefovir dipivoxil prior to
      its commercial availability to people with lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B who have
      limited treatment options.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the considerable unmet medical need of patients with chronic hepatitis B, Gilead has
      initiated an early access program to make its investigational drug, adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg,
      available to those patients with lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B at risk of disease
      progression. Protocol GS-01-550 provides access to patients with lamivudine-resistant
      hepatitis B virus who are in need of an alternative treatment to suppress HBV DNA replication
      and prevent progressive liver disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. =/&gt; 16 years of age (or minimum age required in a given country).

          2. Prior lamivudine therapy for a cumulative period of &gt; 24 weeks or genotypic evidence
             of lamivudine resistance.

          3. Clinical evidence of lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B defined as positive serum
             hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA greater than or equal to 10^6 copies/mL (PCR assay) and
             ALT greater than or equal to 1.2 X upper limit of normal (ULN) within 4 weeks of
             screening despite ongoing therapy with lamivudine.

          4. Treating physician feels that the patient is at risk for disease progression.

          5. Screening laboratory values measured as follows, within 28 days prior to the baseline
             visit:

               -  Adequate hematologic function.

               -  Absolute neutrophil count =/&gt; 750/mm3, platelets =/&gt; 50,000/mm3, hemoglobin =/&gt;
                  7.5 g/dL.

          6. Females of childbearing potential must have had a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test during the screening period. Females must use effective method(s) of
             contraception during heterosexual intercourse while on adefovir dipivoxil and at least
             30 days following treatment discontinuation.

          7. Able to understand and sign the informed consent prior to undergoing study procedures
             and able to comply with the requirements of the study.

          8. Patients co-infected with HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), or other viral infections will
             be eligible to participate provided they meet all other entry criteria.

        Patients who do not meet these entry criteria but for whom the treating physician believes
        that chronic hepatitis B disease progression or premature death is likely to occur in the
        absence of early access to adefovir dipivoxil will be considered on a case-by-case basis by
        the Parexel medical monitor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with any serious or active medical or psychiatric illness that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would interfere with patient treatment, assessment, or
             compliance with the protocol or dosing requirements.

          2. Patients with hypersensitivity to any of the components of the drug product.

          3. Currently receiving nephrotoxic drugs (with the exception of cyclosporine or
             tacrolimus in patients post liver transplantation) such as aminoglycosides (e.g.,
             amikacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, netilmicin, streptomycin, tobramycin),
             conventional amphotericin B, intravenous (IV) vancomycin, cidofovir, IV foscarnet,
             cisplatin, or IV pentamidine OR competitors of renal excretion such as probenecid and
             sulfinpyrazone. These agents must be discontinued at least 7 days prior to starting
             treatment with adefovir dipivoxil.

          4. Currently enrolled in another clinical trial of adefovir dipivoxil.

          5. HIV and HBV co-infected patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [Viread(R)]
             for their HIV disease.

          6. Pregnant or lactating females.
