      Study Plan: Adult cancer patients who have a low risk profile and present with DVT will
      receive dalteparin 200 IU/kg subcutaneously daily (based on actual body weight with a maximum
      dose of 18,000 IU). Eligible patients who have signed the informed consent will be instructed
      on injection technique, will give themselves their first subcutaneous injection under
      supervision of the physician or the nurse and will be observed for a minimum of 1-2 hours
      prior to discharge. Patients may be admitted to an observation unit for up to 24 hours prior
      to discharge if medically necessary. Those patients without complications during the
      observation period will be given discharge instructions and an outpatient schedule to see one
      of the physician investigators daily for their subcutaneous injection of dalteparin, routine
      lab work and initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy.

      Patients that are proficient in administering their own injection with dalteparin will be
      evaluated every other day by the physician investigator. On days of home injection, the study
      nurse will call the patient to check on the patient's status and to remind the patient of
      his/her daily injection. Patients will undergo a physical examination every other day by the
      physician investigator directed towards the clinically affected areas until a therapeutic
      response (INR 2-3) on oral warfarin has been achieved or the patient's clinical condition
      warrants modification of therapy with or without hospitalization. Patients will remain on
      study for a minimum of 5 days with at least 1 day of therapeutic oral anticoagulation.

      The quality of life of the patients enrolled will be assessed by using the Modified Medical
      Outcome Study Short Form-20. An adapted version of the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist will be
      used to specifically assess patients with thrombosis. Patients will complete these two
      instruments at study entry, day 3, day 5 and at the end of study if different from day 5.
