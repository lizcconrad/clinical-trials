  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ISIS 104838 is an antisense oligonucleotide drug that reduces the production of a specific
      protein called tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), a substance that contributes to joint pain
      and swelling in rheumatoid arthritis. ISIS 104838 works by blocking TNF-alpha messenger RNA,
      the &quot;instruction&quot; molecule that is required for the production of TNF-alpha protein. This
      trial will assess the safety and efficacy of ISIS 1048383 by subcutaneous injection,
      administered by 3 different dosing regimens for 3 months, versus placebo. Approximately 160
      TNF-alpha inhibitor-na√Øve rheumatoid arthritis patients will be evaluated at 32 sites in the
      U.S. and Canada.
