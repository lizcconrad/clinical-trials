      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not
      yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating
      extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare different chemotherapy regimens in treating
      patients who have extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with chemotherapy-naive extensive stage small
           cell lung cancer treated with cisplatin and oral topotecan vs cisplatin and etoposide.

        -  Compare the response rates, response duration, and time to progression in patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the tolerability of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the patient-perceived disease status and well being in patients treated with
           these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to gender, ECOG performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2), lactate dehydrogenase (less than
      1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) vs 1.5 times ULN or greater), and country. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral topotecan once daily on days 1-5 and cisplatin IV on day 5.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin IV on day 1 and etoposide IV over at least 30 minutes
           on days 1-3.

      Treatment in both arms repeats every 21 days for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, prior to each course, at 4 weeks after study, and
      then every 4 weeks for 16 weeks.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, every 4 weeks for 16 weeks, and then every 3 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 760 patients (380 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 18 months.
