      RATIONALE: Radiolabeled octreotide can locate tumor cells and deliver radioactive
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is to study the safety and effectiveness of radiolabeled
      octreotide in treating children who have advanced or refractory solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90-DOTA-tyr3-octreotide in children
           with advanced or refractory somatostatin receptor-positive tumors.

        -  Determine the short-term and long-term safety and the serious adverse-event profiles of
           this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine any potential antitumor effect of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate level of somatostatin receptor type 2 expression with response in patients
           treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive yttrium Y 90-DOTA-tyr3-octreotide IV over 5-10 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 6 weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of yttrium Y 90-DOTA-tyr3-octreotide until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed weekly after each treatment course, 6 weeks after the last course, and
      then every 6 months thereafter for life.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-35 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Dose escalation will proceed so that the single-cycle and three-cycle maximum tolerated doses of 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide can be determined. The initial dose of 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide to be administered is 30 mCi/m2 in each of three cycles. Dose escalation will proceed in 10 mCi/m2 intervals and will be permitted for the next cohort of subjects pending completion of Cycle 3 by 2 members of the previous cohort with no DLTs. A DLT is defined as a Grade 3 renal toxicity, Grade 4 bone marrow toxicity, or any other Grade 3 toxicity whether or not related to study drug and regardless of duration. Lymphopenia will not be used to define a DLT.</description>
