      The purpose of our study is to identify gene(s) involved in the cause of childhood absence
      epilepsy (CAE).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A high familial predisposition for epilepsy in patients with childhood absence epilepsy
      (CAE), also called petit mal epilepsy, suggests underlying genetic causes contributing to the
      disease. Several areas harboring potential absence epilepsy genes have been identified in the
      genome.

      This study will further narrow down those areas and identify gene(s) involved in the cause of
      CAE by taking several approaches: 1. Comparing patients with CAE to healthy individuals
      without epilepsy and 2. Investigating whole families with many members affected with
      epilepsy).

      Participation in this study requires an interview regarding medical and family history and
      saliva (spit) collection from all available family members of families with many epilepsy
      cases. For those families without a history of epilepsy, parents and children are asked to
      provide a small amount of saliva only. Healthy volunteers without epilepsy or a family
      history of seizures are asked to fill out an anonymous questionnaire and provide a small
      amount of saliva as well.

      Although the study is based at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, all study
      materials can be sent to your home at no cost to participants or their insurance. For the
      collection of saliva, special containers are provided and they can be shipped back to Mount
      Sinai in the pre-paid envelope provided. Study materials can be completed at your
      convenience.

      Results from this study may enable scientists to understand the cause of absence seizures
      and, perhaps, other types of seizures as well and with this laying the foundation for better
      diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy patients in the future.
