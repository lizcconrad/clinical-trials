  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the effects of fast paced assembly line work on women. We are studying
      problems women in poultry processing have with their muscles, tendons, and nerves as well as
      acute injuries they have in the workplace. We are also studying how their work affects the
      quality of their lives.
