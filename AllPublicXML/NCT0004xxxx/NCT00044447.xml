        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have given their signed informed consent.

          -  Males or females between 18 and 80 years old. Female patients must be surgically
             sterile, post-menopausal, or using an accepted method of birth control (i.e., oral
             contraceptives, intrauterine device, Norplant® system, Depo Provera®, or a spermicide
             and condom). Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test and be advised not to become pregnant during the study.

          -  At least 1 year history of NIDDM and performing home blood glucose monitoring.

          -  Patients must have BMI of &gt; 26 to &lt; 42 kg/m2 at baseline (week 0).

          -  Patients must have HbA1C &gt; 7.5% but &lt; 9.5% at screen (week -4).

          -  Patients must have evidence of insulin secretory capacity (fasting C-peptide
             concentration &gt; or equal to 0.27 nmol/l during the stabilization period).

          -  Patients must have FPG &gt; 130 mg/dl but &lt; 235 mg/dl prior to (within 48-72 hours)
             randomization at Visit 1 Week 0.

          -  Patients must be receiving as their current diabetic therapy stable doses of metformin
             (at dose of 1.0-2.5gm/day), or metformin extended release at a maximum dose of 2
             gm/day and a half maximum to a maximum dose of thiazolidinedione for at least 3
             months.

          -  Patients must be able to understand and willing to adhere to and be compliant with the
             study protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who require insulin therapy or are currently on other sulfonylureas.

          -  Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to sulfonylureas.

          -  Patients with past history of severe hypoglycemia reaction on their current
             antidiabetic therapy requiring medical attention.

          -  Patients with a history of acute metabolic complications such as hyperosmolar coma or
             ketonuria.

          -  Patients with clinically significant abnormal baseline laboratory values (hematology,
             blood chemistry or urinalysis) which define a disease or condition, which in the
             opinion of the investigator may either put the patient at risk because of
             participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study, or the
             patient's ability to participate and complete the study. Should there be a laboratory
             value which, upon initial screening, is substantially outside the normal range, the
             test should be repeated.

          -  Patients who had an increase in their thiazolidinedione medication within 2 months of
             entering the study (Visit 0).

          -  Patients who had an increase in the metformin medication within 1 month of entering
             the study (Visit 0).

          -  Patients whose body weight has changed more than 2% for patients &lt; 250 pounds or 3%
             for patients &gt;= 250 pounds, during the 4 week stabilization period when compared to
             the weight at the screening visit 0 (week - 4).

          -  Patients with acute infections.

          -  Patients who have received any drug (i.e. a chemotherapy agent) with a well-defined
             potential for toxicity to a major organ system during the three months prior to the
             study.

          -  Patients with clinically significant renal or hepatic disease (i.e. ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper
             limit of normal) or gastrointestinal disorders that may interfere with absorption of
             the study drugs.

          -  Patients who are allergic to sulfonamides and excipients.

          -  Patients with any history of alcohol or drug abuse.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females will be excluded.

          -  Patients with a history of psychosis, emotional or intellectual problems that could
             impair the ability of the patient to participate in the study or to complete the
             study.

          -  Patients who have participated in any investigational study within 30 days prior to
             Visit 0.
