  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical research study is to determine whether abatacept treatment on a
      background of Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) will relieve the symptoms of
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in participants who are currently receiving anti-tumor necrosis
      factor (TNF) therapy for at least 3 months and are not responding or have taken anti-TNF
      therapy in the last 3 months and did not respond. The safety of treatment with abatacept will
      also be evaluated. This study also has a 4.5-year long-term extension beginning 6 months
      after the start of the study.

    <description>The validated 12-it3em Medical Outcomes Study sleep questionnaire (MOS-sleep) was used to measure sleep quality. An overall Sleep Problem Index (SPI) was generated as a summary measure of different types of sleep problems (sleep disturbance, sleep quantity, sleep adequacy, etc.). The score ranges from 0 to 100 with a higher score reflecting more severe problems with sleep. The mean score of the SPI in a population with chronic problems is 29.</description>

          <title>Abatacept (ABA)</title>
          <description>Participants with active RA who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this study were randomized to receive abatacept on a background of DMARDs. Participants must have been treated with anti-TNF therapy for at least 3 months and designated as anti-TNF therapy failures due to inadequate efficacy. Participants weighing &lt; 60 kg received 500 mg, participants weighing 60 kg to 100 kg received 750 mg, and participants weighing &gt; 100 kg received 1 gram. Study medication was administered on Days 1, 15, 29 and every 28 days thereafter for a total of 7 doses. Each dose was infused intravenously over approximately 30 minutes.</description>

          <description>All participants who completed the double-blind period were eligible to continue in the open-label period. At the beginning of the open-label period (Day 169), all eligible participants were re-allocated to a 10 mg/kg weight-tiered dose of abatacept at their enrollment visit into the open-label period, based on their entry weight into the study. Participant dose was adjusted based on annual anniversary weight. Participants weighing &gt; 100 kg received 1 g, participants weighing ≥ 60 kg and ≤ 100 kg received 750 mg, and participants weighing &lt; 60 kg received 500 mg on a background of DMARDs (at discretion of the investigator). Concomitant biologic RA therapies were later excluded.</description>

        <description>The disability section of the full HAQ includes 20 questions to assess physical functions in 8 domains: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common activities. The questions are evaluated on a 4-point scale: 0=without any difficulty, 1= with some difficulty, 2= with much difficulty, and 3= unable to do. Higher scores= greater dysfunction. A disability index was calculated by summing the worst scores in each domain and dividing by the number of domains answered. Clinically meaningful HAQ response=an improvement of at least 0.3 units from baseline in HAQ disability Index.</description>

        <description>HAQ-DI is a self-administered questionnaire composed of 20 questions assessing physical function in 8 domains: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common activities. Questions are evaluated on a 4-point scale: 0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, and 3=unable to do. The HAQ-DI is the weighted sum of the scale scores, with higher scores indicating poorer function.

          <description>CRP is an acute phase reactant protein that is a clinical marker for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and a core component of the ACR scoring system. CRP was evaluated from serum samples. Increasing levels of CRP indicate increasing level of disease. For each post-baseline visit in the DB, time-matched baseline CRP values were presented and represent the mean baseline value for only that cohort of participants with assessments available at that visit.</description>

        <description>Rheumatoid factor (RF or RhF) is an autoantibody (antibody directed against an organism's own tissues) most relevant in rheumatoid arthritis. It is an antibody against the Fc portion of Immunoglobulin (Ig)G, which is itself an antibody. RF and IgG join to form immune complexes which contribute to the disease process. A positive value for RF was &gt;20 IU/mL; a negative value for RF was ≤ 20 IU/mL.</description>

        <description>SF-36 is a validated instrument measuring health-related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores: PCS=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health; MCS=vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For subscores and summary scores, 0 =worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. Mean BL value presented represents a time-matched Day 85 BL value for only that cohort of participants with data available at that visit.</description>

It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores: PCS=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health; MCS=vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For both, 0=worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. Change from Baseline= Post-baseline value – time-matched baseline value, where time-matched BL value = the mean BL value for only that cohort of participants with data available at Day 85.</description>
          <population>Analysis was carried out on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population defined as all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication. Two participants were unevaluable for response due to each missing 2 infusions of study drug. N=Number of Participants Analyzed, n=number of participants at visit</population>

        <title>DB; Mean Baseline SF-36 PCS, MCS, and SF-36 Individual Component Scores For Participants With Measurements at Day 169</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a validated instrument measuring health-related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores: PCS=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health; MCS=vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For subscores and summary scores, 0 =worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. Mean BL value presented represents a time-matched Day 169 BL value for only that cohort of participants with data available at that visit.</description>

        <title>DB; Mean Baseline HAQ-DI and HAQ Component Scores in Participants With Assessments at Day 169</title>
        <description>The HAQ DI is a self-administered questionnaire composed of 20 questions to assess physical functions in 8 domains: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common activities. Questions are evaluated on a 4-point scale: 0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do. HAQ-DI is a weighted sum of the scale scores, with a higher score indicating poorer function. The mean baseline value presented represents a time-matched Day 169 baseline value for only that cohort of participants with assessments available at that visit.</description>
        <time_frame>BL</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis was carried out on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population defined as all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication. Two participants were unevaluable for response due to each missing 2 infusions of study drug. N=Number of Participants Analyzed, n=number of participants at visit</population>

Participants must have been treated with anti-TNF therapy for at least 3 months and designated as anti-TNF therapy failures due to inadequate efficacy. Participants weighing &lt; 60 kg received 500 mg, participants weighing 60 kg to 100 kg received 750 mg, and participants weighing &gt; 100 kg received 1 gram. Study medication was administered on Days 1, 15, 29 and every 28 days thereafter for a total of 7 doses. Each dose was infused intravenously over approximately 30 minutes.</description>

        <title>DB; Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline to Day 169 in HAQ-DI and HAQ Component Scores in Participants With Assessments at Day 169</title>
        <description>HAQ DI is a self-administered questionnaire composed of 20 questions to assess physical functions in 8 domains: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common activities. Questions evaluated on a 4-point scale: 0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do. HAQ-DI=weighted sum of the scale scores. Higher score indicates poorer function.Change from BL = Post-BL value – time-matched BL value, where the time-matched BL value represents the mean BL value for only that cohort of participants with data available at Day 169.</description>
        <time_frame>BL, Day 169</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis was carried out on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population defined as all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication. Two participants were unevaluable for response due to each missing 2 infusions of study drug. N=Number of Participants Analyzed, n=number of participants at visit</population>

            <description>Participants with active RA who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this study were randomized to receive abatacept on a background of DMARDs. Participants must have been treated with anti-TNF therapy for at least 3 months and designated as anti-TNF therapy failures due to inadequate efficacy. Participants weighing &lt; 60 kg received 500 mg, participants weighing 60 kg to 100 kg received 750 mg, and participants weighing &gt; 100 kg received 1 gram. Study medication was administered on Days 1, 15, 29 and every 28 days thereafter for a total of 7 doses. Each dose was infused intravenously over approximately 30 minutes.</description>

        <description>The DAS28 is a continuous disease measure which is a composite of 4 variables: the 28 tender joint count, the 28 swollen joint count, ESR or CRP levels, and participant assessment of disease activity measure on a visual analogue scale. The DAS28 has numeric thresholds that define high disease activity (&gt; 5.1), low disease activity (&lt; 3.2) and remission (&lt; 2.6). A clinically significant response= decrease in DAS28 score of &gt;1.2 from baseline. The mean BL value presented represents a time-matched Day 169 BL value for only that cohort of participants with assessments available at that visit.</description>

        <description>ACR 20/50/70 response requires a participant to have a 20/50/70% reduction in the number of swollen and tender joints, and a reduction of 20/50/70% in three of the following five parameters: physician global assessment of disease, participant global assessment of disease, participant assessment of pain, C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and degree of disability in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score. A participant achieved a sustained ACR 20/50/70 response if the participant had ACR 20/50/70 observed for at least 2 consecutive study visits.</description>

        <description>The DAS28 is a continuous disease measure which is a composite of 4 variables: the 28 tender joint count, the 28 swollen joint count, ESR or CRP, and participant assessment of disease activity measure on a visual analogue scale. The DAS28 has numeric thresholds that define high disease activity (&gt; 5.1), low disease activity (&lt; 3.2) and remission (&lt; 2.6). A clinically significant response= decrease in DAS28 score of &gt;1.2 from baseline.</description>

        <description>The DAS28 is a continuous disease measure which is a composite of 4 variables: the 28 tender joint count, the 28 swollen joint count, ESR or CRP levels, and participant assessment of disease activity measure on a visual analogue scale. The DAS28 has numeric thresholds that define high disease activity (&gt; 5.1), low disease activity (&lt; 3.2) and remission (&lt; 2.6). Time-matched baseline values were presented by visit and represented the mean baseline value for only that cohort of participants with data available at that visit.</description>

        <title>OL; Mean Time-matched Change From Baseline in DAS28 (CRP) Over Time For Participants Treated in the OL</title>
        <description>DAS28 is a continuous disease measure which is a composite of 4 variables: the 28 tender joint count, the 28 swollen joint count, ESR or CRP, and participant assessment of disease activity measure on a visual analogue scale.

          <population>Intent-to-treat (ITT) population: all randomized subjects receiving at least 1 dose of study drug. 2 participants were unevaluable for response due to each missing 2 infusions of study drug. N=total number of participants analyzed, n=the number of participants at time point with data. Mean time-matched BL values reflect changing n-values over time.</population>

        <title>OL; Mean Time-matched Change From Baseline in DAS28 (ESR) Over Time For Participants Treated in the OL</title>
        <description>DAS28 is a continuous disease measure which is a composite of 4 variables: the 28 tender joint count, the 28 swollen joint count, ESR or CRP, and participant assessment of disease activity measure on a visual analogue scale. The DAS28 has numeric thresholds that define high disease activity (&gt; 5.1), low disease activity (&lt; 3.2) and remission (&lt; 2.6). Time-matched mean change from baseline = Post-baseline value - time-matched baseline value, where the time-matched baseline value represents the mean baseline value for only that cohort of participants with data available at that visit.</description>

        <title>OL; Number of Participants Achieving HAQ Response Over Time In Participants Treated in the OL</title>
        <description>The HAQ disability index (HAQ DI) is a self-administered questionnaire composed of 20 questions to assess physical functions in 8 domains: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common activities. The questions are evaluated on a 4-point scale: 0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do. The HAQ disease index is a weighted sum of the scale scores, with a higher score indicating poorer function. Clinically meaningful HAQ response was defined as an improvement of at least 0.3 units from baseline in HAQ DI.</description>

        <population>Analysis was carried out on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population defined as all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication. Two participants were unevaluable for response due to each missing 2 infusions of study drug. N=Number of Participants analyzed, n=number of participants with measurements at visit.</population>

        <title>OL; Mean Time-matched Baseline HAQ-DI and HAQ Component Scores Over Time For Participants Treated in the OL</title>
        <description>The HAQ DI is a self-administered questionnaire composed of 20 questions to assess physical functions in 8 domains: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common activities. Questions are evaluated on a 4-point scale: 0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do. HAQ-DI is a weighted sum of the scale scores, with a higher score indicating poorer function. Time-matched baseline values were presented by visit and represented the mean baseline value for only that cohort of participants with data available at that visit.</description>

        <description>HAQ-DI is a self-administered questionnaire composed of 20 questions to assess physical functions in 8 domains:dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common activities. Questions evaluated on a 4-point scale: 0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do. HAQ-DI=weighted sum of the scale scores. Higher score indicates poorer function.Change from BL = Post-BL value – time-matched BL value, where the time-matched BL value represents the mean BL value for only that cohort of participants with data available at that visit</description>

            <description>Participants with active RA who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this study were randomized to receive abatacept on a background of DMARDs. Participants must have been treated with anti-TNF therapy for at least 3 months and designated as anti-TNF therapy failures due to inadequate efficacy. Participants weighing &lt; 60 kg received 500 mg, participants weighing 60 kg to 100 kg received 750 mg, and participants weighing &gt; 100 kg received 1 gram. Study medication was administered on Days 1, 15, 29 and every 28 days thereafter for a total of 7 doses. Each dose was infused intravenously over approximately 30 minutes.</description>

        <description>ESR, also called a sedimentation rate or Biernacki Reaction, is the rate at which red blood cells sediment in a period of 1 hour. It is a common hematology test that is a non-specific measure of inflammation.

        <description>SF-36 measures health-related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores:PCS=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health; MCS=vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For subscores and summary scores, 0 =worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. Time-matched baseline values were presented by visit and represented the mean baseline value for only that cohort of participants with data available at that visit.</description>

        <description>SF-36 measures health-related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores:PCS=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health; MCS=vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For subscores and summary scores, 0 =worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. Time-matched baseline values were presented by visit and represented the mean baseline value for only that cohort of participants with data available at that visit.</description>

        <title>OL; Mean Time-matched Change From Baseline in Bodily Pain Score Over Time For Participants Treated in the OL</title>
        <description>SF-36 measures health-related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores: PCS=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health; MCS=vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For both, 0=worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. Change from BL = Post-BL value – time-matched BL value, where the time-matched BL value represents the mean BL value for only that cohort of participants with data available at that visit.</description>

        <title>OL; Mean Time-matched Baseline Social Functioning Score Over Time For Participants Treated in the OL</title>
        <description>SF-36 measures health-related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores:PCS=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health; MCS=vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For subscores and summary scores, 0 =worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. Time-matched baseline values were presented by visit and represented the mean baseline value for only that cohort of participants with data available at that visit.</description>

        <title>OL; Mean Time-matched Change From Baseline in Role-Emotional Score Over Time For Participants Treated in the OL</title>
        <description>SF-36 measures health-related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores: PCS=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health; MCS=vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For both, 0=worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. Change from BL = Post-BL value – time-matched BL value, where the time-matched BL value represents the mean BL value for only that cohort of participants with data available at that visit.</description>

          <title>OL; Mean Time-matched Change From Baseline in Mental Health Score Over Time For Participants Treated in the OL</title>
          <description>SF-36 measures health-related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores: PCS=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health; MCS=vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For both, 0=worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. Change from BL = Post-BL value – time-matched BL value, where the time-matched BL value represents the mean BL value for only that cohort of participants with data available at that visit.</description>
          <population>Intent-to-treat (ITT) population: all randomized subjects receiving at least 1 dose of study drug. 2 participants were unevaluable for response due to each missing 2 infusions of study drug. N=total number of participants analyzed, n=the number of participants at time point with data. Mean time-matched BL values reflect changing n-values over time.</population>

        <description>Limitations on activities of daily living in the OL period at each study visit was measured by a 2-item questionnaire that was developed to collect data on the amount of time that a participant is unable to perform their usual activities because of their rheumatoid arthritis. The scale ranges from 0 to 100 with increasing score indicating increasing restrictions on levels of activity.</description>
