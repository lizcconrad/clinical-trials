        Disease Characteristics:

          -  Histologic or cytologic diagnosis or either, colonic, rectal, or breast carcinoma

          -  Measurable lesion diagnosed by CT scan

          -  Recurrent/metastatic disease considered surgically unresectable.

        Prior/Concurrent Therapy:

          -  Chemotherapy: Patients who either have failed at least one regimen of standard
             systemic therapy, or are clinically asymptomatic and are not presently being
             considered for chemotherapy (Enrollment must occur at least 4 weeks beyond last
             treatment)

          -  Other: Prior treatment with investigational agents is excluded unless follow-up is
             completed and patient is off study

        Patient Characteristics/Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Performance Status: Patients with a Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70% (or equivalent,
             ECOG 0-1) and expected survival of at least 3 months.

          -  Hematopoietic: WBC &gt;/= 3000 mm3, neutrophils &gt;/= 1500 mm3, platelets &gt;/= 75,000, CEA &lt;
             300 ng/mL

          -  Hepatic: Serum bilirubin &lt;/= 2.0 mg/dL, ALT &lt; 2.5 x IULN

          -  Cardiovascular: Patients with LVEF &gt;/= 40% by required MUGA/2D-ECHO study.

          -  Pulmonary: Patients with FEV1 &gt;/= 60% by required Pulmonary Function Tests

          -  Other: Patients agreeing to use a medically effective method of contraception during
             and for a period of 3 months after the treatment period. A pregnancy test will be
             preformed on each premenopausal female of childbearing potential immediately prior to
             entry into the study. Patients able to understand and give written informed consent.
             Patients with a significant concurrent medical condition that could affect the
             patient's ability to tolerate or complete the study.
