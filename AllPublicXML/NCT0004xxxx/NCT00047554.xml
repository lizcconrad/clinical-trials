      The purpose of this study was to monitor iris pigmentation changes over a 5-year period in
      patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. To be eligible for the study, these
      individuals must have experienced an iris pigmentation change while previously dosing with
      TRAVATAN.
