  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if the two different formulations of exemestane
      (Aromasin), oral and injectable, are equivalent in terms of pharmacodynamics and
      pharmacokinetics, i.e., if ultimately both formulations have the same efficacy in
      postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer who have failed previous antiestrogens
      therapy and are equally safe.
