  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major goal of this study is to determine the risks and benefits of bone marrow
      transplants in patients with severe thalassemia or sickle cell disease. Participation in this
      project will be for two years.

  <detailed_description>

      To do the bone marrow transplant, we must first kill the cells in the bone marrow that make
      the abnormal red blood cells that are found in patients with severe thalassemia or sickle
      cell disease.

      We will do this by using three drugs: busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and CAMPATH-1H. CAMPATH-IH
      is an investigational drug. CAMPATH-1H is used to prevent participants from rejecting or
      refusing to let the donor blood cells grow in the body. After the drug treatment,
      participants will be given bone marrow from a brother or sister who has healthy bone marrow
      that matches.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion:

          -  Patients with homozygous B0/+ thalassemia or severe variants of B0/+ thalassemia with
             an HLA genotypically identical donor.

          -  Patients with an HLA genotype identical donor and hemoglobin SS, hemoglobin SC, or
             hemoglobin Sb 0/+ and at least one of the following:

        Previous central nervous system vaso-occlusive episode with or without residual neurologic
        findings; Frequent painful vaso-occlusive episodes which significantly interfere with
        normal life activities and which necessitate chronic transfusion therapy; Recurrent SCD
        chest syndrome events which necessitate chronic transfusion therapy.

          -  Severe anemia which prevents acceptable quality of life and necessitates chronic
             transfusion therapy.

          -  The patient must have an HLA genotype identical donor.

          -  Between the ages of birth and 65 years.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test.

        Exclusion:

          -  Biopsy proven chronic active hepatitis or fibrosis with portal bridging.

          -  SCD chronic lung disease &gt;/= stage 3.

          -  Severe renal dysfunction defined as creatinine clearance &lt;40 ml/min/1.73 M2

          -  Severe cardiac dysfunction defined as shortening fraction &lt;25%.

          -  HIV infection.

          -  Severe but unspecified chronic toxicity serious enough to detrimentally affect the
             patient's capacity to tolerate bone marrow transplant (BMT).

          -  Inadequate intellectual capacity to understand the nature and risk inherent in the BMT
             process and give informed consent (in the case of minors, this criteria must be
             fulfilled by the legal guardian).

          -  Pregnant, lactating or unwilling to use appropriate birth control.
