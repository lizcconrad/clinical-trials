      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the patient's
      immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor
      are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red
      blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It is not yet known whether donor stem cell
      transplant is more effective with or without chemotherapy in treating primary myelodysplastic
      syndrome.

      PURPOSE: This phase III trial is studying how well donor stem cell transplant given with
      chemotherapy works and compares it with donor stem cell transplant without chemotherapy in
      treating children with primary myelodysplastic syndrome.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine, by a standard approach, the frequency of different FAB subtypes in children
           with primary myelodysplastic syndromes.

        -  Determine the frequency of cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities in these patients.

        -  Determine the survival of patients treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation
           with or without induction chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the rate of complete remission in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the event-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the relapse rate, morbidity, and mortality of patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Determine different subsets of patients who benefit from these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to FAB subtype
      (refractory anemia (RA) or RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) vs RA with excess blasts (RAEB)
      vs RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t) vs juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML)).

      Patients undergo complete medical and physical examination. Patients are screened for the
      following aberrations: -7, +8, +21, t(8;21), t(15;17), and inv(16). Smears of peripheral
      blood and bone marrow, as well as bone marrow biopsies and all cytogenetic and molecular
      studies performed on blood or bone marrow, are evaluated by a panel of international experts.

      Patients with progressive RA or RARS undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT)
      according to EWOG-MDS SCT studies. Patients with stable RA or RARS wait for an optimal donor
      before undergoing ASCT. Patients with RAEB with fewer than 15% bone marrow blasts undergo
      ASCT. Patients with RAEB with at least 15% bone marrow blasts and patients with RAEB-t with
      fewer than 30% bone marrow blasts receive standard acute myeloid leukemia (AML) induction
      therapy and then undergo ASCT. Patients with RAEB-t with at least 30% bone marrow blasts are
      considered for standard AML induction therapy.

      Patients with advanced JMML undergo evaluation for splenectomy and receive chemotherapy with
      mercaptopurine and cytarabine every 3-4 weeks (for 1-4 doses). Patients then undergo ASCT.

      Patients are followed every 6 months.
