  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, open-label, multicenter, randomized, comparative study of Campath versus
      chlorambucil as front line therapy in patients with progressive B-Cell Lymphocytic Leukemia
      (B-CLL). Eligible patients must have previously untreated, Rai stage I-IV disease, and be
      experiencing progression of their B-CLL requiring treatment. Patients who meet all
      eligibility criteria may be randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either Campath or
      chlorambucil. An estimated 284 patients (142 per treatment arm) from approximately 40 or more
      investigational sites will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms.

             clone.

          -  Rai Stage I through IV disease with evidence of progression as evidenced by the
             presence of one or more of the following:1. Disease-related B symptoms (fever of

             evidence of infection, night sweats without evidence of infection, weight loss &gt;10%
             within previous 6 months. 2. Evidence of progression marrow failure as manifested by:
             a. decrease in hemoglobin to &lt;11g/dL or b. decrease in platelet count to &lt;100x10 to
             the ninth/L within the previous 6 months or c. decrease in absolute neutrophil count
             (ANC) to &lt;1.0x10 to the ninth/L within the previous 6 months. 3. Progressive
             splenomegaly to &gt;2 cm below the left costal margin or other organomegaly with
             progressive increase over 2 consecutive clinic visits greater than or equal to 2 weeks
             apart. 4. Progressive lymphadenopathy with at least 5 sites of involvement with either
             two nodes at least 2cm in longest diameter or one node greater than or equal to 5cm in
             longest diameter with progressive increase over 2 consecutive visits greater than or
             equal to weeks apart. 5. Progressive lymphocytes with an increase of &gt;50% over a
             2-month period, or an anticipated doubling time of less than 6 months.
