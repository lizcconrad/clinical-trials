      RATIONALE: BAY 56-3722 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary
      for tumor cell growth.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of BAY 56-3722 in treating patients who
      have recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the tumor response rate of patients with recurrent, unresectable, or
           metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with BAY 56-3722.

        -  Determine the duration of response, time to progression, and survival of patients
           treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive BAY 56-3722 IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks
      for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-140 patients will be accrued for this study.
