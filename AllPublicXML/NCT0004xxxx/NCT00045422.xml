      RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. Imatinib mesylate
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth.
      Combining interferon alfa with imatinib mesylate may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining interferon alfa with imatinib
      mesylate in treating patients who have chronic myelogenous leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether interferon alfa in combination with imatinib mesylate adds to the
           hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular response rates in patients with chronic phase
           chronic myelogenous leukemia that is newly diagnosed or has not achieved a complete
           cytogenetic response to imatinib mesylate alone.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate (STI-571) once daily for 9 months. At 9
      months, patients with more than 35% Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) cells in bone
      marrow receive oral STI-571 twice daily for 3 more months. At 12 months, patients with more
      than 35% Ph+ cells in bone marrow receive oral STI-571 once daily and interferon alfa
      subcutaneously once daily. Treatment continues for at least 1 year in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with an appropriate HLA-matched donor may
      choose to have a bone marrow transplantation at any time during the study.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (60 without an HLA-matched donor and 20 with an
      HLA-matched donor) will be accrued for this study within 5 years.
