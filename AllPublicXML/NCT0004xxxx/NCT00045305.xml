      RATIONALE: Photopheresis treats the patient's blood with drugs and ultraviolet light outside
      the body and kills the white blood cells. Giving photopheresis, pentostatin, and radiation
      therapy before a donor bone marrow or stem cell transplant helps stop the patient's immune
      system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the
      patient's immune system and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor
      effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response
      against the body's normal cells. Giving pentostatin before transplant and cyclosporine or
      mycophenolate mofetil after transplant may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving pentostatin together with
      photopheresis and total-body irradiation work before donor bone marrow transplant in treating
      patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the complete response rate in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes treated
           with reduced-intensity allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, including photopheresis,
           total body irradiation, and pentostatin.

        -  Determine the disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the engraftment rate of donor cells in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the extent and duration of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a single-arm, two-stage, multicenter phase II study.

        -  Preparative Regimen: Patients undergo photopheresis using methoxsalen on days -7 and -6
           and receive pentostatin intravenously (IV )continuously on days -5 and -4. Total body
           irradiation is administered on days -3 and -2 for a total of 3 doses.

        -  Transplantation: Allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells are infused on
           day 0.

        -  Acute graft-vs-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV on days
           -1 to 30 and then orally every 12 hours. Cyclosporine dose is then tapered beginning
           after day 50 and continuing for 6 months in the absence of GVHD. Once cyclosporine dose
           is significantly decreased, oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is then administered twice
           a day. MMF dose is then tapered for 12 months in the absence of GVHD. Patients also
           receive methotrexate IV on days 1 and 3.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients would be accrued for this study within 2.1 years.

    <description>Completed response is defined as:
Bone marrow evaluation: Repeat bone marrow showing &lt; 5% myeloblasts with normal maturation of all cell lines, with no evidence for dysplasia (see dysplasia qualifier under peripheral blood evaluation).
Peripheral blood evaluation [absolute values must last at least 2 months] Hemoglobin &gt;11 g/dl (untransfused, not on erythropoietin) Neutrophils (1500/mm3 (not on a myeloid growth factor)) Platelets (100,000/mm3 (not on a thrombopoetic agent)) Blasts - 0% No dysplasia.

    <description>Disease free survival (DFS) was listed as a secondary endpoint in the study protocol, which would be assessed in patients who achieved complete response (CR). It was defined to be time from CR to documented progression or to death without progression. Patients without documented progression or death reported were censored at the time of last disease evaluation. However, due to the small number of patients with CR, the number of patients who developed disease progression was reported here.</description>

    <description>Preparative Regimen: Patients underwent photopheresis on two consecutive days and received pentostatin 4 mg/m2/d (total dose = 8 mg/m2) by continuous IV infusion on two consecutive days following photopheresis. Total body irradiation was administered on two consecutive days following pentostatin for a total of 600 cGy given in three 200 cGy fractionated doses.
Transplantation: Unmanipulated allogeneic bone marrow or G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cells were infused on day 0 within 48 hours of completion of TBI. Minimum cell dose was 2 ×106 CD34 cells/kg recipient.
Acute graft-vs-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients received Cyclosporine or Tacrolimus per institutional preference or protocol beginning no later than day -1. Methotrexate (MTX) was administered on day +1 and +3. Mycofenolate mofetil (MMF) was introduced on day 100 and could be tapered and discontinued after 12 months if no active cGVHD.</description>

          <description>Preparative Regimen: Patients underwent photopheresis on two consecutive days and received pentostatin 4 mg/m2/d (total dose = 8 mg/m2) by continuous IV infusion on two consecutive days following photopheresis. Total body irradiation was administered on two consecutive days following pentostatin for a total of 600 cGy given in three 200 cGy fractionated doses.
Transplantation: Unmanipulated allogeneic bone marrow or G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cells were infused on day 0 within 48 hours of completion of TBI. Minimum cell dose was 2 ×106 CD34 cells/kg recipient.
Acute graft-vs-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients received Cyclosporine or Tacrolimus per institutional preference or protocol beginning no later than day -1. Methotrexate (MTX) was administered on day +1 and +3. Mycofenolate mofetil (MMF) was introduced on day 100 and could be tapered and discontinued after 12 months if no active cGVHD.</description>

            <description>Preparative Regimen: Patients underwent photopheresis on two consecutive days and received pentostatin 4 mg/m2/d (total dose = 8 mg/m2) by continuous IV infusion on two consecutive days following photopheresis. Total body irradiation was administered on two consecutive days following pentostatin for a total of 600 cGy given in three 200 cGy fractionated doses.
Transplantation: Unmanipulated allogeneic bone marrow or G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cells were infused on day 0 within 48 hours of completion of TBI. Minimum cell dose was 2 ×106 CD34 cells/kg recipient.
Acute graft-vs-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients received Cyclosporine or Tacrolimus per institutional preference or protocol beginning no later than day -1. Methotrexate (MTX) was administered on day +1 and +3. Mycofenolate mofetil (MMF) was introduced on day 100 and could be tapered and discontinued after 12 months if no active cGVHD.
