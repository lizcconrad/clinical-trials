      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. O(6)-benzylguanine may increase the effectiveness of carmustine by
      making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining carmustine with
      O(6)-benzylguanine in treating patients who have newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma
      multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the activity of carmustine and O6-benzylguanine in patients with newly
           diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme not requiring immediate radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV over 1 hour followed approximately 1 hour later
      by carmustine IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for a maximum of 3
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are then
      referred for radiotherapy. Patients who demonstrate tumor response after completion of the
      third course of chemotherapy receive 6 additional courses after completion of radiotherapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-36 patients will be accrued for this study.
