      BACKGROUND:

      Venous thromboembolism is a common condition with considerable morbidity and mortality. The
      disorder has diverse causes including trauma, stasis, drugs, cancer, and genetic factors that
      contribute to enhanced clotting and coagulation. The study uses existing large-scale
      population studies to unravel factors responsible for and contributing to venous
      thromboembolism.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study design is a prospective cohort study of 77,118 persons based on pooling information
      from four large randomized trials of US health professionals that have collected detailed
      risk factor information and have used common strategies to prospectively identify and
      validate cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE). These trials are: Physicians' Health Studies
      I &amp; II including 29,071 US male physicians, of whom 22,071 have been followed since the
      initiation of the first trial in 1982; the Women's Health Study including 39,876 female
      health professionals who will have an average of 10 years of follow-up; and the Women's
      Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study including 8,171 female health professionals with prevalent
      cardiovascular disease or at high risk of cardiovascular disease who will have an average of
      8 years of follow-up. Archived blood samples were collected from approximately 75 percent of
      participants at baseline and will be used to assess biochemical and genetic markers of risk
      including factor V Leiden, the G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene,
      hyperhomocysteinemia, and anticardiolipin antibodies. The study will assess the joint
      association with risk of these markers and potentially modifiable factors including body mass
      index, hormone replacement therapy, physical activity, and aspirin use. The study population
      will include over 1,000 incident cases of VTE, including 750 with blood samples.
