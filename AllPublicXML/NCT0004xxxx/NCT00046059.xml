  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most common behavioral disorder in
      childhood, affecting 3-5% of children between the ages of 7 and 17. Family studies suggest
      that there is a genetic component to ADHD. Scientists believe that it is a complex disorder
      in which two or more genes may be involved.

      Potentially eligible families will be asked to give written consent to participate and will
      be asked to complete questionnaires for each member in the family. In addition, an interview
      will be administered to the parent of minors enrolled in the study to determine their
      eligibility for being in the study. This screening tool is computerized and will take
      approximately 45 minutes to administer per child.

      Once screenings are completed, a blood collection kit will be sent to the family to take to
      their local medical care provider, have blood samples drawn and sent to NIH. There is no cost
      to the family to participate. We would like to enroll entire families, with both parents and
      all children.

      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neuropsychiatric disorder
      affecting 5% of children worldwide. A study of the hypothesis that Attention Deficit

      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a genetically influenced brain disorder has been undertaken
      using a two armed approach: 1) Isolated population analysis from a large, extended pedigree
      study done in Colombia, South America in a population isolate called the Paisa have been
      studied for the last 7 years; and a recently added second isolated in USA from Amish
      population at Lancaster, Co Pennsylvania; with different background and environmental
      influences, and 2) a U.S. based study of nuclear families with at least one affected child
      and at least one sibling (either affected or unaffected), and their parents. Following
      careful phenotyping, DNA from blood samples from these two genetically different groups will
      be analyzed through a genomewide scan for linkage and positional candidate approach to search
      for genes associated with ADHD. In addition comparison of genetic-environment interactions
      will be done on these two different populations. Genetic influence are to modulate biological
      aspects in cognition and behavioral manifestations. The prefrontal cortex and its connections
      is known to play a very important role in the processing of emotions and impulsivity. It is
      considered the primary biological component of a brain circuit that would explain the main
      clinical characteristics present in ADHD phenotype. Measurement of brain metabolites in this
      region may be very useful in phenotyping ADHD. Thus, after identification of specific
      genotype implicated in ADHD risk in the Colombian population, in a subset of already
      recruited individuals, phenotyping will include proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H
      MRS) to detect biochemical phenotypes which may be correlated with genetic markers for ADHD.
      Additional analysis for potential genetic-environment interactions will be done to compare
      isolated populations in different environments. Identification of a biological marker to be
      used to support and confirm clinical diagnosis is highly desirable.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        This study will enroll families with the following characteristics:

          1. Families with children, seven through 17 years of age, diagnosed with ADHD (defined as
             the proband for the study).

          2. The probands siblings, either affected with ADHD (concordant) or unaffected
             (discordant), seven years of age and above, including adult siblings.

          3. The parents, both mothers and fathers, of enrolled probands.

          4. The study will enroll both male and female probands of any ethnic background and race.
             The prevalence of ADHD is higher in males than in females, so we would expect to have
             a higher number of male probands than female probands. Both male and female siblings
             and male and female parents of probands will be enrolled.

          5. Adults who are or may be unable to provide informed consent will be excluded.

          6. Probands with one parent affected with ADHD or with neither parent affected with ADHD
             are eligible. Probands from bilineal families, families with both parents affected
             with ADHD, will be excluded for statistical reasons.

        Additional inclusion criteria for the study include:

        1. Ability to read and understand spoken English, since the questionnaires, scales, and
        interviews that we have license to use in this study are in English.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Some conditions can confound the diagnosis of ADHD. Probands with the following conditions
        will be excluded from enrollment or will be withdrawn from the study if the condition is
        discovered subsequent to enrollment:

          -  Prematurity

          -  Neurological conditions

          -  Cardiac surgery

          -  Prenatal drug exposure

          -  Hydrocephaly

          -  Mental Retardation (IQ&lt;80)

          -  Known genetic syndromes

          -  Known CNS disorders

          -  Known lead toxicity

          -  Tourette Disorder

          -  Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

          -  Major Depression on both proband and affected sibling

          -  Pervasive Developmental Disorder

          -  Age under 7 years old

          -  Autism

          -  Other Psychoses

          -  Post Traumatic Stress Disorder

          -  Language Disorder (if known)

          -  Severe Sensory Impairment (visual and hearing)

        Probands with the following conditions may be included, but the conditions will be noted
        during statistical analysis:

          -  Oppositional Defiant Disorder

          -  Conduct Disorder

          -  Tic Disorder

          -  Obsessive/Compulsive Symptoms

          -  Anxiety/Phobias

          -  Learning Disabilities
