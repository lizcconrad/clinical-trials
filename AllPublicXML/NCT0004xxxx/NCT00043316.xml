      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Interferon
      gamma-1b (IFN-g 1b) on lung function when given to patients with cystic fibrosis by
      inhalation (breathed into the lungs) three times a week for 12 weeks.

      The FDA has not approved Interferon gamma-1b for use with cystic fibrosis patients, which is
      the condition being examined in this study.
