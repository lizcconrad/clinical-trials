  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the effect in blood sugar control between Lantus and
      twice daily intermediate acting insulins (NPH or Lente) when used as the basal insulin in a
      multiple daily injection setting with fast acting insulin (Lispro)
