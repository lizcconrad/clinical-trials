          -  Presence of moderate to severe erythema.

          -  Presence of telangiectasia.

          -  Female patients must utilize one of the following methods of birth control throughout
             the study: IUD, diaphragm, a condom plus the use of a spermicidal gel or foam, oral
             contraceptives (provided patient has been utilizing this method for at least 4 months
             prior to baseline and has not changed the brand within this period). Patients may also
             participate if they are surgically sterilized, in a monogamous relationship with a
             sterile partner, or sign an agreement that they will abstain from sexual intercourse
             during the course of a study.

          -  Patients must sign an informed consent form.

          -  Negative pregnancy test and non-lactating.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  The initiation of a hormonal method of contraception within 4 months of baseline; or
             discontinuation during the course of study; or change in the actual product within 4
             months of baseline or during the study.

          -  The use of topical acne treatments within 2 weeks of baseline.

          -  The use of systemic antibiotics within 4 weeks of baseline.

          -  The use of an investigational drug with 90 days of baseline.

          -  Pregnant women or women of child-bearing potential who are not using an adequate form
             of birth control as described in Item 4 of the Inclusion Criteria.

          -  Nursing women.

          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to tetracyclines.

          -  Patients on clinically significant, concomitant drug therapy (See section below).

          -  The use of any acne treatment during the course of the study.

          -  The use of topical steroids 6 weeks prior to baseline and during the study.

          -  The use of systemic corticosteroids 6 weeks prior to baseline and during the study.

          -  The use of vasodilators 6 weeks prior to baseline or during the study.

          -  The use of Î±-adrenergic receptor-blocking agents 6 weeks prior to baseline and during
             the study.

        Prohibited Medications:

             325 mg q.d.) may be used by those patient requiring platelet aggregation inhibitor.

          -  Penicillin antibiotics should NOT be used during the course of this trial since the
             bacteriostatic action of doxycycline may interfere with the bactericidal action of
             penicillins.

          -  Antacids and vitamins containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium may impair drug
             absorption and should be taken at least 1.5 hours before or 3.0 hours after taking
             study medication.
