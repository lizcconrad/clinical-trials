      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of oxaliplatin in treating children who
      have recurrent or refractory medulloblastoma, supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal or
      atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Estimate the objective response rate to oxaliplatin in pediatric patients with recurrent
           or refractory medulloblastoma at first progression.

        -  Estimate the objective response rate to oxaliplatin in pediatric patients with recurrent
           or refractory medulloblastoma at second or later relapse.

        -  Estimate the objective response rate to oxaliplatin in pediatric patients with recurrent
           or refractory supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor, or atypical teratoid
           rhabdoid tumor.

        -  Describe the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor type
      (medulloblastoma [measurable disease at first relapse vs positive cerebrospinal fluid or
      linear leptomeningeal disease vs measurable disease at second or later progression] vs
      supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor vs atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor).

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up
      to 17 courses (1 year) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 65 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5-2.8
      years.
