      To find out if it is safe and effective to use smoked marijuana in combination with opioids
      to treat cancer pain. The study will evaluate whether smoked marijuana, when used with
      opioids, will have an effect on pain relief, and to see if marijuana reduces the side effects
      of opioids, which include nausea and/or vomiting.
