  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ISIS 2302 is an antisense oligonucleotide drug that reduces the production of a specific
      protein called intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), a substance that plays a significant
      role in the increase of inflammation. People with Crohn's disease have been shown to
      over-produce ICAM-1 in their gut tissues. Alicaforsen works by blocking ICAM-1 messenger RNA,
      the &quot;instruction&quot; molecule that is required for the production of ICAM-1 protein. This trial
      will examine effects of alicaforsen delivered by 2-hour intravenous infusion over a four-week
      period, compared to a placebo. Patients may remain on stable background 5-ASA, antibiotic, or
      immunosuppressive drugs, and prednisone (or equivalent) at &lt;/= 30 mg per day.
