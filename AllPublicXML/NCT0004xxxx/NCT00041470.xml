      The purposes of this are:

        -  To determine the highest doses of Taxol and Navelbine that we can safely give to
           patients;

        -  To determine what kind of side effects are caused by the combination of Taxol, Navelbine
           and G-CSF;

        -  To determine whether the combination of Taxol, Navelbine and G-CSF is more effective
           than standard therapy in treating metastatic breast cancer and prolonging life;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Complete response (CR) in advanced breast cancer is an important predictor of improved
      survival. The largest experience reported with long-term follow-up in this regard is from
      M.D. Anderson Hospital, with a median survival of 33 months and 5-year survival of 19% among
      patients who achieved a CR with doxorubicin-based chemotherapy.19 We believe that our
      institutional experience to date indicates that CR rates in excess of 20% can be achieved in
      second-line chemotherapy from the combination of vinorelbine and a taxane, provided that
      G-CSF is given. For the reasons outlined, we believe that dose density is likely to be
      important for both classes of agents, but dose intensity may be most important for
      vinorelbine. Both paclitaxel and docetaxel can be given on a weekly schedule with some
      success, but it appears that myelosuppression is a more frequent dose-limiting toxicity on
      this schedule for docetaxel. For the current trial, we therefore propose to study weekly
      paclitaxel in combination with dose-intensive vinorelbine, utilizing continuous G-CSF support
      as in our prior studies. We believe that starting doses of 60 mg/m2 for paclitaxel and 20
      mg/m2 for vinorelbine will be well tolerated, but our experience to date, treating 3 patients
      off study at these doses without G-CSF support, indicates that some will require G-CSF even
      at this dose level: we observed grade 4 neutropenia in 2 of the 3. Our intention in this
      trial is to determine the optimal dose of these two agents when continuous growth factor
      support is provided. We will be starting at a ratio of 0.8 for vinorelbine and 0.75 for
      paclitaxel (assuming 80 mg/m2/week as a &quot;full&quot; dose for the later agent).

      It is now widely appreciated that patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors over
      express HER-2-neu demonstrate benefit from the addition of trastuzumab (Herceptin) to a
      chemotherapy program with paclitaxel as a single agent.20 Such patients will be allowed to
      receive trastuzumab in the standard dose and schedule (4 mg/kg loading dose, then 2
      mg/kg/week) given IV, in addition to paclitaxel and vinorelbine. Since trastuzumab does not
      produce myelosuppression or neuropathy (the anticipated dose-limiting toxicities for
      vinorelbine and paclitaxel, respectively), and neither of these agents combined separately
      with trastuzumab produces unusual or severe new side effects, this should not affect the dose
      escalation scheme for the chemotherapeutic agents.

             histologic slides and/or blocks available for review.

          -  Patient has had one or less prior regimens for metastatic disease. Prior paclitaxel by
             3, 24 or 96-hour infusion is permitted as long as it did not result in any neuropathy.
             Prior docetaxel on an every 3-week schedule is permitted.

          -  Measurable (bidimensionally) or evaluable disease.

          -  Age &gt; 18.

             treatment.

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 16 weeks.

          -  Prior irradiation is permitted, provided:

          -  Prior irradiation does not exceed 25% of the estimated bone marrow volume. (See
             Appendix I)

          -  Measurable/evaluable disease must exist outside the radiation field OR there must be
             histologic proof of progressive disease within a radiation field.

          -  Informed consent must be obtained prior to registration.

          -  Patients must be &gt; 2 weeks from prior surgery; &gt; 3 weeks from radiation therapy to the
             pelvis, spine or long bones; &gt; 3 weeks from prior chemotherapy (&gt; 6 weeks for
             mitomycin C or nitrosureas), or &gt; 2 weeks from prior hormonal therapy.

          -  All patients must have placement of appropriate central venous access device.

          -  Tumor HER2/neu expression must be determined prior to study enrollment. Assessment may
             be by fluorescence in situ hydridization (FISH) assay or by immunohistochemistry
             (ICC). If determination is intermediate by ICC, FISH must be performed. For enrollment
             purposes, the phase I portion of the study will not discriminate based on HER2 status.
             However, documentation of patients' HER2 status will be maintained and Herceptin will
             be prescribed for all HER2 positive patients. The phase II portion of the study will
             enroll 30 patients who are documented HER2 overexpressors and 30 patients who are
             non-overexpressors.
