      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of exatecan mesylate in treating patients
      who have advanced solid tumors and kidney dysfunction.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of exatecan mesylate in patients with advanced
           solid tumors and varying degrees of renal dysfunction.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting and non-dose-limiting toxic effects of this drug in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the effects of renal dysfunction on the plasma pharmacokinetics and
           pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Establish a model for dosing this drug in patients with impaired renal function.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      severity of renal dysfunction (normal vs mild vs moderate vs severe).

      Patients receive exatecan mesylate IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 3
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each renal dysfunction stratum receive escalating doses of
      exatecan mesylate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as
      the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
      Patients in the normal renal function stratum do not undergo dose escalation.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients (6 normal, 9 mild, 12 moderate, and 18 severe renal
      dysfunction) will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years.
