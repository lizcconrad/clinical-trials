  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest safe dose of the drug
      Bevacizumab that can be given in combination with chemoradiation for the treatment of
      pancreatic cancer. The effect that this combination treatment has on the tumor will also be
      studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study administers 50.4 Gy of radiation for unresectable pancreatic cancer with
      concurrent capecitabine and an experimental drug, Bevacizumab. The drug is an antiangiogenic
      agent (kills tumor blood vessels) and has been shown in preclinical models to enhance the
      antitumor effect of radiation and chemotherapy.
