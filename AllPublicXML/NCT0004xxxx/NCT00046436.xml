  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at how well the OraQuick HIV 1/2 Antibody rapid test works and how women
      accept being tested for HIV late in pregnancy and during labor. For women with positive test
      results, the study will look at whether or not these women accept anti-HIV drugs and which
      drugs they receive.

    <textblock>
      A simple HIV test design and easily interpretable, fast results are logistical advantages in
      clinical settings such as the labor and delivery unit. A fast test result means that a woman
      can make important choices about her and her baby's medical care before she delivers her
      baby. If a woman finds out she has HIV, she can decide to take antiretroviral drugs before
      delivery to decrease the risk of passing HIV to her baby. These advantages are also important
      for women with little or no prenatal care who present for care late in pregnancy, but may not
      be inclined to return for a standard test result or adhere to subsequent prenatal visits.

      Eligible women who elect to participate in this study will be enrolled in either the Late
      Presenter Group (women who are not in active labor, and for whom delivery is not imminent) or
      the Peripartum Group (women who are in active labor with anticipation of delivery within 24
      hours). Step I for all women will include rapid HIV testing with OraQuick HIV 1/2 and
      standard testing with enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (EIA) or Western blot. Women with a
      positive HIV test and their infants will be offered preventative antiretroviral therapy and
      enrollment into Step II. Step II will include clinical evaluations, laboratory evaluations,
      and an adherence assessment for the women and their infants. Women in the Late Presenter
      Group who participate in Step II will have one prenatal visit, a visit at labor and delivery,
      and three postpartum visits. Women in the Peripartum Group who participate in Step II will
      have three postpartum visits. All infants in Step II will have five study visits through 24
      weeks of age.

      All antiretroviral drugs will be obtained by prescription and will not be provided through
      this study.
