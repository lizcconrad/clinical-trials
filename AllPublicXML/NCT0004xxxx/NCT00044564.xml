  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with renal cell cancer, most frequent methods of treatment include surgery,
      chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and immunotherapy. Renal cell carcinoma is usually considered
      to be radioresistant and chemoresistant. In patients with metastatic disease, the options are
      limited. The taxanes are among the most commonly used class of chemotherapy agents in
      clinical oncology today but they are not effective in renal cancers; the development of Bay
      59-8862 targets taxane-resistant tumors and the current protocol is designed to test the
      safety and efficacy of Bay 59-8862 in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.
