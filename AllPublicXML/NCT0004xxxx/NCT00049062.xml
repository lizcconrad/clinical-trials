    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Anastrozole may fight
      breast cancer by blocking the production of estrogen by the tumor cells. Biological therapies
      such as ZD 1839 may interfere with the growth of the tumor cells and slow the growth of
      advanced solid tumors. Combining anastrozole with ZD 1839 may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining anastrozole with ZD 1839 in
      treating postmenopausal women who have metastatic breast cancer that has not responded to
      hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of anastrozole and ZD 1839, as measured by objective
           response (partial or complete) or stable disease at 6 months, in post-menopausal women
           with estrogen receptor-positive, hormone refractory, metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate molecular markers with clinical benefit in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients are stratified according to prior objective response to endocrine therapy (yes vs
      no).

      Patients receive oral anastrozole once daily alone for 2 weeks. Patients then receive oral
      anastrozole and oral ZD 1839 once daily for 28 days. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 month and then monthly thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36-78 patients (18-39 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study.
