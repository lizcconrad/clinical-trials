      To compare home use of an automatic external defibrillator (AED) to the use of local
      emergency medical system in treating survivors of sudden cardiac arrest.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND:

      Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) occurs every two minutes throughout the United States, with more
      than 70 percent occuring at home. Because survival falls 10 percent per minute over the first
      ten minutes, it is imperative to defibrillate as soon as possible. Public efforts cannot
      provide defibrillation fast enough in most cases. Physicians believe the initial shock is
      best done using readily available AEDs by family members who are only seconds from their
      loved one.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This study tests the central hypothesis that providing an AED for home use will improve
      survival beyond that achieved from the typical response to sudden cardiac arrest. An
      estimated 7,000 people who have had an anterior myocardial infarction will be randomly
      assigned to one of two groups: 1) a standard response to sudden cardiac arrest, entailing
      calling an emergency medical service (EMS) system and performing CPR, or 2) the addition of a
      home AED to the standard response. The standard response will be augmented and standardized
      by the provision of a video on how to respond to sudden cardiac arrest and how to perform
      CPR. The goal for the standard response will be immediate notification of EMS and prompt CPR.
      The goal for the AED group will be to shock the cardiac arrest victim up to three times
      immediately, if indicated by the AED, and call EMS and perform CPR as soon as possible and
      preferably within two minutes of collapse. Participants will be enrolled for more than two
      years and followed for an additional two years. The study will be performed at 200 cardiology
      clinics.
