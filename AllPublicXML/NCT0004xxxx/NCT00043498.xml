      A molecular epidemiologic study of African American and Hispanic mothers and newborns to
      investigate the role of common urban pollutants on procarcinogenic and developmental damage.

  <detailed_description>

      The major objective of the proposed research is to study the impact of early-life exposures
      to common urban pollutants on neurobehavioral development and asthma in a sample of children
      living in three low-income, minority communities of New York City (Central Harlem, Washington
      Heights and the South Bronx). Using a molecular epidemiologic approach with monitoring,
      biomarkers, and clinical assessments at serial time points, we will extend our study of
      African-American and Latina urban mothers and children in order to follow the cohort through
      child age 11 years to assess the longer-term impact of exposures on child health and
      developmental outcomes.

      We collected maternal urine during the third trimester of pregnancy, maternal blood at
      delivery, umbilical cord blood, meconium, blood and urine from the child at ages 24, 36, and
      60 months.

        The present study enrolled 727 African American and Latino (Dominican) mothers and their
        children. The African American and Latino (Dominican) women were initially enrolled into
        the parent CCCEH study during pregnancy. Caucasian women are not included because a central
        purpose of the research is to evaluate health outcomes in a high risk, minority population.

        Enrollment eligibility was restricted to nonsmoking pregnant women 18-35 years of age who
        self-identified as either African American or Dominican and who had resided in northern
        Manhattan or the South Bronx in New York City for at least 1 year before pregnancy. Women
        were excluded if they used illicit drugs, had diabetes, hypertension, or known HIV, or had
        their first prenatal visit after the 20th week of pregnancy.
