      The Healthy Environments Partnership was established in October 2000, as a part of the
      National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences “Health Disparities Initiative.” The
      Healthy Environments Partnership seeks to expand the knowledge base of how social and
      economic inequalities are linked to disparities in cardiovascular health among residents of
      Detroit. The Healthy Environments Partnership is a project of the Detroit Community-Academic
      Urban Research Center. The partners are: Brightmoor Community Center, Butzel Family Center,
      the Detroit Health Department, Friends of Parkside, Henry Ford Health System, Southwest
      Counseling and Development Services, Southwest Detroit Environmental Vision and University of
      Detroit Mercy and the University of Michigan School of Public Health, School of Nursing, and
      the Institute for Social Research.
