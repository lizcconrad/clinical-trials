    <textblock>
      The incidence of respiratory allergy in the US has increased gradually over the past several
      years, and current estimates suggest that allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma affect
      approximately 20% and 5% of the population, respectively. Rhinitis and asthma frequently
      coexist, and large-scale population surveys indicate that up to 38% of subjects with rhinitis
      have asthma, and up to 78% of subjects with asthma have chronic nasal symptoms. Safety
      concerns with the increased use of inhaled corticosteroids, the heterogeneity of the disease,
      and poor compliance with asthma medication regimens, point to the need for the development of
      safe and convenient oral therapies for asthma. Histamine is an important chemical mediator of
      inflammation in asthma. The benefits of antihistamine treatment in patients with mild to
      moderate asthma have been well documented, however their clinical use has been previously
      limited due to the high doses required for efficacy and their associated side effects
      including sedation and cognitive impairment.
