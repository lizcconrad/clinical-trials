      The Purposes of this Study are to determine:

      The safety of duloxetine and any side effects that might be associated with it.

      Whether duloxetine can help patients with major depression.

      It is possible that information collected during this study will be analyzed by the sponsor
      in the future to evaluate duloxetine for other possible uses or for other medical or
      scientific purposes other than those currently proposed.

      Duloxetine might not have any good effects for you.
