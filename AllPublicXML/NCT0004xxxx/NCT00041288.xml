      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
      Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed
      by chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Sometimes the transplanted cells are rejected by the
      body's normal tissues. Cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, and tacrolimus may
      prevent this from happening.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of fludarabine plus
      total-body irradiation with that of combination chemotherapy followed by donor peripheral
      stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the 1-year overall survival rate of patients with relapsed low-grade
           non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with fludarabine and
           total body irradiation vs cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by allogeneic
           peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and donor lymphocyte infusions.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in
           patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the 1-year treatment-related mortality and infectious complications in patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the efficacy of these treatment regimens, in terms of 1-year disease-free
           survival, of these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease, age (less than 55 vs over 55), and participating transplantation center. Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive fludarabine IV on days -4 to -2. Patients undergo total body
           irradiation followed by allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) on
           day 0. Patients receive graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis comprising oral
           cyclosporine twice daily on days -2 to 90 followed by a taper on days 90-150 and oral
           mycophenolate mofetil twice daily on days 0-28.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive fludarabine IV on days -6 to -2 and cyclophosphamide IV on days
           -3 to -2. Patients undergo PBSCT on day 0. Patients receive GVHD prophylaxis comprising
           methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11 and tacrolimus IV continuously and then orally
           on days -2 to 90 followed by a taper on days 90-150.

      At approximately day 180, patients with persistent disease, evidence of T-cell chimerism, and
      no GVHD may receive up to 3 donor lymphocyte infusions administered every 1-2 months.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 1 month, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6
      months for 1 year.

      Patients are followed at 1 month, every 3 months for 1 year, and then annually for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
