  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effectiveness in the maintenance of continuing adjunctive
      atypical antipsychotic medication compared to traditional mood stabilizer(s) alone in the
      maintenance treatment of adolescents with bipolar disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In children and adolescents, bipolar disorder is often accompanied by symptoms such as
      hallucinations, delusions, or paranoia that require acute treatment with a combination of an
      atypical antipsychotic medication and a mood stabilizer. It is not known if it is necessary
      to continue treatment with the atypical antipsychotic medication after the child's symptoms
      have remitted.

      Participants in this study are treated with lithium, divalproex (Depakote), and one of the
      following atypical antipsychotic medications: olanzapine (Zyprexa), risperidone (Risperdal)
      or quetiapine (Seroquel) for at least 24 weeks. Participants who have already begun
      combination therapy with at least one of the mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotic
      medications listed above are also encouraged to enroll in this study. After participants have
      been on combination therapy for at least 24 weeks they will then be randomly assigned to one
      of two groups. The first group will continue to receive active mood stabilizer and atypical
      antipsychotic medication. The second group will receive active mood stabilizer and placebo.
      Participants are assessed weekly and followed for up to 18 months.
