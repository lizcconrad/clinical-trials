      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining BMS-247550 with gemcitabine in
      treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicity, and safety of BMS-247550
           when combined with gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of this regimen in this patient population.

        -  Assess, preliminarily, any antitumor activity of this regimen in this patient
           population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of BMS-247550.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8 followed by BMS-247550 IV
      over 3 hours on day 8. The order of chemotherapy drug administration on day 8 is reversed
      during the second course only. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-247550 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 9 patients total
      are treated at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
