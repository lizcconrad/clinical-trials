      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining UCN-01 with fludarabine in
      treating patients who have relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or lymphocytic
      lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the overall response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic
           lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma treated with UCN-01 and
           fludarabine.

        -  Assess the molecular changes in CLL cells in peripheral blood in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of UCN-01.

      Patients receive UCN-01 IV over 3 hours on day 1 and fludarabine IV over 30-60 minutes on
      days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of UCN-01 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3
      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 18-46
      additional patients receive UCN-01 and fludarabine as above at the recommended phase II dose.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this
      study within 6 months. A total of 18-46 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of
      this study within 9-23 months.
