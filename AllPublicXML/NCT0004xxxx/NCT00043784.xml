                  least 2 contiguous leads

               -  Abnormal cardiac enzymes within the 24 hours before enrollment, defined as

          -  Angina from a secondary cause such as severe, uncontrolled hypertension (systolic
             blood pressure &gt;180 mm Hg despite treatment); anemia; valvular disease; congenital
             heart disease; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; restrictive or constrictive
             cardiomyopathy; thyrotoxicosis

          -  Thrombolytic therapy within the preceding 24 hours

          -  Other serious diseases, including severe liver disease or renal failure [creatinine
             clearance &lt;30 mL/min

          -  Treatment with other investigational agents or devices within the previous 30 days,
             planned use of investigational drugs or devices, or previous enrollment in this trial

          -  Inability to give informed consent or high likelihood of being unavailable for
             follow-up

          -  Not a candidate for intervention, (angiography or PCI)

          -  Treatment with a direct thrombin inhibitor or a low molecular weight heparin other
             than enoxaparin in the 7 days preceding enrollment.
