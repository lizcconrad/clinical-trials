      This study will determine whether the drug celecoxib (Celebrex® (Registered Trademark)) can
      help stabilize or improve vision in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) who
      are receiving photodynamic therapy, or PDT (also called cold laser treatment). The macula is
      the part of the retina in the back of the eye that determines central or best vision. AMD can
      severely impair central vision, affecting a person's ability to read, drive, and carry out
      daily activities. This vision loss is caused by the formation of abnormal new blood vessels
      in the choroid-a thin, pigmented vascular layer of the eye behind the retina-that leak blood
      under the macula. PTD stops the growth of these blood vessels and slows the rate of vision
      loss. However, the treatment usually does not cause vision to improve, and it has only a
      temporary effect, requiring several treatments over 2 years. Furthermore, PDT does not work
      in all patients and may actually cause some swelling and re-growth of blood vessels.
      Celecoxib is an anti-inflammatory drug that, in animal studies, has prevented the growth of
      abnormal blood vessels associated with tumors and with injury to the cornea. Thus, the drug
      might reduce swelling and prevent vessel re-growth in AMD, enhancing the effectiveness of
      PDT.

      Patients 55 years of age and older with AMD and visual acuity of 20/20 to 20/200 may be
      eligible for this study. Participants will be randomly assigned to take either celecoxib or a
      placebo (a look-alike pill with no active drug) twice a day and undergo the various tests and
      procedures detailed below. Not every examination will be done at every visit, but all may be
      required at one visit.

        -  Medical history and physical examination

        -  Blood drawing: A blood sample is drawn from an arm vein to evaluate liver and kidney
           function

        -  Eye examination: Visual acuity and eye pressure are measured, and the lens, retina,
           pupils and eye movements are examined

        -  Photography: Photographs of the eye are taken using a special camera with a bright flash

        -  Fluorescein angiography: Pictures of the retina are taken to look for abnormal blood
           vessels. A yellow dye is injected into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in
           the eyes. The retina is photographed using a camera that flashes a blue light into the
           eye. The pictures show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina,
           indicating possible blood vessel abnormality.

        -  Indocyanine green angiography: This procedure, similar to fluorescein angiography, uses
           a green dye to photograph the retina and identify portions of abnormal vessels in the
           deepest part of the retina.

        -  Optical coherence tomography: This new technique uses light to produce a 2-dimensional
           cross-sectional picture of the retina. The patient looks into a machine called an
           optical coherence tomograph at a pattern of flashing and rotating red and green lights,
           first with one eye and then the other.

      One week after starting the study medications, laser treatment will begin. For this
      procedure, a needle is placed in an arm vein and a chemical called verteporfin (Visudyne®
      (Registered Trademark)) is infused into the vein over 10 minutes. After 15 minutes, the eye
      is anesthetized with numbing drops. A special contact lens is then placed on the eye and the
      laser beam is directed to the eye for 83 seconds.

      Patients will be followed in the clinic every 6 weeks for 36 weeks for various examinations
      and possible re-treatment, if needed. Some patients will be asked to return 1 to 2 weeks
      after the first PDT for an eye examination and fluorescein angiography.

    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) represents the most common cause of blindness in
      patients over the age of 60. The major cause of vision loss in this disease is due to the
      development of choroidal neovascularization. Several clinical trials have shown that eyes
      with predominately 'well-defined' areas of neovascularization (lesions having at least 50% of
      vessels which can be readily demarcated with fluorescein angiography) can benefit from
      treatment with photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, this treatment benefit only results in a
      reduction in the number of patients who suffer severe vision loss. Few patients demonstrate
      an improvement in visual acuity. In addition, other neovascular lesions such as those with
      predominate occult (vessels that are difficult to outline by fluorescein angiography) or pure
      occult do not demonstrate any substantial treatment benefit.

      Histopathologic studies have demonstrated the presence of an inflammatory response in the
      retina of patients with choroidal neovascularization as well as in eyes receiving PDT. In
      addition, in eyes receiving PDT, a vascular remodeling and continued neovascular process
      occurs. Therefore, the use of celecoxib (Celebrex® (Registered Trademark)), a specific
      cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, which possesses both anti-angiogenic as well as anti-inflammatory
      properties, may be beneficial in patients with neovascular AMD undergoing PDT.

      The study will be organized as a double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective
      multi-center clinical trial to investigate the ability of celecoxib to alter the inflammatory
      and neovascular responses in AMD patients undergoing PDT. The results of this study will
      contribute to the design of a larger definitive clinical trial. The primary outcome measure
      is a drop of 15 letters or more in best corrected visual acuity following initial PDT
      treatment at 1 year. The secondary outcome measures are stabilization (drop of 4 letters of
      less from baseline) or improvement of best corrected visual acuity following initial PDT
      treatment at week 36, and an improvement by 5 or more letters in visual acuity from baseline
      to week 36, time to retreatment with PDT, number of retreatments with PDT and a change in the
      CNV size, the extent of leakage and staining detected by fluorescein angiography. Additional
      outcome measures will be the change in size and extent of vascular remodeling and choroidal
      new vessel formation as determined by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and high-speed
      indocyanine green angiography (HS-ICG).

        informed consent.

        Age greater than or equal to 50 years.

        In at least one eye, diagnosis of AMD defined by the presence of drusen larger than 63
        micro milli.

        The presence of choroidal neovascularization under the fovea determined by the Principal
        Investigator of each clinical site and defined as any one of the following fluorescein
        angiographic (FA) features:

          1. Early stippled hyperfluorescence of flat retinal pigment epithelium with ill-defined

             or bright hyperfluorescence in the early transit phase of the angiogram. Stippled
             hyperfluorescence may be present. Late frames may show persistent fluorescein staining
             or leakage within a sensory retinal detachment overlying this area (occult).

          3. Late phase leakage of undetermined source with leakage at the level of the retinal
             pigment epithelium in the late-frames of the angiogram in which the source of the late
             leakage cannot be determined from earlier-phase frames of the angiogram (occult).

          4. A well-demarcated area of bright hyperfluorescence in the early phase of the
             angiograpm with leakage through the mid- and late- phase frames which obscures the
