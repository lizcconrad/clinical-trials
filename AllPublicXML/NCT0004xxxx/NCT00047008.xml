      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Giving
      radiation therapy in different ways and combining it with chemotherapy before surgery may
      kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which radiation therapy regimen combined with
      chemotherapy with or without surgery is more effective for head and neck cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare two different radiation therapy regimens
      combined with cisplatin with or without surgery in treating patients who have stage III or
      stage IV head and neck cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare overall survival of patients with stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma of the
           head and neck treated with conventional vs accelerated radiotherapy and concurrent
           cisplatin with or without surgical resection.

      Secondary

        -  Compare local-regional control of disease and disease-free rates in patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Compare the acute and late toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare quality of life, perception of side effects, and performance status of patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine whether epidermal growth factor receptor and cyclo-oxygenase-2 expressions are
           independent prognostic markers in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor
      site (larynx vs other), nodal stage (N0 vs N1 or N2a or N2b vs N2c or N3), and Zubrod
      performance status (0 vs 1). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo standard fractionation radiotherapy 5 days a week for 7 weeks.
           Patients also receive cisplatin IV on days 1, 22, and 43.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo accelerated fractionation radiotherapy 5 days a week for 3.5
           weeks and then twice a day, 5 days a week, for 2.5 weeks. Patients also receive
           cisplatin IV on days 1 and 22.

      Patients with biopsy-proven relapsed disease more than 3 months after completion of therapy
      undergo surgical resection of the primary tumor.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, during one of the last 2 weeks of treatment, at 3
      and 12 months, and then annually for 4 years.

      Patients are followed at 6-8 weeks, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years,
      and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 720 patients (360 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3 years.

    <description>Radiation to the initial target volume encompassing the gross and subclinical disease sites will be delivered in 1.8 Gy per fraction, five fractions a week to 54 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks. At 32.4 Gy/18 Fx (i.e., latter part of week 4), the boost volume covering gross tumor and clinically/radiologically involved nodes will receive boost irradiation of 1.5 Gy/Fx as second daily fraction (at least 6 h interval) for a total of 12 treatment days (18 Gy total). The primary tumor and clinically/radiologically involved nodes will receive 72 Gy in 42 fractions over 6 weeks and uninvolved nodes will receive 54 Gy in 6 weeks. Clinically/radiologically negative posterior neck should receive a minimum dose of 50.4 Gy at 3 cm. The anterior lower neck field will be treated with 1.8 Gy per fraction at 3-cm depth to a total dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions in 5.6 weeks.</description>

    <intervention_name>Conventional surgery for select patients</intervention_name>
    <description>Surgical removal (salvage resection) of the primary tumor should be performed if biopsy-proven cancer remains more than three months after completion of therapy. The nature of the surgical resection should be dictated by the extent of tumor at the initial evaluation. The operation should be conducted using accepted criteria for primary surgical treatment of the cancer.
A planned neck dissection for patients with multiple neck nodes or with lymph nodes exceeding 3 cm in diameter (N2a, N2b, N3) is mandatory, regardless of the clinical and/or radiographic response. A neck dissection is required for patients with N1 disease if a palpable or worrisome radiographic abnormality persists in the neck six weeks after completion of therapy. Surgery should be performed within 2 weeks once the decision for neck dissection is made.</description>
