    <textblock>
      Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. This phase I trial is
      studying the side effects and best dose of combination chemotherapy in treating patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of flavopiridol (alvocidib) when administered with
      irinotecan hydrochloride, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium in patients with locally
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      II. Determine the clinical pharmacokinetics of fluorouracil when administered in this regimen
      in these patients.

      III. Determine, preliminarily, the therapeutic activity of this regimen in these
      patients.Correlate the role of p21 and Drg1 with apoptosis and treatment response in patients
      receiving this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alvocidib and fluorouracil (5-FU).

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes followed 5 hours later by
      leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and alvocidib IV over 1 hour immediately followed by 5-FU
      IV continuously over 48 hours beginning on day 1 of weeks 1, 3, and 5. Courses repeat every 6
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients
      receive escalating doses of alvocidib and 5-FU until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Ten additional patients are treated at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27-77 patients will be accrued for this study within 11-38
      months.
