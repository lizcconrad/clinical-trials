      The purpose of this clinical research study is to assess the safety and efficacy of an
      investigational therapy called DCVax(TM)-Prostate.

      Patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer are eligible if they have a rising PSA or
      three or fewer metastatic lesions. The experimental therapy uses a patient's own white blood
      cells and &quot;teaches&quot; the cells to recognize a &quot;flag&quot; on prostate cancer cells. This may help
      the immune system destroy prostate cancer cells. Side effects reported from the Phase I/II
      trial include skin reactions of redness, pain &amp; swelling at the injection site, and
      short-lived headache, fever &amp; fatigue. Full details are available in the informed consent.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) &amp;#8211; progressive disease despite androgen
             deprivation and serum testosterone &lt;50ng/dL; progression defined as either:

               1. Rising PSA over 6 months with at least a 50% increase between the 1st and 3rd
                  measurement, and the 3rd measurement &gt;2.0 ng/ml; or

               2. Progression of metastatic lesion on bone scan, or

               3. Progression of lymph node metastasis by CT scan.

          -  Zubrod or ECOG performance status of 0-1.

          -  Three or fewer bone metastases on a bone scan with minimal symptoms.

          -  No lymph node lesions greater than 3.0 cm at longest diameter.

          -  Adequate hematological, hepatic and renal function.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  History of other active malignancy.

          -  Prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunosuppressive or investigational therapy
             for metastatic disease in previous 12 months.

          -  Strong opioids, immunosuppressives, megestrol acetate or other estrogenic hormones
             (e.g., Saw Palmetto, PC-SPES) within 1 month prior to enrollment.

          -  Brain, liver, or lung metastases; uncontrolled heart, liver, lung, or renal diseases
             or other serious illness.

          -  Prior splenectomy.

          -  History of severe asthma, anaphylaxis, or other serious adverse reactions to vaccines
             or any of the antigens included in the skin test.

          -  History of moderate to severe lower limb lymphedema, or recent signs of deep venous
             thrombosis (DVT) or thrombo-embolic disease, or impending stroke.

          -  History of immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease; positive HIV, HbsAg or anti-HCV.

          -  Impending untreated spinal cord compression or urinary outlet obstruction.

          -  Any medication that might affect immune function. (Exceptions: Nonprescription doses
