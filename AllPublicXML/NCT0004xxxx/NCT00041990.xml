      To determine the safety and efficacy of decitabine in patients with Philadelphia
      chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia accelerated phase that were previously
      treated with imatinib mesylate (STI 571) and became resistant/refractory or were found to be
      intolerant to the drug.

        Inclusion:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of CML accelerated phase

          -  Ph chromosome-positive

          -  Previous treatment with imatinib mesylate resulting in:

             i) Hematologic Resistance / Hematologic Refractory: Based on a physician's
             (documented) decision to discontinue imatinib mesylate treatment due to failure of
             continued benefit or no benefit to the patient, ii) Imatinib Mesylate Intolerance: any
             toxicity resulting in a physician's (documented) decision to discontinue imatinib
             mesylate treatment.

          -  Patients must have recovered from the side effects of previous CML therapy for
             accelerated phase with the exception of hydroxyurea

          -  Age &gt;/= 2 years

          -  Bilirubin &lt;/= 3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN), SGOT and SGPT &lt;/= 3 x ULN, except
             &lt;/= 5 x ULN in leukemic involvement of the liver, serum creatinine &lt;/= 2 x ULN

          -  WHO performance status 0-3

          -  A negative serum hCG pregnancy test in patients of childbearing potential

          -  Active malignancy other than CML or non-melanoma cancer of the skin

          -  Previous treatment for CML with another investigational agent within 28 days of study
             entry

          -  At study entry, patients who were treated with: imatinib mesylate within the past 48
             hours; interferon-alpha within the past 48 hours; homoharringtonine within the past 14
             days; low-dose cytosine arabinoside within 7 days, moderate dose within 14 days, or
             high dose within 28 days; etoposide, anthracyclines, or mitoxantrone within 21 days;
             busulfan within the past six weeks

          -  Patients who had received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation within 6 weeks of
             Day 1 decitabine therapy

          -  Patients with Grade 3/4 cardiac disease or any other serious concurrent medical
             condition.
