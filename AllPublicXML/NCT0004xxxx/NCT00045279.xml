      RATIONALE: PEG-interferon alfa-2b may stop the growth of kidney cancer by stopping blood flow
      to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of PEG-interferon alfa-2b in treating
      patients who have metastatic kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of PEG-interferon alfa-2b in patients with metastatic renal cell
           carcinoma.

        -  Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on biological surrogates of antitumor activity (basic
           fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and interleukin-6 serum
           levels) in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously once weekly. Courses repeat
      every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at 2 weeks and at 2, 4, 8, and 12 months after
      initiation of study therapy, and then at completion of study therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 15 months.
