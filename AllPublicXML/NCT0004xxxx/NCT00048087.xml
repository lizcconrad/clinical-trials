    <textblock>
      Patients will receive 250 mg Iressa by mouth daily each day while on this study. Patients
      will also receive docetaxel 30 mg/m2 by by vein (IV) on day 1 weekly for the first 3 weeks of
      each course of therapy. A course of therapy is 4 weeks. Patients will not receive docetaxel
      during week 4. A maximum of 8 full cycles of docetaxel plus Iressa are planned. Patients may
      continue on daily Iressa until progressive disease and/or unacceptable toxicity.

             first chemotherapy regimen.

          -  At least a 2-week recovery from prior therapy toxicity.

          -  Signed informed consent.

          -  Prior CNS involvement by tumor are eligible if previously treated and clinically
             stable for two weeks after completion of treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior Iressa or other EGFR inhibiting agents

          -  Prior docetaxel therapy

          -  Other co-existing malignancies or malignancies diagnosed within the last 5 years with
             the exception of basal cell carcinoma or cervical cancer in situ.

          -  Any unresolved chronic toxicity greater than CTC grade 2 from previous anticancer
             therapy.

          -  Incomplete healing from previous oncologic or other major surgery.

          -  Concomitant use of phenytoin, carbamazepine, barbiturates, rifampicin, St John's Wort,

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic
             disease, (e.g., unstable or uncompensated respiratory, cardiac, hepatic, or renal
             disease).

             the presence of liver metastases.

          -  Evidence of any other significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that makes
