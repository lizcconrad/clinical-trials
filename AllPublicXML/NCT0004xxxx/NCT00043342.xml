  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      Interferon gamma-1b (IFN-gamma 1b) when administered by subcutaneous injection over a period
      of 4 weeks to patients with mild-to-moderate cystic fibrosis. Additionally, preliminary
      assessments on the effects of IFN-gamma 1b on lung function and other indicators of health
      will be made.
