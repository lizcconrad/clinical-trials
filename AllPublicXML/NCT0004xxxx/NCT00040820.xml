      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of oxaliplatin in treating patients who
      have locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer that has been previously treated.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Provide oxaliplatin for patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic
           colorectal cancer who have exhausted all approved therapies for colorectal cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, Treatment Access Program study.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up
      to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for at least 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately one patient per site per month will be accrued for this
      study.
