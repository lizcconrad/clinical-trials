  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis C infection is one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease in the
      United States. Approximately one-third of patients with hepatitis C infection develop
      cirrhosis of the liver, which can lead to liver failure or liver cancer. The current
      treatment for hepatitis C infection in previously untreated patients is successful in only
      about half of patients. There is no established therapy for non-responders.

      This is a randomized, double-blinded, multicenter trial to determine the effectiveness of
      thymosin alpha 1 (thymalfasin) 1.6 mg twice weekly plus PEGinterferon alfa-2a 180 ug/wk
      compared to placebo plus PEGinterferon alfa-2a in adults with chronic hepatitis C without
      cirrhosis who are non-responders to previous treatment with interferon or interferon plus
      ribavirin. The definition of non-response requires a positive HCV RNA test at the end of a
      course of at least 12 weeks of therapy. Patients will receive treatment for 12 months, and
      will be followed-up for a further 6 months after the end of therapy.

             disease, drug-induced liver injury, primary biliary cirrhosis, sclerosing cholangitis,
