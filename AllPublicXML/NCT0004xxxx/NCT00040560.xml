  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and imaging ability of 111In-DAC when
      used with planar and SPECT imaging for the detection of lung cancer and brain cancer
      consistent with metastatic lung cancer.

             weeks after study)

          -  Have an ECOG performance status of Zero or One

          -  Are being evaluated for known or suspected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or
             known brain lesions consistent with metastatic lung cancer

          -  (For NSCLC patients)Have been previously scheduled for biopsy or surgical excision of
             the suspected NSCLC, or have a pathological diagnosis of lung cancer within 2 months
             of enrollment but have received no previous treatment

          -  (For brain cancer patients) Have clinical signs and symptoms consistent with a primary
             NSCLC with histological or cytopathological confirmation. Patients cannot have
             received previous treatment with radiation to the brain.

          -  Have signed an informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients will not be eligible for this study if they:

             the 111In-DAC components

          -  Have a clinically unstable medical condition or opportunistic infection, a
             life-threatening disease state, impaired renal or hepatic function or are
             immunosuppressed

          -  Are taking or have taken part in any investigational study within 30 days of start of

             creatinine&gt;1.5mg/100ml, alkaline phosphatase 2X the upper limit of normal

          -  Have undergone an excisional and/or needle localization biopsy within 4 days prior to
             study drug administration

          -  Have undergone a PET scan within 7 days prior to study drug administration

          -  Have any active or previously treated second malignancy except carcinoma in situ of
             the uterine cervix or non-melanoma skin cancer
