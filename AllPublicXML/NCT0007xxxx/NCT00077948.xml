  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beta-blocker medications have been shown to improve heart function and prolong the lives of
      patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Some people with advanced CHF have difficulty
      taking beta-blocker medications due to troublesome side effects, such as low blood pressure
      and/or low heart rate, severe tiredness, dizziness, or shortness of breath. In other words,
      they have difficulty tolerating beta-blocker medications. The purpose of this study is to
      determine if enoximone can improve a patient's ability to tolerate a beta-blocker medication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last decade, it has become evident that certain beta-blocking agents (beta-blockers)
      exert a favorable effect on the natural history of mild to moderate chronic heart failure
      (CHF), including reducing mortality and hospitalization rate. However, as heart failure
      becomes more severe, beta-blockers become difficult to administer because of myocardial
      depression leading to hemodynamic intolerance. A recent clinical study demonstrated that
      subjects who could not tolerate the beta-blocker metoprolol experienced improved tolerability
      when low-dose, oral enoximone was administered prior to the introduction of metoprolol and
      during ongoing treatment. This study will investigate the hypotheses that by stabilizing
      subjects on enoximone first, advanced CHF subjects who are intolerant of beta-blockade will
      be able to 1) tolerate the effects of beta-blocker therapy, and 2) have clinical benefit that
      is due to the combination of both enoximone and extended-release metoprolol succinate (ER
      metoprolol). Support for these hypotheses will be sought by demonstrating that, as compared
      to placebo, low-dose, oral enoximone plus ER metoprolol will increase left ventricular
      ejection fraction (LVEF), improve symptoms of heart failure, and improve submaximal exercise
      tolerance in subjects with CHF.

        Inclusion criteria

        In order to be considered an eligible subject, all of the following entry criteria must be
        met:

          -  Subjects must be competent to provide informed written consent. Subjects must sign an
             IRB/IEC approved informed consent form prior to the initiation of any study
             procedures.

          -  Subjects must be 18 years of age or older.

          -  Subjects must have ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy with symptoms of NYHA Class
             III or IV chronic heart failure.

          -  Subjects must have a LVEF of less than or equal to 35%, measured within 60 days of the
             Screening Visit. LVEF must be assessed by radionuclide ventriculography (MUGA). If the
             subject has experienced any cardiovascular events, has undergone any interventions, or
             received any changes in treatment that may have affected LV function since the most
             recent EF measurement, an LVEF measurement must be completed prior to the subject
             being randomized.

          -  Subjects must have a left ventricular end diastolic dimension (LVEDD) of &gt;2.7 cm/m2 as
             measured by 2-D ECHO within 12 months of the Screening Visit.

          -  Subjects must be on optimal conventional heart failure therapy (with the exception of
             a beta-blocker), including an ACEI for at least 30 days prior to the Screening Visit,
             or the subject must have had a trial of an ACEI and proven to be intolerant, or the
             subject must be taking an ARB for at least 30 days prior to the Screening Visit or
             proved to be intolerant. Optimal conventional therapy may also include spironolactone,
             digitalis glycosides, diuretics, or other vasodilators.

          -  Subjects must have failed the initiation, or the up-titration, of a beta-blocker drug
             due to hemodynamic intolerance within 12 months prior to the Screening Visit. Failure
             to tolerate beta-blockade for hemodynamic reasons is defined as worsening signs and
             symptoms of chronic heart failure, hypotension accompanied with symptoms, or evidence
             of organ hypoperfusion, which in the judgment of the treating physician precluded
             further treatment with the beta-blocker. This beta-blocker intolerance must have been
             documented prior to Screening, and a narrative description of the intolerance must be
             approved by Myogen prior to Randomization.

        Exclusion criteria

        Subjects who meet any one of the following criteria will be deemed ineligible for
        participation in the study:

             uncorrected congenital heart disease, isolated right-sided heart failure, or primary
             pulmonary hypertension.

          -  Subjects who have undergone a cardiac revascularization, valvular surgery, or
             bi-ventricular resynchronization procedure within 60 days prior to the Screening

             ischemic symptoms), or 2) ventricular tachycardia (VT) or premature ventricular
             complexes (PVCs) associated with symptoms, or 3) VT of greater than or equal to 6
             beats

          -  Subjects with sustained (&gt;15 seconds) VT, unless precipitated by an event such as an
             acute myocardial infarction, induction by catheter placement, or by an
             electrophysiology procedure, or addressed by AICD placement.

          -  Subjects with an AICD that has fired for any ventricular arrhythmia within 90 days of
             the Randomization Visit.

          -  Subjects with a documented diagnosis of angina that meets either of the following
             criteria: 1) angina diagnosed as unstable at any time within the 60 days prior to the
             Screening Visit or 2) angina is the primary symptom that limits daily physical
             activity

          -  Subjects who have had ventricular reduction surgery or cardiac myoplasty.

          -  Subjects on a mechanical assist device.

          -  Subjects with evidence of a concomitant disease that may interfere with the natural
             course of the subject's underlying heart failure for the duration of the trial.

          -  Subjects having a concomitant life-threatening disease for which their life expectancy
             is estimated to be less than one year.

             frequent hypoglycemic episodes or frequent hospitalizations for hyperglycemia.

          -  Subjects on the following concomitant medications at the time of Screening are
             excluded from participating in the study: 1) Calcium antagonists other than amlodipine
             or felodipine; 2) Flecainide, encainide, propafenone, sotalol, dofetilide or
             disopyramide; 3) Subjects receiving i.v. positive inotropic agents within seven days
             of the Screening Visit or Randomization Visit; 4) Subjects receiving a human BNP,

             5) Subjects receiving oral or i.v. type-III PDE inhibitors within seven days of the
             Screening Visit or Randomization Visit.

          -  Subjects with a contraindication to treatment with a positive inotropic agent (defined
             as a serious adverse event attributed to previous treatment with a positive inotrope).

          -  Subjects with a known contraindication to beta-blocker therapy. This may include
             beta-agonist-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, a heart rate
             &lt;55 BPM, the presence of second- or third-degree heart block without an implanted
             pacemaker, and first-degree heart block with a PR interval &gt;220 milliseconds.

          -  Pregnant women and women at risk of becoming pregnant (i.e., not using effective
             methods of birth control).

          -  Subjects who have participated in a clinical trial involving another investigational
             drug or device within 30 days of the Screening Visit or at any time during the study.
