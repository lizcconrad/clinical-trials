      This small, preliminary study will examine whether multiple infusions of infliximab
      (RemicadeÂ® (Registered Trademark)) can control inflammation in patients with active
      scleritis. The sclera is the tough white outer coat enclosing the eyeball. Infliximab is a
      combination of part human and part mouse proteins that block a natural body protein called
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF). TNF appears to be involved in scleritis, and stopping its action
      may help reduce the inflammation in the disease. The drug has been approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration for treating Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis.

      Patients 18 years of age or older with active non-infectious scleritis may be eligible for
      this study. Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:

        -  Medical history and physical examination.

        -  Eye examination, including a vision test and examination of the retina (back part of the
           eye) and of the sclera and its blood vessels.

        -  Questionnaire about vision and daily activities.

        -  Tuberculin skin test.

        -  Pregnancy test: Women who can have children are tested for pregnancy at study weeks 0,
           14, 30, 38, and 46.

        -  Infliximab treatment: Infliximab is infused over a 2-hour period through a needle in a
           vein, usually in the arm. The patient's vital signs are checked before the patient
           begins each infusion starts and again before leaving the clinic. After the first two
           infusions, if the disease remains quiet, other scleritis medications will be attempted
           to be reduced to half the original dose over 8 to 12 weeks and possibly to nothing if
           the patient continues to do well. Patients receive a maximum of 9 infusions over a
           30-week period.

        -  Blood draws: About 4 tablespoons of blood are drawn at each visit to test for the number
           and types of cells in the blood and to check for signs of inflammation and side effects
           of the study medicine.

      Patients are seen in the NEI clinic for infusions and to check the response to therapy. This
      includes 13 clinic visits over 46 weeks, as follows: every 2 weeks for the first 2 weeks,
      every 4 weeks thereafter for a total of 30 weeks for infusions, and then every 4 weeks for 16
      additional weeks.

      Patients may stop therapy if their scleritis is not controlled 10 weeks into the study
      period; if they develop a flare of inflammation after initial control of the active
      scleritis; if their vision loss is too large; or if their medications increase or other
      medicines are added to control the scleritis. Patients whose vision decreases minimally,
      stays the same, or improves may remain in the study.

      We propose to investigate the possible efficacy of multiple infliximab infusions to control
      the inflammation in participants presenting with active scleritis. This will be performed
      using an open-label pilot study. Subjects will receive 5mg/kg intravenous infusions of
      infliximab at 0, 2, 6 and 10 weeks. After these initial infusions, participants may contine
      to receive 5 mg/kg dose infusions or may receive 8 mg/kg dose infusions depending on the
      treamtent response. Treatment response is defined as a decrease in inflammation by at least 2
      steps on the scale of grades 0-4 , or a decrease to 0 assessed at week 14. A combination of
      thse two dose infusions (5 mg/kg or 8 mg/kg) will be given for the remainder of the study
      according to set schedules. The primary outcome will be the ability to control active
      scleritis defined as at least a 2-step decrease in sleral inflammation,scleritis within 14
      weeks of initiating infliximab therapy. Secondary outcomes will be the amount of reduction in
      concomitant immunosuppressive medication (measured using the grading scale in Section 4.5.2),
      changes in pain, redness (measured using a visual analogue scale), photophobia, changes in
      visual acuity (changes of 10 letters from baseline in best-corrected visual acuity will be
      considered clinically significant), the typical time between flares, and numbers of flares
      and times between flares while in the study.

        To be eligible to enroll in this study, a prospective participant must satisfy the
        following inclusion criteria:

          1. Participant is 18 years of age or older.

          2. Participant has active non-infectious scleritis, diagnosed by a persistent congestion
             of deep episcleral vessels following a drop of 10% phenylephrine, without active
             intraocular inflammation.

          3. Participant has normal renal or liver function.
