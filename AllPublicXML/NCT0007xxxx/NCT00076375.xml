  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nanocrystalline silver (very small particles of silver) is the active ingredient in Acticoat
      dressings, which have been approved for the treatment of burns and other wounds. Silver has
      been used for decades as an effective antimicrobial agent. In animal studies, nanocrystalline
      silver cream (NPI) has also demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity. Thus, nanocrystalline
      silver cream is being evaluated in the treatment of inflammatory skin conditions such as
      atopic dermatitis (eczema).

      Approximately 180 study subjects with a definitive diagnosis of mild to moderate eczema will
      be enrolled in this study. Subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment with placebo, 0.5%
      NPI or 1% NPI for the 6-week treatment period. Assessments of treatment effect and safety
      will be performed weekly. Upon completion of the study, subjects may be eligible for 12 weeks
      of open-label treatment with 1% NPI.
