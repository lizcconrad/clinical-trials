  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with Fabry disease have an alteration in their genetic material (DNA) which causes a
      deficiency of the a-galactosidase A enzyme. Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta) is a drug that helps
      to breakdown and remove certain types of fatty substances called &quot;glycolipids.&quot; These
      glycolipids are normally present within the body in most cells. In Fabry disease, glycolipids
      build up in various tissues such as the liver, kidney, skin, and blood vessels because
      a-galactosidase A is not present, or is present in small quantities. The build up of
      glycolipid (&quot;globotriaosylceramide&quot; or &quot;GL-3&quot;) levels in these tissues in particular is
      thought to cause the clinical symptoms that are common to Fabry disease. This study will test
      the safety and efficacy of Fabrazyme in the treatment of patients with Fabry disease.
