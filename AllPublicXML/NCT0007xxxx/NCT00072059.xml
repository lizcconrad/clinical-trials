      RATIONALE: Ro 50-3821 may stimulate red blood cell production and treat anemia in patients
      who are receiving antineoplastic therapy for non-small cell lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying six different regimens of Ro 50-3821 to
      compare how well they work in treating anemia in patients who are receiving antineoplastic
      therapy for stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the hemoglobin dose response of anemic patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small
           cell lung cancer receiving antineoplastic therapy treated with 6 different regimens of
           Ro 50-3821.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the safety profile of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the pharmacokinetic profile of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine additional pharmacodynamic characteristics of these regimens in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, parallel, multicenter study. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 6 treatment arms. In all arms, patients begin study therapy on the first
      day of a course of antineoplastic therapy.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive a lower dose of Ro 50-3821 subcutaneously (SC) once weekly.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive a medium dose of Ro 50-3821 SC once weekly.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive a higher dose of Ro 50-3821 SC once weekly.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive a lower dose of Ro 50-3821 SC once every 3 weeks.

        -  Arm V: Patients receive a medium dose of Ro 50-3821 SC once every 3 weeks.

        -  Arm VI: Patients receive a higher dose of Ro 50-3821 SC once every 3 weeks. In all arms,
           treatment continues for 12 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 week.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 210 patients (35 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
