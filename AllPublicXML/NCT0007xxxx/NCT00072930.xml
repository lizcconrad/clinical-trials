      The primary objectives of this study are:

        1. To explore the antitumor activity of MEDI-522 in combination with docetaxel, prednisone,
           and zoledronic acid in patients with metastatic Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer
           (AIPC); and

        2. To summarize the safety of MEDI-522 in combination with docetaxel, prednisone, and
           zoledronic acid in this patient population.
