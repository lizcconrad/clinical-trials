    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 trial will investigate the safety of a modified stem cell transplant procedure
      for treating advanced breast cancer. Patients with cancers can sometimes benefit greatly from
      transplants of stem cells (cells produced by the bone marrow that mature into blood cells).
      In addition to producing new bone marrow and restoring normal blood production and immunity,
      the donated cells fight any residual tumor cells that might have remained in the body, in
      what is called a &quot;graft-versus-tumor&quot; effect. However, severe problems, or sometimes even
      death, may follow these transplants as a result of the high-dose chemotherapy and radiation
      that accompany the procedure. Also, donated immune cells called lymphocytes, or T cells,
      sometimes attack healthy tissues in a reaction called graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD),
      damaging organs such as the liver, intestines and skin. This study will use the following
      strategies to try to reduce these risks:

        -  &quot;Induction chemotherapy&quot; to reduce patients' immunity in an attempt to prevent rejection
           of the donated stem cells

        -  Reduced-intensity conditioning chemotherapy that is easier for the body to tolerate and
           involves a shorter period of complete immune suppression

        -  Removal of lymphocytes from the donor stem cells for transfusion in small quantities at
           monthly intervals following the stem cell transplant to reduce the risk of GVHD

        -  Transplant of specific lymphocytes called Th2/Tc2 cells that may increase the percentage
           of donor stem cells accepted by the patient without significantly increasing GVHD

      Patients between 18 and 75 years of age with advanced (stage IV) breast cancer that does not
      respond to standard therapy may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a
      medical history, physical and dental examinations, x-ray studies and bone marrow biopsies to
      evaluate disease status, blood and urine tests (including a blood test for genetic match with
      the donor), and lung and heart function tests.

      Participants have a central venous line (large plastic tube) placed into a major vein. This
      tube stays in the body during the entire treatment period for infusing the donated stem cells
      and T lymphocytes, giving medications, including chemotherapy and other drugs, antibiotics,
      and blood transfusions, and withdrawing blood samples. Treatment starts with induction
      chemotherapy, in which patients receive one or two cycles of the anti-cancer drugs
      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. (One cycle consists of 4 days on drug therapy followed by a
      17-day rest period.) G-CSF, a drug that boosts white cell production, is also given to reduce
      the risk of infection. Several days before the transplant procedure, patients begin
      conditioning chemotherapy with higher doses of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. Three days
      after the conditioning therapy is completed, the stem cells are infused. To help prevent both
      rejection of the donor stem cells and GVHD, patients receive cyclosporine (first by vein and
      later by mouth) for several weeks after the transplant. Infusions of donor lymphocytes begin
      about 6 weeks after the transplant to boost the immune system and enhance the
      graft-versus-tumor effect.

      Patients may leave the hospital when they are able to eat and drink, have no fever or
      infection, and have a normal or near-normal white cell count. They return for follow-up
      visits twice a week for the first 100 days after the transplant, then every 3 months, then 6
      months and then yearly for at least 5 years post-transplant. The visits include a medical
      history, physical examination, and blood draws, as well as disease staging with CT scans
      every month for the first 6 months.

      Background:

        -  In CC# 00-C-0119 we were able to demonstrate that allogeneic T cells could mediate a
           clinically relevant graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect against MBC after a
           reduced-intensity, T cell depleted allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant
           (alloHSCT).

        -  Responses were observed after establishment of complete lymphoid chimerism, which was
           frequently delayed and required the use of planned donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). DLI
           were associated with a significant incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

        -  In murine models, in vitro generated T cells of Th2/Tc2 phenotype can facilitate
           engraftment of HLA disparate allografts with significantly reduced GVHD as compared to T
           cell replete allografts that have not been manipulated. In addition, Th2/Tc2 cells
           provide an anti-tumor effect through the perforin/granzyme pathway.

        -  Allogeneic Th2/Tc2 cells may facilitate rapid allo-engraftment post-transplant with
           reduced GVHD. In addition, the perforin-mediated anti-tumor activity of Th2/Tc2 cells
           should provide earlier benefit compared with T-cell depleted allografts.

      Objectives:

      -To determine the safety, as defined by the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease, and
      feasibility of administering in vitro generated donor T cells of Th2/Tc2 phenotype to augment
      a T cell depleted allograft (T cell exchange) after reduced-intensity conditioning.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with measurable, metastatic breast cancer and an HLA matched sibling donor

        -  Patients must have received treatment with a taxane, an anthracycline, a hormonal agent
           and/or Herceptin, if the tumor expresses the respective receptors, and at least one
           treatment for metastatic disease that has not resulted in a complete response.

      Design:

        -  Donors will initially have lymphocytes collected to generate the Th2/Tc2 product and
           then have blood stem cells collected following mobilization with filgrastim. The stem
           cell product will be T-cell depleted, and the T-cell dose will be adjusted to 1 x 10(5)
           CD3+ cells/kg.

        -  Patients will receive induction (immune depleting) chemotherapy with the goal of
           reducing circulating CD4+ cell less than 50/microliter prior to proceeding to alloHSCT.

        -  Patients will receive a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine
           and cyclophosphamide. This will be followed by infusion of the T cell depleted
           allograft, which will be supplemented with Th2/Tc2 cells (i.e. T cell exchange).

        -  Cyclosporine will be discontinued after 40 days to permit a full GVT effect. Patients
           may receive donor lymphocyte infusions at days +42, +70, +98 post-transplant to further
           potentiate a GVT effect.

        -  Patients will be enrolled in three cohorts, with escalating Th2/Tc2 cell doses (0.5 -
           12.5 x 10(7) cells/kg) given in a phase-I manner.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Inclusion Criteria - Recipient:

          1. Patients with measurable stage IV breast cancer. Patients with central nervous system
             CNS metastases are eligible if the CNS metastases have been treated and remained
             stable a minimum of four weeks after the completion of therapy.

          2. Patients must have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen for treatment of
             distant metastases and achieved less than a complete response to this therapy.

               1. Patients must have received prior therapy with a taxane (e.g. paclitaxel) and an
                  anthracycline (e.g. doxorubicin) as part of either adjuvant therapy or treatment
                  of metastatic disease.

               2. Patients whose tumor expresses estrogen and/or progesterone receptors must have
                  received at least one hormonal therapy (e.g. Tamoxifen) as part of either
                  adjuvant therapy or treatment of metastatic disease.

               3. Patients whose tumor expresses Her2-neu must have received trastuzumab (Herceptin
                  ) as part of either adjuvant therapy or treatment of metastatic disease.

               4. Patients who have undergone prior autologous stem cell transplantation are
                  eligible for this protocol.

          3. Patients 18 - 75 years of age. The upper age limit was chosen in order not to be
             discriminatory, provided that patients meet all other eligibility criteria.

          4. ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Karnofsky performance status greater
             than or equal to 60%).

          5. Life expectancy greater than 6 months.

          6. Left ventricular ejection fraction has to be greater than or equal to 45% by either
             MUGA or 2-D echo. This test will repeated immediately after induction and prior to
             transplantation. Patients who do not have the minimally required function will be
             removed from trial.

          7. DLCO greater than or equal to 50% of the expected value when corrected for Hb. This
             test will repeated immediately after induction and prior to transplantation. Patients
             who do not have the minimally required function will be removed from trial.

          8. Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl and a creatinine clearance greater than or
             equal to 50 ml/min/1.73 m(2). This test will repeated immediately after induction and
             prior to transplantation. Patients who do not have the minimally required function
             will be removed from trial.

          9. Direct bilirubin less than or equal to 2.5 mg/dl, SGOT less than 4x high normal value.
             Values above these levels may be accepted, at the discretion of the PI or study
             chairperson, if such elevations are thought to be due to liver involvement by
             malignancy. This test will repeated immediately after induction and prior to
             transplantation. Patients who do not have the minimally required function will be
             removed from trial.

         10. Patients must be HIV-, HbsAg-, and Hepatitis C antibody negative. The high degree of
             immune suppression that will be used in this study may lead to the activation or
             progression of these viral illnesses.

         11. Not pregnant or lactating. Patients of childbearing potential must use an effective
             method of contraception. The effects of the chemotherapy, the subsequent transplant
             and the medications used after the transplant are highly likely to be harmful to a
             fetus. The effects upon breast milk are unknown and may be harmful to the infant.

         12. Consenting sibling matched at 6/6 HLA antigens.

         13. Provision for a Durable Power of Attorney.

         14. Ability to give informed consent.

        Inclusion Criteria - Donor:

          1. Age 18 - 75 years. As the potential for cerebrovascular and cardiac complications may
             potentially increase with age, 75 years has been chosen arbitrarily as the upper age
             limit. However, if it is determined after initial accrual of patients in this upper
             age range that this procedure is relatively safe, the age range may be extended.

          2. No physical contraindications to stem cell donation (i.e. severe atherosclerosis,
             auto-immune disease, cerebrovascular accident, prior malignancy. Patients with severe
             atherosclerosis by history will receive a cardiology consult and be judged eligible on
             a case by case basis. The exclusion of patients with a prior malignancy will be
             evaluated on a case by case basis. If it is felt by the investigators that the risk of
             potential transfer of malignant cells is far outweighed by the potential benefit of
             the procedure the patient may be eligible to serve as a donor. Persons with a history
             of non-hematologic malignancy must have undergone potentially curative therapy for
             that malignancy and 1) have had no evidence of that disease for 5 years, and/or 2) be
             deemed at low risk for recurrence (less than or equal to 20% at 5 years). Such persons
             will be considered eligible for stem cell donation at the discretion of the principal
             investigator, who will evaluate the possible benefit to the potential transplant
             recipient and the risk of disease transmission in consultation with Department of
             Transfusion Medicine staff. Prospective donors with a history of non-hematologic
             malignancy who have received potentially curative therapy and are in remission, but
             whose estimated risk of recurrence is greater than 20% at 5 years, will be considered
             on an individual basis in consultation with the NCI IRB. Any prospective transplant
             recipient whose donor has a history of malignancy will be counseled about the
             theoretical risk of transmission of cancer from the donor to the recipient.

          3. Donors must be HIV-negative, HbsAg, and Hepatitis C antibody negative. As donors are
             providing an allogeneic blood product there is the potential risk of transmitting
             these viral illnesses to the recipient.

          4. Donor must not be pregnant or breastfeeding an infant. A donor who is lactating must
             substitute formula feeding for her infant during the period of cytokine
             administration. Filgrastim may be secreted in human milk, although its bioavailability
             from this source is not known. Limited clinical data suggest that short-term
             administration of filgrastim or sargramostim to neonates is not associated with
             adverse outcomes. Donors of childbearing potential must use an effective method of
             contraception during the time they are receiving cytokines. The effects of cytokine
             administration on a fetus are unknown and may be potentially harmful. The effects upon
             breast milk are also unknown and may potentially be harmful to the infant.

          5. Ability to give informed consent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Exclusion Criteria - Patient

          1. Active infection that is not responding to antimicrobial therapy.

          2. History of psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with transplant
             protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent (as determined by
             principal investigator).

        Exclusion Criteria - Donor

          1. History of psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with transplant
             protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent.

          2. History of hypertension that is not controlled by medication, stroke, or severe heart
             disease. Individuals with symptomatic angina will be considered to have severe heart
             disease and will not be eligible to be a donor.

          3. Anemia (Hb less than 11 gm/dl) or thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 100,000 per
             ml).
