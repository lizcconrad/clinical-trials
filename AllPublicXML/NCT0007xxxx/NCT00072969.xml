      This study will evaluate a new immunosupressive therapy, Daclizumab, and compare it with
      antithymocyte globulin (ATG) to treat cytopenia, that is, the deficiency of cellular elements
      of the blood, in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Daclizumab is an anti-interleukin-2 receptor
      (IL-2) antibody. MDS, also known as myelodysplasia, is a disorder that can cause anemia,
      spontaneous bleeding, and greater risk of infections. Although the bone marrow can still
      produce some blood cells, very few reach the bloodstream. The cause of MDS is not known,
      although its behavior is. Many patients need transfusions of red blood cells. They may also
      develop leukemia, which is often quite resistant to treatment with chemotherapy. However, the
      progression of the disorder to leukemia is usually slow, taking many years.

      Patients 18 years of age and older who have MDS may be eligible for this study. Participants
      will undergo the following tests and procedures:

        -  Medical history and physical examination.

        -  Collection of blood for tests including blood counts, liver and kidney function, and
           antibodies against common viruses.

        -  Chest x-ray.

        -  Electrocardiogram.

        -  Bone marrow sample to confirm the diagnosis.

      Participants will randomly receive either ATG or Daclizumab. If they are in the group to
      receive ATG, they will be admitted as inpatients to undergo the first 10 to 14 days of
      treatment. If they do not already have a catheter in one of the large veins of the neck,
      chest, or arm, one will be placed. ATG will be given through the catheter. Blood counts and
      other blood analysis will be monitored daily while the patients are treated. After about 10
      days, they will be released, to be under the care of their referring physicians. Those
      participants who are in the group to receive Daclizumab will receive a total of five doses,
      one every 2 weeks, over 8 weeks, given through a vein as a 15-minute infusion. The first,
      third, and fifth dose will be given at the outpatient clinic. The second and fourth doses can
      be given either at the clinic or by the patients' primary hematologists.

      All patients will be followed as outpatients at 3-month intervals for the first year, and
      then every 6 months for the next 3 years. Afterward, follow-up will be yearly. A small sample
      of blood will be drawn at the visits. Also, bone marrow examinations will be requested at the
      6-month intervals for the first 3 years of treatment. If the treatment that patients are
      assigned to does not work, after 6 months, they will be eligible to receive the other
      treatment-provided that they have complied with the required blood tests and visits to the
      clinic required to assess the patients' safety.

    <textblock>
      Many bone marrow failure syndromes in humans are now recognized to result from immunological
      mechanisms. These diseases include aplastic anemia, pure red cell aplasia, and some types of
      myelodysplasia. Patients with these conditions, who may suffer variable degrees of anemia,
      leukocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia, alone or in combination, have been shown to respond to
      a wide variety of immunosuppressive agents, ranging from corticosteroids to cyclosporine
      (CSA) and antithymocyte globulin (ATG), however, nonresponse and relapse continues to be a
      problem. Why some patients do not respond initially or others respond and then relapse is
      unclear. Autoreactive T cells may be resistant to the effect of ATG/CsA (nonresponders),
      while in others residual autoreactive T cells expand post-treatment leading to hematopoietic
      stem cell destruction and recurrent pancytopenia (relapse). Therefore, novel, less toxic
      immunosuppressive regimens that increase response rates and hematologic recovery and decrease
      relapse rates are needed.

      One such novel therapy, Daclizumab, a humanized anti-interleukin-2 receptor (lL-2R)
      monoclonal antibody (mAb), acts against activated lymphocytes, thus sharing an important
      mechanism of action with ATG. The mAb is much less toxic than ATG and may be administered to
      outpatients at relatively infrequent intervals (every 2 weeks). Treatments with ATG alone and
      CsA alone have demonstrated varying degrees of success in alleviating the cytopenia of MDS.
      Our experience suggests that ATG rather than CSA is the more effective agent inducing
      hematological responses in susceptible MDS patients and that certain variables including the
      patient's age, whether or not they were HLA DR15, and days of red cell transfusion dependence
      prior to treatment were predictive of response.

      We therefore propose this randomized phase II study to evaluate and compare a new
      immunosuppressive therapy, Daclizumab, with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) to treat the
      cytopenia of MDS in a population of subjects with intermediate or high predicted probability
      of response.
