      This study will evaluate the effects of levetiracetam (Keppra (Trademark) on Parkinson's
      disease symptoms and on dyskinesias (involuntary movements) that develop as a result of
      long-term treatment with levodopa. Levetiracetam blocks certain protein receptors on brain
      cells and thus can change the spread of brain signals believed to be affected in patients
      with Parkinson's disease.

      Patients between 30 and 80 years of age with relatively advanced Parkinson's disease and
      dyskinesias due to levodopa therapy may be eligible for this 6-week study.

      Screening and baseline evaluation - Participants are evaluated with a medical history,
      physical examination and neurologic evaluation, blood tests, urinalysis, electrocardiogram
      (EKG), 24-hour holter monitor (heart monitoring), and cardiology consultation. A chest x-ray
      and MRI or CT scan of the brain are done if needed. If possible, patients stop taking all
      antiparkinsonian medications except levodopa (Sinemet) for one month (2 months if taking
      Selegiline) before the study begins and throughout its duration. (If necessary, patients may
      use short-acting agents, such as Mirapex, Requip or Amantadine.)

      Dose-finding phase - Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 2 to 3 days for a
      levodopa &quot;dose-finding&quot; procedure. For this test, patients stop taking Sinemet and instead
      have levodopa infused through a vein. During the infusions, the drug dose is increased slowly
      until parkinsonian symptoms improve or unacceptable side effects occur or the maximum study
      dose is reached. Symptoms are monitored frequently. (Patients who have had dosing infusions
      in the last 3 months do not have to undergo this phase of the study.)

      Active study phase - Patients are randomly assigned to take levetiracetam or placebo (&quot;sugar
      pill&quot;) twice a day for 6 weeks. At the end of weeks 1, 2 4, and 5, patients come to the
      clinic for blood tests, an EKG, and a review of adverse side effects. At the end of weeks 3
      and 6, patients are hospitalized to study the response to treatment. They again stop taking
      Sinemet and selegiline and their ability to perform motor tasks is evaluated. They are then
      placed on an L-dopa infusion for 10 hours. Placebo may be infused at various times instead of
      L-dopa. Motor symptoms are evaluated several times during the infusion. Blood is drawn once
      during the infusion for research studies.

      Lumbar puncture - Patients undergo a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) at the end of weeks 1 and 4
      to measure certain brain chemicals and drug levels. For this test, a local anesthetic is
      given and a needle is inserted in the space between the vertebrae in the lower back. About 2
      tablespoons of fluid is collected through the needle.

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - Patients with changing disease activity may undergo MRIs
      at baseline, at the end of week 1 and at the end of the study to show changes in the brain.
      The patient lies in a narrow cylinder (the scanner) that uses radio waves and a magnetic
      field to produce images of the brain, which show structural and chemical changes.

      Follow-up - 2 weeks after the study ends, patients are contacted by phone for a review of
      side effects or they return to the clinic for an evaluation.

      Introduction: Parkinson's disease is a progressive degenerative disease of unknown etiology.
      Its treatment has been symptomatic and the most successful approach has been to replace the
      missing dopamine through administration of its precursor levodopa. As the disease progresses
      the usefulness of this approach gradually diminishes and motor complications become a source
      of significant disability. Although a number of pharmacological strategies have attempted to
      improve this situation, none has yet proven fully satisfactory. The mechanism by which
      levetiracetam exerts this beneficial effect is unknown. Recently, in a PD monkey model
      levetiracetam was found to moderate dyskinesias and other motor complications, possibly due
      to its effects on striatal GABAergic transmission.

      Objective: To evaluate the acute ability of levetiracetam to safely ameliorate
      dopaminomimetic-treatment-associated dyskinesias and related motor complications in
      parkinsonian patients without compromising the antiparkinsonian response.

      Study Population: 22 moderately advanced parkinsonian patients will be enrolled into a
      randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind proof-of-principle study. Levetiracetam efficacy
      will be assessed through the use of validated motor function scales. Safety will be monitored
      by means of frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.

      Anticipated Risks and Benefits: The potential risks associated with this study amount to only
      a minor increase over minimal risk and are primarily associated with adverse reactions to the
      medications involved. Levetiracetam is a marketed drug with a wide margin of safety. Patients
      receiving drug could benefit from improvement of their symptoms, those on placebo will also
      have their medications adjusted, leading to an improved quality of life.

      Outcome Estimate and Potential Meaning for the Field: This study should further the
      understanding of mechanisms contributing to motor disability in patients with PD that may
      lead to the development of improved therapeutic interventions for this disorder and for
      associated motor response complications.
