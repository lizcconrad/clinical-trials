      RATIONALE: PI-88 may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of PI-88 in treating patients who have
      an advanced malignancy (cancer) or stage IV melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Phase I

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of PI-88 in patients with an advanced malignancy.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

      Phase II

        -  Determine the progression-free survival and time to progression in patients with stage
           IV melanoma treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the biological activity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

        -  Phase I (parts 1 and 2):

             -  Part 1: Patients receive PI-88 subcutaneously (SC) once daily on days 1-4 and
                15-18.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of PI-88 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD has been determined in part I, the
      effect of dose frequency is determined in patients in part II.

        -  Part 2: Patients receive PI-88 SC once daily on days 1-4, 8-11, 15-18, and 22-25 at a
           dose based on the MTD determined in part 1.

      Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of PI-88 until the MTD at this frequency is
      determined.

        -  Phase II (patients with metastatic melanoma): Patients receive PI-88 as in phase I, part
           2 at the MTD.

      Treatment in both phases repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-69 patients (18-30 for phase I [part 1], 6-9 for phase I
      [part 2], and 25-30 for phase II) will be accrued for this study.
