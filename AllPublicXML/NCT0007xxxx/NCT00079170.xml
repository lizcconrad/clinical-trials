      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known whether garlic
      supplements affect the ability of docetaxel to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well giving docetaxel together with garlic works
      in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the clinical pharmacokinetic behavior of docetaxel with and without garlic
           tablets in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the incidence of enzyme and transporter polymorphism in patients treated with
           this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, open-label study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. On days 5-17 of
      course 1, patients receive oral garlic twice daily. Patients have the option of continuing
      garlic tablets as long as they remain on study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-12 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.
