      Study of Daily Dosing with Levalbuterol, Racemic Albuterol, and Placebo in Pediatric Subjects
      with Asthma

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, multicenter,
      parallel-group study of up to 6 weeks in duration. Seven days of QID single-blind, placebo
      administration (via HFA MDI) was followed by 28 days of QID, double-blind treatment. A
      follow-up visit was required only for subjects who had, in the opinion of the investigator, a
      clinically significant finding at Visit 6 /ET that would put the subject at risk. A final
      follow up phone evaluation was conducted 7 days after the completion of Visit 6/ET. This
      study was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was acquired by
      Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed to Sunovion
      Pharmaceuticals Inc.
