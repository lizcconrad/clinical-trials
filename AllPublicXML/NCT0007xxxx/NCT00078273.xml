  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to reduce the prevalence of gambling risk in college
      students by evaluating the effectiveness of different treatments in reducing gambling
      behavior and related negative consequences.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to a personal feedback intervention
      (PFI) or assessment only for 3 years. The PFI intervention will be delivered in a single
      session. Measures will include the NORC DSM Screen for Problem Gambling (NODS), the South
      Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), Gambling Quantity and Perceived Norms, Perceived Injunctive
      Gambling Norms, Gambling Problems Index, gambling frequency, attitudes and beliefs about
      gambling and self-control, readiness to change, gambling expectancies, gambling motives,
      gambling risk perception, psychiatric symptoms, assertiveness, coping skills, substance use,
      alcohol-related problems, self-determination, and social desirability.

    <measure>South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6-Months</time_frame>
    <description>The 20-item South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) measures gambling involvement and problem severity based on DSM-III-R pathological gambling criteria.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gambling Quantity and Perceived Norms Scale (GQPN)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The gambling quantity and perceived norms scale (GQPN) includes a six-item expenditure subscale assessing amount of money won/lost through gambling on a 10-point scale from $0 to more than $2000 over time-periods from the past month to past year. Additional items assess gambling frequency (on a 10-point scale from never to every day in the past year), disposable income (on an 11-point scale from less than $50 to more than $500 per month) and perceptions of gambling frequency and expenditure for the typical college student (perceived norms). Gambling expenditure was calculated as the expenditure subscale mean residualized on disposable income.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gambling Frequency (SOGS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The SOGS was modified to assess internet gambling frequency and expand gambling frequency response options from a three- to a five-point scale with anchors of no times, one to 10 times, more than 10 times, less than weekly, weekly or more than weekly but less than daily, and daily. This modified frequency scale has been shown to correlate highly with other measures of gambling frequency.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gambling Problems Index (GPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Gambling problems (or negative consequences) were assessed using the 20-item Gambling Problems Index (GPI). Participants indicated how often, from never to more than 10 times in the past 6 months, they experienced consequences while, or as a result of, gambling.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>National Opinion Research Center DSM-IV Screen for Pathological Gambling (NODS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>DSM-IV [1] criteria for pathological gambling were assessed using the 17-item National Opinion Research Center DSM-IV Screen (NODS). Some criteria have multiple items, but possible scores range from 0-10 DSM-IV criteria endorsed in the past 6 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Illusions of Control</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Illusions of control were assessed via a six-item subscale from the Beliefs About Control Scale (BACS), on a five-point scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree.</description>

    <description>Sessions lasted for 60-90 minutes and used Motivational Interviewing (MI) to facilitate discussion of feedback from participants' survey responses. Sessions began with open-ended questions about contextual factors associated with participants' gambling, then review of each feedback section: gambling pattern; perceived gambling norms; positive expectancies and negative consequences of gambling; beliefs about control over gambling; and situational self-efficacy to avoid gambling. Participants were encouraged to consider the feedback in light of their personal goals. All participants received a copy of their feedback, a list of skills for limiting gambling and a resource/referral list.</description>

    <description>Participants completed either six weekly 1-hour sessions or attend four sessions containing the same content. Sessions covered functional analysis and gambling triggers; challenging cognitive distortions, with emphasis on illusions of control; coping with triggers; assertiveness; and relapse prevention. Participants received a pamphlet covering each week's topic (which was reviewed with the participant if a session was missed), as well as homework sheets and gambling diaries. CBI participants were asked to refrain from gambling for the duration of the group to provide an opportunity to practice and develop skills applicable to gambling and other behavior change situations.</description>
