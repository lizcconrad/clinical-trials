  <brief_summary>

      Practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) make diagnoses based solely on clinical
      symptoms. This study will evaluate whether TCM practitioners make diagnoses consistently.

    <textblock>
      TCM is one of the oldest and most widely-used indigenous medical systems in the world. It is
      difficult to effectively practice or evaluate TCM outside of its core framework, which
      includes a diagnostic system that is more conceptual and less technologically driven than
      that of conventional medicine. TCM diagnosis relies entirely on clinical symptoms and signs
      that are discerned by the practitioner. The establishment of diagnostic and prescriptive
      consistency is crucial for efficacy studies involving individualized treatments within the
      TCM framework. This study will examine the consistency of TCM diagnoses and herbal
      prescriptions under controlled conditions.

      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients will be individually evaluated by three TCM practitioners;
      the diagnostic and prescriptive behaviors of the practitioners will be recorded and analyzed
      to determine: 1) the extent to which two or more TCM practitioners assign comparable TCM
      diagnoses to the same RA patients; 2) the extent to which two or more TCM practitioners
      prescribe comparable herbal formulas to the same RA patients; and 3) the extent to which TCM
      diagnoses are related to conventional clinical assessments and biomedical tests of RA.
      Variables that cause inconsistency will be identified and analyzed.
