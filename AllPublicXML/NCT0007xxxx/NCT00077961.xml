      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal dose of subcutaneous CAMPATH when used
      in combination with rituximab for patients with relapsing or refractory, low-grade or
      follicular, CD-20-positive, B-Cell non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Safety will be the primary
      objective of phase I, while the primary objective of phase II will be to determine overall
      response.

      This study is being conducted in 2 parts. Phase I will involve dose escalation of
      subcutaneous CAMPATH (SQ) given 3 times per week in combination with weekly doses of
      rituximab (375mg/m2) for a maximum of 8 weeks in order to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD). In Phase II patients will be treated with SQ CAMPATH at the MTD plus weekly
      rituximab (375mg/m2)for a maximum of 8 weeks with primary objective of defining Overall
      Response (OR) to this combination.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For the Phase I portion of the study, patients must have pathologically confirmed
             diagnosis of low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
             that has relapsed or is refractory. For the Phase II portion of the study, patients
             must have a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of low-grade or follicular,
             CD20-positive, B-cell, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Follicular, predominantly small cleaved
             or follicular, mixed small cleaved and large cell, International Working Formulation
             classification B or C or REAL classification follicular center grade 1,2) that has
             relapsed or is refractory.

          -  Previously treated with at least one anti-cancer regimen for NHL

          -  Measurable disease (lesions that can be accurately measured in 2 dimensions by CT scan
             with a greatest transverse diameter of &gt;/= to 2cm or palpable lesions with both
             diameters of 2cm or more)

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

             treatment toxicity to Grade 1 or less, exclusive of alopecia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior combination therapy with rituximab and CAMPATH; prior therapy with either agent
             alone is permitted

          -  A history of a T-cell lymphoma

          -  Known AIDS-related HIV-positive lymphoma

          -  For the Phase II portion of the study (once MTD has been determined), bulky disease,
             ie, any single mass &gt;10cm or circulating malignant cells of 25,000/uL or more

          -  Prior autologous bone marrow or stem cell transplant within 6 months of study entry

          -  Prior allogeneic bone marrow transplant or organ transplant

          -  Prior radiotherapy to the only site of measurable disease

          -  Medical condition requiring chronic use of oral, high-dose corticosteroids

          -  Use of investigational agents within 30 days of study enrollment

          -  Diagnosis of another malignancy within the previous five (5) years, unless the
             probability of recurrence of the prior malignancy is &lt; 5%. Patients with curatively
             treated early stage squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and patients with a history of
             malignant tumor in the past that have been disease-free for at least 5 years

          -  Active central nervous system (CNS) involvement with lymphoma

          -  Pregnant or nursing women

          -  Any significant concurrent disease or illness that would, in the opinion of the
