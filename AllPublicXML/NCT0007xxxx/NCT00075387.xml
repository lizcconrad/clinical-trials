  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving combination chemotherapy with or
      without sodium thiosulfate works in preventing low platelet count while treating patients
      with malignant brain tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin,
      cyclophosphamide, and etoposide phosphate, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Sodium thiosulfate may prevent low platelet counts in patients receiving
      chemotherapy. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective with or
      without sodium thiosulfate in preventing low platelet count during treatment for brain
      tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effect of delayed administration of sodium thiosulfate on the rates of
      platelet toxicity (i.e. platelet count less than 20,000), in subjects with high-grade glioma
      undergoing treatment with carboplatin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide/etoposide phosphate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess tumor response in subjects with high-grade glioma undergoing treatment with
      carboplatin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide/etoposide phosphate, with or without delayed
      sodium thiosulfate.

      II. Assess the effect of delayed administration of sodium thiosulfate on granulocyte and
      erythrocyte counts, in subjects undergoing treatment with carboplatin, cyclophosphamide and
      etoposide/etoposide phosphate.

      III. Assess hearing changes, if any, at the higher frequencies in the standard testing range
      (4000 and 8000 Hertz [Hz]), and at higher frequencies above standard testing (9000 to 16000
      Hz).

      IV. Assess quality of life in subjects undergoing treatment with carboplatin,
      cyclophosphamide and etoposide phosphate.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV), etoposide phosphate IV, and
      carboplatin intra-arterially (IA) over 10 minutes on day 1.

      ARM II: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV, etoposide phosphate IV, and carboplatin IA as
      in Arm I. Patients also receive sodium thiosulfate IV over 15 minutes 4 and 8 hours after
      carboplatin.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
