      Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining GTI-2040 with docetaxel in treating
      patients who have recurrent, metastatic, or unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer, prostate cancer, or other solid tumors. GTI-2040 may stop the growth of cancer cells
      by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. It may also increase the effectiveness of
      docetaxel by making the tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Combining GTI-2040 with
      docetaxel may kill more tumor cells

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the recommended phase II dose of GTI-2040 and docetaxel in patients with
      recurrent, metastatic, or unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, prostate
      cancer, or other solid tumors (phase I study closed to accrual as of 8/5/2004).

      II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the objective
      tumor response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      IV. Determine the stable disease rate, time to disease progression, objective response
      duration, and duration of stable disease in patients treated with this regimen.

      V. Determine the pharmacokinetics of GTI-2040 when administered in combination with docetaxel
      in these patients.

      VI. Correlate the pharmacokinetics of GTI-2040 with the biological and toxic effects of this
      regimen in these patients.

      VII. Correlate baseline and post-treatment levels of ribonucleotide reductase activity in
      tumor biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumoral expression of c-myc, ras,
      pRAF1, pMAPK, and markers of apoptosis with clinical outcome in patients treated with this
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Phase I (closed to accrual as of 8/5/2004): Patients receive GTI-2040 IV continuously on days
      1-14. Patients also receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 3 during course 1 and on day 1
      for all subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of GTI-2040 and docetaxel until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is defined
      as the dose preceding the MTD.

      Phase II: Patients receive GTI-2040 and docetaxel at the RP2D as in phase I.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-48 patients (12-18 for phase I [closed to accrual as of
      8/5/2004] and 15-30 for phase II) will be accrued for this study within 4-16 months.
