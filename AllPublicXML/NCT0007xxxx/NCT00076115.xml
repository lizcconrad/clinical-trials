      A clinical study to determine the safety and effectiveness of risperidone compared with
      placebo in the treatment of bipolar disorder (manic or mixed type) in children and
      adolescents aged 10 to 17 years.

      Subjects will be aged 10 to 17 years with a diagnosis of Bipolar I disorder and suffering
      from a current mixed or manic episode. On enrollment, subjects will be assigned to receive 1
      of 3 treatments (oral placebo tablets, oral risperidone tablets 0.5 to 2.5 mg, or oral
      risperidone tablets 3 to 6 mg), which will be administered daily for 3 weeks. Study
      medication will be increased to the target dosage during the first 7 days, then further
      increased within the target dosage range reached until maximum tolerated dose is reached by
      day 10. The maximum tolerated dose will be given for the last 12 days of the study.
      Risperidone (0.5 to 2.5 mg or 3 to 6 mg doses) or placebo given orally as 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3,
      or 4 mg tablets (or matching placebo) each day for 3 weeks.
