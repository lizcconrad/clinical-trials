      RATIONALE: Hormone replacement therapy may be effective in relieving symptoms of menopause,
      such as hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness, without causing a recurrence of
      breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying hormone replacement therapy to see how
      well it works in relieving symptoms of menopause in postmenopausal women with previous stage
      I or stage II breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare disease-free survival and overall survival of postmenopausal women with prior
           stage I or II breast cancer treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) vs
           nonhormonal alternatives to HRT.

        -  Compare relief of menopausal symptoms and quality of life of patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare cardiovascular and osteoporotic events in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, age (&lt; 40 years vs ≥ 40 years), and years from diagnosis (≤ 2 vs &gt; 2 to
      &lt; 5 vs ≥ 5). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral or transdermal HRT comprising estrogen with or without
           progesterone for at least 2 years.

        -  Arm II: Patients are offered advice on nonhormonal HRT alternatives. Menopausal symptoms
           are assessed at baseline, at 3, 6, and 12 months, every 6 months for 4 years, and then
           annually thereafter. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at 3, 6, and 12 months,
           every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years and then annually thereafter.

      Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,800-3,000 patients (1,400-1,500 per treatment arm) will be
      accrued for this study.
