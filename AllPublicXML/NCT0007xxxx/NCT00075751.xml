    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining bortezomib with gemcitabine and
      carboplatin in treating patients who have advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer
      that has not been previously treated with chemotherapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      gemcitabine and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they
      stop growing or die. Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes
      necessary for their growth. Bortezomib may also help gemcitabine and carboplatin kill more
      tumor cells by making the cells more sensitive to the drugs

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess overall survival in chemo-naÏŠve patients with advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) treated with combination of gemcitabine, carboplatin and PS-341.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess response rate (confirmed plus unconfirmed, complete plus partial), in the subset
      of patients with measurable disease, progression-free survival and quantitative toxicities in
      this group of patients treated with this regimen.

      II. To investigate in an exploratory manner, the association of levels of hypoxia-induced
      secreted proteins and tumor DNA in plasma levels of apoptosis-associated proteins in tumor
      tissue, and the changes in the levels of PS-341 modulated proteins in peripheral white blood
      cells with patient response and survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, carboplatin IV over 15-30
      minutes on day 1, and bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease may continue to receive
      bortezomib alone on the above schedule for up to 1 year at the discretion of the treating
      physician.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for up to 3 years after registration.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 99 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically proven selected stage IIIB (T4
             lesion due to malignant pleural effusion) or stage IV, advanced non-small cell lung
             cancer or recurrent disease after previous surgery and/or radiation

          -  Patients with known brain metastases are not eligible for this clinical trial because
             of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events;
             all patients must have a pretreatment CT or MRI scan of the brain to evaluate for CNS
             disease within 28 days prior to registration

          -  Patients must have measurable OR non-measurable disease documented by CT, MRI, or
             x-ray; measurable disease must be assessed within 28 days prior to registration and
             non-measurable disease must be assessed within 42 days prior to registration; pleural
             effusions, ascites and laboratory parameters are not acceptable as the only evidence
             of disease

          -  Patients must not have received any prior systemic chemotherapy or biological agent
             for non-small cell lung cancer; prior radiation is permitted; however, two weeks must
             have elapsed since the completion of prior radiation therapy and patients must have
             recovered from all associated toxicities at the time of registration; measurable or
             non-measurable disease must be outside the previous radiation field or a new lesion
             inside the port must be present

          -  At least two weeks must have elapsed since surgery (thoracic or other major surgeries)
             and patients must have recovered from all associated toxicities at the time of
             registration

          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; the institutional upper limit of normal OR a creatinine clearance
             &gt;= 60 cc/min; these tests must have been performed within 28 days prior to
             registration

          -  ANC &gt;= 1500/ul obtained within 14 days prior to registration

          -  Platelet count &gt;= 100,000/ul obtained within 14 days prior to registration

          -  Serum bilirubin =&lt; institutional upper limit of normal obtained within 28 days prior
             to registration

          -  SGOT or SGPT =&lt; 2.5 x the institutional upper limit of normal obtained within 28 days
             prior to registration

          -  All patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0-1

          -  Peripheral neuropathy, if present, must be =&lt; grade 1 (NCI Common Terminology Criteria
             for Adverse Events version 3.0)

          -  Correlative science studies: Institutions must have IRB approval of S9925 (the Lung
             Cancer Specimen Repository); patients must be offered participation in S9925; with the
             patient's consent, tumor tissue, blood and plasma will be submitted for testing via
             S9925; patients must be registered separately to S9925 in order for institutions to
             receive credit for specimen submissions

          -  Patients known to be HIV positive and receiving anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) are
             not eligible for this study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions

          -  Patients must not be planning to receive any other concomitant anticancer treatment
             including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biologic agents or any other
             investigational drugs

          -  Patients should not have known hypersensitivity to boron, mannitol, or PS-341; if day
             28 or 42 falls on a weekend or holiday, the limit may be extended to the next working
             day; in calculating days of tests and measurements, the day a test or measurement is
             done is considered day 0; therefore, if a test is done on a Monday, the Monday four
             weeks later would be considered day 28; this allows for efficient patient scheduling
             without exceeding the guidelines

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated
             stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission or
             other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years

          -  Pregnant or nursing women may not participate in this trial because of the increased
             risk of fetal harm including fetal death from the chemotherapeutic agents; women/men
             of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an
             effective contraceptive method

          -  Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign
             and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal
             guidelines

          -  At the time of patient registration, the treating institution's name and ID number
             must be provided to the Data Operations Center in Seattle in order to ensure that the
             current (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study
             has been entered into the data base
