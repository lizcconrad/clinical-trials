      This study will evaluate how well different medications work to relieve pain following third
      molar (wisdom tooth) extraction. Scientists believe that hormone-like substances called
      prostanoids contribute to pain following oral surgery. Prostanoids are produced by
      cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. This study will examine how different medicines inhibit the COX
      enzymes and reduce the amount of prostanoids, and thus the amount of inflammation and pain.
      The study will also look at genetic factors involved in the production of prostanoids and the
      response to pain medication. (Only the bottom two wisdom teeth are extracted for this study.
      Patients whose top wisdom teeth also need to be removed will have those teeth extracted, also
      free of charge, at least 2 weeks after the first surgery.)

      Healthy normal volunteers between 16 and 35 years of age who are in general good health and
      who require third molar extraction may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened
      with a medical history and oral examination, including dental x-rays as needed to confirm the
      need for third molar removal.

      On the morning of surgery, patients have blood drawn to obtain DNA for genetic study. Women
      of childbearing age have a urine pregnancy test. One hour before surgery, patients receive a
      dose of rofecoxib (Vioxx® (Registered Trademark)), acetaminophen (Tylenol® (Registered
      Trademark)), or placebo (a pill with no active ingredient). A half-hour before surgery, they
      receive either a standard painkiller called keterolac (Toradol® (Registered Trademark))) or
      placebo through an arm vein. All patients also receive the sedative midazolam (Versed®
      (Registered Trademark)), also through an arm vein, to induce drowsiness and a local
      anesthetic (lidocaine) to numb the mouth. After the mouth is numbed, but before the wisdom
      teeth are extracted, a biopsy (removal of a small piece of tissue) is conducted in the area
      of the cheek next to the wisdom tooth.

      After the surgery, a small piece of tubing is placed into both extraction sites. Every 20
      minutes for the next 3 hours, inflammatory fluid is collected from the tubing to measure
      chemicals that are believed to cause pain and swelling. Patients complete questionnaires
      every 20 minutes to rate their pain. Those who still have pain an hour after surgery may
      request and receive a &quot;rescue drug&quot; called tramadol (Ultram® (Registered Trademark)) for pain
      relief. Patients remain in the clinic from 3 to 6 hours to monitor the effects of the study
      drugs as the anesthetic wears off.

      After surgery a second biopsy is done to measure any changes in the chemicals being produced
      in response to the surgery. For this biopsy, patients are assigned to one of two groups - one
      group has the second biopsy within 3 hours of surgery, before taking the rescue drug, and the
      other group returns to the clinic the next morning for a biopsy 24 hours after surgery.
      Patients in the second group leave the clinic after surgery with two pain medications
      (tramadol and the study drug) and forms to record pain ratings at home. They are permitted to
      take only the pain medications provided and only at certain times.

      At the end of their participation in the study, all patients are given the pain medication
      flurbiprofen (Ocufen® (Registered Trademark)) to take at home.

      Two cyclooxygenase isozymes, COX-1 and -2, are known to catalyze the rate-limiting step of
      prostaglandin synthesis and are the targets of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
      Recently, the presence of a variant of COX-1, named COX-3, has been demonstrated that is
      especially sensitive to acetaminophen and strongly expressed in brain tissue. The proposed
      study will examine prostanoid suppression in the periphery by inhibition of COX-1, -2, and
      -3, and evaluate the time course of expression of COX isoenzymes in terms of level of mRNA
      and protein itself.

      Subjects (N equals 88) will be healthy volunteers scheduled for the surgical removal of
      impacted third molars. Using a double-blinded, randomized, parallel study design, subjects
      will be allocated to one of four treatment groups and will be administered a dose of blinded
      medication or placebo. One hour prior to oral surgery, rofecoxib 50 mg, acetaminophen 1000 mg
      or placebo in two groups will be administered orally. Half hour prior to surgery, ketorolac
      30 mg or placebo, will be administered intravenously. Microdialysis will be performed with
      sample collection concurrent with pain report over the immediate postoperative period of
      three hours, and the collected transudate will be analyzed by ELISA to evaluate prostanoid
      (prostaglandin E2, thromboxane B2) production. Subjects within each group will be further
      randomized to have a biopsy collected at baseline prior to surgery and either at the time
      when a subject asks for rescue drug within 3 hours or at 24 hours following surgery. The
      biopsies will be frozen in liquid nitrogen and assayed later by RT-PCR for levels of COX-1,
      COX-2, or COX-3 mRNA, and by microarray for evaluation of change in overall mRNA expression.
      A portion of the biopsy samples will be immunostained to reveal the tissue-specific pattern
      of each COX isoenzymes expression within the inflammatory tissue, and another part of the
      biopsy samples will be analyzed by Western blot to quantify the amount of protein. Fifty ml
      of blood will be collected from all subjects, and the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      in the genes regulated by inflammatory responses such as COX-1, COX-2, PGE receptors (EPs),
      and microsomal PGE synthase (mPGES) genes, will be analyzed to investigate the role of
      genetic factors in individual differences of drug responses. The analgesic effect of the
      drugs will be assessed in the clinic every 20 minutes for the first three hours after
      extractions, and on the next morning before taking any medication using two pain intensity
      assessment instruments: a category scale, and a visual analog scale (VAS).

      We anticipate that non-selective COX inhibitor, the selective COX-2 inhibitor, and the
      selective COX-3 inhibitor will differentially alter prostanoid production over the time
      course evaluated, and that primary sensory neurons innervating in the inflammatory tissues
      may differentially express COX isoenzymes that differ in sensitivity to prototypic NSAIDs,
      coxibs, and acetaminophen. We also anticipate that several SNPs will contribute to the
      individual differences in COX expression and drug responses, which has implications for
      individual variation in pain, analgesic responses, and neuronal plasticity.
