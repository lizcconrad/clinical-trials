      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may make the body build an immune response to kill
      tumor cells. Biological therapies, such as BCG and sargramostim, use different ways to
      stimulate the immune system and stop tumor cells from growing. Combining vaccine therapy with
      biological therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of giving vaccine therapy together
      with BCG and sargramostim in treating patients who have undergone cystectomy for transitional
      cell cancer of the bladder.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of NY-ESO-1 peptide vaccine, BCG, and sargramostim
           (GM-CSF) in post-cystectomy patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder
           expressing NY-ESO-1 or LAGE-1 antigen.

        -  Determine the immunological profile (NY-ESO-1 antibody, CD8+ cells, and delayed-type
           hypersensitivity) induced by this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study.

      Patients receive NY-ESO-1 peptide vaccine mixed with BCG intradermally (ID) once weekly on
      weeks 1 and 2. Patients then receive NY-ESO-1 peptide mixed with sargramostim (GM-CSF) ID
      once weekly on day 2 of weeks 3-6. Patients also receive GM-CSF subcutaneously alone on days
      1, 3, 4, and 5 of weeks 3-6. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 2 and 6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-28 patients (8 HLA-A2 positive with prior intravesical BCG,
      8 HLA-A2 positive without prior intravesical BCG, 4-6 HLA-A2 negative with prior intravesical
      BCG, and 4-6 HLA-A2 negative without prior intravesical BCG) will be accrued for this study
      within 15 months.
