  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients experiencing a first episode of psychosis may have brain cell damage due to a
      chemical process called oxidation. This study will compare patients with psychosis to healthy
      volunteers to determine if there are differences in their blood that reflect oxidative brain
      cell damage.

      Preliminary research indicated that impaired antioxidant defense and increased lipid
      peroxidation is associated with brain changes during the onset of psychosis. Oxidative cell
      injury may contribute to poor outcomes in some patients. This study will define the extent
      and nature of oxidative cell injury that is associated with psychopathology at the onset of
      psychosis.

      Participants in this study will be patients at the D. D. Eisenhower Army Medical Center who
      are experiencing a psychotic episode for the first time. Patients will be compared with 40
      healthy volunteers (control group) matched with patients for age, gender, education, ethnic
      background, and occupational status. Patients and volunteers will have blood tests to
      determine the level of oxidative cell injury. Tests will be performed at onset of psychosis,
      and after 6 and 12 weeks of neuroleptic drug treatment. Medical histories and MRI scans will
      be used to examine the relationship of the laboratory tests to the clinical presentation.
