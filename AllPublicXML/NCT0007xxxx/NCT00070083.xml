      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can locate cancer cells and either kill
      them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone, use
      different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Oblimersen may
      increase the effectiveness of a chemotherapy drug by making cancer cells more sensitive to
      the drug. Combining oblimersen with rituximab and combination chemotherapy may kill more
      cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of oblimersen when
      given together with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone in
      treating patients with stage II, stage III, or stage IV large B-cell lymphoma

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility and safety of oblimersen administered in combination with
           rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone, in terms of
           short-term and long-term toxicity, in patients with previously untreated stage III or IV
           or extensive or bulky stage II diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oblimersen administered with this regimen in
           these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the remission rate and failure-free, progression-free, and overall survival of
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, non-blinded, multicenter, dose-escalation study of
      oblimersen.

      Patients receive CHOP-R* therapy comprising cyclophosphamide IV over 15-45 minutes,
      doxorubicin IV over 5-10 minutes, vincristine IV, and rituximab IV over 30-90 minutes on day
      1 and oral prednisone on days 1-5. Patients also receive oblimersen IV continuously on days
      -4 to 3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6-8 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who discontinue treatment due to unacceptable
      toxicity to oblimersen may continue to receive standard therapy comprising CHOP-R.

      NOTE: *Patients treated at the British Columbia Cancer Agency receive cyclophosphamide,
      doxorubicin, vincristine, and rituximab on days 1 and 2 and prednisone as above.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oblimersen until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, at least 10
      patients are treated at that dose level.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months
      for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-28 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-10
      months.
