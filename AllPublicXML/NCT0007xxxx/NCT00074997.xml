  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of administration of a
      cell-delivered ribozyme gene transfer product to participants with chronic (lasting a long
      time) Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) infection (a life-threatening infection
      which you can get from an infected person's blood or from having sex with an infected
      person).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the participant
      nor the physician know the study medication drug name), placebo (an inactive substance that
      is compared with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial) controlled
      study to investigate safety and efficacy of administration of autologous cluster of
      differentiation 34 (CD34+) cells transduced with placebo or an anti-HIV-ribozyme (OZ1) in
      participants with HIV-1 infection. The total study duration will be 100 weeks and will
      include following visits: screening, pre-infusion Days 1-7, Day 8, Week 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20,
      24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64,
      68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96 and 100. Before the administration of CD34+ final cell
      product, a number of procedures will be performed, including the injection of granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to mobilize the CD34+ cells, apheresis and the transduction
      of the CD34+ cells with either OZ1 or placebo. Participants will be divided into two groups:
      one group will receive OZ1-containing CD34+ cells, the other group will receive CD34+ cells
      alone and will receive a single intravenous infusion (a fluid or a medicine delivered into a
      vein by way of a needle) of CD34+ cells transduced with either placebo or OZ1 gene transfer
      product. The final cell product contains approximately 2-20 x 10^7 cells/kilogram autologous
      CD34+ cell suspension transduced with either placebo or OZ1 gene transfer product. Primary
      efficacy will be assessed primarily by the amount of HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) (viral load).
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
