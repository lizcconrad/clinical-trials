  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well gefitinib works in treating patients with
      progressive metastatic neuroendocrine tumors. Gefitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the 6 month progression free survival rate in patients with progressive,
      advanced neuroendocrine tumors treated with ZD1839.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Objective tumor response rate. II. Progression free survival and time to progression. III.
      Improvement in circulating hormone levels. IV. Overall survival V. We will explore the
      molecular characterization of these tumors in attempt to understand the role of EGFR
      expression and its inhibition with ZD1839 in neuroendocrine tumors. The measurements will be
      performed on pretreatment and post-treatment tumor biopsies when possible: EGFR expression
      and gene amplification (IHC for EGFR and phosphorylated EGFR, ISH for gene amplification);
      Activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway (IHC for phosphorylated MAPK); Cell proliferation
      (Ki-67 staining); Apoptosis (TUNEL assay).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease type
      (carcinoid vs islet cell and other neuroendocrine tumors).

      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up
      to 2 years from study entry.

    <description>If patients are lost to follow-up or discontinue active monitoring prior to 6 months post-registration, we will consider censoring them for the evaluation of the primary endpoint. Here, Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate the final success proportion (ie, 6 month success rate with a 95% confidence interval). Otherwise, ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated according to the approach of Duffy and Santner.</description>

          -  Any of the following:

               -  Gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication

               -  History of dry eye syndrome or Sjogren syndrome

               -  Congenital abnormality

               -  Abnormal slit-lamp examination using a vital dye (e.g.: fluorescein or
                  Bengal-rose)

               -  Abnormal corneal sensitivity test (Schirmer test)

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to:

               -  Ongoing or active infection

                  requirement

          -  Known brain metastases; Note: These patients are excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  Known HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy; Note: These
             patients are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions
             with ZD1839 and because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of
             lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies
             will be undertaken in patients receiving combination and anti-retroviral therapy when
             indicated

          -  Concurrent or recent use (≤ 7 days prior to ZD1839 administration) of phenytoin,
             carbamazepine, barbiturates, rifampicin, oxcarbazepine, rifapentine, modafinil, or St.
             John's Wort; Note: Because these drugs induce CYP3A4 enzymes and can cause reductions
             in ZD1839 plasma concentrations below levels thought to be biologically active,
             patients with concurrent or recent use of these drugs are excluded from the study

          -  History of other invasive malignancy ≤ the previous 3 years, except for adequately
             treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix
