  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of a new HIV vaccine. The vaccine in
      this study is mixed with a chemical called alum to improve the body's response to the
      vaccine. Healthy adults who are not infected with HIV may participate in the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EnvPro is a recombinant, purified envelope protein vaccine with an aluminum hydroxide (alum)
      adjuvant. Aluminum hydroxide is licensed as an adjuvant in other vaccines, such as the
      hepatitis B vaccine. This study will examine the safety and tolerability of EnvPro with alum
      adjuvant in healthy, HIV uninfected adults.

      All participants in this study will receive vaccine injections in the upper arm muscle.
      Participants will receive a second vaccine injection eight weeks after the first injection.
      Blood tests will be performed at study visits before the vaccine is given, during the eight
      weeks between injections, and at selected times for up to three years after the vaccine is
      given.
