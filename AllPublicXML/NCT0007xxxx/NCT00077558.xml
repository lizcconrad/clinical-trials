    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fludarabine, work in different ways to stop
      cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. 3-AP may help fludarabine kill more
      cancer cells by making them more sensitive to the drug.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of fludarabine when
      given together with 3-AP in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia,
      chronic leukemia, or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the feasibility and tolerability of 3-AP (Triapine^® ) followed by fludarabine
           in patients with relapsed or refractory acute or chronic leukemia or high-risk
           myelodysplastic syndromes.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of fludarabine. Patients are stratified
      according to disease (acute leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes [MDS] vs chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia and prolymphocytic leukemia). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment
      groups.

        -  Group 1 (chronic lymphocytic leukemia or prolymphocytic leukemia): Patients receive 3-AP
           (Triapine^®) IV over 4 hours and fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of fludarabine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 10 additional
      patients are treated at that dose level.

        -  Group 2 (acute leukemias or MDS): Patients receive 3-AP IV continuously over 24 hours on
           day 1. Beginning within 4 hours after completion of 3-AP, patients receive fludarabine
           IV over 30 minutes on days 2-6.

      In both groups, treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-34 patients will be accrued for this study.
