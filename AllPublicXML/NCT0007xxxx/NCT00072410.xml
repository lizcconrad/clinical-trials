      RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and deliver radioactive
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Giving radiolabeled monoclonal
      antibody directly into the abdominal cavity may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of giving radiolabeled monoclonal antibody
      therapy directly into the abdominal cavity in treating patients who have advanced ovarian
      epithelial cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of intraperitoneal yttrium Y 90
           monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 (Y90 MOAB Hu3S193) in patients with advanced ovarian
           epithelial cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the localization and whole body and abdominal clearance of this drug in these
           patients using indium In 111 monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 and gamma camera imaging.

        -  Determine the serum pharmacokinetics of Y90 MOAB Hu3S193 in these patients using gamma
           well counting.

        -  Determine the antibody response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 (Y90
      MOAB Hu3S193).

      Patients receive intraperitoneal (IP) technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid and undergo abdominal
      imaging on day 1. Provided distribution of technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid is deemed
      adequate, patients then receive IP Y90 MOAB Hu3S193 and IP indium In 111 monoclonal antibody
      Hu3S193 (for imaging) over 30 minutes on day 1. Within 3-5 hours after antibody
      administration, patients undergo whole body imaging and single-photon emission-computed
      tomography (SPECT) imaging of the abdomen and pelvis.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Y90 MOAB Hu3S193 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for at least 2 years and then every 6 months for up to 5
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
