  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DTGM belongs to a new generation of drugs designed to target leukemic cells. To achieve this,
      DTGM takes advantage of the ability of naturally-produced growth factor (GM,
      granulocyte-macrophage stimulating factor) to deliver a drug (diphtheria toxin) to cells;
      preferably leukemic cells. It then attaches to the cells and allows the toxin to enter the
      leukemic cells and destroy them.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of malignant myeloid progenitor cells express receptors for GM-CSF. The fusion
      of GM-CSF with diphtheria toxin allows a targeting of cells with GM-CSF receptors for effects
      of the toxin while sparing GM-CSF receptor-lacking multipotent stem cells. The great majority
      of AML cells express GM-CSF receptors and DT388GMCSF has shown selective killing of AML and
      CMML progenitors in vitro while sparing normal progenitor cells. When administered as a
      single bolus to rodents, adequate blood DT388GMCSF biological activity was found to kill
      several logs of leukemic cells. A phase I clinical trial of DT388GMCSF given as a daily bolus
      i.v. infusion for up to 5 consecutive days was completed in 38 patients. The study defined
      liver toxicity as the DLT. The liver toxicity was observed only in patients &gt; 50 years and
      receiving steroids. Responses were seen in four patients consisting of one complete remission
      and 3 partial remission of short duration. Peak drug levels were inversely proportional to
      pre-treatment DT388GMCSF antibody levels.

      Because of the observed significant preclinical activity in AML and CMML, clinical activity
      in chemorefractory patients with AML, the association of toxicities with steroid exposure,
      and association of the drug level with antibody titer that could be decreased with DT388GMCSF
      exposure, the current follow up phase I trial is designed based on a new administration and
      is a dose - finding trial also aimed to better determine and control side effects, improve
      drug pharmacokinetics and provide initial insight into antileukemic activity of this novel
      agent, delivered at a prolonged intermittent schedule.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with refractory or relapsed AML ( marrow blasts &gt; 20% ), must have failed
             induction therapy or have relapsed after CR duration &lt; 6 months following induction
             therapy, untreated or refractory to salvage chemotherapy. Relapsed AML patients with
             CR duration &gt; 6 months or previously untreated patients refusing chemotherapy and not
             considered for treatments of higher priority are also eligible.

          -  Patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) who failed at least one course of
             chemo- or biological therapy( including trial of erythropoietin), or patients with
             relapsed CMML. Previously untreated CMML patients with HB &lt; or = 12 g / dL, not
             eligible for protocols of higher priority or not wishing to receive chemotherapy.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of &lt; 2.

          -  Patients must have WBC count &lt; 10,000/mL prior to initiating the treatment. The WBC
             count must be stabilized below this level for at least three days by leukopheresis or
             hydroxyurea. Hydroxyurea must be discontinued one day prior to initiation of
             DT388GMCSF treatment.

          -  Patients must have creatinine &lt; 1.6 times ULN: bilirubin &lt;1.6 times ULN; SGPT &lt; 2.6 x
             ULN; albumin &gt; 3 gm/dl; adequate cardiac function (EF &gt;44%), oxygen saturation &gt; 92%
             without exogenous oxygen administered.
