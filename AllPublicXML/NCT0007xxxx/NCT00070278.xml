      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and
      gemcitabine use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.
      Giving combination chemotherapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it can be removed
      during surgery. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective
      in treating early breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying different regimens of combination
      chemotherapy to compare how well they work in treating women who are undergoing surgery for
      early invasive breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the complete pathological response rate in women with poor-risk early breast
           cancer treated with neoadjuvant sequential epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel
           with vs without gemcitabine.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the effect of these regimens on prognostic factors in these patients.

        -  Correlate molecular profiles, specific gene mutations, and genomic and gene expression
           changes with clinical outcome in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the health economics associated with this study.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      estrogen-receptor status (negative vs greater than 10% positive cells), HER-2 status
      (positive vs negative), tumor size (30-50 mm vs greater than 50 mm), and clinical involvement
      of axillary nodes (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

        -  Neoadjuvant sequential chemotherapy:

             -  Arm I: Patients receive epirubicin IV and cyclophosphamide IV on day 1. Treatment
                repeats every 21 days for 4 courses. Patients then receive paclitaxel IV over 3
                hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel as in arm I followed by epirubicin and
                cyclophosphamide as in arm I.

             -  Arm III: Patients receive epirubicin and cyclophosphamide as in arm I followed by
                paclitaxel as in arm I and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8.
                Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses.

             -  Arm IV: Patients receive paclitaxel as in arm I and gemcitabine as in arm III
                followed by epirubicin and cyclophosphamide as in arm I.

        -  Surgery: After completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients in all arms undergo
           definitive surgery.

      Tumor tissue is removed from a subset of patients during serial biopsies. Molecular and
      genetic profiling, mutation analysis, and comparative genomic analysis is performed on the
      tissue samples.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after 4 courses of chemotherapy, after the
      completion of chemotherapy, after surgery, and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years and then every 3 months for 3 years.

      Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 800 patients (200 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
