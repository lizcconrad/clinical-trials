  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety of Zenapax (daclizumab) in patients with multiple
      sclerosis (MS). MS is thought to be caused by an over-reactive immune response. T-lymphocytes
      (cells of the immune system), are thought to damage myelin, a substance that covers the nerve
      and parts of the spinal cord and is damaged in patients with MS. Interleukin-2 is a natural
      substance in the body that is necessary for the growth of T-lymphocytes. Zenapax is a
      genetically engineered antibody that blocks the activity of interleukin-2 and thus interferes
      with the growth of lymphocytes. Therefore, Zenapax may prevent some of the damage to myelin
      that occurs in multiple sclerosis.

      Patients between 18 and 65 years of age with relapsing remitting MS may be eligible for this
      study. Patients with secondary-progressive or primary progressive MS may not participate.
      Candidates will be screened with a complete neurological and medical evaluation and review of
      medical records.

      Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:

        -  Baseline evaluation: Participants have four magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans over
           a 3-month period to assess disease activity. For the MRI scans, the patient lies on a
           table that slides into the scanner - a narrow metal cylinder with a strong magnetic
           field. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours, with most scans lasting between
           45 and 90 minutes. Only patients with activity at or above a certain level are eligible
           to continue with the treatment phase of the study.

        -  Zenapax treatment: Patients receive intravenous (through a vein) infusions of Zenapax.
           The first two infusions are 2 weeks apart, followed by 13 monthly infusions.

        -  MRI scans: Patients undergo MRI scanning before every infusion to evaluate disease
           activity and identify new brain lesions.

        -  Blood and urine tests: Blood and urine samples are collected at each clinic visit for
           routine laboratory evaluations, immunologic study, and genetic testing to determine a
           predisposition for responding to Zenapax treatment.

        -  Lumbar puncture (spinal tap): This procedure will be done during the last month before
           starting treatment and during the seventh month of treatment to examine immune changes
           that occur in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which circulates through and surrounds the
           brain and spinal cord. A local anesthetic is given and a needle is inserted in the space
           between the bones in the lower back where the CSF circulates below the spinal cord. A
           small amount of fluid is collected through the needle.

        -  Skin test: A needle is placed just under the skin is done to assess the patient's immune
           status to common antigens such as tetanus, mumps and candida.

        -  Lymphocytopheresis: Lymphocytes are collected three times - once during the last month
           of baseline before starting treatment, once during the fifth month of treatment, and
           once during the last month of treatment - for immunologic study. Blood is collected
           through a needle in an arm vein in a similar way to donating blood. The blood flows from
           the vein through a catheter (plastic tube) into a machine that separates it into its
           components by centrifugation (spinning). The lymphocytes are removed and the rest of the
           blood (red cells, plasma and platelets) is returned to the body, either through the same
           needle or through another needle in the other arm.

      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease leading to central
      nervous system (CNS) inflammation, demyelination, axonal loss, and leads to substantial
      disability in young adults. Existing approved treatments include interferon beta, glatiramer
      acetate and mitoxantrone. These therapies are only moderately effective in reducing disease
      activity.

      The Neuroimmunology Branch (NIB) has during the last three years tested the tolerability and
      safety of monthly intravenously administered daclizumab (Zenapax(Registered Trademark)), a
      humanized monoclonal antibody against the IL-2 receptor alpha chain, in patients who receive
      interferon-beta, but responded incompletely to therapy with interferon-beta. Daclizumab has
      been well tolerated and inhibited inflammatory disease activity by almost 90%. Under an
      amendment of this protocol, it was demonstrated that the efficacy of daclizumab is maintained
      once interferon-beta therapy is discontinued.

      In the current trial, we will test the efficacy of daclizumab alone in relapsing-remitting MS
      patients. This trial is a single-centre, open-label, baseline to treatment cross-over phase
      II trial. Daclizumab will be administered intravenously at 1mg/kg bodyweight.
      Contrast-enhancing MRI lesions will serve as the primary outcome measure in this phase II
      trial, and a number of clinical, MRI, and immunological parameters will be measured as
      secondary and tertiary outcomes. Daclizumab is a promising new immunomodulatory treatment for
      relapsing-remitting MS.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PRE-TREATMENT SCREENING:

        To be eligible for entry into the study, patients must meet the following criteria at the
        time of enrollment. Re-assessment of the inclusion criteria will occur on day zero of the
        twelve-month treatment phase.

        Between the ages of 18 and 65 years, inclusive.

        Patients with relapsing-remitting MS according to published criteria.

        EDSS score between 1.0 and 5.5.

        Patients have either failed standard therapies (interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate) by
        clinical measures, or are not eligible for standard therapies, or opted not to start or
        continue with any of the standard therapies.

        Patients are able to provide written, informed consent prior to any testing under this
        protocol, including screening and baseline investigations that are not considered part of
        routine patient care.

        Age criteria for inclusion in this study follow those of published diagnostic criteria for
        multiple sclerosis. Due to the uncommon occurrence of MS in individuals under the age of 18
        and the requirement to study a large MS cohort to include these rarely occurring patients,
        this is an appropriate lower age range.

        Patient decision not to start, or not to continue with standard immunomodulatory therapy,
        has to be made by the patient after discussing conventional treatment options to ensure the
        patient has made an informed decision. Additionally, the consent document provided to the
        patient will explicitly state the currently approved therapies and their potential
        benefits.

        ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INITIATING THERAPY:

        To be eligible to proceed to the treatment phase of the study, patients must have at least
        two new gadolinium-enhancing lesions or greater in the four sequential baseline MRI scans
        (average of greater than or equal to 0.5 gadolinium-enhancing lesions or more).

        Patients can not have a relapse during 30 days before initiation of treatment. If a relapse
        occurs during this period and eligibility criteria are otherwise fulfilled, treatment (day
        one) will be delayed while corticosteroids are administered. If corticosteroids are
        administered, the MRI during that period will not be considered. An additional MRI will be
        added at 4 weeks following the completion of corticosteroids, to maintain a total of four
        MRI's that are analyzed in the baseline period. In the event of relapse, the baseline
        period will be prolonged, as necessary, to meet these criteria.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PRE-TREATMENT SCREENING:

        Patients will be excluded from the study if any of the exclusion criteria exist at the time
        of enrollment. Re-assessment of the exclusion criteria will occur on day zero of the twelve
        month treatment phase.

        MEDICAL HISTORY:

        Diagnosis of secondary-progressive or primary-progressive MS, as defined by published
        diagnostic criteria.

        Abnormal screening/baseline blood tests exceeding any of the limits defined below:

          -  Serum alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase levels which are greater than
             three times the upper limit of normal values.

          -  Total white blood cell count less than 3000/mm(3)

          -  Platelet count less than 85000/mm(3)

          -  Serum creatinine level greater than 2.0 mg/dl

          -  Serological evidence of HIV or active hepatitis A, B or C infection since the effects
             of daclizumab are not defined in these patients

          -  Positive pregnancy test

        Pregnant or breast-feeding female.

        History or signs of immunodeficiency.

        Concurrent clinically significant (as determined by the investigators) cardiac,
        immunological, pulmonary, neurological, renal or other major disease.

        Any contraindication to monoclonal antibody therapy. Contraindication to monoclonal
        antibody therapy includes prior history of serum-sickness or similar hypersensitivity
        reaction to receipt of monoclonal antibody or intravenous immunoglobulin therapies.

        Patients with cognitive impairments who are unable to provide written, informed consent
        prior to any testing under this protocol, including screening and baseline investigations
        that are not considered part of routine patient care.

        TREATMENT HISTORY:

        If prior treatments were administered, the patient must be off the following treatment
        agents for the required period prior to enrollment:

          -  Glatiramer acetate, interferon-beta - 24 weeks

          -  IVIg, azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, plasma exchange,
             cyclosporine, oral myelin, cladribine and other immunosuppressive treatments - 24
             weeks

          -  Corticosteroids - 6 weeks

        Prior treatment with other investigational drugs or procedures will be evaluated
        individually by the investigators.

        MISCELLANEOUS EXCLUSIONS:

        History of alcohol or drug abuse within the 5 years prior to enrollment.

        Female patients who are not post-menopausal or surgically sterile who are not using an
        acceptable method of contraception. Acceptability of various methods of contraception will
        be at the discretion of the investigator. Documentation that the patient is post-menopausal
        or surgically sterile must be available prior to enrollment.

        Male patients who are not surgically sterile and not practicing adequate contraception.
        Acceptability of various methods of contraception will be at the discretion of the
        investigator. Documentation that the patient is surgically sterile must be available prior
        to enrollment.

        Unwillingness or inability to comply with the requirements of this protocol including the
        presence of any condition (physical, mental, or social) that is likely to affect the
        patient returning for follow-up visits on schedule.
