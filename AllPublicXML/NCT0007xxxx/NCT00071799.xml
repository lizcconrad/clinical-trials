    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients with high-risk myelodysplastic
      syndromes (MDS) treated with azacitidine have improved survival compared to conventional care
      treatments. The study will also assess the effect of treatments on response, duration of
      response, and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The study will continue for 12
      months following last patient enrolled.

      See study AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001 E for information about the extension to this study.

      Comparison/Control Interventions offered the physician three options:

        -  Best supportive care (BSC) alone,

        -  Low-dose cytarabine subcutaneously for 14 days every 28 to 42 days, or

        -  Standard chemotherapy administered for induction as a continuous intravenous infusion of
           cytarabine over 7 days plus an anthracycline (daunorubicin, idarubicin, or mitoxantrone)
           on Days 1, 2, and 3; and, for those eligible, 1 or 2 consolidation cycles administered
           as continuous intravenous infusions of cytarabine for 3 to 7 days with the same
           anthracycline that was used at induction on Days 1 and 2 (each cycle between 28 to 70
           days from the start of the previous cycle).

      All three options included best supportive care. Neither the experimental group (azacitidine)
      nor any of the comparison/control options allowed use of erythropoietin.

      Duration of Intervention: Patients will be treated until death, withdrawal, unacceptable
      toxicity or conclusion of the study.

          <title>International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)</title>
          <description>The international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) is a standard for risk assessment in primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) that categorizes prognoses taking into account cytogenetics, cytopenias, blasts and blood counts. The scale is 0-3.5 at .5 increments. Scores of 2.5-3.5 represent high risk which corresponds to poorer prognosis. The assessment was performed by the Independent Review Committee.</description>
