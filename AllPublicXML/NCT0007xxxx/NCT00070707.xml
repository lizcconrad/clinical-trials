  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An association between seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) and allergic asthma has been
      established through epidemiologic, pathophysiologic, and therapeutic studies. This study will
      compare Nasonex Nasal Spray to Placebo in treating the nasal and asthma symptoms experienced
      by subjects with SAR and concomitant asthma.

        Eligibility Criteria:

          -  Subject must have at least a two-year history of seasonal allergic rhinitis and of
             increase asthma symptoms associated with the allergy season under study.

          -  FEV 1 70% of predicted at both Screening and Baseline visits.

          -  Subject must demonstrate an increase in absolute FEV 1 less then 12%, with an absolute
             volume increase of at least 200 ml, after reversibility testing at Screening or within
             the past 12 months.

          -  Subjects must be skin test positive (skin prick test with a wheal diameter at least
             3mm larger than the diluent control or intradermal testing with the wheal diameter at
             least 7 mm larger than diluent control) at screening, or within 12 months prior to the
             screening visit, to a seasonal allergen (which may include seasonal molds) prevalent
             during the study period.
