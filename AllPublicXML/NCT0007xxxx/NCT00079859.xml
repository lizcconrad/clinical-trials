  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if implitapide, used in conjunction with other
      lipid-lowering therapies, is safe and effective when compared to placebo in lowering
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with heterozygous familial
      hypercholesterolemia (HeFH).
