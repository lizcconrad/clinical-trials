  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will look at the safety profile (unwanted effects) of the long-lasting
      anticoagulant PEG-hirudin (SPP200) and compare these unwanted effects to those of
      unfractionated heparin, commonly used in haemodialysis to avoid clotting of the graft and of
      the haemodialysis machine.
