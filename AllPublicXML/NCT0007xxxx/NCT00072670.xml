  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of trabectedin (ET-743) in adult
      male participants with advanced metastatic (spread of cancer cells from one part of the body
      to another) prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), non-randomized,
      multi-center and Phase 2 study in adult male participants with advanced metastatic prostate
      cancer. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening (consists of 14 days before study commences
      on Day -1); Treatment (consists of 4-week dosing cycles wherein trabectedin will be
      administered as intravenously at a dose of either 0.58 milligram per square meter [mg/m^2]
      weekly 3-hour infusion, or 1.5 mg/m^2 or 1.2 mg/m^2 every three weeks 24-hour infusion); and
      Follow-up (until survival after the first dose of trabectedin). Participants will discontinue
      study treatment at disease progression or unacceptable toxicity unless, in the Investigator's
      opinion, it is deemed that the participants will continue to derive benefit from trabectedin.
      Efficacy will be evaluated primarily through decline in prostate-specific antigen (substance
      in blood that is measured to check for prostate cancer) after 72 hours of therapy on Day 1.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <time_frame>Day 1 of each cycle until first documented disease progression up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>The PSA response will be evaluated according to National Cancer Institute PSA Working Group criterion, which is, greater than or equal to 50 percent decrease in PSA from Baseline after the first dose of study drug, which would be subsequently confirmed by a measurement, that is, at least 4 or more weeks after initial documentation of PSA.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Prostate-Specific Antigen Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of each cycle until first documented disease progression up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) response will be analyzed in all participants for whom a response will be observed. The Duration of a PSA response is the time from a PSA response to PSA progression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to disease progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of each cycle until first documented disease progression up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Time to disease progression is defined as the time period, from initiation of study treatment until documentation of disease progression. If participant will discontinue the study or lost to follow-up without progression or receive further anticancer therapy after study treatment discontinuation in absence of progression, time to progression will be censored at the time of the last PSA evaluation recorded.</description>
