  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the efficacy and safety of tigecycline with those of levofloxacin in the treatment
      of subjects with CAP requiring hospitalization. The co-primary efficacy endpoints in the
      study will be the clinical response in the clinically evaluable population and the clinical
      response in the clinical modified intent-to-treat population at the TOC visit. The primary
      efficacy analyses will first determine whether tigecycline is noninferior to levofloxacin. If
      tigecycline is found to be noninferior, the analyses will determine whether tigecycline is
      statistically better than levofloxacin.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects ≥ 18 years of ag.

          -  Subjects hospitalized with CAP for whom IV antibiotic treatment is indicated

          -  The presence of fever (within 24 hours prior to randomization), defined as oral
             temperature &gt;38°C/100.4°F, axillary temperature &gt;38.1°C/100.6°F, tympanic temperature
             &gt;38.5°C/ 101.2°F, or a rectal/core temperature &gt;39°C/102.2°F OR hypothermia (within 24
             hours prior to randomization), core temperature &lt;35°C/95°

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any concomitant condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude an
             evaluation of a response or make it unlikely that the contemplated course of therapy
             could be completed (eg, life expectancy &lt;30 days)

          -  Hospitalization within 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms

          -  Residence in a long-term care facility or nursing home ≥14 days before the onset of
             symptoms
