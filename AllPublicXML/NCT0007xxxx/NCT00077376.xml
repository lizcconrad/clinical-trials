  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving trastuzumab together with ixabepilone and
      carboplatin works in treating patients with HER2/neu-positive metastatic breast cancer.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can locate tumor cells and either kill them or
      deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as ixabepilone and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells
      from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining trastuzumab with ixabepilone and
      carboplatin may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the response rate (as determined by RECIST criteria) to combination therapy
      with Ixabepilone (BMS-247550), trastuzumab, and carboplatin in patients with metastatic
      breast cancer known to overexpress HER2.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine time to disease progression (TTP) and time to treatment failure (TTF) after
      treatment with Ixabepilone (BMS-247550), trastuzumab and carboplatin in patients with
      metastatic breast cancer known to overexpress HER2.

      II. To determine the toxicity of combination therapy with Ixabepilone (BMS-247550),
      trastuzumab and carboplatin in patients with metastatic breast cancer known to overexpress
      HER2.

      III. To evaluate overall survival (OS) of combination therapy with Ixabepilone (BMS-247550),
      trastuzumab, and carboplatin in patients with metastatic breast cancer known to overexpress
      HER2.

      IV. To correlate levels of phospho-STAT3 with levels of HER2, Survivin and EGFR expression as
      measured in tissue by immunohistochemistry.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Induction therapy: Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin®) IV over 30 minutes* on days 1,
      8, 15, and 22 and ixabepilone IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and
      15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity.

      NOTE: *Trastuzumab is given over 90 minutes on day 1 of course 1 (induction therapy) only.

      Maintenance therapy: Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years from
      study entry.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-6
      months.

    <time_frame>Assessed every 3 cycles during induction therapy and every 6 cycles during maintenance therapy until disease progression or up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>To assess objective response, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor burden at baseline to which subsequent measurements will be compared. The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each lesion at baseline and during follow-up.
The best overall response based on RECIST is the best response recorded from registration until disease progression/recurrence, taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since registration. The best response was determined based on the tumor responses in target and nontarget lesions, with or without new lesions. To be assigned a status of complete or partial response, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. To be assigned a status of stable disease, measurements must have met the stable disease criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 8 weeks.</description>

          <description>During the induction phase, patients were treated with Ixabepilone (BMS-247550) 15mg/m2 intravenously (IV) followed by carboplatin (AUC=2 IV) on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle for a maximum of 6 cycles. Trastuzumab was administered weekly (4mg/kg loading dose then 2mg/kg IV) starting on day 1. Routine premedication included H1 blocker (diphenhydramine 50 mg orally (PO) or IV), H2 blocker (ranitidine 150 mg PO or 50 mg IV or another equivalent H2 blocker), and at least a 5-HT3 antagonist and dexamethasone.
After completion of 24 weekly trastuzumab doses (induction therapy), trastuzumab were given at a dose of 6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks (maintenance therapy) beginning one week after the 24th weekly dose. Trastuzumab were repeated every 21 days until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity.</description>

Trastuzumab was administered weekly (4mg/kg loading dose then 2mg/kg IV) starting on day 1. Routine premedication included H1 blocker (diphenhydramine 50 mg orally (PO) or IV), H2 blocker (ranitidine 150 mg PO or 50 mg IV or another equivalent H2 blocker), and at least a 5-HT3 antagonist and dexamethasone.
After completion of 24 weekly trastuzumab doses (induction therapy), trastuzumab were given at a dose of 6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks (maintenance therapy) beginning one week after the 24th weekly dose. Trastuzumab were repeated every 21 days until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity.</description>

        <title>Objective Response for HER2+ Patients (Best Objective Response a Patient Has Ever Experienced on Study)</title>
        <description>To assess objective response, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor burden at baseline to which subsequent measurements will be compared. The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each lesion at baseline and during follow-up.
The best overall response based on RECIST is the best response recorded from registration until disease progression/recurrence, taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since registration. The best response was determined based on the tumor responses in target and nontarget lesions, with or without new lesions. To be assigned a status of complete or partial response, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. To be assigned a status of stable disease, measurements must have met the stable disease criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 8 weeks.</description>
