      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Giving a
      vaccine with Montanide ISA-51 and sargramostim may cause a stronger immune response and kill
      more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy
      when given together with Montanide ISA-51 and sargramostim in treating patients with stage IV
      breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety of telomerase: 540-548 peptide vaccine emulsified in Montanide
           ISA-51 and sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with HLA-A2-expressing stage IV breast
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the generation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)
           peptide-specific vs cytomegalovirus peptide-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)
           immunity in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate the dose level of this regimen with the generation of hTERT-specific CTL
           immunity and the development of hTERT-specific autoimmunity in these patients.

        -  Determine the tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of the telomerase: 540-548 peptide and CMV 495
      peptide portions of the vaccine.

      Patients receive telomerase: 540-548 peptide and CMV 495 peptide (as an immunological
      control) vaccine emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously (SC) followed by sargramostim
      (GM-CSF) SC on day 1 of weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 19, and 27 (for a total of 8 vaccinations).
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 5-8 patients receive escalating doses of telomerase: 540-548 peptide and CMV 495
      peptide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 5 or 2 of 8 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A total
      of 12 patients receive treatment at the MTD.

      Patients are followed within 30 days and then at 6 and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-28 patients will be accrued for this study.
