      This pilot study will evaluate the effect of direct current (DC) electrical polarization of
      the brain on language, memory, reaction time, and mood in six patients with frontotemporal
      dementia (Pick's disease). There is no effective treatment available for cognitive impairment
      in patients with this condition. DC polarization sends a very weak current between two sponge
      pads placed on the head. In a previous study in healthy volunteers, DC polarization of the
      left prefrontal area of the brain increased verbal fluency, memory and attention, and motor
      reaction time in the study subjects.

      Patients between 35 and 75 years of age with frontotemporal dementia who have been referred
      to NINDS's Cognitive Neuroscience Section for an existing protocol will be offered
      participation in this study. Candidates will be screened with a neurological examination to
      confirm the diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia.

      Participants receive 40 minutes of DC polarization or sham polarization in each of two
      separate sessions. (No current is applied in the sham treatment). During the polarization,
      the patient rests quietly. Sponge pads that have been soaked in water are put on the left
      side of the head and above the right eye, and are held in place with elastic netting. Before
      the polarization and after about 20 minutes of polarization, patients undergo the following
      tests:

        -  Language: Patients must say as many words beginning with certain letters as they can in
           90 seconds.

        -  Memory: Patients must remember a letter on a computer screen, and when the letter
           appears again, press the same letter on the keyboard.

        -  Reaction time: Patients place pegs on a pegboard.

        -  Mood: Patients place a mark on a line ranking how they feel.

      Introduction: In this study, we will use anodal direct current (DC) polarization at 2 mA to
      treat patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Currently, there is no effective treatment
      for these patients. Previously, in healthy volunteers, we observed that DC polarization of
      the left prefrontal area for 20 min safely increases verbal fluency, cognitive processing
      speed (working memory and attention) and motor reaction speed. Both of these functions are
      severely impaired in FTD. Objective: We wish to see whether anodal DC polarization of the
      left prefrontal cortex in FTD patients leads to improvement in verbal fluency and working
      memory. Design: In this pilot study, we propose to treat six FTD patients for 40 min with
      anodal and sham DC polarization in a single-blind, crossover design. Outcome Measures: The
      main outcome measures will be verbal fluency and working memory. If anodal DC polarization
      produces clinically relevant improvements in these patients this will provide the impetus for
      a larger trial.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        -Six patients referred to the Cognitive Neuroscience Section, NINDS, with a clinical
        diagnosis of FTD confirmed here, will be selected to participate in the study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Greater than 75 years of age.

          -  Presence of metal in the head other than dental hardware.

          -  Broken skin in the area of the stimulating electrodes.

          -  Any behavioral disorder that makes testing impossible.

          -  Children are excluded, as FTD is not a childhood illness.
