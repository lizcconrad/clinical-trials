      This study is designed to study how adults with Type 2 Diabetes and either high blood
      pressure and/or high blood cholesterol manage their treatment regimen. It is also called the
      Diabetes Management Study. Individuals need to be 40 years of age or older and on oral
      medication (pills) management for two of the three conditions of interest. They may also be
      on other treatment such as insulin, diet and/or exercise programs. Individuals will be
      followed for approximately 12 months. About 1/4 of the persons in the study will receive a
      telephone counseling program with a nurse focused upon their management of their treatment
      program.
