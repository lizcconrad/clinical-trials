      Primary objective:

        -  To demonstrate the superiority of extended VTE prophylaxis with enoxaparin 40mg sc qd
           for 28 ± 4 days, compared to placebo, both following 10 ± 4 days of initial treatment
           with enoxaparin 40mg sc qd

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess the reduction in mortality rate at the end of the double-blind treatment
           period, at 3 (90 ± 10 days) and at 6 (180 ± 10 days) months from the time of entry to
           the study, in patients on extended prophylaxis

        -  To assess the incidence of VTE at 3 months (90 ± 10 days) from the time of randomization
           to the study

        -  To evaluate the safety of extended enoxaparin VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical
           patients with prolonged immobilization. Safety evaluation includes:

             -  Major and minor hemorrhage

             -  Heparin induced thrombocytopenia

             -  Serious adverse events

        -  To assess differences in levels of health-care utilization and cost between patients
           receiving extended VTE prophylaxis versus those receiving placebo.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Recent immobilization ≤ 3 days

          -  Level 1 mobility patients who are ≥ 40 years of age with acute medical illness or
             acute exacerbation of chronic medical illness

          -  Level 2 mobility patients who

               -  are &gt;75 yrs of age

               -  are ≥ 40 years of age and have a history of VTE (deep venous thrombosis or
                  pulmonary embolism)

               -  are ≥ 40 years of age and have a baseline diagnosis of cancer (active cancer or
                  history of cancer)

        Anticipated decreased level of mobility of 5 ± 2 days with a level of activity 1 and 2 at
        the time of study entry and likely to continue at a lower than pre-morbid activity level
        after the initial 5 ± 2 day period. PATIENTS DO NOT HAVE TO BE HOSPITALIZED IN ORDER TO BE
        INCLUDED IN THE STUDY.(Definition of decreased level of mobility: _Level 1:bed rest or
        sedentary patients _Level 2:level 1 with bathroom privileges)

          -  Presence of at least one of the following medical conditions:

               -  Heart Failure, NYHA class III and IV

                    -  Class III : Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of
                       physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary physical
                       activity causes fatigue, palpitationdyspnea, or anginal pain.

                    -  Class IV : Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on
                       any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency
                       or of the anginal syndrome may be present even at rest. If any physical
                       activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.

               -  Acute respiratory insufficiency

               -  Other acute medical conditions such as:

                    -  Acute ischemic stroke, any territory, with an appropriate neuroradiologic
                       (head CT scan or brain MRI scan) providing results consistent with non
                       hemorrhagic stroke

                    -  acute infection without septic shock

                    -  acute rheumatic disorders

                       confirmed cancer in patients who are not candidates for debulking or
                       curative intent surgery at study entry

                    -  Any other acute medical illness or exacerbation of chronic medical illness
                       resulting in clinically significant reduction in mobility as compared to
                       premorbid level.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Women who are breastfeeding, pregnant or of childbearing age and not using medically
             acceptable effective contraception

          -  Patients with any evidence of an active bleeding disorder

          -  A documented previous episode of heparin-induced or LMWH induced thrombocytopenia
             and/or thrombosis (HIT, HAT, or HITTS)

          -  Patients who have taken part in another clinical trial within the previous thirty days

          -  Patients with a persistent renal failure. The patient's creatinine level must be less
             than the creatinine level per gender/age/weight. This will replace the calculated
             creatinine clearance

          -  Known or suspected severe anemia of unexplained cause considered clinically relevant
             by investigator

          -  Patients with prosthetic heart valves
