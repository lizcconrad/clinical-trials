  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial is studying the best dose of FR901228 when given together with
      rituximab and fludarabine and to see how well FR901228 works alone in treating patients with
      relapsed or refractory low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as FR901228 and fludarabine, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can locate cancer
      cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming
      normal cells. Rituximab may increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy drugs by making cancer
      cells more sensitive to the drugs.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For phase 2: is to assess the clinical efficacy (complete and partial response rates) of
      single agent depsipeptide.

      II. For phase 1: is to assess the feasibility of adding Depsipeptide to a regimen of
      Rituximab and Fludarabine and to establish the MTD of Depsipeptide in this combination.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate disease response (clinical outcome) with the changes in histone acetylation
      assays.

      II. Study the expression of death receptors of DR4 and DR5 after treatment with depsipeptide.

      III. Assessment of minimal residual disease by immune histochemistry.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase II study of single-agent FR901228 followed by a phase
      I, dose-escalation study of FR901228.

      PHASE II: Patients receive FR901228 IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients who achieve a complete or partial remission receive 2 additional courses (for a
      total of 6 courses). Patients with stable disease after 4 courses or progressive disease at
      any time after 2 courses proceed to the phase I portion of the study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive rituximab IV over approximately 4-8 hours on day 1; fludarabine IV
      over 10-30 minutes on days 2-4; and FR901228 IV over 4 hours on days 2, 9, and 16. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of FR901228 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed for up to 3 years from study entry.

                  past, if they received one or both agents individually and had a 50% responses;
                  this response corresponds to PR to prior therapy

          -  Presence of measurable disease by CT scan 4 weeks after the last chemotherapeutic
             regimen with at least one lesion greater than 1.5c m in one dimension and or positive
             bone marrow biopsy

          -  ECOG performance status â‰¤ 2 with a minimal life expectancy of 4 months

          -  Female patients of childbearing age should have negative pregnancy test; pregnant and
             breast-feeding women will not be eligible for the study because the antiproliferative
             effects of depsipeptide may be harmful to the developing fetus or nursing infants

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1000/Âµl; lower ANC (&gt;= 500/Âµl) count will be considered
             if they are due to a bone marrow involvement by the disease; patients can receive
             growth factors (G-CSF and erythropoietin) to sustain the peripheral counts during the
             cycles of therapy

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100.000/Âµl; lower platelets (&gt;50.000/Âµl) count will be considered if they
             are due to a bone marrow involvement by the disease; patients can receive growth
             factors (G-CSF and erythropoietin) to sustain the peripheral counts during the cycles
             of therapy

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal

          -  AST/ALT =&lt; 3 x institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x the institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Patients with history of seizures are included if under adequate control; blood levels
             of seizure medications are monitored during the study

          -  The patient must understand the investigational nature of the protocol, potential
             risks and benefits of the study and provides an informed written consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (within 6 weeks for
             rituximab, nitrosoureas and mitomycin and within 8 weeks for UCN-01) prior to entering
