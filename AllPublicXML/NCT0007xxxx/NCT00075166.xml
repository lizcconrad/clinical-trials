      This study will compare the effectiveness of craniotomy to that of stereotactic surgery (SRS)
      for the treatment of metastatic brain tumors - tumors that first develop elsewhere in the
      body and then travel to the brain. Craniotomy is surgical removal of the tumors through an
      operation. SRS consists of highly focused radiation doses to the tumors. Neither treatment is
      experimental and both have shown benefits to patients with metastatic brain tumors. This
      study will determine whether one treatment is superior to the other in prolonging patient
      survival.

      Patients 21 years of age and older with one to three metastatic brain tumors may be eligible
      for this study. Participants will have a medical history and physical examination, blood and
      urine tests, an electrocardiogram, and chest x-ray. They will then be randomly assigned to
      undergo either surgery or SRS. Before either procedure, patients will have a magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) scan. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain
      images of the brain. Patients scheduled for SRS will have a computed tomography (CT) scan in
      addition to the MRI. CT uses X-rays to obtain images of the brain. During the CT, a contrast
      agent is injected through an IV tube placed in a vein to enhance the CT images. For both the
      MRI and CT tests, the patient lies on a table that slides into a cylindrical scanner. The MRI
      usually lasts between 45 and 90 minutes, while the CT scan lasts for about 30 to 60 minutes.

      Patients scheduled for surgery will have general anesthesia or local anesthesia with
      sedation. They will be in intensive care after the surgery until their condition is stable.
      Before being discharged home, they will have another MRI scan. The surgical sutures or
      staples will be removed 7 to 10 days after surgery.

      Patients scheduled for SRS will have their scalp numbed with medicine and their head will be
      placed in a head frame. A CT scan will be done on the morning of the procedure to plan the
      treatment. Around noon, the treatment, which consists of brief exposures to radiation, will
      be administered with the patient positioned comfortably on a treatment couch. The treatment
      will be completed in 1 to 2 hours, after which the head frame will be removed. After a brief
      period of observation, the patient will be discharged home.

      Patients will return to NIH for follow-up visits within 4 weeks after surgery or SRS and then
      every 3 months after that for a medical history, physical examination, and MRI scan, and to
      complete a quality of life questionnaire.

      Introduction: Metastatic brain tumors occur more frequently than primary brain tumors and
      occur in approximately 25% of patients who die of cancer each year. The main treatment goals
      for patients with brain metastases are the relief of neurological symptoms and long-term
      control of the tumors. Glucocorticoids and external beam whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT)
      comprise the current standard of care and increase median survival from one month to three to
      six months. Patients with three or less tumors (greater than 70% of patients) also commonly
      undergo surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with the goal of lengthening survival. Two
      prospective randomized trials have shown a significant survival benefit for patients
      undergoing surgical resection of single tumors in combination with WBRT compared to patients
      receiving WBRT alone. Although there have been no prospective randomized studies comparing
      SRS and WBRT to WBRT alone, there have been numerous large retrospective series reporting a
      significant survival benefit from SRS. To date, a prospective randomized trial comparing
      surgery to SRS has not been reported. Despite the lack of rigorous data, there are proponents
      for each of these treatment modalities. Those in favor of surgery cite the ability to achieve
      a complete resection in most cases, the almost immediate relief of symptoms, and the low rate
      of local recurrence. Those in favor of SRS cite an equivalent degree of local tumor control
      compared to surgery, the relative ease of the one day outpatient procedure, and the ability
      to treat lesions in deeper brain structures.

      Objectives: We plan to determine in a prospective randomized manner if surgery is superior to
      SRS for prolonging survival in patients with one to three surgically accessible brain tumors.

      Study Population: Patients aged twenty one years and older with one to three brain metastases
      will be assessed for enrollment in this study.

      Design: Patients who meet eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to undergo either
      surgery or SRS for their tumors. Patients will then be followed at regularly scheduled
      intervals for the duration of their disease.

      Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure will be time of survival following treatment.
      Among the secondary outcomes that will be measured over time are tumor recurrence or
      progression, neurologic sign or symptom development, functional independence, steroid and
      anticonvulsant use, and overall quality of life.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients must:

          1. be 21 years of age or older.

          2. have a histologically confirmed primary malignancy.

          3. be able to undergo an MRI scan of the brain.

          4. have one to three intraparenchymal brain metastases as identified on a brain MRI scan
             with intravenous contrast.

          5. have contrast enhancing tumor(s) that are well circumscribed and less than or equal to
             4.0 cm in any dimension.

          6. be appropriate for either procedure as determined by both a neurosurgeon and a
             radiation oncologist.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients must not:

          1. have tumor(s) in the midbrain, pons, or medulla - patients undergoing surgical
             resections in these areas are highly likely to develop significant neurological
             deficits or death.

          2. have tumors within 10 millimeters of the optic apparatus (nerves and chiasm) or the
             area postrema - patients undergoing SRS to these areas are at significant risk of
             developing permanent blindness or intractable nausea.

          3. be poor operative candidates from an anesthetic point of view secondary to other major
             medical illnesses - the risk of undergoing general anesthesia outweighs the potential
             benefit of undergoing surgical resection of a brain metastasis.

          4. have a coagulopathy demonstrated by an abnormal prothrombin time, activated partial
             thromboplastin time, or thrombocytopenia (platelet count less that 150,000
             platelets/mm3) - the risk of developing uncontrollable intra-operatively bleeding
             outweighs the potential benefit of undergoing surgical resection of a brain
             metastasis.

          5. have radiographic or cerebrospinal fluid specimen evidence of widespread
             leptomeningeal metastasis - neither surgery nor SRS is a useful treatment modality for
             this condition.

          6. significant psychiatric impairments which, in the opinion of the investigators, will
             interfere with the proper administration or completion of the protocol - self
             explanatory.

          7. acute or untreated infections (viral, bacterial or fungal) - patients with active
             infections are highly likely to have spread of their infections to the brain as a
             result of a craniotomy.

          8. be pregnant at the time of the randomized treatment - general anesthesia and surgery
             may subject the fetus to unacceptable risks. Also, the NIH does not offer full
             obstetrical services in the event that medical care to the mother and/or fetus is
             required. Pregnant women presenting with brain metastases will be referred to
             facilities offering OB/GYN services.

          9. be prisoners or other institutionalized individuals - these individuals are at risk of
             being susceptible to undue influences to participate in a research protocol against
             their free will.

         10. have a diagnosis of germ cell tumor, lymphoma or small cell lung cancer - these tumors
             are highly radiosensitive and should therefore be treated with radiation.

         11. have any of the following: aneurysm clip, implanted neural stimulator, implanted
             cardiac pacemaker or auto defibrillator, cochlear implant, ocular foreign body or
             implant [e.g. metal shavings, retinal clips], or insulin pump as these items would be
             contra-indications to undergoing an MRI scan.

         12. have an allergy to iodine or shellfish or have previously had an allergic reaction to
             iodinated-contrast agents as this is a contra-indication to undergoing a contrast
             enhanced CT of the brain - a contrast enhanced CT of the brain is required for the
             planning of SRS.
