      RATIONALE: Contingency management is a behavioral treatment approach that provides immediate
      rewards for positive change in behavior such as quitting smoking. In this protocol,
      contingency management will be in the form of a cash reward. A smoking cessation
      (stop-smoking) program that combines contingency management with bupropion and counseling may
      be effective in helping cancer survivors stop smoking.

      PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of bupropion and counseling
      with or without contingency management in helping cancer survivors stop smoking.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the feasibility of a multi-component smoking cessation intervention comprising
           bupropion and counseling with or without contingency management (cash reward) for cancer
           survivors who continue to smoke.

        -  Compare 7-day point-prevalence abstinence rates in patients treated with these smoking
           cessation interventions.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the characteristics of these patients that predict success at quitting
           smoking.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 smoking
      cessation intervention arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral bupropion twice daily on weeks 1-12 and brief practical
           counseling (i.e., problem-solving strategies, stimulus control, stress management, and
           social support) on weeks 1-6.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive treatment as in arm I and contingency management (i.e.,
           monetary reinforcement for not smoking) on weeks 1-6.

      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 12 and 24 weeks after the completion of the smoking cessation
      interventions.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per intervention arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 8 months.
