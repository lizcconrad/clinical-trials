      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of tigecycline in the treatment of selected serious
      infections caused by VRE. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the clinical response for all
      subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects aged 18 years or older

          -  Isolation of one of the following multi-antibiotic resistant bacteria:
             vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis,
             or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, alone or as part of a polymicrobial
             infection

          -  Have a confirmed diagnosis of a serious infection (eg, bacteremia [unless due to an
             excluded infection], complicated intra-abdominal infection, complicated skin and skin
             structure infection, or pneumonia) requiring administration of intravenous (IV)
             antibiotic therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with any concomitant condition or taking any concomitant medication that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, could preclude an evaluation of a response or make it
             unlikely that the contemplated course of therapy or follow-up assessment will be
             completed or that will substantially increase the risk associated with the subject's
             participation in this study

          -  Anticipated length of antibiotic therapy less than 7 days

          -  For subjects with VRE, known or suspected hypersensitivity to tigecycline or
             linezolid, or other compounds related to these classes of antibacterial agents (eg,
             oxazolidinones, tetracyclines, minocycline, doxycycline). For subjects with MRSA,
             known or suspected hypersensitivity to tigecycline or vancomycin, or other compounds
             related to these classes of antibacterial agents (eg, tetracyclines, minocycline,
             doxycycline)
