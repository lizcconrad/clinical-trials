      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as CC-8490, work in different ways to stop tumor
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of CC-8490 in treating patients who have
      recurrent or refractory high-grade gliomas.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of CC-8490 in patients with recurrent or refractory
           high-grade gliomas.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the potential anti-glioma activity of this drug in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral CC-8490 once daily on days 1 and 3-28 (course 1 only). Beginning with
      course 2 and for all subsequent courses, patients receive oral CC-8490 once daily on days
      1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CC-8490 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, a total of 10
      patients are treated at that dose.

      Patients are followed within 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34 patients will be accrued for this study.
