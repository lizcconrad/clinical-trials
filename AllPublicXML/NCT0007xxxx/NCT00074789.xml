  <brief_summary>

      This study will test the effectiveness of a short-term intervention in treating depressed
      young mothers with young children enrolled in Early Head Start Programs.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Limited resources, poor social support, and complex life problems contribute to the high
      prevalence and severity of depressive symptoms in low-income mothers. As depressive symptoms
      persist, they often rob young mothers of the energy they need for school, job training, and
      positive interaction with their children, which can negatively affect a child's language
      acquisition, intellectual development, and social conduct. This study will design and
      implement a home-based treatment to help young mothers manage their depressive symptoms,
      increase their social support, manage or resolve life issues, and effectively parent their
      infant or toddler through the use of EHS resources.

      Mothers will be randomly assigned to receive either home-based interpersonal depression
      treatment or an attention control/usual care condition for 26 weeks. Assessments will be made
      at study start and Weeks 14, 22, and 26. Depression scales, interviews, and analyses of
      videotaped mother-child interactions will be used to assess participants. Stress, social
      support, and use of EHS services will be assessed.
