      RATIONALE: Inserting the interleukin-12 gene into a person's cancer cells may make the body
      build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of interleukin-12 gene
      when injected into the tumors of patients with liver metastases secondary to colorectal
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of intratumoral adenoviral
           vector-delivered interleukin-12 gene in patients with liver metastases secondary to
           colorectal cancer .

        -  Determine the tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the immune response in patients treated with this regimen.
