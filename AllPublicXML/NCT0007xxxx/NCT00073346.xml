    <textblock>
      Compulsive hoarding is a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that is characterized by
      excessive acquisition of possessions, difficulty discarding possessions, and excessive
      clutter. This condition is resistant to both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic
      interventions that are effective in treating other symptoms of OCD. This study will determine
      the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in treating compulsive hoarding
      symptoms.

      This study consists of three phases. In Phase 1, data from previously conducted pilot studies
      will be revised and expanded. In Phase 2, the revised data will be used to develop and
      implement a treatment manual for compulsive hoarding. During this phase, treatment will be
      flexibly applied to allow for variations in treatment duration and choice of techniques.
      During Phase 3, participants will be randomly assigned to either CBT or a wait-list control,
      followed by active treatment for a fixed duration. Therapist adherence and competence will be
      assessed through audiotaped therapy sessions.
