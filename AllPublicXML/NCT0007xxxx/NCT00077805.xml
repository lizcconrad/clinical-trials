      Primary objective:

        -  To demonstrate superiority of enoxaparin 40 mg sc qd in the prevention of VTE compared
           to UFH (unfractionated heparin) 5000 U sc q12 hours given for 10 ± 4 days following
           acute ischemic stroke.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To compare the incidence of VTE between the 2 treatment groups at 30, 60, and 90 days
           from the time of randomization

        -  To compare neurologic outcomes between the 2 treatment groups, including incidence of
           stroke recurrence, rate of stroke progression, and patient functional status, during the
           10 ± 4 days of treatment, and after 30, 60, and 90 days from the time of randomization

        -  To evaluate the safety of using enoxaparin compared to UFH for VTE prevention in
           patients following acute ischemic stroke

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Acute ischemic stroke, any territory, with an appropriate neuroradiologic study (head
             CT scan or brain MRI scan) providing results consistent with non hemorrhagic stroke
