  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine the effect of HuMax-CD4, as a treatment for
      advanced stage (late stage) cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Almost all patients who are
      affected by late stage CTCL have many cancerous cells which bear a receptor called CD4.
      HuMax-CD4 is an investigational drug directed against this receptor. There is no placebo in
      this trial; all patients will be treated with HuMax-CD4. The response rates, duration of
      responses, relief of symptoms, and safety profile of HuMax-CD4 will be evaluated during this
      trial.
