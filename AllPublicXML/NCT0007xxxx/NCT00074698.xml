      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of FG-3019, a
      therapeutic antibody designed to block the pro-fibrotic activity of connective tissue growth
      factor (CTGF). CTGF triggers the production of collagen and fibronectin, which cause scarring
      and thickening of the lungs. Approximately 18 to 27 males and females, 21 to 80 years of age
      with a diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) will be enrolled in this study. The
      duration of the study is approximately one month, during which patients will receive a single
      infusion of FG-3019. In addition, there will be two follow-up visits 6 and 12 months after
      receiving the study drug.
