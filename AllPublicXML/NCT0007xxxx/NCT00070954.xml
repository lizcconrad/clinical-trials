  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective treatment for severe or medication-resistant
      depression and other psychiatric disorders. A common side effect of ECT is problems with
      short-term memory during treatment. This study will test whether taking ginkgo biloba (GB)
      prior to and during the course of ECT will lessen the effects of ECT on short-term memory.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ECT is a safe and effective modern treatment for severe depression and other psychiatric
      conditions. An estimated 100,000 treatments occur per year in the United States. ECT's most
      bothersome adverse effect is memory loss, with all patients receiving ECT experiencing some
      degree of short-term cognitive impairment. At present there are no known effective
      pharmacologic treatments to prevent or improve ECT-induced cognitive dysfunction. Preliminary
      research has shown the herbal preparation GB aids cognitive function and memory in both
      patients with dementia and in normal volunteers. This study will investigate the utility and
      safety of GB to minimize the cognitive impairment typically associated with ECT.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either twice-daily GB or
      placebo. Participants will begin taking GB or placebo as soon as consent is obtained and
      baseline testing is completed in order to reach steady-state plasma levels of GB prior to
      ECT. Patients will undergo cognitive testing at specified intervals following ECT. The final
      study visit will occur one week after a participant's final ECT treatment.
