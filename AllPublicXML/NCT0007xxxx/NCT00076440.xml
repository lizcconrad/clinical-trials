      ALADDIN is a research study to investigate the safety and effectiveness of leuprolide (a
      hormone drug) to improve the cognitive function and slow the progression of Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) in men 65 years and older with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease who reside
      in the community.

      ALADDIN is a clinical trial investigating the safety and effectiveness of leuprolide (a
      hormone drug) to improve the cognitive function and slow the progression of Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). The study will include treatment of men 65 years and older with mild to
      moderate Alzheimer's disease who reside in the community. The objective is to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of two different doses of leuprolide to improve the cognitive function
      and slow the progression of AD, as measured by the ADAS-COG and the Clinical Global
      Impression (CGI). Measures of behavioral disturbances, and quality of life of the caregiver
      will be made also. The study design is randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel
      group design with a 2:1 randomization of drug to placebo. Sample size will include 90
      participants from multiple test sites.

      Following initial screening and baseline visits, the participant and caregiver will visit the
      site 8 times for a total of 10 visits over 48 weeks. The drug is administered via injection
      every 3 months. Safety assessments are completed and psychometric testing is done.
      Participant's memory, behavior, and global functioning are assessed during the participant
      and caregiver interviews. Each visit takes approximately 2 hours.

        Patients who satisfy all of the inclusion criteria listed below will be eligible for entry
        into the trial.

          -  Patient and responsible caregiver can give their consent by signing the IRB-approved
             Informed Consent Form; or, when the patient is judged by the Investigator to be unable
             to give consent, the legally authorized representative gives consent by signing the
             consent form and the patient gives assent, in accord with local regulations;

          -  Male;

          -  65 years of age or older;

          -  Diagnosis of probable AD according to the National Institute of Neurological
             Disorders-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINDS-ADRDA)
             criteria, and the Investigator ascertains that the condition was present at least 6
             months prior to screening;

          -  Taking a drug for the treatment of AD, such as a cholinesterase inhibitor and/or
             MemantineÂ®, which they began taking at least 90 days prior to baseline and, in the
             Investigator's opinion, the dosage will likely remain stable throughout the trial; or,
             they have never taken such a drug or stopped taking it at least 90 days prior to
             baseline and will likely refrain from taking such treatment throughout the trial;

          -  Taking other drugs or substances that have purported cognition-enhancing properties
             such as ginkgo biloba or Vitamin E, which they began taking at least 60 days prior to
             baseline and, in the Investigator's opinion, the dosage will likely remain stable
             throughout the trial; or, they have never taken such a drug or stopped taking it at
             least 90 days prior to baseline and will likely refrain from taking such treatment
             throughout the trial;

          -  Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 12 to 24 (inclusive) at the screening
             visit;

          -  Brain imaging study (CT scan, MRI or PET) performed at the time of their initial
             diagnosis of AD or after that time, and the findings were consistent with a diagnosis
             of probable AD, or, if a brain imaging study has not been performed, one will be
             performed during the screening process;

          -  Rosen Modified Hachinski score of 4 or lower at the screening visit, supporting the
             Investigator's clinical judgment that the patient's dementia is probable AD and not of
             vascular origin;

          -  Fluent in English or Spanish and completed at least 6 years of education;

          -  Live at home or in a congregate living facility for requirements other than skilled
             nursing care, and have a caregiver who sees the patient at least three times a week
             for a total of at least 10 hours and can sign the consent form, provide information
             pertinent to the patient's cognitive status, accompany the patient on clinic visits,
             and participate in the evaluations.

          -  Hamilton Depression Scale (17-item version) (HamD) score of 14 or less at the
             screening visit;

          -  DEXA scan, performed at screening, within normal limits (i.e., a T-score of greater
             than -2.0); or, if their DEXA measure was abnormally low (i.e., a T-score of -2.0 or
             lower), in either a lumbar vertebra or hip, to specifically include a T-score for the
             femoral neck), they were receiving treatment for osteoporosis/osteopenia for at least
             3 weeks prior to baseline and that treatment is not expected to change during the
             course of the trial; or, if their DEXA measure was abnormally low and they are not
             receiving treatment for osteoporosis/osteopenia, they may proceed to baseline after 3
             weeks of treatment for osteoporosis/osteopenia provided that all inclusion/exclusion
             criteria are met, including assessment of the HamD, concomitant medications, ECG and
             laboratory tests performed within 45 days of baseline show that they are eligible;

          -  Screening laboratory test values do not indicate significant medical conditions that
             would interfere with their participation in and completion of the study.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Patients with any of the exclusion criteria listed below will be ineligible for entry into
        the study.

          -  Female;

          -  Younger than 65 years of age;

          -  Significant neurological disease affecting the brain or psychiatric disease other than

          -  Receiving testosterone;

          -  Taking a drug for the treatment of AD for less than 90 days prior to baseline; or, in
             the opinion of the Investigator, they are likely to either require a change in dose or
             discontinuation of the drug;

          -  Never received cholinesterase inhibitor treatment, and the likelihood of their
             starting such treatment during the study is other than low, or they have taken and
             discontinued cholinesterase inhibitor treatment in the past and the likelihood of
             their resuming cholinesterase inhibitor treatment during the study is other than low;

          -  Started or changed within 60 days prior to the screening visit the dosage of any drug
             (including OTC) that affects cognitive function, such as neuroleptics,
             antidepressants, anxiolytics, sedatives, hypnotics, anti-convulsants, centrally acting
             antihypertensive agents such as clonidine and Aldomet; or other medications that have
             been shown to have possible effects on cognition such as Vitamin E, nonsteroidal
             anti-inflammatory drugs, and statins, or if, in the Investigator's opinion, the dosage
             of such medication is likely to be changed during the course of this trial. Any
             changes in the dosage of any of these drugs during the course of the trial and the
             reason for the change must be fully recorded in the concomitant medication page of the
             patient's case report form (CRF). If a drug that affects cognition (e.g., a hypnotic
             or anxiolytic drug) is given on a PRN basis, such treatment should be interrupted for
             12 hours before a visit, if possible;

          -  Taking coumadin or anti-Parkinsonian medications;
