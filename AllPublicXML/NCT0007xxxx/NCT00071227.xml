      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a new formulation of triamcinolone
      acetonide for the treatment of retinal blood vessel disorders. Triamcinolone is a steroid
      drug that decreases inflammation and scarring and is routinely used to treat eye inflammation
      or swelling. The commercially available form of this drug is associated with potentially
      harmful side effects thought to be due to preservatives in the preparation. This study will
      use a formulation that does not contain these potentially harmful preservatives. Preliminary
      findings from other studies suggest that injection of steroids in the eye can reduce retinal
      thickening and improve vision. However, they may also cause mild discomfort and lead to
      vision-threatening conditions. The effects of the drug on the conditions under study in this
      protocol are not known.

      Patients with the following conditions involving disorders of retinal blood vessels may be
      eligible for this study:

        -  Choroidal neovascularization associated with age-related macular degeneration (50 years
           of age and older)

        -  Macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion (18 years of age and older)

        -  Diabetic macular edema ((18 years of age and older)

      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

        -  Medical history and physical examination

        -  Eye examination to assess visual acuity (eye chart test) and eye pressure, and to
           examine pupils, lens, retina and eye movements. The pupils will be dilated with drops
           for this examination.

        -  Fluorescein angiography to evaluate the eye's blood vessels. A yellow dye is injected
           into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the retina
           are taken using a camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures show if
           any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible blood vessel
           abnormality.

        -  Indocyanine green angiography to identify feeder vessels that may be supplying abnormal
           blood vessels. This procedure is similar to fluorescein angiography, but uses a green
           dye and flashes an invisible light.

        -  Optical coherence tomography to measure retinal thickness. This test shines a light into
           the eye and produces cross-sectional pictures of the retina. These measurements are
           repeated during the study to determine if retinal thickening is getting better or worse,
           or staying the same.

        -  Stereoscopic color fundus photography to examine the back of the eye. The pupils are
           dilated with eye drops to allow examination and photography of the back of the eye.

        -  Triamcinolone acetonide injection to treat the eye. A numbing eye drop, an antibiotic
           eye drop, and an injected antibiotic are put in the eye before triamcinolone acetonide
           is injected into the eye's vitreous (jelly-like substance inside the eye). After the
           injection, the patient lies on his or her back for 30 minutes. An antibiotic eye
           ointment is used for 2 days following treatment.

        -  Blood tests to measure liver and kidney function.

      Patients return to the clinic for follow-up visits 1, 4, and 7 days, and 1 month after the
      first treatment. Patients whose condition does not improve after 3 months do not receive any
      more injections, but return for eye examinations at least once a year for 3 years. Patients
      whose condition improves with treatment return for follow-up visits 6 and 9 months after the
      first injection and then every 6 months for 2 more years. At each visit, a determination is
      made whether another injection is needed. After each repeat injection, patients return for
      follow-up visits at 1, 4, and 7 days after the injection.

      The use of intravitreal injections of corticosteroid (triamcinolone acetonide) appears to be
      a promising treatment for a variety of ocular diseases associated with inflammation. To date,
      the only drug available, 'Kenalog-40 Injection' produced by Bristol Myers Squibb, has not
      been formulated for intraocular use. This formulation when used intraocularly has been
      associated with cases of non-bacterial endophthalmitis, which is thought to be due to the
      presence of benzyl alcohol and/or polysorbate 80. Both are suspected irritants.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a novel preservative-free formulation
      of triamcinolone acetonide (TAC-PF) at four dosage levels.

      The study will be an open-label, single-masked, randomized Phase I study that will
      investigate the safety and potential efficacy of the new formulation of TAC-PF. Sixteen
      participants with retinal vascular disease will be randomly assigned to receive via
      intravitreal injection at one of 4 dose levels (1 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, or 16 mg) of TAC-PF.
      Depending on a participant's response, injections may be repeated at up to 3 month intervals.
      Participants will be followed for 3 years.

      The primary outcome will be an assessment of post-injection intraocular toxicity related
      events including increased inflammation, increased intraocular pressure, significant
      decreases in BCVA, cataract formation, retinal detachment, and intraocular hemorrhage. The
      secondary outcomes will be an improvement of 15 letters in best-corrected visual acuity
      (BCVA, ETDRS) from baseline to year 3, and decreases in retinal thickening and area of
      leakage.
