  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether the addition of cognitive behavioral therapy can improve the
      efficacy of the medication paroxetine (PaxilÂ®) in treating individuals with social anxiety
      disorder. Patients with social anxiety disorder will undergo a 12-week open trial with
      paroxetine. Those who complete the open trial having achieved only partial response will be
      randomized to receive cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in addition to paroxetine or to
      continue on paroxetine alone for an additional 16 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Social anxiety disorder is a prevalent and disabling condition for which effective long-term
      treatments need to be identified. Paroxetine is effective in treating the acute symptoms of
      social anxiety, but many patients achieve less than optimal response. CBT has also been
      effective in treating social anxiety disorder; thus,it may also be effective in augmenting
      paroxetine response. This study will examine the effects of paroxetine treatment alone and in
      combination with CBT among patients who achieve less than optimal response after an open
      trial with paroxetine.

      Participants in this study will receive paroxetine for 12 weeks (Phase 1). After 12 weeks,
      participants who have completed this open trial but have achieved some but less than optimal
      response will move forward to Phase 2. To be eligible to move forward to Phase 2, patients
      must have achieved at least a 10% improvement in their open-trial Liebowitz Social Anxiety
      Scale Scores (LSAS) but still have an LSAS score of 30 or greater. Patients meeting these
      criteria will be randomly assigned to either add weekly sessions of CBT to their treatment or
      to continue taking paroxetine alone for another 16 weeks. Social anxiety symptoms, rates of
      response and remission, fear of negative evaluation, disability and quality of life will be
      assessed.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change measured from Week 12 to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The LSAS is a 24-item clinician-administered measure, which provides 0-3 ratings for anxiety and avoidance of social and performance situations. Anxiety and avoidance ratings are summed across items, yielding a range of scores from 0-144, with higher scores representing greater severity of social anxiety symptoms. We examined amount of change from week 12 to week 28 as the primary outcome. Change was calculated as Week 12 score minus Week 28 score, so a positive score equals greater positive change.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Responder and remitter status measured at Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I is a 7-point clinician-administered scale measuring improvement in symptoms over time. Lower numbers represent greater improvement. We examined responder status (i.e., percent of patients receiving an endpoint, Week 28, rating of 1 or 2) as well as remission status (i.e., percent of patients receiving an endpoint, Week 28, rating of 1) as secondary outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change measured from Week 12 to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The SIAS is a 20-item self-report measure of anxiety experienced while interacting in dyads or groups. Items are rated on a 0-4 scale, yielding a range of scores from 0-80, with higher scores representing greater anxiety. We examined amount of change at from week 12 to week 28 as a secondary outcome. Change was calculated as Week 12 score minus Week 28 score, so a positive score equals greater positive change.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Phobia Scale (SPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change measured from Week 12 to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The SPS is a 20-item self-report measure of anxiety experienced when being observed by others. Items are rated on a 0-4 scale, yielding a range of scores from 0-80, with higher scores representing greater anxiety. We examined amount of change at from week 12 to week 28 as a secondary outcome. Change was calculated as Week 12 score minus Week 28 score, so a positive score equals greater positive change.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (BFNE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change measured from Week 12 to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The BFNE is a 12-item self-report measure of concern about negative evaluation by others. Items are rated on a 1-5 scale, yielding scores ranging from 12-60, with higher scores indicating greater fear of negative evaluation. We examined amount of change at from week 12 to week 28 as a secondary outcome. Change was calculated as Week 12 score minus Week 28 score, so a positive score equals greater positive change.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Liebowitz Self-Report Disability Scale (LSRDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change measured from Week 12 to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The LSRDS is an 11-item self-report measure of the degree to which one's emotional problems limit one's ability to function in a variety of domains. Items are rated on a 0-3 scale of severity, and 10 of the 11 items (choosing either school or work as one area and omitting the other) are summed to produce a total score, ranging from 0-30. Higher scores represent greater disability. We examined amount of change at from week 12 to week 28 as a secondary outcome. Change was calculated as Week 12 score minus Week 28 score, so a positive score equals greater positive change.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change measured from Week 12 to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The QOLI is a 16-item self-report measure of life satisfaction. Each item is rated for importance (0-2) and satisfaction (-3 to +3), and these ratings are multiplied, summed, and divided by the number of non-zero entries to yield an average item score, which can range from -6 to +6. We examined amount of change at from week 12 to week 28 as a secondary outcome. Change was calculated as Week 12 score minus Week 28 score, so a positive score equals greater positive change.</description>

          <description>The CGI-I is a 7-point clinician-administered scale measuring improvement in symptoms over time. Lower numbers represent greater improvement. We examined responder status (i.e., percent of patients receiving an endpoint, Week 28, rating of 1 or 2) as well as remission status (i.e., percent of patients receiving an endpoint, Week 28, rating of 1) as secondary outcomes.</description>
          <population>Responders (CGI-I=1 or 2). Remitters (CGI-I=1). Analyses based on Week 28 observations if available. if not, Week 20 or Week 12 observations were substituted. Fisher's Exact Test used for analyses.</population>

Items are rated on a 0-4 scale, yielding a range of scores from 0-80, with higher scores representing greater anxiety. We examined amount of change at from week 12 to week 28 as a secondary outcome. Change was calculated as Week 12 score minus Week 28 score, so a positive score equals greater positive change.</description>

          <title>Liebowitz Self-Report Disability Scale (LSRDS)</title>
          <description>The LSRDS is an 11-item self-report measure of the degree to which one's emotional problems limit one's ability to function in a variety of domains. Items are rated on a 0-3 scale of severity, and 10 of the 11 items (choosing either school or work as one area and omitting the other) are summed to produce a total score, ranging from 0-30. Higher scores represent greater disability. We examined amount of change at from week 12 to week 28 as a secondary outcome. Change was calculated as Week 12 score minus Week 28 score, so a positive score equals greater positive change.</description>
          <population>Data analysis was conducted via mixed-effects linear regression which allows use of data from patients with missing observations by using maximum likelihood estimation. The same holds true for all continuous outcome measures. However, mean change (and SDs) reported here is based on completed observations.</population>
