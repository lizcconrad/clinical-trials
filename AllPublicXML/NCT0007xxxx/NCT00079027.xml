    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from
      dividing. Chemoembolization kills tumor cells by blocking the blood flow to the tumor and
      keeping chemotherapy drugs near the tumor. It is not yet known whether doxorubicin is more
      effective with or without chemoembolization in treating unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma
      (liver cancer).

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying doxorubicin given by infusion to see how
      well it works compared to doxorubicin given by chemoembolization in treating patients with
      advanced liver cancer than cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the survival of patients with advanced unresectable primary hepatocellular
           carcinoma treated with intravenous doxorubicin hydrochloride vs doxorubicin
           hydrochloride chemoembolization.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the response rate in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare time to progression in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the health economic implications of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to participating center, stage of disease, and alpha-fetoprotein levels (&lt; 500
      ng/mL vs ≥ 500 ng/mL). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (control arm): Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 3-5 minutes on
           day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II (chemoembolization arm): Patients undergo transarterial chemoembolization using
           DC Bead and doxorubicin hydrochloride. Chemoembolization repeats every 8 weeks for a
           total of 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at weeks 10 and 24.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 12 weeks thereafter.

      Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 280 patients (140 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
