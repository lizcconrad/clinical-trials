  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether CP-547,632, an oral VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor is effective in the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal
      serous cancer, or fallopian tube cancer for patients who have failed first line
      platinum-based therapy and have a persistent rising CA-125.

             spiral CT or &amp;#163;2cm by conventional CT or clinical exam).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No prior exposure to mouse antibodies or prior VEGF or VEGF receptor targeted
             treatment or other anti-angiogenic-directed, anti-cancer treatment including
             thalidomide.

          -  No prior consolidation therapy with cytotoxic agents for ovarian cancer.

          -  Continuation of hormone replacement therapy is permitted.

          -  No requirement for concomitant anticoagulant therapy.

          -  Administration of low dose anticoagulants for maintenance of central venous access is
             permitted.No chronic oral or intravenous steroid use.
