      This study will examine whether the motor cortex (the part of the brain that controls
      movement) works properly in patients with primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), a disorder in
      which voluntary movements are very slow.

      Healthy volunteers between 40 and 75 years of age and patients with ascending PLS (a subset
      of PLS) may be eligible for this study. Patients with ascending PLS have a slowing of
      finger-tapping movements that corresponds to a particular abnormality of certain neuronal
      (nerve cell) activity.

      Participants perform a finger-tapping reaction time exercise while brain wave activity
      (electroencephalography, or EEG) and muscle activity (electroymogram, or EMG) are measured.
      The subject is seated in front of a computer screen. A signal appears on the screen and the
      subject taps a key as quickly as possible in response to the signal.

      For the EEG, brain activity is recorded by placing electrodes (small metal discs) on the
      scalp with an electrode cap or glue-like substance. A conductive gel is used to fill the
      space between the electrodes and the scalp to make sure there is good contact between them.
      The brain waves are recorded while the subject taps his or her fingers very slowly. For the
      surface EMG, electrodes filled with a conductive gel are taped to the skin.

      Participants also undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test uses a strong magnetic
      field and radio waves to obtain images of the brain. During the procedure, the subject lies
      still on a table that can slide in and out of the scanner - a narrow metal cylinder. Scanning
      time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours, with most scans lasting between 45 and 90 minutes.
      Subjects can communicate with the MRI staff at all times during the scan and can ask to be
      moved out of the machine at any time.

      Objective: Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS) is a clinical syndrome of progressive spasticity.
      Patients with PLS have slow voluntary movements. In PLS, degeneration of corticospinal tracts
      disrupts the communication between the motor cortex and motor neurons. Normally, voluntary
      movements are preceded by EEG waveform changes that begin before the movement occurs. These
      waveforms are called movement related cortical potentials (MRCPs). The first part of the MRCP
      represents neural activity in the motor cortex. The goal of this study is to determine
      whether the motor cortex and pre-motor cortex operate normally to generate these intrinsic
      signals for voluntary movement in patients with PLS.

      Study population: Patients with PLS of at least 3 years duration with slow finger tapping
      movements will be studied. Patients must fulfill the clinical criteria for the ascending
      subtype of PLS. They must also have a loss of corticospinal excitability as measured by
      transcranial magnetic stimulation. Age matched normal volunteers will be studied as a control
      group.

      Design: Patients and normal volunteers will undergo a session of EEG recording while making
      slow finger tapping movements. They will have an MRI of the brain, for the purpose of
      localizing dipole positions of the MRCP components.

      Outcome parameters: The peak amplitudes of components of the MRCPs will be compared between
      patients and a healthy control group as the primary outcome measure. Localization of the
      dipoles of the components is a secondary outcome measure.
