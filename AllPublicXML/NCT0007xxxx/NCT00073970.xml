      RATIONALE: Celecoxib may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by
      blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of celecoxib in treating patients who have
      relapsed prostate cancer following radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the effect of celecoxib on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in patients
           with prostate cancer in biochemical relapse after prior definitive radiotherapy or
           radical prostatectomy.

        -  Compare the PSA doubling times in patients treated with this drug vs historical
           controls.

        -  Compare the PSA doubling times in patients treated with this drug vs pretreatment PSA
           values.

        -  Determine the time to clinical recurrence in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily. Treatment continues for 5 years in the
      absence of disease progression. Patients may continue treatment beyond 5 years at the
      discretion of the treating physician.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>To study the effect of COX-2 inhibitors on PSA level in patients who have only biochemical relapse after definitive radiation therapy or surgery for prostate cancer. In particular, to study the effect of celecoxib on PSA levels and PSA doubling times as compared to 1) historical controls (known and well-described median PSA doubling times of 9 months), and 2) pre-treatment PSA values and doubling times.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease progression rate</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression will be defined as evidence of biochemical relapse (increase in serum PSA levels on 3 successive determinations, provided that the increase is at least 5 ng/ml from baseline) or clinical objective progression or relapse - i.e. the development of new lesions by digital rectal exam (DRE) or enlargement of existing lesion, or the development of symptoms of clinical progression (specifically bony pain) which is confirmed by radiological imaging studies</description>
