      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, work in
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Treating a
      person's lymphocytes in the laboratory and reinfusing them may replace immune cells destroyed
      by chemotherapy. Vaccines made from peptides may make the body build an immune response to
      kill tumor cells. Giving a vaccine with Montanide ISA-51 may cause a stronger immune response
      and kill more tumor cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's lymphocytes to kill tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well lymphocyte-depleting nonmyeloablative (not
      damaging to bone marrow) chemotherapy followed by autologous lymphocyte infusion, peptide
      vaccine plus Montanide ISA-51, and interleukin-2 works in treating patients with metastatic
      melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the clinical tumor regression in patients with metastatic melanoma treated
           with a lymphocyte-depleting nonmyeloablative preparative chemotherapy regimen followed
           by autologous lymphocyte infusion, ESO-1 peptide vaccination comprising ESO-1:157-165
           (165V) and Montanide ISA-51, and interleukin-2.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the survival of the infused lymphocytes in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the long-term immune status of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to type of lymphocyte infusion (ESO-1-reactive
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes [TIL] vs ESO-1 reactive peripheral blood lymphocytes [PBL]).

        -  Autologous lymphocyte collection and expansion: Autologous PBL or TIL are collected from
           patients during leukapheresis or biopsy. The cells are sensitized in vitro with
           ESO-1:157-165 (165V) melanoma antigen and expanded.

        -  Lymphocyte-depleting nonmyeloablative preparative chemotherapy: Patients receive
           lymphocyte-depleting nonmyeloablative preparative chemotherapy comprising
           cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -7 and -6 and fludarabine IV over 15-30 minutes
           on days -5 to -1.

        -  Autologous lymphocyte infusion: Autologous PBL or TIL are reinfused on day 0*. Patients
           also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily beginning on day 1 and
           continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  ESO-1 peptide vaccination: Patients receive ESO-1 peptide vaccination comprising
           ESO-1:157-165 (165V) peptide emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 SC on days 0*-4, 11, 18, and
           25.

        -  Interleukin therapy: Patients receive interleukin-2 IV over 15 minutes 3 times daily on
           days 0*-4.

      NOTE: *Day 0 is 1-4 days after the last dose of fludarabine.

      Patients achieving stable disease or partial response may receive up to 1 retreatment course.
      Patients with progressive disease after infusion of PBL may receive retreatment with TIL, if
      available.

      Patients are followed at 4-5 weeks, every 3-4 months for 2 years, and then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-74 patients (12-37 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 2-3 years.
