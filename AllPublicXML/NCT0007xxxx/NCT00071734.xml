  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the central regions and brain activation patterns associated with
      simple vocal behaviors under conditions of normal auditory feedback-when people hear
      themselves speak. Such feedback plays a major role in learning and maintaining human voice
      control. But voice control can be harmed by neurological injury or disease, reducing the
      ability of a person to orally communicate. Research has shown that auditory feedback is
      continuously monitored, brought about by both automatic and voluntary corrections in the
      amplitude (loudness) and frequency of (pitch) of the human voice. This study aims to
      determine which areas of the brain have activity dependent on the level of blood oxygen. It
      will provide new knowledge about basic vocal motor control and provide a basis for
      investigations into the integration of hearing and speaking in human vocal expression
      throughout life.

      Participants 18 to 45 years of age with normal hearing and voice function and with a steady
      heart rate may be eligible for this study.

      Participants will be evaluated by a speech-language specialist, regarding a history of voice
      health and measures of voice function. They will be tested on their ability to vary voice
      amplitude and frequency and tested on their hearing. Also, they will undergo an
      electrocardiogram to determine their heart rate.

      For the study, participants will undergo an MRI scan. During the MRI scan, patients will lie
      still on a table that can slide in and out of a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong
      magnetic field. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours, with most scans between 45
      and 90 minutes. Patients may be asked to lie still for up to 90 minutes at a time. As the
      scanner takes pictures, there will be loud knocking noises, and patients will wear headphones
      to muffle the sound. The headphones will also enable patients to hear their voice. The
      patient's head will be positioned with a coil of 25 to 30 cm diameter and supported by a
      headrest. A microphone will be placed about 2 cm from the patient's mouth for communication
      and collection of data. Also, an angled mirror will be attached to the head coil, so that the
      patient can look outside of the scanner. By way of a projection screen, the patient will
      receive a visual cue to vocalize, or use his or her voice.

      Patients will be asked to repeatedly do some of the following vocalization tasks: (1) rest,
      (2) hum or sigh without voicing (exhale), (3) hum or sigh audibly, (4) hum audibly while
      increasing or decreasing voice frequency, and (5) hum audibly while increasing or decreasing
      voice amplitude. During the scan, patients will be able to communicate with the MRI staff at
      all times and may ask to be moved out of the machine at any time. Some scans may be done in a
      3 Tesla scanner. It is the latest advance in MRI, with a stronger magnetic field than in the
      more common 1.5 Tesla scanner. Functional MRI is done while a person is performing tasks,
      such as moving a limb or speaking. The fMRI scan will take about 1 hour.

      Auditory feedback plays a uniquely prominent role in the learning and maintenance of human
      voice control. Yet much of what is known about central voice motor control has come from
      research in non-human primates during production of genetically-determined vocalizations that
      do not rely upon auditory feedback. Extrapolation from studies of bat echolocation suggest
      that midbrain networks underlie automatic audiovocal error correction in humans; however,
      bats and humans differ greatly in anatomical and physiology.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Males and females of any race or ethnicity will be eligible to participate in this study.

        Volunteers must be between the ages of 18 and 45 with normal hearing and voice function.
        Participants will be further selected for having a steady heart rate. A history of voice
        training is not required, but participants must be able to produce grossly independent
        voice F0 and amplitude changes.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Contraindications to participation include: pregnancy, cardiac pacemaker or auto
        defibrillator, artificial heart valve, neural pacemaker, surgical metal clips in the brain,
        eye, or on blood vessels, cochlear implants, ocular implants or foreign bodies such as
        metal shavings or splinters, insulin pump, implanted drug infusion device, shrapnel, bullet
        or shot wound, and tattooed makeup. Participants will be screened with the NMR Center
        Safety Screening Questionnaire which also includes items such as intraventricular shunts,
        transdermal medication patches, wire sutures, bone/joint pins, screws, nails, or plates,
        and body piercings. Given that surgical staples, orthopedic pins, orthodontic braces and
        dental implants are no longer considered absolute contraindications in MRI, Dr. Saxon or
        Dr. Kearney will approve or disapprove participation in the study based on their judgment
        of the MR compatibility of these items, using published guides including those referenced
        above.

        Volunteers will be also excluded if they are found to be pregnant, report any tendency
        toward claustrophobia or are unable for any reason to lie still within an MR scanner.
