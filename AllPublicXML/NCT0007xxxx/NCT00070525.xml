  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well tipifarnib works in treating young patients with
      recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma, medulloblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor,
      or brain stem glioma. Tipifarnib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes
      necessary for their growth.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate in pediatric patients with recurrent or progressive high-grade
      glioma, medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), or brain stem glioma treated
      with tipifarnib.

      II. Determine the distribution of time to progression, time to treatment failure, and time to
      death in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease (high-grade glioma vs recurrent or progressive medulloblastoma/primitive
      neuroectodermal tumor [PNET] vs progressive diffuse, intrinsic brain stem glioma).

      Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days for
      up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
