      This study will examine how depression, anxiety, and migraine run in families. It will help
      in defining the risk factors for physical, mental, and health problems-as well as define ways
      that those problems may be prevented and treated.

      A broad range of ages among family members will be included to evaluate the patterns of how
      these disorders are expressed throughout people's lives. Children of all ages will be
      included, and those ages 8 to 17 will be interviewed directly.

      Assessments will be collected through criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
      Mental Disorders IV as well as the spectrum, or range, of mood disorders and co-existing
      conditions. A member of the study team will visit the participants at home or will do an
      interview by telephone. Participation will take approximately 3 to 4 hours. Children will
      complete questionnaires given by the research team as well as questionnaires that they will
      do by themselves. The questions will pertain to the children's health, including physical and
      mental health and medical history, social relationships, problems, skills, and ways of
      dealing with important or stressful issues in their lives. These questionnaires will take up
      to 1 hour to complete.

      Health history gathered from adult participants will pertain to height, weight, exercise, and
      general function. Women will be asked about the use of oral contraceptives, estrogen, and
      progesterone. In addition, there will be questionnaires on personality and temperamental
      traits, that is, behavior and impulsiveness. Questions will also involve social intuition,
      family and other environmental factors, general functioning, and basic demographics such as
      ethnicity, race, socioeconomic status, marital status, education level, and employment
      history.

      Families enrolled in this phase of the research will be invited to participate in the next
      phase. There would be follow-up to evaluate the development of mood disorders, subtypes, and
      syndromes across the lifespan.

      Objective:

      The chief goal of this study is to identify the endophenotypes of the spectrum of mood
      disorders using the methods of genetic epidemiology, developmental psychopathology and
      clinical psychiatry/psychology. The major research questions focus on the specificity of
      familial transmission of the mood disorder spectrum (i.e., symptoms, symptom clusters,
      subtypes) and the role of comorbidity with anxiety disorders and migraine syndromes in
      defining subtypes of mood disorders.

      Study Population:

      We propose to recruit 800 probands with bipolar I, bipolar II, major depression, panic/GAD,
      phobias, migraine, and unaffected controls, ascertained through both psychiatric and
      non-psychiatric clinical settings and systematic community samples, in order to enhance
      generalizability to the population. Approximately 2750 first-degree adult relatives and
      spouses, 350 child offspring (ages 7-17), and 75 young child offspring (ages 0-7) will
      comprise the family study component. For a breakdown of these numbers by diagnostic group see
      table 1.

      Design:

      This study employs a retrospective cohort family study for the association between mood and
      other mental and physical disorders in probands and their relatives. Probands and relatives
      will be evaluated using structured diagnostic interviews and standardized diagnostic criteria
      followed by clinical validation interviews and diagnostic consensus procedures. Assessment
      instruments will collect information on the DSM-IV criteria as well as the spectrum of mood
      disorders and comorbid conditions. A subset of families will receive more comprehensive
      evaluation of clinical, laboratory, and other functional domains to identify biologic markers
      and endophenotypes for mood and related disorders.

      Outcome Measures:

      The primary outcome measure is the familial aggregation of mood disorder subtypes and their
      co-aggregation with migraine and anxiety disorders with diagnoses based on clinical review of
      the diagnostic interviews, family history information and clinical evaluation of study
      participants when relevant using traditional family study measures of association. Secondary
      outcomes include associations between mood disorders with the laboratory, biological, and
      functional assessments that are collected as part of the clinical study and their familial
      correlations.

        -  Since this study is based on systematic recruitment from the local community and other
             non-clinical settings such as screening protocols from volunteers, there are no
             specific diagnostic inclusion and exclusion criteria. However, the study targets
             individuals with mood spectrum conditions and migraine. Criteria for the specific
             subgroups of mood and anxiety disorders are presented in Table 1. Individuals who do
             not meet criteria are classified as controls.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. age 18 or greater;

          2. the ability to comprehend the interview, and

          3. probands must agree to contact at least two relatives.

             EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

             The only exclusion criteria include impaired ability to comprehend the interview or
             inability to read.
