    <textblock>
      Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (also known as tenofovir DF or Viread) is used with other
      anti-HIV drugs to treat HIV infection. Taking tenofovir DF every day may also prevent HIV
      infection. This study will determine if taking a tenofovir DF tablet every day is safe and
      effective in preventing HIV infection. Participants in the study will be sex workers in Phnom
      Penh, Cambodia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cambodia has one of the highest rates of HIV infection in Southeast Asia. At the end of 2002,
      HIV infection rates among Cambodian sex workers ranged from 14.8% to 28.8%. Tenofovir DF is a
      nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that was licensed for the treatment of
      HIV-1 infection by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2001. This
      randomized clinical trial will determine if a daily oral 300 mg dose of tenofovir DF is safe
      and effective in preventing HIV-1 infection. This is a collaborative study between the
      University of California, San Francisco, the University of New South Wales, and the Ministry
      of Health of Cambodia.

      Nine hundred and sixty HIV uninfected female sex workers in Phnom Penh will be enrolled in
      the trial. Participants will be randomized to receive either 300 mg of tenofovir DF or
      placebo daily for 12 months. Participants will be evaluated for rates of HIV infection,
      adherence to the drug regimen, and changes in risk behaviors. All participants will be
      monitored throughout the trial for side effects and toxicity. Participants will be involved
      in the study for 14 months.
