  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study’s purpose is to determine whether tolvaptan can safely and effectively return the
      body’s balance of sodium and water toward normal, and to characterize and quantify the
      potential clinical benefits of this treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium concentration below the lower limit of normal and
      is the most frequently encountered electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized patients.
      Generally speaking, most cases of hyponatremia are mild. However, as the serum sodium falls
      below 130 mEq/L, the possibility of significant morbidity and mortality increases, and most
      clinicians will initiate corrective therapy for serum sodium values approaching 130 mEq/L and
      lower. The reasons for treating hyponatremia relate both to the symptoms, which may be quite
      disturbing to patients, as well as to potential outcomes including permanent neurological
      damage and death. There is also growing awareness of the association between hyponatremia and
      increased mortality in patients with heart failure.A common theme underlying the occurrence
      of hyponatremia whether in the setting of congestive heart failure, hepatic failure with
      ascites, or the syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) is the non-osmotic
      secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP). The presence of excess AVP leads to fluid retention
      and hyponatremia. Agents that antagonize AVP, causing proportionally more water diuresis than
      solute excretion, could offer a significant treatment option for patients with hyponatremia,
      compared to fluid restriction alone. Treatment of hyponatremia, particularly in clinical
      settings such as decompensated congestive heart failure, is difficult as conventional
      diuretics cause neurohormonal activation and further stimulate the inappropriate release of
      vasopressin, leading to additional retention of free water and aggravation of hypoosmolality.
      Similarly, for cirrhosis with ascites and SIADH, conventional diuretics are either minimally
      effective or completely contraindicated. An alternative approach to symptom relief and
      treatment of hyponatremia may be the use of vasopressin antagonists, which increase free
      water clearance with proportionally less effect on sodium excretion. Tolvaptan is an oral
      vasopressin antagonist with relative affinity for the V2 receptor which has been shown to
      induce a diuresis with proportionally more free-water than sodium loss. The current study is
      being undertaken in order to evaluate whether tolvaptan, an oral AVP inhibitor, will be
      effective in correcting mild to moderate hyponatremia, and to elucidate the effect of this
      correction on the subject’s well-being.
