  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a simplified lopinavir-ritonavir based
      therapy will continue to keep the viral load to very low levels after initial treatment with
      a combination of Kaletra® (lopinavir/ritonavir) plus Combivir® (lamivudine/zidovudine).

          -  Subject is naïve to HIV ARV therapy or has received &lt; 7 days total of any HIV ARV
             therapy &gt; 30 days prior to study drug administration.

          -  Subject's HIV RNA is &gt;= 1000 copies/mL at screening.

          -  If sexually active, subject agrees to use safe sex practices to reduce risk of HIV
             transmission (e.g., male or female condom, vaginal dam, etc.).

          -  If female, the results of a urine pregnancy test performed at screening and on Day
             1/Baseline are both negative.

          -  If female, subject is either not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal
             for at least 1 year or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral
             oophorectomy or hysterectomy), or is of childbearing potential and practicing one of
             the following methods of birth control:

               -  A. Condoms, sponge, foams, jellies, diaphragm or intrauterine device.

               -  B. A vasectomized partner.

               -  C. Total abstinence from sexual intercourse.

          -  Subject is not breastfeeding.

          -  Subject's vital signs, physical examination, and laboratory results do not exhibit
             evidence of acute illness.

          -  Subject has a Karnofsky score greater than or equal to 70.

          -  Subject agrees not to take any drugs during the study, including over-the-counter
             medicines, vitamins, mineral supplements, herbal preparations, alcohol, or
             recreational drugs without the knowledge and permission of the investigator.

          -  Subject has not been treated for an active AIDS-defining opportunistic infection
             within 30 days of initiating study drug.

          -  Subject has voluntarily signed and dated an informed consent form, approved by an
             Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), after the nature
             of the study has been explained and the subject has had the opportunity to ask
             questions. The informed consent must be signed before any study-specific procedures
             are performed.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  A subject will be excluded from the study if he/she meets any of the following
             criteria:

          -  Subject has a history of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to lopinavir,
             ritonavir, lamivudine, zidovudine, efavirenz, or to any inert materials contained in
             the study drug formulations.

          -  Subject has significant history of cardiac, renal, neurologic, psychiatric, oncologic,
             endocrinologic, metabolic, or hepatic disease that would, in the opinion of the
             investigator, adversely affect his/her participation in this study.

          -  Subject is currently taking any drug (medicinal or herbal) that is contraindicated
             and/or not to be co-administered with any of the three study drugs as defined in the

          -  Subject has a history of drug and/or alcohol abuse or psychiatric illness that in the
             investigator's opinion could preclude compliance with the protocol.

          -  Subject is receiving immunomodulatory agents, colony stimulating factor, bone marrow
             stimulants (e.g., erythropoietin [Procrit®, Epogen®] or filgrastim [Neupogen®]),
             ganciclovir, interferon-alpha, and other bone marrow suppressive or cytotoxic agents.

          -  The TRUGENE HIV-1 resistance report indicates resistance or possible resistance to the
             study reverse transcriptase inhibitor(s) [RTI(s)] (efavirenz, lamivudine or
             zidovudine) OR the presence of any mutation in the protease gene leading to an amino
             acid substitution at the following loci: 8, 30, 32, 46, 47, 48, 50, 54, 82, 84, or 90
             OR four or more mutations at the following loci: 10, 20, 24, 36, 53, 63, or 71.

          -  Screening laboratory analyses show any of the following abnormal laboratory results:
             Presence of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); Hemoglobin &lt;= 9.5 g/dL; Absolute
             neutrophil count &lt;= 1000 cells/mL; Platelet count &lt;= 50,000 per mL; ALT (SGPT) or AST
             (SGOT) &gt;= 3.0 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN); Fasting Triglycerides &gt; 750 mg/dL;
             Fasting Cholesterol &gt; 300 mg/dL; Creatinine &gt;= 1.5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN);

          -  Subject is taking a prescribed lipid lowering medication such as HMG-CoA Reductase
             Inhibitors (statin) or fibrate medications.

          -  Subject has a history of diabetes mellitus.
