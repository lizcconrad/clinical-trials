  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a preliminary study designed to prepare for a full-scale, randomized
      clinical trial of the effectiveness of tai chi, mediation, and therapeutic massage for
      chronic lower back pain in adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the common use of complementary and alternative therapies for back pain, little is
      known about how such therapies compare with each other or with conventional medical therapies
      in terms of effectiveness and cost. This study will lay the groundwork for a full-scale trial
      that will evaluate the relative effectiveness and costs of three promising relaxation-related
      techniques (massage, tai chi, and meditation) that are appropriate for both younger and older
      adults with chronic lower back pain. The pilot study will identify and resolve unanticipated
      problems and estimate the sample sizes required for an adequately-powered, full-scale trial.

      Participants with chronic lower back pain will be randomly assigned to one of the following
      groups: tai chi, massage, meditation, or continued usual care (control group). The
      participants assigned to each intervention will be divided equally between persons under and
      over age 65.
