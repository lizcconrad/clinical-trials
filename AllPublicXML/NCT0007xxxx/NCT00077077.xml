      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as DJ-927 and capecitabine, use different ways to
      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of DJ-927 and
      capecitabine in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of DJ-927 and capecitabine in patients with locally
           advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting and non-dose-limiting toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the possible pharmacokinetic interactions of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, nonrandomized, multicenter study.

        -  Course 1: Patients receive oral DJ-927 once on day 1 and oral capecitabine once on days
           0 and 1 and twice daily on days 2-14.

        -  Course 2: Patients receive DJ-927 as in course 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily on
           days 2-15.

        -  Course 3 and all subsequent courses: Patients receive DJ-927 as in course 1 and oral
           capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14.

      All courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of DJ-927 and capecitabine until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A minimum of 6 patients receive
      treatment at the MTD.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
