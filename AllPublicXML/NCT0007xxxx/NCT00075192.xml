  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open label, randomized study. Patients will be randomized to one of
      the following arms with an allocation ratio of 3:1, respectively: Arm A: CP-675,206 +
      neoadjuvant hormone therapy (NHT) OR Arm B: neoadjuvant hormone therapy. After randomization,
      patients will receive study treatment for three cycles (one cycle is defined as 28 days).
      After completion of three cycles, patients will undergo a prostatectomy and pathology
      assessments will be completed at a central laboratory, the Armed Forces Institute of
      Pathology (AFIP) in Washington, DC.

          -  Potential candidate for NHT prior to prostatectomy, including high or intermediate
             risk of recurrence, based on an estimated risk of biochemical recurrence: High risk
             category: PSA &gt;20 or Gleason score 8 or cT2c/cT3 OR Intermediate risk category: PSA
             &gt;10 and d20 or Gleason score 7 or cT2b

          -  No evidence of metastatic disease by physical examination, bone scan, and computed

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1

          -  Adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function determined within 2 weeks prior to
             starting therapy

          -  Availability of prostatectomy specimen for histological analysis at the Armed Forces
             Institute of Pathology

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential requirement for systemic corticosteroids before surgery based on prior
             history

          -  History of autoimmune colitis or chronic GI conditions associated with diarrhea or
             bleeding, or current acute colitis of any origin

          -  Any serious uncontrolled medical disorder or active infection which would impair
             ability to receive study treatment and subsequent prostatectomy

          -  Coexisting malignancies except basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin
