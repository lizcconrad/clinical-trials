    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate patients with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) to learn more about the
      genetic causes of the various types of this inherited metabolic disorder and the medical
      complications associated with it. People with MMA may have problems with learning and
      development and kidney malfunctioning. They can become seriously ill, sometimes with little
      warning. There is no cure for any MMA, but special diets and vitamin therapies are used for
      treatment.

      Patients between 2 and 70 years of age with MMA may be eligible for this study. Participants
      are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 4-5 days each year for 5-10 years for the
      following tests and procedures:

        -  Medical history, physical examination, eye examination

        -  Consultations from dentists and specialists in the nervous system, digestive tract,
           endocrine, and kidney, as needed.

        -  24-hour urine collection to examine for methylmalonic acid, other acids, sugar, and
           proteins for measuring kidney function.

        -  Blood test to assess liver and thyroid function, blood counts and blood chemistries,
           methylmalonic acid levels, and for genetic tests and basic research studies.

        -  Blood test to measure growth hormone production. For this test, a very small amount of
           blood is collected overnight (every 20-30 minutes from 8:00 PM to 8:00 AM) through an
           intravenous catheter (plastic tube placed in a vein). The total amount of blood drawn is
           approximately 1 tablespoon. Patients who have stopped growing or whose weight does not
           permit collection of 1 tablespoon of blood do not undergo this procedure.

        -  Frequent blood pressure measurements, including overnight monitoring

        -  Skin biopsy for cell culture (cells to grow in the laboratory for future testing). For
           this procedure, an area of skin is numbed with an anesthetic such as lidocaine. A 4-mm
           diameter circular area is then removed using a sharp punch and scissors. The wound is
           dressed and usually heals within a week.

        -  Photographs of the face and body (wearing underwear) to help track growth and
           appearance.

        -  Ultrasound of the kidneys

        -  Hand x-ray to determine bone age

        -  Dual energy x-ray absorptionometry (DEXA) scan to assess bone density. For the DEXA
           scan, the patient lies still on a table while the spine and hip are scanned using a
           small amount of radiation.

      Any patient who becomes seriously ill during the evaluation may be cared for at the NIH or
      transferred to another hospital if it is deemed advisable.

    <textblock>
      Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), one of the most common inborn errors of organic acid
      metabolism, is heterogeneous in etiology and clinical manifestations. Affected patients with
      cblA, cblB and mut classes of MMA are medically fragile and can suffer from complications
      such as metabolic stroke or infarction of the basal ganglia, pancreatitis, end stage renal
      failure, growth impairment, osteoporosis, and developmental delay. The frequency of these
      complications and their precipitants remain undefined. Furthermore, current treatment
      protocol outcomes have continued to demonstrate substantial morbidity and mortality in the
      patient population. Rarely, solid organ transplantation (liver, and/or kidney) has been used
      to treat patients. Disordered intracellular metabolism of vitamin B12 produces another group
      of disorders that feature methylmalonic acidemia as well as (hyper)homocysteinemia. These
      conditions are named after the corresponding cellular complementation class cobalamin C
      (cblC), D and F and are also heterogenous, clinically and biochemically. The genetic
      disorders underlying cblE and cblG feature an isolated impairment of the activity of
      methionine synthase, a critical enzyme involved in the conversion of homocysteine to
      methionine. Lastly, a group of patients who have increased methylmalonic acid and/or
      homocysteine in the blood caused by mutation(s) in unknown genes exist.

      In this protocol, we will clinically evaluate patients with methymalonic acidemia and
      cobalamin metabolic defects. Routine inpatient admissions will last 4-5 days and involve
      urine collection, blood drawing, ophthalmological examination, radiological procedures,
      MRI/MRS, skin biopsies in some, and developmental testing. In a subset of patients who have
      or will receive renal, hepato- or hepato-renal transplants or have an unusual variant or
      clinical course and have MMA, a lumbar puncture to examine CSF metabolites will be performed.
      In this small group of patients, CSF metabolite monitoring may be used to adjust therapy.

      The study objectives will be to further delineate the spectrum of phenotypes associated with
      these enzymopathies, query for genotype/enzymatic/phenotype correlations and search for new
      genes in rare families that have evidence for an unknown class of methylmalonic acidemia
      and/or homocysteinemia. The population will consist of patients previously evaluated at NIH,
      physician referrals, and families directed to the study from clinicaltrials.gov as well as
      the Organic Acidemia Association. Most patients will be evaluated only at the NIH Clinical
      Center. However, if the NIH team decides that a patient under the age of 2 years is a
      candidate subject for this research protocol, that patient may enroll at the Children s
      National Medical Center (CNMC) site, pending approval by Dr Chapman, the Principal
      Investigator of the CNMC location. Outcome measures will largely be descriptive and encompass
      correlations between clinical, biochemical and molecular parameters.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients of any gender, ethnicity, and age are eligible to enroll in this protocol.
        Affected individuals under the age of 2 years may be clinically evaluated at Children s
        National Medical Center (CNMC) as part of an evolving agreement in the Translational
        Program in Pediatrics, if they are deemed eligible for participation. Patients will be
        diagnosed based on a determination of MMA and homocysteine levels in plasma and urine. Most
        will have their complementation class known or pending. Some patients who have not yet had
        this laboratory test will be admitted to the protocol based upon metabolic parameters and
        clinical history. This latter category of patients might include individuals with a
        suspected genetic but unknown class of MMA. We will also obtain specimens for patients
        under 2 years old with a suspected diagnosis of combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria
        (CMAMMA) for ACSF3 genetic testing because the NIH is the only center offering CLIA
        certified molecular diagnosis.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients will be excluded if they cannot travel to the NIH or CNMC because of their medical
        condition. The PI may decline to enroll a patient for other reasons. Other criteria that
        may lead to exclusion include, for example, residing in a hospital, sub-optimal metabolic
        control as determined by Dr. Venditti s review of the laboratory data, any patient who
        requires dialysis once or more/week and weighs &lt;40 kg, any patient who is being treated for
        an intercurrent infection with antibiotics or has evidence of an acute infection and has
        metabolic symptoms, any patient who does not have a regular/local metabolic, genetic or
        endocrine physician and/or a family physician, pediatrician, or internist, and any patient
        who may be metabolically unstable but not acutely ill. Each family may be contacted by Dr.
        Venditti or a staff member working with him one week prior to a pending inpatient admission
        to confirm that the patient is metabolically stable and ready to visit the NIH in a state
        of relative health, with an adequate supply of special formulas, medications, supplements,
        and if needed, medical equipment such as feeding pumps and replacement parts for feeding
        tubes.
