      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and activity of SGN-40 in a weekly
      dosage schedule as a single agent.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-dose, single-arm, phase I, dose-escalation study to define the
      toxicity profile, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of
      SGN-40 in patients with refractory or recurrent multiple myeloma.

      A minimum of three patients will be entered into each dose-level cohort. All patients will
      receive a dose-loading schedule during the first two weeks. The maximum weekly dose will be
      16mg/kg.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have refractory or recurrent secretory multiple myeloma (MM).

          2. Patients must have failed at least two different prior systemic therapies for MM.

          3. Patients may have received a maximum of five cytotoxic regimens.

          4. Patients who have received any of the following must complete within the specified
             time frame below:

               -  Autologous stem cell transplant - 12 weeks prior to first dose

               -  Nitrogen Mustard agents, Melphalan, BCNU, IVIG, or monoclonal antibody therapy -
                  6 weeks prior to first dose

               -  Chemotherapy, Radiation, or other therapies for MM - 4 weeks prior to first dose

          5. Patients who have not undergone autologous stem cell transplantation must be either
             ineligible for stem cell transplantation or, if eligible, must have refused treatment
             by autologous stem cell transplantation.

          6. Patients must have an ECOG performance status of ≤ 2 and a life expectancy &gt; three
             months.

          7. Patients must be available for periodic blood sampling, study-related assessments, and
             management of toxicity at the treating institution for the entire duration of the
             study.

          8. Patients must be at least 18 years of age.

          9. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative β-HCG pregnancy test result
             within three days of enrollment. All patients must plan to use an effective
             contraceptive method during the course of the study.

         10. Patients must meet baseline lab data requirements.

         11. Patients must give written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with non-secretory MM or solitary plasmacytoma or plasma cell leukemia.

          2. Patients with a history of allogeneic transplantation.

          3. Patients receiving plasmapheresis within four weeks prior to enrollment.

          4. Patients undergoing major surgery within four weeks prior to enrollment.

          5. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to recombinant proteins or any excipient
             contained in the drug formulation.

          6. Patients with a history of other malignancies during the past five years with the
             exception of adequately treated basal or squamous cell skin cancer or cervical
             carcinoma in situ.

          7. Patients with any active viral, bacterial, or systemic fungal infection within four
             weeks of enrollment.

          8. Patients with a history of significant chronic or recurrent infections requiring
             treatment.
