      Surface eye problems (problems of the cornea and conjunctiva), such as dry eye, are often
      evaluated using ocular surface staining - the application of a colored dye to the surface of
      the eye. The physician examines the nature, degree, and pattern of staining on the eye's
      surface to determine the diagnosis, assess disease severity, and document treatment effects.
      Grading of ocular surface staining is often used in research studies to measure the response
      to a treatment or treatment side effects. Therefore, it is critical that the grading
      methodology be reproducible and sufficiently detailed to detect changes in eye health status.
      Current evaluation techniques using these dyes are somewhat subjective, however, since they
      require human assessment and judgment. This study will assess the validity and reliability of
      digital photography and compare it with standard slit lamp evaluation for analyzing ocular
      surface dye staining to document surface eye damage in patients with dry eye.

      Patients 3 years of age and older with dry eye may be eligible for this study. Participants
      will have the following tests and procedures:

        -  Visual acuity: (eye chart) test

        -  Slit lamp evaluation: Examination of the front part of the eye with a special microscope
           called a slit lamp biomicroscope. Special dyes derived from vegetables are instilled
           into the eye to stain the surface of the eye where it is dry and damaged. The doctor
           then determines the extent of staining. The staining will be repeated within one week of
           the first examination.

        -  Digital eye photography: Digital photographs of the eye are taken to aid in assessing
           the extent of dry eye changes. The camera flashes a bright light for each picture. About
           5 to 10 pictures are taken for each eye.

      Ocular surface vital dye staining is a measure of ocular surface damage and is frequently
      used as an endpoint in clinical studies. The identification and development of standardized
      objective outcome measures for the evaluation of therapeutic intervention of ocular surface
      disease is an area previously identified as critical to the future of well-designed clinical
      trials in this area. The Report of the NEI / Industry Workshop on Clinical Trials in Dry Eyes
      identified, the standardization of clinical tests used to diagnose dry eye states and assess
      treatment effects, as an area of critical interest. The purpose of this protocol is to
      determine the suitability of slit lamp biomicroscopic digital photography of ocular surface
      vital dye staining by comparing it to the current standard procedure, clinical assessment.
      Digital image-based assessment would have many advantages over current procedures and would
      apply the appropriate rigor to the evaluation of the anterior segment that has been shown to
      be an extremely effective method for the evaluation of the extent of posterior segment
      diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. Such valid,
      reproducible, reliable photographic documentation of retinal abnormalities and disease
      progression has been successfully employed as a primary outcome measure in many large
      clinical trials. In this protocol, we will compare grading of digital images of ocular
      surface staining to clinical assessment, facilitating the use of ocular surface vital dye
      staining as a valid outcome measure in clinical trials.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Individuals with ocular surface dysfunction and/or disease are eligible for inclusion in
        this study.

        Individuals being evaluated or treated for ocular surface disease will be enrolled.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients who cannot hold their eyes open long enough for the photographs to be taken or who
        has a known allergy to sodium fluorescein or lissamine green will be excluded.

        Children 2 years of age or younger will be excluded since they will not be able to
        cooperate for slit lamp photography. Dry eye is exceedingly uncommon in this age group.
