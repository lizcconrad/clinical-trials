      RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as MDX-010, work in different ways to stimulate the
      immune system and stop tumor cells from growing. Vaccines made from gp100 peptides may make
      the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Combining the vaccines with Montanide
      ISA-51 may cause a stronger immune response and kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known
      whether monoclonal antibody therapy is more effective with or without vaccine therapy in
      treating advanced melanoma.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying monoclonal antibody therapy alone to see
      how well it works compared to monoclonal antibody therapy, gp100 peptides, and Montanide
      ISA-51 in treating patients with stage IV melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the clinical response in patients with stage IV melanoma treated with
           escalating doses of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody
           (MDX-010) with or without gp100 peptides emulsified in Montanide ISA-51.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity profile of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the immunologic response in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine, in HLA-A*0201-positive patients, the differences in responses between
           patients previously vaccinated with gp100 peptides and patients not previously
           vaccinated.

      OUTLINE: This is a 2-part, partially randomized study.

        -  Part I (closed as of 3/7/2005):

             -  HLA-A*0201-negative patients: Patients receive anti-cytotoxic
                T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody (MDX-010) IV over 90 minutes
                on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 doses (3 courses of 3
                escalating doses) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             -  HLA-A*0201-positive patients: Patients are stratified according to prior exogenous
                gp100 peptide immunization (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
                arms.

                  -  Arm I: Patients receive MDX-010 in the same manner as the HLA-A*0201-negative
                     patients.

                  -  Arm II: Patients receive MDX-010 as in arm I. Patients also receive
                     gp100:209-217 and gp100:280-288 peptides emulsified in Montanide ISA-51
                     subcutaneously immediately after each MDX-010 infusion.

        -  Part II:

             -  HLA-A*0201-negative patients (closed as of 3/7/2005): Patients receive MDX-010 as
                in part I. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 doses (2 courses of 2
                escalating doses, beginning with a higher dose level than in part I) in the absence
                of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             -  HLA-A*0201-positive patients: Patients are stratified and randomized as in part I.

                  -  Arm I: Patients receive MDX-010 in the same manner as the HLA-A*0201-negative
                     patients.

                  -  Arm II: Patients receive MDX-010 as in arm I. Patients also receive
                     gp100:209-217 and gp100:280-288 peptides emulsified in Montanide ISA-51
                     subcutaneously immediately after each MDX-010 infusion.

      In both parts, patients with stable disease or a complete response (CR) after completing all
      courses of MDX-010 may receive 1 additional course of therapy in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving a partial response may continue to recieve treatment with
      MDX-010 at the same dose, in the absence of unacceptable toxicity, until CR or until tumor is
      no longer shrinking.

      Patients are followed at 3 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and
      then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35-179 patients (up to 35 for part I [closed as of 3/7/05] and
      69-141 [23-47 per arm (arm I closed as of 3/7/05)] for part II) will be accrued for this
      study within 3-4 years.
