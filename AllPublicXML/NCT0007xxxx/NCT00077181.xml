  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine, work in different ways to stop cancer cells
      from dividing so they stop growing or die. 3-AP may help cytarabine kill more cancer cells by
      making them more sensitive to the drug. This phase I trial is studying the side effects and
      best dose of 3-AP when given with high-dose cytarabine in treating patients with advanced
      hematologic malignancies

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of 3-AP (Triapine) administered with high-dose
      cytarabine in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the clinical activity of this regimen in these patients. II. Determine the
      effect of treatment with 3-AP (Triapine) on intracellular levels of cytarabine in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 3-AP (Triapine).

      Patients receive high-dose cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5 and 3-AP (Triapine) IV over
      2 hours on days 2-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each stratum receive escalating doses of 3-AP (Triapine) until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-48 patients (3-24 per stratum) will be accrued for this study
      within 15-24 months.
