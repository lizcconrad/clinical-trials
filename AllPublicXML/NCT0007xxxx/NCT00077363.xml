  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving capecitabine together with tipifarnib works
      in treating women with taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die. Tipifarnib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes
      necessary for their growth. Giving capecitabine together with tipifarnib may kill more tumor
      cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The primary objective of this study is to determine the response rate in patients with
      taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer treated with capecitabine plus tipifarnib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate toxicity in patients with taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer treated
      with capecitabine plus tipifarnib.

      II. To evaluate progression free survival, time to treatment failure, and overall survival in
      patients with taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer treated with capecitabine plus
      tipifarnib.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive 4 additional courses beyond documentation
      of CR.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast with
             manifestations of metastatic progression

          -  Patients must have at least one objective measurable disease parameter as defined by
             RECIST criteria; tumor measurements and evaluation of non-measurable sites must be
             performed within 4 weeks prior to registration

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2

          -  In order to be eligible for inclusion, patients must meet all of the following
             criteria with regard to prior cytotoxic therapy: (1) prior treatment with an
             anthracycline (e.g., doxorubicin, epirubicin) either in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant
             setting and/or for metastatic disease, (2) prior treatment with a taxane (i.e.
             paclitaxel, docetaxel) for metastatic disease, or relapse while receiving adjuvant
             taxane therapy (3) progressive disease while receiving taxane therapy or up to 30 days
             after receiving the last taxane dose, (4) no more than three prior cytotoxic regimens
             for metastatic disease, (5) no prior treatment with capecitabine or 5-flourouracil for
             metastatic disease

          -  Prior hormonal therapy in either the metastatic or adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting is
             allowed, but patients must have been off such therapy for greater than or equal to 1
             week prior to registration

          -  No prior radiotherapy other than to the conserved breast, to the postmastectomy chest
             wall or to a limited field involving less than 25% of marrow - containing bone

               -  Previously irradiated tumors cannot be used to assess a clinical response;
                  patients will not be eligible for this study if the previously irradiated tumors
                  constitute the only site of measurable disease

          -  Patients must not have previously received tipifarnib or other farnesyl transferase
             inhibitors

          -  Patients must be disease-free of prior malignancies for &gt; 5 years with the exception
             of curatively treated basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin or carcinoma in
             situ of the cervix

          -  Patients must have serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 mg/dl or measured (or calculated)
             creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/minute

          -  Granulocytes &gt; 1500/mm^3

          -  Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm^3

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal

          -  SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT) =&lt; 3 x upper limit of normal (unless liver is involved by
             tumor, in which case SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT) can be =&lt; 5 x upper limit of normal)

          -  Patients must not be pregnant or breastfeeding since there is no information regarding
             the use of these agents in this population; a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             is required within 14 days prior to registration if pre- or perimenopausal (i.e., last
             menstrual period within one year of registration)

          -  Women of childbearing potential are strongly advised to use an accepted and effective
             method of contraception

          -  Patients with current or previously treated brain metastases are ineligible; patients
             who are taking enzyme inducing anticonvulsant medications are also not eligible (e.g.,
             phenobarbital, phenytoin)

          -  Patients must not have had prior organ allograft or received immunosuppressive therapy

          -  Patients must not have any uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not
             limited to, chronic nausea/vomiting, complete or partial bowel obstruction,
             dysphagia/odynophagia with inability to swallow pills, ongoing or active infection,
             symptomatic cardiovascular disease, or other chronic medical or psychiatric conditions
             that would impair compliance or would substantially increase the risk of participating
             in this study

          -  Patients must not have received previous treatment with cytotoxic drugs, and/or
             radiotherapy &lt; 4 weeks prior to registration; concurrent radiation therapy is not
             permitted

          -  Because of the potential for a drug interaction between warfarin and both tipifarnib
             and capecitabine, patients taking warfarin adjusted to an elevated INR are not
             eligible; patients taking prophylactic low-dose warfarin (i.e., 1 mg daily) are
             eligible, but a PT and INR are required within 2 weeks of registration and must be
             normal

          -  Patients with CTC v 3.0 grade 2-4 neuropathy are not eligible
