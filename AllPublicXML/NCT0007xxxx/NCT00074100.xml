      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as amonafide, work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of amonafide in treating women who have
      metastatic breast cancer that has progressed after previous chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the time to progression in women with metastatic breast cancer who have
           progressed after prior chemotherapy and are now treated with amonafide.

        -  Determine the overall response rate (complete and partial response) in patients treated
           with this drug.

        -  Determine the safety of a phenotypically driven dosing regimen of this drug in these
           patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to tumor response, duration of response, and time to treatment
           failure in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive amonafide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at
      least 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with
      stable or responding disease may receive additional courses (beyond 5 courses) at the
      investigator's discretion.

      Patients are followed at 30 days and then every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 175 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
