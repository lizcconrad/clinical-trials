      This study will implement a school-based program to prevent depression, academic failure, and
      substance use in at-risk adolescents transitioning from middle school to high school.

    <textblock>
      The transition from middle school to high school presents important challenges for
      adolescents. Programs that enhance personal efficacy and social support resources may prevent
      at-risk students from developing behaviors that can lead to substance use, academic failure,
      and depression. This study will implement a skills-based program called Coping and Support
      Training for the Transition (CAST-T) as a preventive intervention for at-risk students.

      At-risk students in eighth grade will be randomly assigned to receive either CAST-T or school
      as usual. The CAST-T program will initially be delivered in twelve sessions over 6 weeks in
      the middle school setting. The program includes booster sessions, case management, structured
      home-based parent education, and support and skills training throughout the transition
      period. Participants will be assessed from the beginning of eighth grade to the end of ninth
      grade. Vulnerability to academic problems and depression will be assessed with school records
      and self-report scale scores.

    <measure>Change in Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire is a 13 item measure of level of self reported depressive symptoms. Each item in scored on a 3-point Likert scale as follows: &quot;True&quot; (0), &quot;Sometimes&quot; (1), and &quot;Not True&quot; (2) rated within the timeframe of the previous two weeks. A total score is obtained; scores can range from 0 to 26. Total scores of 12 or higher may signify that a child/adolescent is suffering from depression. Higher scores on this scale suggest a worse outcome or greater endorsement of depressive symptoms. Change is measured based on two time points baseline to the 18 months follow-up assessment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>School Attachment</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>School attachment measure consisted of 4 items. Item responses range from 0 (unsatisfied, rarely attended, not involved, etc.) to 6 (highly satisfied, regularly attended, very involved, etc). Scores could range from 0 to 36 with higher scores indicating more positive school attachment. Item were:
My overall satisfaction with classes was… Overall, how safe did school feel last semester… Overall, how friendly did school feel… How involved were you in school activities…</description>

    <description>The CAST-T/HSTS condition combined the Brief Intervention and 12 school based small group sessions which taught skills to enhance personal control (to manage depression, anger, stress), self-esteem, decision making and interpersonal communications. HSTS skills groups were held in the spring of 8th grade with 4 one-on-one booster sessions delivered to the students as 9th graders by HSTP leaders; parents also participated in 4 sessions. HSTS objectives are: 1) to increase the acquisition of coping skills competencies by teaching and practicing strategies taught; 2) to increase social support resources by building a supportive network; 3) to increase the youth's engagement in positive social activities; and 4) to motivate parents to increase their support via parent educational sessions.</description>

    <description>Brief Intervention: After each youth and parent completed baseline questionnaires the youth participated in a 1 on 1 standardized clinical follow-up with a trained clinician (blind to study condition) to review areas of concern, based on questionnaire responses including stressors at school, home, and with peers, level of support available and how to access support. The teen and clinician then planned a feedback call to parents, allowing teens to shape requests for support from parents as well as understand exactly what information would be shared with parents. Feedback call to parents reviewed concerns and made recommendations for services as needed. A similar procedure was followed after each assessment for all participants who indicated a risk of clinical depression or self-harm.</description>

      <recruitment_details>8th graders in 6 middle schools completed the screening battery; those with 15+ on the Moods and Feelings Questionnaire and below the clinical cutoff on the Youth Self Report, Aggressive subscale were eligible. 716 met criteria; 497 were randomized. 123 families or youth declined; the rest could not be contacted.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants recruited across 4 annual cohorts, included 241 youth randomized to HSTS and 256 to the Brief Intervention (BI). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups at baseline in terms of gender, race, and socioeconomic status (SES) as well as baseline comparisons of target variables (depression, hopelessness, anxiety, anger).</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change in Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ)</title>
        <description>The Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire is a 13 item measure of level of self reported depressive symptoms. Each item in scored on a 3-point Likert scale as follows: &quot;True&quot; (0), &quot;Sometimes&quot; (1), and &quot;Not True&quot; (2) rated within the timeframe of the previous two weeks. A total score is obtained; scores can range from 0 to 26. Total scores of 12 or higher may signify that a child/adolescent is suffering from depression. Higher scores on this scale suggest a worse outcome or greater endorsement of depressive symptoms. Change is measured based on two time points baseline to the 18 months follow-up assessment.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to 18 months</time_frame>
        <population>The main study hypothesis was that at-risk middle school students randomly assigned to participate in the CAST-T/HSTS versus the Brief Intervention would demonstrate a greater reduction in self-reported depressive symptoms after the 8th grade intervention as well as lower rate of increase in depressive symptoms at the 18 mos. follow-up.</population>

            <title>CAST-T/HSTS</title>
            <description>HSTS condition combined the Brief Intervention and the HSTS protocol. HSTS introduced skills to enhance personal control (management of depression, anger and stress), self-esteem, decision making and interpersonal communications. Skills were taught in school based small groups to foster social support with outreach to teachers, peers, and parents. HSTS skills groups were held in the spring of 8th grade followed by four one-on-one booster sessions delivered to the students as 9th graders by HSTP leaders; parents participated in four educational sessions.
HSTS objectives are: 1) to increase the acquisition of coping skills competencies by teaching and practicing strategies taught; 2) to increase social support resources by building a supportive network; 3) to increase the youth's engagement in positive social activities; and 4) to motivate parents to increase their support via parent educational sessions.

            <description>Brief Intervention: After each youth and parent completed baseline questionnaires the youth participated in a 1 on 1 standardized clinical follow-up with a trained clinician (blind to study condition) to review areas of concern, based on questionnaire responses including stressors at school, home, and with peers, level of support available and how to access support. The teen and clinician then planned a feedback call to parents, allowing teens to shape requests for support from parents as well as understand exactly what information would be shared with parents. Feedback call to parents reviewed concerns and made recommendations for services as needed. A similar procedure was followed after each assessment for all participants who indicated a risk of clinical depression or self-harm.
