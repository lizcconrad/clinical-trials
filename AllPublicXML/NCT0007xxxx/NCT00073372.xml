      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of abciximab in the treatment of
      acute ischemic stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abciximab is a drug that prevents platelets from sticking together and forming a clot. There
      are limited studies using abciximab in the treatment of strokes. This phase III, multicenter,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study is designed to assess the
      effectiveness and safety of abciximab for treatment of acute ischemic stroke, in helping
      dissolve clots in brain arteries so that blood and oxygen can flow better and there may be
      less brain damage.

      Safety evaluations will be performed at specified intervals throughout the study and will
      consist of laboratory tests, vital signs (such as blood pressure), physical examinations and
      the occurrence and severity of adverse events as well as other study specific procedures.
      Patients will receive either Abciximab: 0.25 mg/kg bolus (to a maximum of 30 mg) followed by
      a 0.125 µg/kg/min infusion (to a maximum of 10 µg/min) for 12 hours or a bolus of placebo
      followed by infusion for 12 hours

             onset

        Exclusion Criteria:
