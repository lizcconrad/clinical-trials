    <textblock>
      People with knee osteoarthritis (OA) frequently complain of knee instability. This study will
      test whether certain exercises can improve knee stability, reduce pain, and improve physical
      function in people with knee OA.

      Study hypotheses: 1) Participants in the stability training group will demonstrate less pain
      and higher levels of physical function, based on self-report measures of pain and function
      (WOMAC, Lower Extremity Function Scale), and less time to complete the Get Up and Go test, a
      physical performance measure of function. 2) During walking and the step down task,
      participants in the stability training group will demonstrate greater knee motion during
      weight bearing, greater vertical ground reaction forces and loading rates, and reduced ratios
      of co-contraction between quadriceps/hamsting and tibialis anterior/gastrocnemius muscle
      pairs compared to the standard group. Participants in the stability group will also
      demonstrate greater step lengths, single limb support times, and average walking velocity
      compared to the standard group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditional exercise therapy for knee OA primarily focuses on lower limb strength and joint
      motion deficits. Recent evidence has suggested that changes in lower limb biomechanical
      factors during weight bearing activities may have substantial impact on physical function and
      disease progression in individuals with knee OA. The effectiveness of exercise therapy
      programs might be improved by incorporating balance and agility training techniques (knee
      stability training). The aim of this trial is to test the effectiveness of supplementing
      traditional exercise therapy with knee stability training techniques tailored for individuals
      with knee OA.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. The first group will participate
      in a standard rehabilitation program of traditional exercise therapy for knee OA. The second
      group will participate in a standard rehabilitation program supplemented with a knee
      stability program. Study visits will occur at study entry, 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year. At
      each study visit, changes in pain, physical function, and biomechanical factors will be
      assessed. This study will last for one year.
