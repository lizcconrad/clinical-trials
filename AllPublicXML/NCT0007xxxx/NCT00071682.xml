  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of herbal products interferes with
      normal anticoagulation, leading to either excessive thinning of the blood and bleeding
      problems or inadequate thinning of the blood and clotting problems. Many patients who are on
      long term anticoagulation, or blood thinning, for a variety of medical problems, also take
      herbal products. It is not yet known whether use of herbal products interferes with this
      anticoagulation, and puts patients at risk for bleeding or clotting. This study will
      carefully monitor patients who are taking herbs and anticoagulants to determine if their
      laboratory tests show signs of being affected by the herbs. The study will ask all patients
      about their herbal product use, so all reported herbs will be included and monitored.
