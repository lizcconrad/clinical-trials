      The purpose of this study is to characterize the quality of life (QOL) and longitudinal
      patterns of change in QOL outcomes in children and youth with HIV infection; to identify
      demographic, social, disease status, treatment, and health care utilization factors that
      predict longitudinal changes in outcomes; to develop a conceptual model that characterizes
      the effects of specific factors that predict longitudinal changes in QOL; and to characterize
      the influence of HIV symptoms on QOL outcomes in the domains of health perceptions, physical,
      psychological, and social role functioning.

      This is a Phase III study. This study will use national data available through a prospective,
      observational, longitudinal study of children and youth (n=1,993) from birth to 25 with HIV
      infection (Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 219/219C) to develop knowledge about
      the quality of life (QOL) and the factors that affect it in order to be able to implement
      effective nursing interventions and clinical programs to support and improve QOL in this
      vulnerable population of children.
