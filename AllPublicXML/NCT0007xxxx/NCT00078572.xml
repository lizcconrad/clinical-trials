    <textblock>
      This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of an oral dual tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor in combination with capecitabine versus capecitabine alone in women with locally
      advanced or metastatic breast cancer that has not responded to previous therapy.

                  anthracycline-containing chemotherapy, and for whom further anthracycline is not

             or metastatic setting. Trastuzumab administered in the adjuvant setting is not
             exclusionary, but for eligibility trastuzumab must also have been administered in the
             locally advanced or metastatic setting.

             expression levels of ErbB1 and ErbB2 by IHC and FISH testing performed by the study
             central laboratory. Central laboratory results will not be used to determine subject
             eligibility for the study, unless testing is being used for required documentation of
