      This study will determine whether Medication Adherence Therapy (MAT) can improve medication
      adherence and lower the risk of rehospitalization in older patients with psychosis.

      Psychoses are among the most common and serious psychiatric disorders. Currently, the most
      effective treatment for psychoses involves the use of antipsychotic or neuroleptic
      medications. Unfortunately, pharmacologic regimens often do not achieve their goals because
      of poor medication adherence. Nonadherence to antipsychotic treatment is a considerable
      public health problem that leads to myriad clinical and economic burdens, including psychotic
      relapse, increased clinic and emergency room visits, and rehospitalization.

      Participants in this study are randomly assigned to receive either MAT or supportive
      treatment for 12 weeks. MAT is given in 15 sessions and consists of motivational
      interviewing, education, and social skills and behavior modification. Individual MAT sessions
      are held in Weeks 1 and 12; small group sessions take place in Weeks 2 through 11. Three
      monthly booster group sessions begin in Week 16. Participants are assessed at baseline and at
      3, 6, and 12 months. Medication adherence, psychopathology, quality of life, medication side
      effects, health beliefs, and functioning are assessed.
