  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar spinal manipulation, or chiropractic adjusting, is thought to separate the surfaces of
      the spinal joints and thereby relieve lower back pain. This study will use MRI scans to
      evaluate the spinal joints before and after spinal manipulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Zygapophysial joints, better known as facet or “Z” joints, are located on the back
      (posterior) of the spine on each side of the vertebrae where it overlaps the neighboring
      vertebrae. Z joints provide stability and allow the spine to bend and twist. Adhesions in the
      Z joints may develop following hypomobility of vertebrae. These adhesions may be alleviated
      by separation (gapping) of the Z joints.

      Side posture adjusting (spinal manipulation) is thought by many to gap the Z joints, yet no
      measurable differences of the Z joints before and after spinal manipulation have ever been
      published. This study will evaluate gapping of the L3/L4, L4/L5, and L5/S1 Z joints by taking
      measurements directly from MRI scans of the Z joints before and during positioning for a side
      posture adjustment, and before and after side posture adjusting.

      Health volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1) neutral position
      followed by side posture positioning (trunk rotated to the volunteer’s right); 2) neutral
      position followed by side posture spinal adjusting followed by neutral positioning; 3)
      neutral position followed by side posture spinal adjusting, followed by side posture
      positioning; and 4) neutral position followed by neutral position (control group). MRI scans
      will be taken with the volunteers in the original neutral position and in the final position
      (either second neutral position or side posture positioning).
