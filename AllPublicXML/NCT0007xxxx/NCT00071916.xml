    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a group of African Americans and Caucasians with
      hepatitis C virus (HCV), compare their response rates to combination treatment with pegylated
      interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin, and identify possible causes for racial differences in
      response to therapy. The study will enroll a total of 260 participants, age 18 or older, over
      a 10 period. In the next 5 years 132 subjects will be studied locally, including 112 African
      Americans and 20 Caucasians. Participants will be recruited from the clinical practices of
      the hepatologists (liver doctors) at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and
      will also be selected from referrals at local hepatology clinics and the Memphis VA Hospital.
      Volunteers will be treated with pegylated interferon alfa-2b injections once weekly and oral
      ribavirin 2 times a day for up to 72 weeks. Study procedures include multiple blood draws.
      Participants may be involved in study related procedures for up to 72 weeks.

      The University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC) Memphis Hepatitis C Cooperative
      Research Center was established in 2000 to support clinical and basic research in
      understanding the basis for chronic disease in hepatitis C (HCV) infection and response to
      therapy in clinically infected patients. The primary research goal is to understand why
      African American (AA) patients with chronic hepatitis C are more susceptible to chronic
      infection and why their response rate to combination therapy is only 50 percent or less of
      that for non AA patients. The present study will support this ongoing work by continuing to
      provide clinical samples from patients with chronic hepatitis C who are undergoing treatment.
      The specific aims for the 2005-2010 Hepatitis C Cooperative Research Center are: to determine
      how human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II-dependent immune regulation and T cell
      specificities affect differences in immune responses to HCV and response to therapy in AA
      patients compared to non AA patients; to determine if there is a difference in
      interferon-induced signaling between patients that respond to therapy and those that do not;
      and to measure and compare the sustained virologic response to standard treatment for
      hepatitis C between AA and non AA patients. Researchers plan to continue enrollment of
      patients to the &quot;African American Response to Therapy for Hepatitis C&quot; study (112 African
      American patients and 20 Caucasian patients) in order to meet the current specific aims.
      Participants will include adult African American and Caucasian patients with compensated
      chronic hepatitis C who have not been previously treated with interferon and/or ribavirin.
      Patients meeting the entry criteria will be enrolled. The total number of patients to be
      enrolled is 260 over a 10-year period. In the next 5 years 132 subjects (112 African
      American, 20 Caucasian) will be studied locally. Patients will be recruited primarily from
      the clinical practices of the hepatologists at UTHSC. Patients will also be selected from
      referrals at local Gastroenterology Hepatology clinics and the Memphis Department of Veterans
      Affairs (VA) Hospital. Patients will be treated with weight based pegylated interferon
      alfa-2b once weekly and weight based ribavirin twice a day. Duration of treatment with both
      pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin will be for up to 72 weeks. Treatment will be
      discontinued at 24 weeks if there is persistent viremia and the patient wishes to discontinue
      therapy. Ribavirin will be administered orally at a dose of 13 +/- 2 mg/kg per day twice
      daily, with 200 mg capsules. Pegylated interferon alpha-2b will be administered by the
      subcutaneous route.

             disease; immunologically-mediated diseases; gout' or any medical condition requiring,

             Pretreatment stress test will be required for all participants greater than 50 years
             of age or 45 years of age if diabetic.

          -  Patients with clinically significant retinal abnormalities.

          -  Substance abuse, such as alcohol (greater than 80 gm/day), intravenous (IV) drugs and
             inhaled drugs. If the patient has a history of substance abuse, to be considered for
             inclusion into the protocol, the patient must have abstained from using the abused
             substance for at least 3 months.

          -  Patients with a history of organ transplantation will be excluded.

          -  Patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus.

          -  Preexisting psychiatric conditions; especially severe depression, or a history of
             severe psychiatric disorder, such as major psychoses, active suicidal ideation and/or
             suicidal attempt are excluded. Patients with a history of mild depression may enter
             the protocol if they meet the following eligibility criterion and are monitored more
             intensively. Mild depression includes either situational depression for a limited
             period or depressive symptoms, which do not significantly interfere with the patient's
             work or daily functions. All patients will complete the Center for Epidemiological
             Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The CES-D is a 20-item self-report scale designed to
             measure depressive symptomatology experienced during the week prior to the interview.
             The items are scored on a four-point scale (0-3), with the total score ranging from
             zero to 60. CES-D scores of 16-20 suggest minor depression, and scores greater than 20
             suggest major depression. The score can be determined in real time. A score of 16 or
             higher should prompt further questioning and consideration of treatment or referral to
             psychiatry. Detailed follow-up of each patient may be individualized according to
             his/her need; this would usually include predetermined visits.
