  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving temozolomide together with thalidomide works
      in treating patients with brain metastases secondary to melanoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die. Thalidomide may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the
      tumor. Combining temozolomide with thalidomide may kill more tumor cells

      OBJECTIVES: Primary I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with brain
      metastases secondary to melanoma treated with temozolomide and thalidomide.

      Secondary I. Determine the toxic effects of and tolerance to this regimen in these patients.

      II. Determine the objective response rate in extracranial metastases of patients treated with
      this regimen.

      III. Determine the time to first disease progression (intra- or extracranial) in patients
      treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-42 and oral thalidomide once daily on
      days 1-56. Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses of therapy
      beyond CR.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years.
