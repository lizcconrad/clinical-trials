      The purpose of this study is to identify health management concerns and needs of family
      members of asymptomatic and symptomatic persons with mutation in the gene for Huntington
      Disease (HD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study with three phases. In Phase 1, focus groups consisting of
      family members of persons with HD Gene mutation will be conducted and data collected to be
      analyzed through content analysis to identify salient themes and key issues. In Phase 2, a
      survey instrument will be developed and field-tested in order to describe the health care
      needs, management strategies, and needs for health and social services of
      relative/significant others of asymptomatic and symptomatic persons with the mutation in the
      gene for HD.

      In Phase 3, the survey will be distributed to family members of asymptomatic and symptomatic
      persons with mutation in the gene for HD and frequencies and comparisons of survey responses
      according to respondent characteristics will be reported.
