    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information on the safety and the effectiveness of an
      investigational vaccine for the prevention of smallpox disease. Smallpox was one of the major
      causes of death and sickness through the first half of the 20th century, but a global program
      of smallpox eradication resulted in the elimination of the natural disease. The last cases of
      smallpox in the United States occurred in 1949 in Texas. Today, only laboratory workers who
      work with smallpox-related viruses, military personnel, and health care workers are
      vaccinated.

      Historically, individuals in the US were vaccinated with a product such as Dryvax速, which
      contains the virus vaccinia in the same family as smallpox. This virus could promote immunity
      to smallpox, but not produce the disease itself. Although effective, these vaccines are not
      safe to use in people with atopic dermatitis (eczema, allergic immune response to allergens),
      children less than 1 year of age, and people with a compromised immune system, occurring in
      certain diseases (HIV positive individuals and AIDS), and following treatment with certain
      types of drugs. It is important to find a safe vaccine that can be used to protect people who
      cannot receive routine vaccinia-based smallpox vaccine.

      The vaccine in this study is known as Modified Vaccinia Ankara or MVA vaccine. It is the
      objective of this study to find out if MVA vaccine is safe and effective in providing
      immunity to smallpox. The effectiveness of this vaccine will be measured in two ways. The
      first way is to find out if there are specific antibodies in your blood following MVA
      vaccination. Antibodies are chemicals your body produces to fight smallpox virus.

      The second way is to see whether or not there is a typical skin reaction following
      vaccination with a traditional smallpox vaccine, given about three months after vaccination
      with the MVA vaccine. The typical reaction in an unvaccinated person to smallpox vaccine is
      formation of a blister or &quot;pox&quot; which occurs at the site of vaccination. In a person with
      immunity to smallpox the skin reaction is much less, and typically consists of a little
      swelling at the site of vaccination.
