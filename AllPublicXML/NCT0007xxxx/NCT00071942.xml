      Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. This phase I trial
      is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in treating patients with
      metastatic breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the toxicity associated with repeated vaccination with an admixture of
      recombinant vaccinia viruses (rV-MUC-1 and rV-TRICOM).

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of rV-MUC-1 and rV-TRICOM vaccine
      admixture.

      III. To evaluate the toxicity of adding GM-CSF to the admixture of the rV-MUC-1 and
      rV-TRICOM.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess host immune reactivity following rV-MUC-1 and rV-TRICOM with and without GM-CSF
      administration.

      II. To determine whether vaccination with rV-MUC-1 and rV-TRICOM with and without GM-CSF is
      associated with antitumor activity.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive vaccination comprising recombinant vaccinia-MUC-1 and recombinant
      vaccinia-TRICOM vaccine intradermally on days 1 and 29 (for a total of 2 doses) in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of recombinant vaccinia-MUC-1 and
      recombinant vaccinia-TRICOM vaccine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The
      MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional 10 patients (including 5
      HLA-A2-positive patients) receive vaccination as above at the MTD and sargramostim (GM-CSF)
      subcutaneously on days 1-4 and 29-32.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, monthly until disease progression, and then annually for up
      to 15 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 11-22 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24
      months.

             breast; measurable disease is not required; subjects who are NED are eligible;
             subjects must have had at least one prior regimen of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or
             hormonal therapy prior to entering this study; subjects may have received any number
             of prior therapies for metastatic disease

             conditions (e.g., atopic dermatitis, burns, impetigo, varicella zoster, severe acne or
             other open rashes or wounds) until condition resolves; pregnant or nursing women;
             children under 5 years of age; and immunodeficient or immunosuppressed persons (by
             disease or therapy), including HIV infection; close household contacts are those who
             share housing or have close physical contact; determination of the severity of these
             conditions will be made by the investigator or co-investigator

          -  Subjects must not have any other serious medical condition that in the opinion of the
             investigator is incompatible with the protocol; subjects with active infections

             antibiotics have been stopped for at least 3 days

          -  Subjects must have had prior vaccinia (smallpox) exposure, determined by subject
             history, medical documentation, or scar characteristic of vaccinia exposure; there
             must be no history of allergy or untoward reaction to prior vaccinia (smallpox)
             vaccination

          -  Tumor tissue positive for staining with MAbs DF3 and/or DF3-P or elevated serum CA15-3
             (also known as CA27-29); note: this can be done on stored slides, but subject will be

             abstinence prior to study entry and for at least 4 weeks after the last vaccination;
             women who are breast-feeding are not eligible for this study; should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately

          -  Signed informed consent

          -  Participants who have been previously treated with vaccinia vectors or MUC1 such as
             those on protocol T98-0057 (DFPCC # 97-050) are not eligible for this study
