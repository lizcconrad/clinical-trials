      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation
      may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.
      Giving immunotherapy using cyclosporine, interferon gamma, and interleukin-2 after stem cell
      transplantation may help the transplanted cells make an immune response and kill any
      remaining cancer cells. It is not yet known whether high-dose chemotherapy followed by
      autologous stem cell transplantation is more effective with or without immunotherapy.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II/III trial is studying how well high-dose chemotherapy
      followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, cyclosporine, interferon gamma, and
      interleukin-2 works and compares it to high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem
      cell transplantation only in treating patients with refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's
      lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Phase II

             -  Determine the feasibility and toxicity of immunotherapy comprising cyclosporine,
                interferon gamma, and interleukin-2 after high-dose myeloablative chemotherapy with
                autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in patients with refractory or relapsed
                Hodgkin's lymphoma.

                  -  Phase II part of the study was completed and should have proceeded to Phase
                     III; however long delay occurred due to some proposed protocol changes to
                     Phase III , so long that the study got permanently closed ***********

        -  Phase III

             -  Compare the event-free and overall survival of patients treated with vs without
                this immunotherapy regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the event-free and overall survival rates, toxic effects, and response rates
           to reinduction chemotherapy followed by hyperfractionated involved-field radiotherapy,
           high-dose chemotherapy comprising carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan, and
           ASCT in these patients.

        -  Correlate tumor biologic characteristics with response in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Determine the effectiveness of this immunotherapy regimen in producing autologous
           graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) and auto-reactive cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity in these
           patients.

        -  Correlate greater levels of autologous GVHD and in vitro cytolytic activity with
           improved event-free and overall survival in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine whether treatment with immunotherapy can overcome the negative prognostic
           significance of p53 mutation and high serum levels of interleukin-10 and interleukin-2
           receptor in these patients.

        -  Determine the genotoxicity of retrieval therapy and the incidence of hypermutability by
           longitudinal genotoxic biomonitoring in these patients.

        -  Correlate HLA class II invariant peptide (CLIP) expression in tumor cells with improved
           event-free and overall survival in patients treated with immunotherapy regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter phase II study followed by a randomized,
      multicenter phase III study. Patients are stratified according to study phase (II vs III).

      Patients receive 2 courses of salvage induction therapy on COG-AHOD00P1 or equivalent. Within
      2-5 weeks after completion of salvage induction therapy, patients receive protocol therapy.

        -  Phase II: All patients receive the following treatment:

             -  Hyperfractionated involved-field radiotherapy: Patients who have completed prior
                salvage induction therapy and have not received full tissue tolerance from prior
                radiotherapy may receive hyperfractionated involved-field radiotherapy twice daily
                for 7 days.

             -  High-dose preparative regimen: Beginning within 7 days after radiotherapy, patients
                receive carmustine IV over 3 hours on day -6; etoposide IV over 1 hour and
                cytarabine IV over 1 hour on days -5 to -2; and melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day
                -1.

             -  Autologous stem cell transplantation: Patients undergo autologous bone marrow or
                peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients then receive
                filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) or IV beginning on day 1 and continuing
                until blood counts recover.

             -  Immunotherapy: Patients receive cyclosporine IV twice daily beginning on day 0 and
                continuing until the completion of the course of interferon gamma and
                interleukin-2. When sufficiently recovered, patients also receive interferon gamma
                SC every other day for 10 doses. Beginning 2 days after the start of interferon
                gamma, patients also receive interleukin-2 SC once daily for 18 days.

        -  Phase III: Patients who respond to prior salvage induction therapy are randomized to 1
           of 2 treatment arms. Patients who have progressive disease after 2 courses of prior
           salvage induction therapy are assigned to arm I.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive treatment as in phase II.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive treatment as in phase II without immunotherapy. In both
                phases, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
                toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 156 patients (25 for phase II and 131 for phase III) will be
      accrued for this study within 5.4 years.
