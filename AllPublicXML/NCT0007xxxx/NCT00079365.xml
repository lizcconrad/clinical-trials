      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil and gemcitabine, work in
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation
      therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Fluorouracil may make the tumor cells
      more sensitive to radiation therapy. Brachytherapy uses radioactive material, such as
      phosphorus P32, placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Combining
      chemotherapy and external-beam radiation therapy with brachytherapy may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying fluorouracil, gemcitabine, external-beam
      radiation therapy, and brachytherapy using phosphorus P32 to see how well they work compared
      to fluorouracil, gemcitabine, and external-beam radiation therapy in treating patients with
      locally or regionally advanced unresectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (pancreatic
      cancer).

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the survival of patients with locally or regionally advanced unresectable
           adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with fluorouracil, external beam radiotherapy,
           and gemcitabine with vs without brachytherapy with phosphorus P32 suspension.

      Secondary

        -  Compare time to disease progression, tumor response rate, and physical performance in
           patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the safety and tolerability of these regimens in this patient population.

        -  Compare duration of response and time to treatment failure in patients treated with
           these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive phosphorus P32 suspension percutaneously under CT guidance on
           day 0 and at months 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8. Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously on
           days 1-5 of weeks 1-6. Patients concurrently undergo external beam radiotherapy 5 days a
           week on weeks 1-6. At the completion of radiotherapy, patients receive gemcitabine IV
           over 30 minutes once weekly for 7 weeks. After a 1-week rest, patients then receive
           gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once weekly for 3 weeks. Treatment repeats every 28 days.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive fluorouracil and gemcitabine and undergo external beam
           radiotherapy as in arm I.

      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (40 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 24-30 months.
