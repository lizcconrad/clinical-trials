      The purpose of the study is to:

        -  Find out if BAY 43-9006 prevents the growth of tumors

        -  For patients who have stable cancer status after 3 months of treatment if it is safer
           and/or more effective to continue to give BAY 43-9006 or to stop giving BAY 43-9006 at
           that time.

        -  Find out how long the effect of BAY 43-9006 is on tumors. To assess the safety of BAY
           43-9006 (sorafenib) in the treatment of advanced refractory cancers.

        -  Measure the amount of BAY 43-9006 and some of its targets in the blood stream in some
           patients.

             (assessed by the following laboratory requirements):

             anticoagulated with an agent such as coumadin or heparin will be allowed to
             participate provided that no prior evidence of underlying abnormality in these
             parameters exists.
