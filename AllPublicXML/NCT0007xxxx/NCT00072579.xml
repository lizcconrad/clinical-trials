      RATIONALE: Colony-stimulating factors, such as sargramostim, may increase the number of
      immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may bring about complete remission
      in patients who have chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying sargramostim to see how well it works in treating
      patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia that is not in complete cytogenetic
      remission after initial treatment.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy and safety of sargramostim (GM-CSF) by cytogenetic examination of
           the bone marrow in patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia who are not
           in complete cytogenetic remission after initial therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously daily for 3 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving no response
      receive GM-CSF for an additional 3 months. Patients failing to achieve a partial response or
      better after the second course of GM-CSF are removed from the study. Patients achieving a
      partial response after the first or second course of GM-CSF continue to receive GM-CSF for an
      additional 9 months. Patients are then re-evaluated. Patients achieving a complete cytologic
      response at 9 months then receive GM-CSF 3 times weekly in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
