        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Subject is ≥ 20 years of age.

          -  Subject is diagnosed with ESRD, and must be on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) three
             times a week for at least 2 months prior to the Screening Phase and expected to remain
             on HD for the duration of the study.

          -  If female, subject is either not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal
             for at least 1 year or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral
             oophorectomy or hysterectomy), or is of childbearing potential and practicing one of
             the following methods of birth control:

               -  Condoms, sponge, foams, jellies, diaphragm or intrauterine device (IUD)

               -  Contraceptives (oral or parenteral) for three months prior to study drug
                  administration

               -  In a monogamous relationship with a vasectomized partner

          -  If female, subject is not breastfeeding and has a negative serum pregnancy test prior
             to the treatment phase.

          -  Subject had an intact PTH value &gt; 200 pg/mL.

          -  Serum calcium level &lt; 10.2 mg/dL at Screening visit.

          -  Serum phosphorus level &lt; 6.5 mg/dL at Screening visit.

          -  Ca´P product ≤ 65 at Screening visit.

          -  Must voluntarily sign and date an informed consent, approved by an Institutional
             Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), prior to the conduct of any
             study-specific procedure

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Subject has a history of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to vitamin D
             or vitamin D related compounds.

          -  Subject has chronic gastrointestinal disease, which in the Investigator's opinion, may
             result in clinically significant GI malabsorption.

          -  Liver function defects defined as &gt; 2 times the upper limit of normal for liver enzyme
             or &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal coagulation levels.

          -  Subject is taking maintenance calcitonin, glucocorticoids in an equivalent dose &gt; 5 mg
             prednisone, or other drugs that may affect calcium or bone metabolism, other than
             females on stable (same dose and product for 3 months) estrogen and/or progestin
             therapy.

          -  For any reason, subject is considered by the Investigator to be an unsuitable
             candidate to receive pharmacological doses of vitamin D.

          -  Subject has received any investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to the Treatment
             Phase.
