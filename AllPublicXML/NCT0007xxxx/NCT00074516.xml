      This study will test the effectiveness of a combination of anti-rejection medicines in
      preventing complications typically seen in cystinosis patients undergoing kidney transplants.
      Cystinosis is a rare disease affecting children that causes growth retardation and kidney
      failure. Kidney transplant is the standard treatment for kidney failure in these patients,
      followed by immunosuppression to prevent organ rejection. The standard drug regimen for
      immunosuppression includes steroids, which can lead to other serious complications. This
      study will look at combination therapy that does not include steroids.

      Patients 7 years of age and older with cystinosis who are candidates for a kidney transplant
      at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center may be eligible for this 5-year study.
      Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood tests.

      Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:

        1. Kidney transplant: Patients undergo kidney transplant surgery under general anesthesia.

        2. Central line placement: A large intravenous catheter (plastic tube, or IV line) is
           placed in a vein in the chest or neck under local anesthesia before the transplant
           surgery. The line remains in place for some time during the hospitalization to
           administer immunosuppressive medications, antibiotics, and blood, if needed. The line is
           also used to collect blood samples.

        3. Leukapheresis: This procedure for collecting white blood cells is done before the
           transplant. The cells are studied to evaluate the patient's immune system. Whole blood
           is withdrawn through a catheter in an arm vein or through the central line and directed
           into a machine that separates the blood components by spinning. The white cells are
           removed and the red cells and plasma are returned to the body.

        4. Immunosuppressive medication following transplantation

             -  Adults receive thymoglobulin at the time of the transplant and for 3 days after
                surgery; mycophenolate mofetil daily after the transplant; tacrolimus twice a day
                once the kidney is working well; and sirolimus daily.

             -  Children receive daclizumab the day of the transplant, day 4 after surgery, and at
                weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 15, 19, and 23, and mycophenolate mofetil daily after the
                transplant.

        5. Follow-up visits: After discharge from the hospital, patients return to the Clinical
           Center for follow-up at 6 months, at 1 year, and then yearly for 5 years. A physical
           examination is done the first four visits, and blood and urine samples are collected at
           every visit. Kidney biopsies (removal of a small amount of kidney tissue through a thin
           needle) are done at 6 months, 1, 3, and 5 years after the transplant. The biopsied
           tissue is examined to evaluate how well the kidney is responding to the
           immunosuppression medicines, to determine whether more or less medication is needed, and
           to evaluate how the patient is responding to the donor kidney.

        6. Routine laboratory tests, coordinated by the patient's local physician, are done 2 to 3
           times a week for the first 2 to 3 months after transplantation, then weekly for several
           more months, and at least monthly for life.

      Cystinosis is an autosomal recessive disorder due to impaired cystine transport across the
      lysosomal membrane, resulting in abnormal cystine accumulation throughout the body. Fanconi
      syndrome manifests in the first year of life, and end-stage renal failure occurs at ~10 years
      of age, requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation. Oral cysteamine therapy delays but does
      not always prevent the need for a renal allograft in cystinosis, which accounts for ~3% of
      all pediatric transplants in the United States. With improvements in immunosuppression,
      short-term graft and patient survival is quite good for cystinosis patients, although not as
      good as for patients with ESRD due to structural defects. Long-term graft survival can be
      affected by the non-renal complications of cystinosis, which persist after renal
      transplantation.

      The aim of this study is to establish standards for the transplantation of kidneys into
      patients with nephropathic cystinosis using steroid-sparing immunosuppression. Our goals are
      to:

        1. Analyze the long and short term outcome of cystinosis patients following living and
           cadaveric kidney transplantation using steroid-free immunosuppression;

        2. Determine a consistent clinical approach to recipients with cystinosis in the immediate
           post-operative period, specifically regarding fluid and electrolyte management,
           retention of native kidneys, and timing of the re-initiation of cystinosis therapy after
           transplantation;

        3. Assess the immunologic impact of cystinosis by monitoring immune responses using a
           number of in vitro assays.

      In this study, patients will receive a living donor or cadaveric kidney transplant with
      steroid free immunosuppression. Graft function, histology and graft and patient survival will
      be measured. Progression of cystinosis in other organ systems will be monitored. Additional
      studies on the graft will include transcriptional analysis of inflammatory and immunologic
      mediators. Serum will be assayed for inflammatory mediators and peripheral white blood cells
      assayed for immune function. This study will represent the first comprehensive, prospective
      analysis of kidney transplantation in patients with cystinosis.
