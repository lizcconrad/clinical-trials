      Studies have shown that Montessori-based activities, which focus on developing an
      individual's unique abilities, are effective in increasing engagement between nursing home
      residents with dementia and their caregivers. This study will determine whether the positive
      effects of Montessori-based programming can be replicated in adult day care, assisted living,
      and nursing homes. Results from this study will be used to create training materials to help
      staff in different settings implement the intervention within existing schedules, staffing,
      and programming routines.

      This study will be conducted in two phases. During Phase I, participants with mild dementia
      will be trained to become small group leaders for Montessori-based activities. In Phase II,
      newly-trained participants will use their skills to assist others. Assessments will be made
      throughout the study. Participants' engagement with the environment and caregiver burden and
      satisfaction will be assessed.
