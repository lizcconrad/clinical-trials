      This study will evaluate the ability of people of different ethnic backgrounds to develop
      immune responses against the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). A common virus, EBV is present in 90
      percent of healthy people and usually does not cause problems. Most people are infected in
      childhood, have no symptoms, and are unaware of their infection. People infected as
      adolescents or adults may develop infectious mononucleosis, which usually resolves
      completely. However, in immune suppressed people, like those who have had a transplant, EBV
      can cause fatal cancers. It can also cause certain cancers such as Burkitt's lymphoma,
      Hodgkin's lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma in people who are not immune suppressed.
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is 100 times more common in people of Asian origin (particularly
      southern Chinese) compared with Caucasians. This difference may be the result of genetic,
      rather than environmental, factors. This study will examine whether the same proteins
      produced by EBV in the cancer cells react differently in people of different ethnic
      background in a way that could explain the differences in predisposition for this disease.

      Healthy normal volunteers 18 years of age and older of Caucasian or Chinese ancestry may be
      eligible for this study. Candidates of Chinese ancestry must be born in China (including
      Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, or be first generation offspring of parents born in these
      places).

      Participants will have a blood sample drawn and will undergo lymphapheresis - a procedure for
      collecting large numbers of white blood cells called lymphocytes. The blood sample is tested
      for blood counts and HLA type, a genetic marker of the immune system. HLA molecules help
      determine the way the body's immune cells respond to virus. HLA typing is similar to blood
      typing. Usually done to match stem cell or organ transplants, HLA testing may also be used to
      try to identify factors associated with an increased risk of certain diseases or conditions.
      HLA type is strongly associated with ethnic background.

      For lymphapheresis, blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein, similar to donating
      blood. The blood flows from the vein through a catheter (plastic tube) into a machine that
      separates it into its components by centrifugation (spinning). The white cells are removed
      and the rest of the blood (red cells, plasma and platelets) is returned to the body through a
      needle in the other arm. The procedure takes 2 to 3 hours. The collected white cells are used
      for research for this study, including the ability to react to EBV proteins, and are then
      destroyed.

    <textblock>
      Epstein Barr virus (EBV) can induce in immune compromised patients fatal lymphoproliferative
      lesions that regress upon reversion of immune suppression or adoptive transfer of
      EBV-specific CD8+ T cells. EBV can also induce neoplastic lesions in immune competent hosts
      including Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). EBV-specific
      CD8+ T cell responses can occur in patients with these cancers that are qualitatively similar
      but quantitatively diminished compared to EBV-primed normal individuals. Although these
      cancers share several features, they are characterized by divergent patterns of expression of
      EBV proteins. In particular, NPC expresses preferentially the latent membrane protein (LMP) 2
      with or without expression of LMP 1 and intermediate expression of the Epstein-Barr nuclear
      antigen. Thus, there is interest to develop LMP 2-directed immunizations for patients with
      NPC with the hope that enhancement of the insufficient natural immunity may lead to tumor
      regression. Since, the incidence of NPC is tightly associated with ethnic background
      (principally Southern Chinese) and Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) phenotype, diverse
      populations may display distinct reactivity patterns toward EBV epitopes that may in turn be
      responsible for their respective predisposition to acquire NPC. Although, several LMP 2
      epitopes have been described, to our knowledge, no systematic mapping across diverse
      ethnicity complemented with high-resolution HLA typing has ever been done. We, therefore,
      propose to map immune dominant epitopes of LMP 2 in EBV primed normal individuals of
      Caucasian or Asian (Chinese) ethnicity by measuring interferon (IFN)-gamma transcript levels
      in circulating lymphocytes exposed to a library of overlapping nonamer peptides encompassing
      the full sequence of LMP 2. High resolution, sequence-based HLA typing will complement the
      study.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Normal volunteers, age greater than or equal to 18 years of Caucasian or Chinese ancestry
        will be eligible for the study. Chinese ancestry will be defined as being born in China
        (including Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore) or being first generation offspring of parents
        born in China (including Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore).

        ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

        Individuals must weigh at least 110 pounds.

        Potential participants must pass the criteria for blood donors established by the American
        Association of Blood Banks according to the routine screening performed within the
        Department of Transfusion Medicine.

        Potential participants should pass a brief physical exam to exclude potential cardiac
        problems.

        WBC 3000/mm(3) or greater.

        Platelet count 90,000 mm(3) or greater.

        Negative pregnancy test

        Ante-cubital veins compatible with the apheresis process. Apheresis center nurses will
        assess the ante-cubital veins of all subjects prior to enrollment. If their veins are
        judged to be too small to support the intravenous catheter required for the procedure, they
        will be excluded. If at the time of each apheresis procedure the nurses are unable to
        obtain adequate ante-cubital vein access, the subject will be excluded.

        Evidence of previous exposure to EBV infection will not represent inclusion criteria.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Potential participants will be excluded:

        Who are undergoing or have undergone in the past 3 weeks any form of systemic therapy that
        may affect immune function.

        Who have active systemic infections, autoimmune disease or any known immunodeficiency
        disease.

        Who require systemic steroid therapy.

        Who are pregnant.

        Who are positive for hepatitis B (s)AG or HIV antibody (because of possible immune effects
        of these conditions). HIV testing will be performed prior to enrollment.

        Who have any form of active primary or secondary immune deficiency.
