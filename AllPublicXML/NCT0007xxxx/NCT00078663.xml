  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether a program of systematic oral care can help prevent
      hospital-acquired respiratory infections in patients in intensive care units. Such infections
      occur five times more often in critically ill patients compared with patients in general
      hospital wards and result in longer hospital stays and an increased risk of death. The rate
      of respiratory infection among critically ill patients correlates strongly with the presence
      of disease-causing bacteria in the mucosal areas of the mouth, gums, and teeth, indicating
      that assiduous oral care is especially important in this patient population. This study will
      compare a program of meticulous oral care using oral assessments taught by a dentist and
      dental hygienist with the standard care typically given in intensive care units.

      Critically ill patients 18 years of age and older who are hospitalized in an intensive care
      unit for 3 or more days and whose oral hygiene is dependent on hospital care providers may be
      eligible for this study. Patients will be recruited from intensive care units at four
      Washington, D.C., area hospitals - Suburban Hospital, Washington Hospital Center, Inova
      Fairfax Hospital, and Winchester Medical Center.

      Participants will have their lips, mouth, gums, teeth, and saliva examined several times a
      day to determine their optimum oral care. They will receive standard care, such as flossing,
      brushing, rinsing with a mouthwash, and possibly use of an antiseptic spray that prevents
      bacteria from clinging to the teeth. Small samples of saliva (less than one-fourth of a
      teaspoon) and dental plaque will be collected the day the patient is admitted to the
      intensive care unit and again on days 3 and 5 of their stay in the unit. The saliva sample is
      collected with a small suction tube placed in the corner of the mouth; the plaque specimen is
      collected by gliding a tiny piece of paper over the surface of a front tooth. The samples
      will be examined for any bacteria not normally found in saliva.

      Critically ill patients, especially those that require endotracheal intubation, have the
      greatest risk of any hospitalized patient for acquiring nosocomial pneumonia. Nosocomial
      pneumonia, in this population, produces a substantial increase of mortality and morbidity.
      The literature suggests the causative pathway is aspiration of oropharyngeal pathogens found
      in dental plaque. The build-up of dental plaque has been significantly associated with
      subsequent nosocomial respiratory infections. Thus, prevention of pathogens colonization in
      the oropharyngeal cavity could be an effective infection control measure.

      Dental plaque once it reaches a critical thickness, acts as a reservoir for both aerobic and
      anaerobic pathogens. Failure to remove plaque begins a complex cascade of biological activity
      by which pathogens adhere to mucosal and tooth surfaces and pathogen overgrowth ensues.
      Additionally, neglected or insufficient mouth care is the foremost predisposing factor to
      oral conditions such as gingivitis, mucositis, and stomatitis which supply additional ports
      of entry for pathogens.

      There are only a handful of studies that compare the frequency and type of oral hygiene
      required to prevent or decrease oropharyngeal colonization. A recent pilot study, 01-CC-0207,
      compared oral care provision in two intensive care units (ICU) in the Clinical Center. The
      test ICU offered meticulous oral hygiene through a system of regular oral assessments taught
      by a dentist and dental hygienist. The score from the assessment determined the type and
      frequency of oral care. The control ICU gave standard care typical of the ICU community.
      Plaque and saliva assays were collected from the enrolled patients. Significantly lower Beck
      scores and lower colony forming organisms in the specimens was achieved in the test ICU on
      day 3, p less than 0.03 and p less than 0.001 respectively.

      This protocol will expand the pilot into a prospective randomized assigned trial conducted at
      four hospitals in the Washington D.C. area. These hospitals have ICUs more representative of
      ICU's nation-wide. This study will test the effectiveness of a comprehensive and systematic
      oral care program to reduce the oral assessment scores, mucosal plaque scores, and the amount
      of pathogen inoculum present in the saliva and plaque. Intubated and non-intubated patients
      will be compared as well as meticulous care with or without the addition of the oral
      antiseptic, chlorhexidine. Consistency of practice performance will also be evaluated when
      nursing staff has dentist/hygienist instruction and monitoring versus the traditional nurse
      instruction.
