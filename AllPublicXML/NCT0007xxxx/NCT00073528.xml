             randomized therapy;

          -  Radiotherapy prior to initiation of randomized therapy is allowed to a limited area
             (e.g., palliative treatment for painful bone metastases), if it is not the sole site
             of disease. Subject must have completed treatment and recovered from all treatment
             related toxicities, in particular bone marrow suppression;

          -  Able to swallow and retain oral medication;

          -  Cardiac ejection fraction within the institutional range of normal as measured by
             echocardiogram (or MUGA scan if an echocardiogram cannot be performed or is
             inconclusive);

          -  Subjects must complete all screening assessments as outlined in the protocol;

          -  Adequate organ function

        Exclusion Criteria:

             anti-ErbB1/ErbB2 therapy for advanced or metastatic disease;

          -  Bisphosphonate therapy for bone metastases is allowed; however, treatment must be
             initiated prior to the first dose of randomized therapy. Prophylactic use of
             bisphosphonates in subjects without bone disease, except for the treatment of
             osteoporosis, is not permitted;

          -  Malabsorption Syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, or
             resection of the stomach or small bowel. Subjects with ulcerative colitis are also
             excluded;

          -  History of other malignancy. Subjects who have been disease-free for 5 years, or
             subjects with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer or
             successfully treated in situ carcinoma are eligible;

          -  Concurrent disease or condition that would make the subject inappropriate for study
             participation, or any serious medical disorder that would interfere with the subject's
             safety;

          -  Subjects who have not recovered from toxicities related to prior adjuvant therapy
             (e.g., surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, biologic
             therapy, and investigational agents);

          -  Subjects who have received anthracyclines in the neo-adjuvant and/or adjuvant setting,
             which exceeded the following doses: 360 mg/m2 of Doxorubicin, 720 mg/m2 of Epirubicin,
             and 72 mg/m2 of Mitoxantrone;

          -  Subjects with extensive symptomatic visceral disease including hepatic involvement and
             pulmonary lymphangitic spread of tumor, or the disease is considered by the
             investigator to be rapidly progressing or life threatening;

          -  Active or uncontrolled infection;

          -  Dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would prohibit the
             understanding or rendering of informed consent;

          -  Known history of uncontrolled or symptomatic angina, arrhythmias, or congestive heart
             failure;

          -  Known history of, or clinical evidence of, central nervous system (CNS) metastases or
             leptomeningeal carcinomatosis;

          -  Concurrent anti-cancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery,
             immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, biologic therapy, or tumor
             embolization) other than letrozole;

          -  Concurrent treatment with an investigational agent or participation in another
             clinical trial;

          -  Used an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer,
             preceding the first dose of randomized therapy (GW572016 or placebo);

          -  The subject has a known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy
             to drugs chemically related to randomized therapy (GW572016 or placebo) or to
             excipients of randomized therapy (GW572016 or placebo); 18. Subject has known
             hypersensitivity to Femara or excipients of Femara

        <title>Number of Participants With Progression Free Survival (PFS) in the Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-Positive Her3 as Assessed by the Investigator</title>
        <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization until the earliest date of disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause, if sooner. The date of documented PD is defined as the date of radiological PD as assessed by the investigator based on imaging data and also by the clinical assessment of symptomatic progression. Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.0), PD is defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>

        <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization until the earliest date of disease progression or death due to any cause, if sooner. The date of documented disease progression is defined as the date of radiological disease progression as assessed by the investigator based on imaging data and also by the clinical assessment of symptomatic progression. Per RECIST 1.0, disease progression is defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>

        <title>Clinical Benefit (CB) in the HER2-Positive Population as Assessed by the Investigator</title>
        <description>CB is defined as the percentage of participants with evidence of confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) for at least 6 months. CR: disappearance of all target lesions. PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as a reference the baseline sum LD. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the baseline measurement.</description>

          <description>Participants were stratified based on site of disease at screening (SDS) (soft tissue or visceral or bone-only disease) and prior adjuvant endocrine therapy (PAET) (discontinuation interval [DI] =&gt;6 months or DI &lt;6 months). OR is defined as the number of participants achieving either a confirmed CR or PR. Response was assessed via RECIST. CR: disappearance of all target lesions. PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as a reference the baseline sum LD. DI is defined as the time period from stopping the PEAT and the randomization date.</description>
          <population>ITT Population. Only those participants with some measurable disease were assessed. Response with bone scan confirmation was required. Participants with bone-only disease were excluded from the analysis because bone-only disease is non-measurable only per RECIST 1.0.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants Completing the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-breast (FACT-B) Questionnaire at the Scheduled Visits</title>
        <description>Quality of Life (QOL) was assessed using the FACT-B questionnaire, which was a 37-item (27 general and 10 breast cancer-specific questions) self-reporting instrument consisting of 5 dimensions: physical-, social/family-, emotional-, functional-well being, and a breast cancer subscale. Higher scores on the FACT-B scales (each ranging from 0 [not at all] to 4 [very much]) indicate a higher QOL. The score is transformed for FACT-B and results in a total score ranging from 0 to 144. Complete: completing at least 1 question from FACT-B.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline for the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) Score Using Observed Data</title>
        <description>FACT-G is a subscale of the FACT-B QOL questionnaire and consists of 27 questions grouped into 4 domains that measure a participant's physical, functional, social and family, and emotional well-being. FACT-G is assessed on a five-point Likert-type scale, with scores ranging from 0 to 4 (0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). The total score is calculated as the sum of the item scores on the subscale; the total ranges from 0 to 108, with higher score indicating a better quality of life.</description>

        <description>IHC is a commonly used test to assess the amount of the HER2 receptor protein on the surface of the cancer cells. The IHC test results in a score of 0 to 3+, which indicates the amount of HER2 receptor protein on the cells in a sample of breast cancer tissue. Tissue scores of 0 to 1+ indicate HER2 negativity; scores of 2+ and 3+ indicate HER2 positivity. Clinical benefit is defined as participants with CR, PR, or SD for =&gt;6-month period.</description>
