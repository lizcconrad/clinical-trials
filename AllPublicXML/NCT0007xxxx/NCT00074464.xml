      To investigate the predictive value of using measures of cholesterol homeostasis to identify
      individuals at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease relative to established risk

      BACKGROUND:

      Cholesterol is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease. The current approach to
      assessing this risk factor is to measure levels in the blood as if blood levels were a static
      and fixed phenomenon. Cholesterol levels in the blood are in fact a complex product of
      transport of cholesterol and lipids into and out of various compartments: (1) from the gut,
      liver or periphery into the blood; (2) from the blood into the periphery and the liver; (3)
      de novo synthesis of cholesterol in the liver; and (4) excretion from the liver as bile
      acids. It is possible that one or more of these processes may serve as better risk factors
      for atherosclerosis or coronary events than simple measures of cholesterol. This study
      addresses a new and potentially important question.

      The study will utilize plasma samples from subjects participating in Cycle 6 of the
      Framingham Offspring Study. The Framingham Offspring Study is a longitudinal community based
      study initiated in 1971. A sample of 5,135 men and women, consisting of the offspring of the
      original Framingham Heart Study and their spouses were enrolled for the study, the objective
      of which was to identify common factors or characteristics that contribute to cardiovascular
      disease (CVD) by following its incidence over a long period of time in a large group of
      participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or
      stroke.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The project includes a case-control study relating the new lipid findings to cardiovascular
      disease (CVD), a cross-sectional study to establish normal values and associations with diet
      and genotypes, and a prospective study of cardiovascular events during a 10-year follow-up
      period. The specific aims are to 1) quantify circulating indicators of cholesterol
      homeostasis [levels of phytosterols and cholestanol (surrogate measures of cholesterol
      absorption) and cholesterol precursors (surrogate measures of cholesterol synthetic rates)]
      in plasma samples from Framingham Offspring Study participants diagnosed with established CVD
      and/or &gt;50% carotid stenosis (N=165) not taking lipid-lowering medication and control
      subjects matched for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension and smoking status (n=330); 2)
      evaluate the validity of using indicators of cholesterol homeostasis to predict CVD risk in
      the Framingham Offspring Study-Cycle 6 participants by a) establishing adult normal ranges
      for circulating levels of phytosterol, cholestanol and cholesterol precursor (N=3378), b)
      defining the relationship between phytosterol, cholestanol and cholesterol precursor levels,
      and lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein levels in plasma, c) defining the relationship
      between phytosterol, cholestanol and cholesterol precursor levels and selected dietary intake
      data (energy, protein, fat, saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and trans fatty
      acids, cholesterol, fiber and antioxidant supplements) and d) determining the relationship
      between phytosterol, cholestanol and cholesterol precursor levels and selected genotype data
      related to CVD risk (gene loci of apo E, apo A-IV, scavenger receptor class B type 1 [SRB1],
      and ATP-binding cassette [ABC] G5 and ABCG8 transporters); and 3) monitor clinical events in
      the Framingham Offspring Study cohort throughout a 10-year period (1995-2005) and relate
      these data to the phytosterol, cholestanol and cholesterol precursor levels. Measures of
      cholesterol homeostasis will be quantified first in subjects identified in specific aim #1
      and then the balance of subjects identified in specific aim #2, achievable now due to the
      development of a gas chromatographic method using a single plasma sample. These data will be
      assessed relative to dietary, biochemical and genotype data currently available for the
      cohort. The results of the study will define the relationship between markers of cholesterol
      absorption and synthesis, and CVD outcomes; establish reference values for measures of
      cholesterol absorption and synthesis; and assess the predictive value of these measures to
      identify high risk individuals relative to established risk factors.
