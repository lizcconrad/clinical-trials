  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EAA-090 is being developed for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic
      neuropathy. It is a selective antagonist that binds competitively to the glutamate site of
      the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor.

      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of 3 fixed oral doses of EAA-090 compared with
      placebo in subjects with neuropathic pain associated with diabetic neuropathy.
