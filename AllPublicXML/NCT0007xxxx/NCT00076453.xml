    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease and is the most common form of arthritis. This
      study will evaluate the effectiveness of customized shoe inserts in controlling and relieving
      the pain of knee osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disease causing deterioration of the joint cartilage and the
      formation of bone spurs at the margins of the joints. Knee OA causes substantial pain,
      suffering, and disability, as well as enormous economic burden on the patient; unfortunately,
      treatment provides relief but not a cure. The majority of patients with symptomatic knee OA
      do not attain satisfactory long-term relief, even with recent advances in pain relievers.
      Analgesic treatment may relieve the pain but does not improve biomechanics and may even
      aggravate OA.

      Although OA is complex and not completely understood, disease onset and progression are at
      least partly related to responses by bone and cartilage to biomechanical loading. Devices
      that promote pressure reduction from the medial knee may provide pain relief while
      simultaneously protecting the joint from further degeneration; one such device is a lateral
      wedge orthotic shoe insert. When worn during weight-bearing activity, these inserts have been
      shown to reduce loading of the medial compartment and may provide pain relief. This study
      will evaluate the effectiveness of orthotic shoe inserts in controlling and relieving knee
      OA. The study will also assess improvements in loading biomechanics of the knee.

      This is a 3-year study. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups; the first
      group will receive lateral wedge orthotic inserts and the second group will receive standard
      orthotic inserts. There will be 10 study visits during the course of the study. Patients will
      undergo X-rays and bone mineral density testing (DEXA) and 3 blood collections during the
      course of the study.
