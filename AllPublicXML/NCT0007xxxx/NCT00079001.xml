      RATIONALE: Zoledronate may prevent or decrease skeletal (bone)-related events (such as pain
      or fractures) caused by bone metastases and androgen deprivation therapy. It is not yet known
      whether treatment with zoledronate is effective in preventing bone-related events in patients
      who have prostate cancer and bone metastases.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well zoledronate works in preventing
      bone-related events in patients who are receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate
      cancer and bone metastases.

      Zoledronic acid decreases the risk of skeletal related events in men with prostate cancer
      metastatic to bone and disease progression after primary hormonal therapy.

      This study is designed to evaluate whether earlier treatment with zoledronic acid will
      further decrease the risk of skeletal related events. This is a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, multicenter study followed by an open-label study. Patients are
      stratified according to ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2), prior skeletal-related event (no
      vs yes), and serum alkaline phosphatase (&lt; upper limit of normal [ULN] vs ≥ ULN).

      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether treatment with zoledronic acid at
      the time of initiation of androgen deprivation therapy for metastatic prostate cancer will
      delay the time to first skeletal related event. The secondary objective of the study is to
      compare the effect of treatment with zoledronic acid to placebo on overall survival (OS),
      progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicity in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy
      for metastatic prostate cancer.

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or a skeletal-related event. All patients receive concurrent androgen
      deprivation therapy with a GnRH agonist. Patients also receive oral calcium and (vitamin D)
      supplements daily. Patients progressing to androgen-independent prostate cancer proceed to
      the open-label therapy with zoledronic acid IV. Treatment continues for 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or the first skeletal-related event.

      Patients are followed periodically for approximately 10 years after entry on the study.

               -  Patients treated with intermittent androgen deprivation therapy are not eligible
                  except for patients concurrently enrolled in SWOG-9346/INT-0162/CALGB 9594, Phase
                  III Study of Intermittent Androgen Deprivation in Patients with Stage D2 Prostate
                  Cancer.

          4. Prior Treatment:

                    -  orchiectomy,

                    -  GnRH agonist (e. g., leuprolide, goserelin, triptorelin),

                    -  estrogen therapy,

                    -  antiandrogen (e. g., bicalutamide, flutamide, nilutamide), or

                    -  any other therapy known to lower testosterone level or inhibit testosterone
                       effect.

               -  Prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant hormone therapy is allowed provided that the
                  duration of hormone therapy was six months or less and the hormone therapy was
                  discontinued more than 6 months prior to study entry.

               -  No prior treatment with a bisphosphonate

               -  No prior treatment with denosumab

               -  No prior treatment with radiopharmaceuticals

               -  ≥ 4 weeks since completion of prior radiation therapy with at least one bone
                  metastasis present that has NOT been radiated.

          5. ECOG (CTC) performance status 0-2
