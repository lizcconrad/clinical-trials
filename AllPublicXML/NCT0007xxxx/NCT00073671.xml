      This study examines the impact of a group cognitive behavioral program aimed at preventing
      depressive disorders and symptoms in adolescents at risk for developing depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a prevalent, chronic, and impairing condition that is often undetected and
      becomes more difficult to treat as chronicity increases. There is an increasing need to
      conduct large-scale depression prevention studies in adolescents. This study evaluates a
      cognitive-behavioral prevention (CBP) program to determine its effectiveness in preventing
      depressive disorders in at-risk adolescents. The study also will ascertain the costs this
      intervention to inform attempts at future dissemination of the program in &quot;real world&quot;
      settings.

      Participants in this study are randomly assigned to receive either CBP for eight weekly and 6
      monthly continuation sessions or usual care. Depressive symptoms and disorders, levels of
      functioning, and medical and mental health care utilization are assessed at baseline and
      again at 2, 8, 20, and 32 months after intake.
