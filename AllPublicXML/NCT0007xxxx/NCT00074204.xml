      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, carboplatin, and docetaxel, use
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more
      than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which treatment regimen is more
      effective for stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of gemcitabine and
      carboplatin followed immediately by docetaxel with that of giving delayed docetaxel in
      treating patients who have stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung
           cancer treated with gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by immediate vs delayed
           docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the response rate and time to progression in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to ECOG performance
      status (0 or 1 vs 2).

      All patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 8 and carboplatin IV
      over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with stable or responding disease proceed to docetaxel therapy. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (immediate docetaxel): Patients receive immediate docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day
           1.

        -  Arm II (delayed docetaxel): Patients are observed until first evidence of disease
           progression and then receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life (QOL) is assessed at baseline, at restaging (after completion of gemcitabine
      and carboplatin), before courses 2-6 of docetaxel*, and then at 1 and 3 months after study
      treatment.

      NOTE: *For patients randomized to delayed docetaxel, QOL is assessed every 3 weeks until
      first disease progression and then before courses 2-6 of docetaxel

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 2 months for 6 months, and then every 3
      months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 550 patients (275 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
