  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Fibromyalgia Family Study identifies and collects blood samples from families with two or
      more members affected with Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS). The primary goal of the study is to
      identify genes that predispose people to FMS and/or symptoms related to FMS; identifying
      these genes may lead to a better understanding of the disease and more effective treatments.

    <textblock>
      FMS predominantly affects women and is characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal
      pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and multiple tender points on physical examination. The
      pathophysiological mechanisms underlying FMS are not clearly understood, but neuroendocrine
      factors seem to be of major importance. Studies of familial association suggest that genetic
      factors play a role in FMS. This study will establish patterns of genetic linkage in families
      with FMS.

      Participating family members will undergo a brief physical exam (including tender point
      exam), donate a blood sample, and complete a detailed questionnaire that includes experience
      with pain, fatigue, depression, bowel symptoms, headache, anxiety, and physical limitations.
      Measurements of serum serotonin and related compounds will also be obtained. To detect
      genetic factors, a genome-wide linkage scan using 405 microsatellite markers will be
      performed.

        The population of this study is family based and aimed to recruit 160 multic-case FMS
        families. We plan to perform a genome scan and evaluate 200-300 linkage markers to FMS and
        FMS-related traits. Future plans include establishing a DNA and data repository for
        distribution for future studies.
