      RATIONALE: Celecoxib may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor.
      Erlotinib and celecoxib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary
      for their growth. Combining celecoxib with erlotinib may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of celecoxib when
      given together with erlotinib in treating patients with stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell
      lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the biologically active dose of celecoxib administered with erlotinib in
           patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the clinical activity of this regimen, in terms of reduction in tumor burden,
           in these patients.

        -  Correlate biological endpoints with cyclooxygenase-2 and epidermal growth factor
           receptor inhibition in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, dose-escalation study of celecoxib.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily and oral celecoxib twice daily on days 1-28.
      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease may continue treatment
      beyond 2 courses at the investigator's discretion.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of celecoxib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) and biologically active dose (BAD) are determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).
      The BAD is defined as the maximum decrease in the level of PGE_2 where no DLT occurs.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-27 patients will be accrued for this study.
