      RATIONALE: Screening tests such as ultrasound and mammography may help doctors detect cancer
      cells early and plan more effective treatment for breast cancer. It is not yet known whether
      ultrasound is more effective than mammography in detecting breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying breast ultrasound to see how well it works compared
      to mammography in detecting cancer in women who are at high risk for breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the diagnostic yield of whole breast bilateral screening ultrasound and
           mammography for the detection of breast cancer in women at high risk for breast cancer.

        -  Determine the cancer detection yield of a single contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
           imaging (MRI) examination after 3 rounds of annual screening with ultrasound and
           mammography in these participants. (MRI component of the study)

      Secondary

        -  Determine the independent sensitivity and specificity of these screening methods in
           these participants.

        -  Correlate performance of these screening methods with selected participant
           characteristics (e.g., breast density and heterogeneity of the parenchyma).

        -  Validate the sonographic classification of lesions as &quot;probably benign&quot; and estimate the
           rate of malignancy in participants screened with these methods.

        -  Determine the cost effectiveness associated with screening breast ultrasound, in terms
           of radiologist and resource time performing the exam and the induced cost of screening
           ultrasound (e.g., follow-up and biopsy).

        -  Determine the reproducibility of lesion identification, measurement of lesion diameters,
           and volume and recording of lesion location on ultrasound in these participants.

        -  Determine the size, type, grade, and nodal status of cancers seen only on MRI in these
           participants. (MRI component of the study)

        -  Estimate the rate of benign biopsies and short interval follow-up induced only by MRI in
           these participants. (MRI component of the study)

        -  Determine the cost effectiveness of MRI, including induced costs of unnecessary biopsies
           and follow-up. (MRI component of the study)

        -  Compare the agreement among multiple examiners in sonographic, mammographic, and MRI
           feature analysis (using terms from the BI-RADS® lexicon) and final assessment (e.g.,
           estimated probability of malignancy and/or recommendation for biopsy) in the enriched
           set of diagnostic training cases with consensus and histopathologic reference standards.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2
      screening arms.

        -  Arm I: Participants undergo physician-performed bilateral whole breast ultrasound (US)
           followed by mammogram within 2 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Participants undergo mammogram followed by physician-performed bilateral whole
           breast US within 2 weeks.

      In both arms, participants with negative or benign findings are rescreened according to their
      screening arm at 1 and 2 years. Participants with &quot;probably benign&quot; findings are rescreened
      at the 6-month follow-up visit. Participants with findings that are suspicious or highly
      suggestive of malignancy are recommended for biopsy.

      A subset of participants* in both arms undergo contrast-enhanced breast MRI within 4 weeks
      after completion of the 2-year screening US and mammogram. Participants with &quot;probably
      benign&quot; findings seen only on MRI may undergo an additional breast MRI at the 6-month
      follow-up visit. Participants with additional suspicious lesions seen only on MRI undergo
      second-look targeted US for biopsy guidance or MRI-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy after
      completion of any biopsies or additional views prompted by the 2-year screening US and
      mammogram visit.

      NOTE: *No diagnosis of metastatic cancer of any type since entering this clinical trial.

      Participants are followed annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,808 participants will be accrued for this study within 2
      years.
