  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal cohort study of how the responses to a 3 day period of controlled
      overfeeding relate to subsequent weight gain. We hypothesize that thin individuals are
      resistant to weight gain because they respond to periods of overfeeding by increasing fat
      oxidation, reducing food intake, and increasing physical activity relative to those who gain
      weight over time.
