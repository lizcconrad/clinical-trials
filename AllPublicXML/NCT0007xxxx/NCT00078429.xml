      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study represents a collaborative effort among investigators of the Cardiovascular Health
      Research Unit, Department of Genome Sciences at the University of Washington (UW), and the
      multi-center Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), including the CHS Blood Laboratory at the
      University of Vermont. The study links advances in thrombosis and inflammation biology,
      large-scale human genomics, and population and statistical genetics, with the unique
      resources of CHS, a large, bi-racial cohort of older adults. In older men and women without
      clinically apparent vascular disease, carotid intimal-medial thickness or IMT (a measure of
      subclinical atherosclerosis), C-reactive protein (a sensitive marker of inflammation), and
      D-dimer (a global marker of activation of the hemostatic system) predict subsequent clinical
      events such as myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. While the therapeutic benefits of
      thrombolytic therapy and aspirin suggest a major role for clotting and inflammation in the
      etiology of coronary disease and stroke, the genetic determinants of these risk factors,
      which are also influenced by traditional lifestyle risk factors such as smoking and obesity,
      remain largely unexplored in older adults. The setting for this study is the Cardiovascular
      Health Study, a cohort study of 5888 older adults designed to assess risk factors for stroke
      and coronary disease. Data on traditional risk factors, on measures of subclinical disease,
      and cardiovascular events are available to the ancillary study. By integrating recent
      clinical and experimental data on age-related and vascular bed-specific regulation of blood
      coagulation, and incorporating complete human genomic DNA sequence variation data from the
      NHLBI-funded UW Program for Genomic Applications, the investigators will evaluate thoroughly
      the association of thrombosis and inflammation genes with (1) carotid IMT, CRP, and D-dimer
      levels measured at baseline and (2) incident MI and stroke in adults &gt;65 years old followed
      for up to 12 years.
