      Background:

      Patients with cancers of the blood and immune system often benefit from transplants of stem
      cells from a genetically well-matched sibling. However, severe problems may follow these
      transplants because of the high-dose chemotherapy and radiation that accompany the procedure.
      Also, donated immune cells sometimes attack healthy tissues in a reaction called
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), damaging organs such as the liver, intestines and skin. To
      reduce toxicity of high-dose preparative chemotherapy, this study performs allogeneic
      transplant after low doses of chemotherapy. In an attempt to improve anti-tumor effects
      without increasing GVHD, this study uses donor immune cells (Th2 cells) grown in the
      laboratory; some patients will receive standard donor immune cells (not grown in laboratory).
      All patients will receive immune modulating drugs sirolimus and cyclosporine to prevent GVHD.

      Objective:

      To determine the safety, treatment effects and rate of GVHD in patients receiving transplants
      that use low-intensity chemotherapy, sirolimus plus cyclosporine, and transplant booster with
      either Th2 cells or standard immune cells.

      Eligibility:

      Patients 16 to 75 years of age with acute or chronic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
      Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, or myelodysplastic syndrome.

      Patients must have a suitable genetically matched sibling donor and adequate kidney, heart
      and lung function.

      Design: The protocol has three treatment groups: cohort 1, Th2 booster at two weeks
      post-transplant; cohort 2, standard T cell booster at two weeks post-transplant; cohort 3,
      multiple infusion of Th2 cells.

      Background

      In protocol 99-C-0143, we evaluated a new approach to allogeneic HSCT that involved intensive
      host T cell ablation and graft augmentation with in vitro generated donor Th2 cells. Rapid
      full donor engraftment occurred with this regimen; however, grade II to IV acute GVHD was not
      significantly reduced in Th2 cell recipients. In an attempt to improve clinical results using
      Th2 cell graft engineering, this second-generation Th2 cell clinical trial was developed that
      incorporates the following interventions: (1) In an attempt to reduce transplant-related
      toxicity, this protocol now uses a very low-intensity host preparative chemotherapy; (2) In
      an attempt to reduce GVHD, this study will utilize Th2 cells expanded in the presence of the
      immune modulation agent, rapamycin (sirolimus), as murine Th2 cells grown in rapamycin reduce
      GVHD more effectively than control Th2 cells; (3) To further reduce GVHD, subjects will
      receive a short-course of sirolimus therapy in addition to standard cyclosporine GVHD
      prophylaxis; and (4) Using this novel low-intensity transplant platform, compare in a
      preliminary manner the post-transplant outcome of patients receiving pre-emptive donor
      lymphocyte infusion (DLI) using either Th2 cells or unmanipulated donor T cells.

      Objectives

      In the setting of HLA-matched sibling allogeneic HSCT using GVHD prophylaxis of cyclosporine
      and short-course sirolimus, compare in a preliminary manner the safety, feasibility,
      alloengraftment, clinical anti-tumor effects, and GVHD rate of low-intensity Preparative
      Chemotherapy with pre-emptive DLI using either Th2 cells or unmanipulated T cells at day 14
      post-HSCT.

      Eligibility

      Subjects that are 16 to 75 years of age that have a suitable 6/6 HLA-matched sibling donor
      are potentially eligible. Subjects with a diagnosis of acute or chronic leukemia, non-Hodgkin
      s lymphoma, Hodgkin s disease, multiple myeloma, or myelodysplastic syndrome are potentially
      eligible. Adequate kidney, cardiac, and pulmonary function are required.

      Design

        -  Patients age 18 or older with lymphoma (all types) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia will
           be randomized just prior to the transplant regimen to receive DLI with either donor Th2
           cells (cohort 1) or unmanipulated T cells (cohort 2); n=10 patients will be accrued to
           each arm provided that stopping rules pertaining to excessive GVHD or graft rejection
           are not met. For these randomized patients, the preparative regimen will consist of
           low-intensity fludarabine (120 mg/m(2)) plus cyclophosphamide (1200 mg/m(2)) and GVHD
           prophylaxis will consist of short-course, high-dose sirolimus followed by maintenance
           cyclosporine. Cohorts 1 and 2 will be compared in a preliminary manner with respect to
           their post-transplant outcome, in particular: (a) conversion of mixed chimerism to
           predominant donor chimerism; (b) rate and severity of classical acute and late acute
           GVHD at the day 100 and day 180 post-transplant time points; and (c) time to induction
           of leukemia/lymphoma remission (if entering transplant with disease) or time to relapse
           (if entering transplant in remission).

        -  Patients with non-lymphoma diagnoses, patients with lymphoma that are under the age of
           18 and lymphoma patients that are projected to be unable to complete the
           protocol-defined therapy through day 180 post-transplant will not be randomized but will
           be treated on cohort 3 (n=40), which will evaluate transplantation without the Flu/Cy
           preparative regimen and with pre-emptive Th2 cell DLI. The primary objective of cohort 3
           is to evaluate whether transplantation without a preparative regimen will reduce the
           rate of acute GVHD associated with Th2 cell DLI from 41% (the rate observed with the
           Flu/Cy preparative regimen) to a rate of 15% (6 cases out of 40).

              10. Left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 45%, preferably by
                  2-D echo, or by MUGA. However, patients with LVEF of between 35% and 44% may also
                  be eligible provided that such patients are cleared by a Cardiology Consultation
                  that must include a cardiac stress test.

              11. Corrected DLCO greater than 50% of expected value.

              12. Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl or creatinine clearance greater than
                  or equal to 50 ml/min.

              13. Serum total bilirubin less than 2.5 mg/dl; serum ALT and AST equal 2.5 times
                  upper limit of normal. Values above these levels may be accepted, at the
                  discretion of the PI or study chairman, if such elevations are thought to be due
                  to liver involvement by malignancy or GVHD.

              14. Adequate central venous access potential.

              15. Potential patients referred for the study may not be eligible for the
                  experimental protocol therapy due to reasons such as uncertainty about donor HLA
                  typing or need to control malignant disease, infection, or metabolic abnormality
                  such as hypercalcemia on a emergent basis. Should a referred patient present to
                  us in such a scenario, the patient will be referred back to their primary
                  hematologist-oncologist for treatment. However, if referral back to the referring
                  physician is not in the best interest of the patient according to the clinical
                  judgement of the PI, then the patient may receive standard treatment for the
                  malignant disease or complicating conditions (infection, metabolic problems under
                  the current study. In other cases, a patient may have reasonable control of
                  malignancy but does not meet the CD4 cell cut-off of 50 cells per microliter
                  required for cohort 3 therapy; in such cases, standard care chemotherapy regimens
                  may be administered for the specific goal of reducing the CD4 count (that is,
                  immune depleting regimens such as the pentostatin plus cyclophosphamide
                  combination, administered similar to the manner that we have developed on
                  protocol 08-C- 0088). If it becomes apparent that the patient will not be able to
                  proceed to experimental therapy, then he/she must come off study.
                  Recipient-Subjects receiving a standard therapy, and availability of receiving
                  the same treatment elsewhere, outside of a research protocol. Because such
                  standard care therapy is not experimental, it is not necessary to complete the
                  eligibility criteria prior to receiving such standard care; however, prior to
                  initiation of the experimental therapy, the patient must meet each of the
                  eligibility crieteria detailed above. Attempts will be made to standardize such
                  pretransplant chemotherapy (by administration of EPOCH-FR chemotherapy, which is
                  detailed later in this protocol); however, other regimens using approved agents
                  will be allowed if such regimens are thought to be in the best interest of the
                  patient.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA: DONOR

          1. First-degree relative with genotypic identity at 6/6 HLA loci (HLA- A, B, and DR).

          2. Age 11 to 90 years and able to give consent or assent. For donors &lt; 18 years old, the
             legal guardian must be able to provide informed consent.

          3. Adequate venous access for peripheral apheresis, or consent to use a temporary central
             venous catheter for apheresis.

          4. Donors must be HIV negative.

          5. Donors with a history of hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection may be eligible.
             However, eligibility determination of such patients will require a hepatology
             consultation. The risk/benefit of the transplant and the possibility of transmitting
             hepatitis will be discussed with the patient and eligibility will then be determined
             by the principal investigator and LAI.

          6. Lactating donors must substitute formula feeding for her infant during period of
             filgrastim administration (to prevent any filgrastim effect on infant).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA: PATIENT

          1. Active infection that is not responding to antimicrobial therapy.

          2. Active CNS involvement by malignancy.

          3. HIV infection (treatment may result in progression of HIV and other viral infections).

          4. Chronic active hepatitis B. Patient may be hepatitis B core antibody positive. For
             patients with concomitant positive hepatitis B surface antigen, patient will require a
             hepatology consultation. The risk/benefit profile of transplant and hepatitis B will
             be discussed with the patient and eligibility determined by the principal investigator
             and Lead Associate Investigator.

          5. Hepatitis C infection. Patient may have hepatitis C infection. However, each patient
             will require a hepatology consultation. The risk/benefit profile of transplant and
             hepatitis C will be discussed with the patient and eligibility determined by the
             principal investigator and Lead Associate Investigator.

          6. Pregnant or lactating. Patients of childbearing potential must use an effective method
             of contraception. The effects of the chemotherapy, the subsequent transplant and the
             medications used after the transplant are highly likely to be harmful to a fetus. The
             effects upon breast milk are also unknown and may be harmful to the infant.

          7. History of psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with transplant
             protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA: DONOR

          1. History of psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with transplant
             protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent.

          2. History of hypertension that is not controlled by medication, stroke, autoimmune
             disease, or severe heart disease (donors with symptomatic angina will be excluded).
             Donors with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting or angioplasty who are
             symptom free will receive a cardiology evaluation and be considered on a case-by-case
             basis.

          3. History of prior malignancy. However, cancer survivors who have undergone potentially
             curative therapy may be considered for stem cell donation on a case-by-case basis. In
             addition, donors with localized cancer such as prostate cancer that are on a
             watch-and-wait management due to the low-risk of disease progression may also be
             considered for stem cell donation on a case-by-case basis. The risk/benefit of the
             transplant and the possibility of transmitting viable tumor cells at the time of
             transplantation will be discussed with the patient.

          4. Donors must not be pregnant (unknown effect of filgrastim on fetus). Donors of
             childbearing potential must use an effective method of contraception.

          5. Anemia (Hb less than 11 gm/dl) or thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 100,000 per
             microliter). However, potential donors with Hb levels less than 11 gm/dl that is due
             to iron deficiency will be eligible as long as the donor is initiated on iron
             replacement therapy and the case is individually approved by NIH or Hackensack Blood
             Bank.
