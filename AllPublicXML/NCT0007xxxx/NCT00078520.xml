  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients that have chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This research study
      aims to determine the safety and dosage of special cells that may make the patients own
      immune system fight the cancer.

      To do this, we will put a special gene into cancer cells that have been taken from the
      patients body. This will be done in the laboratory. This gene will make the cells produce
      interleukin 2 (IL-2), which is a natural substance that may help the immune system kill
      cancer cells. Additionally, we will stimulate the cancer cells with another natural protein
      called CD40 ligand (CD40L), which experiments in animal and human cells in vitro demonstrated
      can help IL-2 perform better.

      Some of these cells will then be put back into the patient's body. Studies of cancers in
      animals and in cancer cells that are grown in laboratories suggest that combining substances
      like IL-2 and CD40L helps the body kill cancer cells. An experimental treatment similar to
      this has already been used in children and similar experimental treatments are being used in
      adults with other cancers.

      This is a phase I trial to assess the safety of a dose escalation of hCD40L-expressing
      autologous tumor cells with a fixed dose of recombinant hIL-2 gene transduced autologous
      leukemic blasts. All eligible patients will be treated with a minimum of three and up to six
      injections. There will be no use of placebo or control subjects.

    <description>Patients may be treated with a minimum of 3-6 injections of their IL-2-secreting and CD40L-expressing autologous B-CLL cells, separated by one to two weeks in an immunological treatment window. Any patient whose disease regresses after the administration of 6 injections may be offered further injections (i.e. more than 6 injections) of tumor vaccine at the dose level previously administered, if enough vaccines are available. Patients will receive a fixed dose of IL-2 secreting B-CLL cells throughout the entire treatment protocol while an escalating number of CD40L-expressing B-CLL cells will be given at each dose-level.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients are eligible for administration of their vaccine if they present with B-CLL
             (not in Richters transformation) with (group A) or without (group B) (Inclusion of
             B-CLL) measurable disease. Untreated or complete remission patients will be enrolled
             for vaccine administration in a therapeutic (i.e., no chemotherapy) window of three
             months. If during these three months (necessary to complete the vaccine study), the
             patient presents with rapid clinical progression, he or she will be excluded from our
             current study and will receive treatment according to the standard institutional
             guidelines. IMPORTANT NOTE: vaccine production for complete remission patients can
             only be achieved if tumor cells have been collected BEFORE entering complete
             remission.

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 10 weeks.

          -  Patients must have ECOG performance status of 0-2 as below: 0 = up and about, no
             restriction, 1 = Ambulatory, no strenuous activity, 2 = Ambulatory, capable of
             self-care appropriate for age. Up and about &gt; 50% of time, but unable to carry out any
             physical activities or attend school, 3 = Limited self-care only. Up and about &lt; 50%
             of time, 4 = Disabled, no self care. Bedridden or confined to chair.

          -  Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy before

             2 times normal, normal prothrombin time).

          -  Patients must have adequate renal function (creatinine less than 3 times normal for
             age or creatinine clearance &gt; 80mg/min/1.73m2).

          -  Patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware this is a
             research study and have been told of its possible benefits and toxic side-effects.
             Patients will be given a copy of the consent form.

          -  Patient must not have received treatment with other investigational agents within the
