    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this 5-year study is to determine whether exemestane alone or in
      combination with celecoxib decreases breast tissue density in healthy postmenopausal women at
      high risk for breast cancer. Dense breast tissue seen on mammography has been linked to an
      increased risk of breast cancer. The study will also examine the effects of exemestane and
      celecoxib on bone density, blood hormone levels and quality of life. Exemestane, approved by
      the Food and Drug Administration for treating postmenopausal women with breast cancer, lowers
      the amount of estrogen in the body. Celecoxib, approved for treating arthritis pain and for
      reducing the number or colon polyps in an inherited syndrome, is an anti-inflammatory drug.
      Half of the women in the study will receive exemestane alone and half will receive exemestane
      and celecoxib together.

      In December 2004, the arm using exemestane and celecoxib was closed to accrual

      Postmenopausal women who are at increased risk for developing invasive breast cancer may be
      eligible to participate. Candidates are screened with breast cancer risk assessment, medical
      history and physical examination, blood tests, review of medical records, if needed, breast
      biopsy, and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to assess bone density. For the DEXA
      scan, the subject lies still on a table for about 30 minutes while the spine and hip are
      scanned using a small amount of radiation.

      Participants take exemestane in pill form once a day for 2 years. They also take calcium and
      vitamin D pills daily to help protect bone health. They are followed in the clinic during the
      course of the study to determine the amount of drug taken and any side effects, and for the
      following tests and procedures:

        -  Medical evaluation and blood tests at after 1 and 3 months on study drugs

        -  Medical evaluation at 6 months

        -  Breast biopsy at screening and then at 12 months

        -  dual-emission x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan of the spine, mammogram and routine blood
           tests before starting study drugs and then yearly for 5 years.

      Background:

      Evidence from adjuvant treatment trials of invasive breast cancer with aromatase inhibitors
      suggests that these agents are superior to tamoxifen in preventing contralateral breast
      cancer and are well tolerated. These agents are promising breast cancer chemopreventive
      agents. Data on safety and effect on surrogate biomarkers in a healthy at risk population is
      lacking.

      Objectives:

      Primary:

      -The primary objective is to evaluate the study drug effects on mammographic density after
      one year on treatment.

      Secondary:

      -Secondary objectives include assessing the effect of the intervention on bone mineral
      density, serum hormones and lipids, and breast tissue biomarkers.

      Eligibility:

      Eligible patients are postmenopausal women who meet one of the following criteria:

        -  History of stage I or II breast cancer 2 years out from definitive therapy.

        -  Gail model 5 year risk greater than or equal to 1.7%

        -  History of treated ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS)

        -  History of high risk lesion on breast biopsy (atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH),
           atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH), lobular carcinoma in-situ (LCIS))

        -  Known or suspected breast cancer 1, early onset (BRCA1) or breasts cancer 2, early onset
           (BRCA2) mutation

        -  Subjects must have adequate bone mineral density by dual-emission x-ray absorptiometry
           (DEXA) scan in order to enroll.

      Design:

        -  This is an open label study of exemestane in postmenopausal women with an elevated risk
           of developing invasive breast cancer. Forty five subjects will be enrolled and receive
           standard dose exemestane (25 mg each day (QD)), calcium and vitamin D.

        -  Each subject will continue treatment for a total of two years.

        -  Changes in mammographic breast density and bone mineral density will be evaluated
           annually which will provide long term biomarker and safety information about prevention
           therapy with exemestane.

        unclear cases, (e.g. 50 year old who has had hysterectomy) chemical confirmation of
        postmenopausal status may be confirmed with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) greater than
        35 U/L.

        Elevated risk for developing invasive breast cancer by virtue of one of the following
        criteria:

        Gail Model risk of greater than or equal to 1.7% over 5 years from study entry. (This is
        the same minimum level of risk required for a subject to be eligible for the recently

        Deleterious mutations in BRCA1 or 2 OR A priori risk assessment of 20% chance or greater of
        carrying BRCA1/2 gene mutation. The BRCAPRO and Couch model will both be used to asses this
        risk. If a woman has a 20% risk of carrying a BRCA1/2 mutation by either model, she will

        Subjects should be willing to abstain from use of hormonal therapies (e.g. tamoxifen,
        hormone replacement therapy, oral contraceptive pills, hormone-containing intrauterine
        devices (IUDs). E-string is acceptable). Venlafaxine will be offered as supportive care for
        women with menopausal symptoms.

        Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1.

        Subject has been counseled regarding her options and has signed the informed consent
        document.

        evidence of disease at time of enrollment AND no history of cancer directed treatment in
        the 2 years preceding enrollment.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:
