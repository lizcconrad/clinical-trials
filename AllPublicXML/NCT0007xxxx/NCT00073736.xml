  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary cancer of the liver. MB07133 is
      being developed for the treatment of inoperable HCC, using a platform technology known as
      HepDirectTM, which enables drugs to be targeted specifically to the liver. The objective for
      this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of MB07133.

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose of MB07133 when administered as a 7-day continuous
      i.v. To characterize the safety profile and the pharmacokinetics of MB07133 and metabolites
      during and after continuous infusion. To determine the effect of MB07133 on hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) tumor size.

             normal or an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
             greater than 5 times upper limit of normal, or serum albumin less than 3.2 g/dL
