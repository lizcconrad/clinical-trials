    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study of pemetrexed and gemcitabine chemotherapy given once every 14 days
      to patients with advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer. This treatment is for patients
      that have not received any prior chemotherapy treatment for lung cancer. The primary goal is
      to find out if the tumor gets smaller or disappears with this treatment.
