      This study will evaluate and treat people with SARS, a new type of pneumonia (lung infection)
      originating in China. SARS is caused by a new virus that is easily transmitted from person to
      person. This study will look at the course of the disease; determine how the virus affects
      the body and how the body fights the infection; and evaluate diagnostic tests to quickly
      identify the disease.

      People 18 years of age and older with probable or suspected SARS may be eligible for this
      study. Close contacts of patients with SARS, patients who recovered from SARS, and NIH health
      care workers involved in the care of patients will also be enrolled. Patients with SARS who
      require hospitalization will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center. Because SARS spreads
      easily, hospitalized patients will be in a room by themselves and will not be allowed any
      visitors. They will not leave their room except for tests, such as x-rays.

      All participants will have a full medical examination, including a medical history, physical
      examination, and blood tests. In addition, the participants undergo various tests and
      procedures as follows:

        -  Probable and suspected SARS patients may be hospitalized or may be seen as outpatients.
           They are provided the treatment judged best for their disease, usually according to
           expressed or published recommendations. The best treatment for SARS is not yet known,
           and there have been no studies evaluating therapies. Outpatients are seen three times a
           week for 2 weeks, once a week for 4 more weeks, and then at 6 months. Patients have
           mouth and throat swabs taken three times a week for the first 2 weeks, then once a week
           for 4 more weeks. Blood is drawn three times a week for the first 2 weeks, then once at
           weeks 3, 4, and 6. If virus is still detectable after 6 weeks, nose washings and throat
           swabs are repeated until no virus is detected for 3 weeks in a row. In addition,
           patients provide urine and stool samples, have a chest x-ray and electrocardiogram, and
           undergo bronchoscopy and bronchial lavage. For the bronchoscopy, a bronchoscope
           (pencil-thin flexible tube) is passed into the large airways of the lung, allowing the
           physician to examine the airways. Cells and secretions from the airways are rinsed from
           the lung with salt water. A brush the size of a pencil tip is passed through the
           bronchoscope to scrape cells lining the airways and pieces of tissue are collected for
           analysis.

        -  Close contacts of patients are evaluated twice a week for 2 weeks, then once a week for
           2 more weeks. Blood is drawn at the first visit and then at 1, 2, and 4 weeks. Mouth and
           throat swabs, nose washings, and sputum collections are done twice a week for 2 weeks,
           then once a week for 2 more weeks. Urine and stool samples are collected once a week for
           4 weeks. If virus from the nose or throat is still detectable after 4 weeks, weekly nose
           washings and throat swabs continue until no virus is detected for 3 weeks in a row.
           Blood may also be drawn during the weekly visits.

        -  Recovered SARS patients provide blood, urine, and stool samples and have a mouth and
           throat swab and nose aspiration to see if the SARS virus is present. For the nasal
           aspiration, salt water is put in the nose and then suctioned out. Usually, these tests
           are done only once. If virus is detected, however, the nose washing, throat swabs and
           blood tests are repeated once a week until no virus is detected for 3 weeks in a row.

        -  Health care workers document their contact with patients, use of isolation procedures
           and equipment, and any unexpected events that occur during contact. They are evaluated
           for symptoms of infection and provide a blood sample once a month

    <textblock>
      Since mid February 2003, there have been reports of atypical pneumonias originating in China
      which have subsequently been termed the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). SARS has
      subsequently spread to multiple countries including the United States, and is accompanied by
      a higher than anticipated morbidity and mortality. Because of world travel and the apparent
      easy transmissibility of this disease reported in other nations, the number of patients with
      SARS may continue to rise. The primary purpose of this protocol is to evaluate and treat
      persons with SARS. Other goals will be to characterize the clinical course of SARS by also
      evaluating close contacts of people with SARS, as well as those that have recovered from
      SARS. Additional goals of the protocol are to elucidate the pathophysiology of SARS,
      characterize the immune response during SARS, and evaluate diagnostic tests for the rapid
      identification of SARS in clinical specimens. Further knowledge about SARS may lead to
      effective forms of therapy and improve mortality from this disease.
