      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying immunization using two different gp100
      protein vaccines to compare how well they work in treating patients with metastatic melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the clinical response in patients with metastatic melanoma immunized with
           recombinant gp100 protein (184V) emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 with or without
           gp100:209-217 (210M) peptide.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the toxicity profile of these immunizations in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts according to
      HLA-A2*0201 status. Patients assigned to cohort 1 are then randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Cohort 1 (HLA-A2*0201-positive patients): Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
           arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive immunization comprising recombinant gp100 protein (184V)
                emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 22, 43, and 64 (1
                course).

             -  Arm II: Patients receive immunization comprising recombinant gp100 protein (184V)
                and gp100:209-217 (210M) peptide emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 SC on days 1, 22,
                43, and 64 (1 course).

        -  Cohort 2 (HLA-A2*0201-negative patients): Patients receive immunization as in cohort 1,
           arm I.

      In both cohorts, treatment continues in the absence of rapid disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      In both cohorts, patients are evaluated 3-4 weeks after the fourth immunization. Patients
      achieving stable disease or a partial response receive retreatment according to their
      assigned cohort. Patients with progressive disease who are eligible for interleukin-2 (IL-2)
      receive retreatment according to their assigned cohort AND high-dose IL-2 IV over 15 minutes
      3 times daily on days 2-5, 23-26, 44-47, and 65-68 (1 course). Patients receive up to 3
      retreatment courses. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive 1 retreatment course
      beyond CR. Patients with progressive disease who are ineligible for IL-2 administration are
      removed from the study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45-75 patients (30-50 for cohort 1 [15-25 per treatment arm]
      and 15-25 for cohort 2) will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
