      This study will compare the safety and effectiveness of three popular weight loss plans.
      These plans will be compared with the USDA Dietary Guidelines.

    <textblock>
      Obesity is the single most significant, nutrition-related health issue of the new millennium.
      Several “medical experts” have designed and promoted weight loss diets that dramatically
      differ from one another and from the USDA Dietary Guidelines. These diets have gained
      surprisingly widespread and persistent popularity among Americans despite the lack of
      evidence supporting their claims. This clinical trial will provide preliminary feasibility
      data for a full-scale study that will examine health outcomes (e.g., benefits, risks,
      success) of three popular weight loss diets. The study will investigate behavioral and
      physiological factors that influence adherence and retention to these diet plans.

      Overweight women will be randomly assigned to one of four diets for 1 year: Atkins (extremely
      low carbohydrate), Zone (low carbohydrate, high protein), Ornish (very low fat), or USDA/Food
      Pyramid (high carbohydrate/moderate-low fat). Behavioral and physiological data will be
      collected. Participants attend study visits at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year. At
      these visits, measurements will include that will include weight and blood pressure
      measurements and blood tests. Participants will be asked to complete ten questionnaires over
      the course of the study to assess behavior and appetite. Participants will also undergo a
      DEXA scan to assess body composition.
