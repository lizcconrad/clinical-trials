  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, non-randomized, open label study of ILX651 in patients with locally
      advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Approximately 60 patients will
      be enrolled in this study that is expected to last 18 months. All patients will be treated
      with ILX651 administered intravenously (IV) daily for 5 consecutive days once every 21 days.
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the overall response rate. The secondary
      objectives are to determine the progression free survival, duration of response, time to
      tumor progression, survival, safety/tolerability of ILX651, and to evaluate pharmacokinetic
      profile.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC previously treated with
             2 prior chemotherapy regimens (not including prior adjuvant therapy for stage I or II
             disease).

          -  Disease recurrence or progression after prior therapy with a platinum-based and a
             taxane-based regimen, given either concurrently or separately.

          -  Measurable disease. Measurable lesions should be outside the field of radiation. Where
             measurable lesions are within a previously irradiated field, there must be objective
             evidence of progression of the lesion prior to patient enrollment.

          -  Male or female patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Must have adequate organ and immune system function as indicated by the following
             laboratory values, obtained less than or equal to 2 weeks prior to registration: A.
             Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 x 1,000,000,000. B.
             Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL. C. Platelet count greater than or equal
             to 100 x 1,000,000,000/L. D. Serum creatinine or calculated creatinine clearance less
             than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL or greater than or equal to 60 mL/min. E. Serum total
             bilirubin within limits of normal values. F. AST and ALT less than or equal to 2 times
             the upper limit of normal (ULN). G. Alkaline phosphatase within limits of normal
             values

          -  Anti-cancer therapy, major surgery, or irradiation must have been completed at least 3
             weeks before enrollment in this study. Patient must have recovered from the acute side
             effects incurred as a result of previous therapy.

          -  Female patients with childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within
             7 days of study enrollment. Men and women of reproductive potential must use an
             effective contraceptive method while enrolled in the study.

          -  Signed informed consent (includes HIPAA authorization).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with uncontrolled congestive heart failure or angina, patients with a history
             of myocardial infarction within 2 months of enrollment, or patients with cardiac
             functional capacity Class III or IV as defined by the New York Heart Association
             Classification.

          -  Previously treated with &gt; 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced or metastatic
             disease.

          -  Prior radiotherapy to the only site of measurable disease.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to study drug or its analogs.

          -  Use of investigational agents within previous 30 days.

          -  Known, active infection, or known HIV positive or presence of an AIDS related illness.

          -  Active secondary malignancy except minor skin cancers.

          -  Presence of symptomatic active brain metastases, including leptomeningeal involvement.

          -  Any significant concurrent disease or illness, or psychiatric disorders or alcohol or
             chemical abuse that would, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise patient
             safety or compliance, or interfere with the interpretation of study results.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females.
