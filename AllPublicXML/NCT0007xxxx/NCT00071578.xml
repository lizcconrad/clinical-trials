  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Binge Eating Disorder (BED) is associated with impairments in physical, psychological, and
      social functioning. Research has revealed relationships between disordered eating and both
      low self-esteem and negative emotional states.

      Participants in this study will complete assessment interviews regarding their eating
      disorder and associated problems. Similar assessments will be conducted at the end of the
      study. Participants will then be randomly assigned to one of two therapy groups. Participants
      in one group will focus on the role of self-esteem, self-awareness, and personal
      effectiveness in binge eating. Participants in the other group will focus on the role of
      negative emotions and binge eating. Both treatments will involve a 30 to 40 minute
      pre-treatment individual orientation session, followed by 20 weeks of weekly group therapy.
      Sessions will take place over 22 weeks, or approximately 6 months (18 weekly sessions
      followed by 2 biweekly sessions). Follow-up assessments will take place at 3 months, 6
      months, and 12 months after study completion to assess maintenance of treatment effects.
