      -  Purpose: A phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the
           efficacy and safety of 200 Âµg of recombinant Interferon gamma-1b administered by
           subcutaneous (SC) injection, compared with placebo, in patients with IPF

        -  Enrollment: Approximately 800 patients will be enrolled from approximately 80 centers in
           North America and Europe

        -  Randomization: 2:1 active-to-placebo ratio

        -  Duration: at least 2 years active drug or placebo (rescue therapy will be permitted for
           patients who meet predefined criteria)

      INSPIRE, the largest and most comprehensive clinical trial ever conducted in IPF, has now
      completed enrolling patients with mild to moderate IPF. Eligible patients will receive either
      Interferon gamma-1b or placebo for a minimum of 2 years.
