  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasingly more individuals are trying to lose weight. Indeed, many women, regardless of
      their size, experience a life-long battle and preoccupation with their weight. Despite the
      attention to weight and the increase in diet behavior, the incidence of obesity continues to
      rise. There is little data to show improved long term success for the majority of
      participants who engage in weight loss behaviors.

      The specific aim is to improve the psychological and metabolic health of obese women with a
      history of chronic dieting through encouraging &quot;Health at Every Size&quot; (HAES). This treatment
      model emphasizes &quot;intutitive eating,&quot; i.e., internal regulation of eating (responding to cues
      of hunger, appetite and satiety). The HAES model is being compared to the current standard of
      care in obesity treatment, energy restriction dieting, which encourages cognitive control of
      eating and weight reduction.
