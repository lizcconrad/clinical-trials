  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our previous studies have demonstrated that there is substantial metabolic opposition to the
      maintenance of an altered body weight. Leptin is a protein secreted by fat cells and the
      circulating concentrations of leptin are directly proportional to fat mass. Leptin-deficiency
      is associated with severe obesity in rodents and in humans and the obesity is relieved by
      leptin administration. These studies examine the hypothesis that some of this metabolic
      opposition cto the maintenance of an altered body weight can be relieved by restoring
      circulating concentrations of the hormone leptin to the same range as at usual body weight in
      subjects who are maintaining a reduced body weight. The basic design of this study is to
      observe subjects at a 10% reduced body weight and then again at that reduced body weight
      while receiving physiological leptin or T3 supplementation.

      We demonstrated a substantial metabolic resistance to maintenance of altered body weight.
      Leptin is secreted by fat cells in circulating concentrations that are directly proportional
      to fat mass. Leptin-deficiency is associated with severe obesity in rodents and in humans and
      the obesity is relieved by leptin administration. These studies examine the hypothesis that
      some of this metabolic opposition cto the maintenance of an altered body weight can be
      relieved by restoring circulating concentrations of the hormone leptin to the same range as
      at usual body weight in subjects who are maintaining a reduced body weight. The basic design
      of this study is to observe subjects at a 10% reduced body weight and then again at that
      reduced body weight while receiving physiological leptin or T3 supplementation.
