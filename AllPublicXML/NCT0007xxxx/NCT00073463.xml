  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm the improvement in pulmonary function and cytokine
      levels observed in the recently completed multidose aerosol study for the treatment of Cystic
      Fibrosis (CF).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder with an incidence of approximately 1 in
      33000 live births. It is due to defects in the CFTR gene, which is located on chromosome 7.
      Gene Therapy holds the promise of addressing the primary defect in CF by reconstituting the
      CFTR function in the lung. tgAAVCF, which has been genetically engineered to contain the CFTR
      gene, has been extremely well tolerated following single and multiple dose administrations to
      the nose, sinus, and lung. Dose-dependent gene transfer has been demonstrated. Although
      vector gene expression has not been detected, evidence consistent with biological activity
      was observed in maxillary sinus study, and statistically significant changes in the FEV1 and
      IL-8 levels were observed in the recently completed multidose aerosol study. These findings
      are worthy of further investigation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Eligible subjects will be randomized to two aerosolized doses of either tgAAVCF or placebo
        30 days apart. Subjects will undergo pulmonary function testing every two weeks during the
        active portion of the study (three months) and will be followed for safety for a total of
        seven months.
