  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive aspergillosis is a type of fungal infection typically identified in very sick
      patients (for example, patients with cancer or who have had a bone marrow or organ
      transplant). This study will seek to enroll patients (16 years of age or older) with invasive
      aspergillosis infections (involving organs or deep tissues) who are failing or could not
      tolerate standard antifungal therapy. Your doctor will make this determination based upon
      specific study criteria. Patients that fulfill all study criteria will be treated daily with
      both the investigational drug and another antifungal agent. The choice of the other agent is
      up to your doctor. This investigational drug is approved for the treatment of invasive
      aspergillosis by itself. The safety and efficacy of this investigational drug, in combination
      with other agents is not known.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  Patients must meet a specific definition of probable or definite invasive
             aspergillosis and be considered to have failed or be intolerant of standard antifungal
             therapy.

          -  The patient must be at least 16 years old and if a woman of childbearing potential,
             must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test sensitive to 25 IU hCG prior to
             enrollment.
