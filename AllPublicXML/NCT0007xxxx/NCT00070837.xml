  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the highest dose of MLN2704 that can be given
      multiple times safely to patients with prostate cancer, and to identify any side effects
      associated with taking the drug. This study will also evaluate how MLN2704 is taken up,
      broken down and eliminated by the body.
