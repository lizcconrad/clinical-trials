  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of GTI-2040 and gemcitabine in
      treating patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die. GTI-2040 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary
      for their growth and by making tumor cells more sensitive to gemcitabine

      OBJECTIVES: Primary I. Determine the toxicity profile and maximum tolerated dose of GTI-2040
      and gemcitabine in patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors.

      Secondary I. Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this regimen in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive GTI-2040 IV continuously on days 2-16 of course 1 and on days 1-16 of all
      subsequent courses and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of course 1 and on
      days 2, 9, and 16 of all subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of GTI-2040 and gemcitabine until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is
      determined, 10 additional patients are treated at that dose.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-20
      months.
