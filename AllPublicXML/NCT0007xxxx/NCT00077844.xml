      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous enoxaparin
      versus intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) in patients undergoing non-emergent PCI, as
      assessed by measuring the incidence of non-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) major and
      minor bleeding.
