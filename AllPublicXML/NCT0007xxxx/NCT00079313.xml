      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of imatinib (Gleevec(Registered
      Trademark)) in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and atypical chronic
      myelogenous leukemia (CML). These conditions cause uncontrolled growth of malignant
      (cancerous) cells in the bone marrow that prevents the bone marrow from functioning normally
      in producing blood cells. The cancer cells also can spill over into the blood and invade
      other organs of the body. Imatinib has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for
      treating chronic myelogenous leukemia, which has characteristics similar to atypical CML and
      to CMML, and data from other research suggests this drug may be able to produce a remission
      in forms of leukemia other than CML.

      Patients over 18 years of age with atypical CML or CMML may be eligible for this study.
      Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood tests,
      electrocardiogram, chest x-ray, and bone marrow aspiration and biopsy (removal of a small
      piece of bone marrow tissue through a needle inserted into the hip bone).

      Participants take imatinib capsules once a day for 2 years. If at any time during the study
      the patient's blood counts begin to rise, disease symptoms develop, or the disease has
      progressed, the dose of imatinib is increased each week until the disease progression is
      stopped. Any patient whose disease does not response to treatment after 6 weeks of increased
      dosing and 30 days at the maximum daily dose of 800 mg is taken off the study and referred
      for different treatment.

      Patients are seen by their referring physician every week for the first 4 weeks of the study,
      every other week for the next 8 weeks, and then monthly until the study is completed. At each
      visit, blood is drawn to monitor for drug side effects and response to therapy. In addition,
      patients come to the NIH Clinical Center every 3 months for a complete history and physical
      examination and for a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy every 6 months to assess the effect
      of treatment on bone marrow cells.

      Patients who leave the study before 2 years are followed with laboratory monitoring for 6
      months after stopping imatinib; those who remain on the drug for the full 2 years are
      monitored for 1 year after stopping the drug.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of imatinib for
      improving blood counts in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and atypical
      chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).

      Although a number of agents have been used to treat these diseases, most patients do not
      respond to treatment. Imatinib has been shown in clinical trials to induce high rates of
      responses in patients with chronic phase CML. Imatinib has also been shown to be effective in
      inducing responses in a subset of patients with CMML and atypical CML and is also effective
      in a subset of patients with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), another
      myeloproliferative disorder. Because patients with several different myeloproliferative
      diseases have been shown to experience dramatic responses to imatinib, we would like to
      determine what proportion of patients with atypical myeloproliferative diseases (CMML and
      atypical CML) will respond to this agent.

      Prior to enrollment, a thorough clinical evaluation will be performed. A baseline bone marrow
      will be obtained to exclude acute leukemia or lymphoma and to assess the degree and nature of
      the myeloproliferation. In order to minimize bone marrow suppression, other myelosuppressive
      drugs will be tapered and discontinued during the first week of therapy with imatinib.
      Complete blood counts will be performed weekly for the first month and every other week
      thereafter. Clinical assessments will be performed every three months to assess for continued
      response.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All subjects must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

        All subjects must meet the established diagnostic criteria for CMML or atypical CML.

        The diagnostic criteria for CMML include:

          -  persistent peripheral blood monocytosis (greater than 1000/mm(3)),

             CMML can still be made if the other requirements are met and a cytogenetic abnormality
             is present in the marrow cells or if monocytosis has been persistent for at least 3
             months and all other causes of monocytosis have been excluded.
