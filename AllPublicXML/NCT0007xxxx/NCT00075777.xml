      RATIONALE: Valproic acid may help stop the growth of Kaposi's sarcoma cells by blocking the
      enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying valproic acid in treating patients with HIV-related
      Kaposi's sarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety of valproic acid in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma.

        -  Determine the effects of this drug on human herpes virus 8 (KSHV) gene expression using
           polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the effects of this drug on HIV, KSHV, and Epstein-Barr virus viral loads in
           the plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of these patients.

        -  Determine clinical response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral valproic acid twice daily on days 1-28 followed by a drug taper over 2
      weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
