      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet
      known whether radiation therapy after surgery is effective in preventing a recurrence of
      ductal carcinoma in situ.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying adjuvant radiation therapy to see how
      well it works compared to observation after surgery in treating women with estrogen receptor
      positive or progesterone receptor positive ductal carcinoma in situ and are also receiving
      either tamoxifen or anastrozole.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare ipsilateral tumor relapse and breast cancer metastases in women with completely
           excised low-risk estrogen receptor- or progesterone receptor-positive ductal carcinoma
           in situ of the breast receiving adjuvant tamoxifen or anastrozole and treated with
           adjuvant radiotherapy vs observation alone.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the minimal surgical margins required to minimize the local recurrence rate in
           patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Identify molecular markers that predict ipsilateral tumor recurrence in patients treated
           with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      All patients receive adjuvant tamoxifen or anastrozole for 5 years.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 3 or 5 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation alone. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at
           6 months, and then at 1, 2, and 5 years.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 1 year and then annually for up to 10 years.

      Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,000 patients (1,000 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 5 years.
