      This study will test a spinal cord reflex called reciprocal inhibition before, during, and
      after learning a motor skill to see if the reflex becomes stronger by learning the movement.
      People learn new motor skills throughout their lives. At first, performing a new skilled
      movement such as riding a bicycle takes effort and is clumsy, but with practice, it becomes
      relatively automatic. The motor cortex (a part of the brain) is very active when a new
      skilled movement is learned, but becomes less active when the movement is over-learned. This
      study will determine whether the spinal cord helps coordinate the pattern of activity between
      groups of muscles once a motor skill is learned.

      Healthy volunteers between 21 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates
      are screened with a medical history and neurological examination.

      Participants are divided into two groups. Group 1 has movement training sessions only and
      Group 2 has both movement training sessions and physiology sessions, as follows:

      Movement training sessions

      For 15 minutes every weekday, participants practice moving their wrist back and forth to make
      a cursor on the computer screen follow a target. Activity of the arm muscles is monitored
      with surface electrodes taped to the skin. The sessions continue until the participant can
      perform the movement well. Group 1 participants return to the clinic a week after the last
      session to perform the movement again to see if their skill level has changed. Each session
      lasts about 20 to 30 minutes.

      Physiology sessions

      In three separate sessions, the reflex for reciprocal inhibition is measured before and at
      several times during the movement task. This is done with nerve conduction studies. A probe
      placed on the skin delivers a low-intensity electrical stimulus. Wires taped to the skin
      record the nerve impulses. To measure reciprocal inhibition, several dozen stimuli are given
      to two nerves in combinations. Each session lasts 2 to 3 hours.

      Objective:

      Once a skilled movement is thoroughly learned, it can be performed relatively automatically.
      The motor cortex is active when learning a new motor skill, but becomes less activated once
      the skill has become over-learned. We hypothesize that learning a skilled movement is
      associated with more efficient use of subcortical motor circuits. Subcortical motor circuits
      can coordinate features of the intended movement such as the timing and patterns of
      activation of different muscles. The goal of this study is to determine whether learning a
      motor skill strengthens spinal interneuron circuits that facilitate the movement. Subjects
      will learn to perform a movement consisting of alternating wrist movements. The strength of
      reciprocal inhibition between antagonist muscles will be tested.

      Study Population:

      22 healthy adult volunteers

      Design:

      The study has two experiments. Both experiments use a within-subjects design. The purpose of
      the first experiment is to determine whether learning to accurately perform an alternating
      wrist flexion and extension movement task is associated with reduced co-contraction of wrist
      flexor and extensor muscles. Subjects will practice making accurate wrist flexions and
      extensions to keep a cursor on a target for fifteen-minute sessions every weekday until they
      are able to obtain 95% accuracy. Activity of the arm muscles will be monitored during the
      sessions with surface electrodes on the arm muscles. The first experiment will also determine
      the best training parameters for learning the task. In the second experiment, a second group
      of subjects will learn the task using the best training parameters. The strength of the
      reflex for reciprocal inhibition will be measured before, during and after training.
      Reciprocal inhibition will also be measured after the movement has become highly learned.

      Outcome measures:

      In the first experiment, the outcome will be the percent of movement time in which
      co-contraction occurs, as recorded from surface electrodes, while the subject learns to
      perform the movement to 95% accuracy. In the second experiment, the outcome measure is the
      strength of spinally mediated reciprocal inhibition, as measured using reflexes.
