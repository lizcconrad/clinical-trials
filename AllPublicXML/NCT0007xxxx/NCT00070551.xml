  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of GTI-2040 and high-dose
      cytarabine in treating patients with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia. GTI-2040
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine, use different ways to stop cancer cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving GTI-2040 together with cytarabine may kill more
      cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of GTI-2040 and
      high-dose cytarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the therapeutic response in patients treated with this regimen. II. Determine
      the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to age (under age
      60 vs age 60 and over). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 strata.

      Stratum I (under age 60): Patients receive GTI-2040 IV continuously on days 1-6 and high-dose
      cytarabine IV over 2 hours twice daily on days 2, 4, and 6.

      Stratum II (age 60 and over): Patients receive GTI-2040 IV continuously on days 1-6 and
      high-dose cytarabine IV over 4 hours once daily on days 2-6.

      In both strata, treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients per stratum receive escalating doses of GTI-2040 and high-dose
      cytarabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-51patients will be accrued for this study within 2-16 months.
