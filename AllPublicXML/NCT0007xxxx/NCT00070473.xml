      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as pemetrexed disodium, use different ways to
      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Pemetrexed disodium may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of pemetrexed disodium
      in treating young patients with recurrent solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of pemetrexed disodium in children and adolescents
           with refractory solid tumors.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate the presence of the C677T polymorphism of the methylenetetrahydrolate
           reductase gene, the presence of a polymorphism in the enhancer region of the thymidylate
           synthase (TS) gene promoter (2R and 3R tandem repeats), the presence of a polymorphism
           within one of those repeats, and the presence of a functional polymorphism in the
           3'-untranslated region with toxicity in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels at study entry with toxicity in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate various gene expression profiles with response in patients treated with this
           drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of pemetrexed disodium until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
