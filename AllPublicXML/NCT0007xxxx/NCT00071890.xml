  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether interleukin-2 (IL-2) given before the interruption of
      antiretroviral (ARV) treatment could significantly extend the period of time that a patient
      is temporarily not taking ARV treatment and also preserve CD4 counts above 350 cells per
      microliter. There will be an evaluation of the toxicity, or extremely harmful effects, of
      ARV, and the effect on quality of life.

      The use of ARV medications has greatly improved the condition and mortality of HIV-infected
      patients. But when used long term, those medications have been associated with great
      toxicities and medication fatigue. As a result, patients may not adhere to ARV use, and
      resistance to viruses may grow. The CD4 molecule is on the surface of helper T-lymphocytes,
      or T-helper cells. It serves as the primary receptor for HIV-1 and HIV-2, allowing the virus
      to gain entry into its host. The CD4 count increases immediately in response to ARV, giving
      an estimate of the state of a patient's immune system. Thus, it is a strong marker of the
      immediate risk of an opportunistic infection, one that takes advantage of a person's weakened
      immune system. IL-2 is a molecule naturally produced by activated T cells. In patients with
      HIV, IL-2 treatment can increase CD4 counts but the clinical importance of this increase is
      not clear. This study will compare the decline in CD4 count, when ARV is interrupted, in two
      random groups of participants: (1) those who will receive three cycles of IL-2 (one every 8
      weeks) in combination with ARV therapy for the first 24 weeks of the study before stopping
      ARV and (2) those who will receive ARV therapy without IL-2 for 24 weeks before stopping ARV.

      Patients 18 years of age or older who have HIV-1 infection and who have been on ARV therapy
      for at least 1 year, and who currently have a CD4 count 500 cells per microliter or higher
      and never had a CD4 count of less than 200 cells per microliter and a viral load less than
      the limit of detection, may be eligible for this study.

      Participants will undergo the following procedures and tests:

        -  Physical examination.

        -  Blood tests to measure blood lipids (fats), sugar, complete blood count including
           platelets, and chemistries.

        -  Assessment of fat distribution.

        -  Questionnaire about quality of life.

      In addition, those participants who are randomly placed in the group receiving IL-2 and ARV
      will get an echocardiogram at the beginning of the study and at week 24. They will receive a
      starting dose of 6 million units of IL-2 as an injection under the skin twice a day. Each of
      the three IL-2 cycles will last 5 days. After the 24-week period, participants in both groups
      will stop taking ARV medications if their CD4 count is still equal to or greater than 500
      cells per microliter. The study will continue into 120 weeks. Participants will be asked to
      continue to visit the clinic every 8 weeks for evaluation of their viral load and CD4 counts.
      Every 24 weeks, they will be asked to answer a questionnaire about their quality of life.
      Blood tests and other measurements will also be done as follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of antiretroviral (ARV) medications has greatly improved morbidity and mortality of
      HIV-infected patients but long-term use of these agents has been associated with significant
      toxicities and medication fatigue that can lead to problems with adherence and eventual
      development of virologic resistance. The spectrum of ARV toxicities is broad including the
      development of lipodystrophy syndrome with lipid abnormalities and glucose intolerance or
      diabetes, while increasing evidence suggests an increased risk of cardiovascular
      complications in ARV-treated HIV-infected individuals. Current PHHS treatment guidelines
      recommend deferring ARV treatment initiation in asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals with
      CD4 count greater than or equal to 350 cells/micro liter, and treatment initiation after the
      CD4 count is less than 350 cells/micro liter. Several patients who started antiretroviral
      therapy at higher CD4 counts (based on older treatment initiation guidelines) or have
      experienced significant immunologic reconstitution after ARV initiation, elect to interrupt
      antiretroviral therapy until their CD4 count reaches the level of current recommendations for
      therapy initiation (less than 350 cells/micro liter).

      Studies to date suggest that baseline and nadir CD4 count are the best predictors of a longer
      duration of treatment interruption that may be more beneficial with respect to reversal or
      delay of long-term ARV-associated toxicity and improved quality of life. It is known that
      intermittent cycles of IL-2 administration can lead to expansion of the CD4 pool and prolong
      survival of CD4 T cells. In this study the hypothesis tested is that IL-2 given prior to ARV
      treatment interruption could significantly prolong the period of ARV treatment interruption
      with preservation of CD4 counts above 350 cells/micro liter, and that this prolongation will
      be beneficial with respect to antiretroviral related toxicity and quality of life.

      The study will have two parts: during the first part (24 weeks) patients will be randomized
      1:1 to either receive three cycles or IL-2 with their ARV therapy or ARV therapy alone. In
      the second part (week 24 to week 120), all participants will interrupt therapy and restart
      when CD4 is less than 350 cells/micro liter. The main comparison will be at week 72, when the
      proportion of patients from the two groups who remain off drugs and have a CD4 greater than
      350 cells/micro liter will be compared. At regular intervals (every 24 weeks) lipodystrophy
      measurements and quality of life questionnaires will be evaluated.
