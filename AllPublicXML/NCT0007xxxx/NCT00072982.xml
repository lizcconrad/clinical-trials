      The object of this study is to determine whether treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with
      a combination of fish oil and borage seed oil is superior to treatment with either oil alone.
      This study will also investigate the biochemical, immunological, and molecular mechanism
      responsible for the therapeutic effects of these fatty acids. Each patient will be followed
      for eighteen months.
