  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pompe disease (also known as glycogen storage disease Type II) is caused by a deficiency of a
      critical enzyme in the body called acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Normally, GAA is used by the
      body's cells to break down glycogen (a stored form of sugar) within specialized structures
      called lysosomes. In patients with Pompe disease, an excessive amount of glycogen accumulates
      and is stored in various tissues, especially heart and skeletal muscle, which prevents their
      normal function. The objective of this protocol is to provide enzyme replacement therapy with
      rhGAA on an expanded access basis, to severely affected patients with infantile-onset Pompe
      disease for whom there is no alternative treatment and who do not meet the clinical
      characteristics described in the inclusion criteria for participation in other Genzyme
      Corporation-sponsored study currently enrolling patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient or the patient's legal guardian(s) must provide written informed consent
             prior to any study-related procedures being performed;

          -  The patient must have a diagnosis of infantile-onset Pompe disease as defined by: a)
             The patient has/had onset of symptoms compatible with Pompe disease by 12 months of
             age adjusted for gestation, if necessary. Age at onset of symptoms must be documented
             in the patient's medical record(s). AND b) The patient has documented GAA deficiency,
             i.e., below the laboratory-defined cut-off value as determined by the laboratory
             performing the GAA enzyme activity assay. Tissues used for determination of GAA
             deficiency may include blood, muscle or skin fibroblasts.

          -  Patients less than or equal to 6 months of age must have one of the following: a)
             Cardiomyopathy, defined as a LVMI determined by cross-sectional echocardiography; OR
             b) a requirement for invasive or non-invasive ventilatory support, where non-invasive
             ventilation is defined as any form of ventilatory support applied without the use of
             an endotracheal tube.

          -  Patients greater than 6 months of age must have 2 of the following: a) Cardiomyopathy,
             defined as a LVMI determined by cross-sectional echocardiography; b) a requirement for
             invasive or non-invasive ventilatory support, where non-invasive ventilation is
             defined as any form of ventilatory support applied without the use of an endotracheal
             tube; OR c) Severe motor delay, defined as failure to perform gross motor skills
             achieved by 90% of normal aged peers on the Denver Developmental Assessment;

          -  The patient or his/her legal guardian(s) must have the ability to comply with the
             clinical protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Major congenital abnormality;

          -  Clinically significant organic disease (with the exception of symptoms relating to
             infantile-onset Pompe disease), including clinically significant cardiovascular,
             hepatic, pulmonary, neurologic, or renal disease, or other medical condition, serious
             intercurrent illness, or extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would preclude participation in the study or potentially decrease
             survival.
