      The purpose of this study is to see whether individuals who access the &quot;911&quot; emergency
      medical system with a heart attack or severe chest pain will receive more timely hospital
      treatment and better outcomes if hospital clinicians are provided with earlier and more
      complete electrocardiography (ECG) information.

      This is a Phase III study. Patients will be randomized (like tossing a coin) to 1 of 2
      groups: Group 1: Patients will have pre-hospital ECG intervention. Group 2: Patients will
      have routine emergency heart care. Information will be collected about time symptoms started,
      clinical management, and other measures. All patients will be contacted by telephone 12
      months later and interviewed as to whether they experienced any cardiac symptoms.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>For 5-years, paramedics responding to 911 calls for symptoms suggestive of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) in one U.S. county transmitted an electrocardiogram (ECG) to the target emergency department (ED) for all patients meeting eligibility criteria. A central computer received the transmission and randomized to an experimental or control group.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>4,219 calls to 911 for ACS symptoms were made over the study period; 3,103 pre-hospital ECGs were transmitted by paramedics; 2,353 ECGs were successfully received by the target emergency department (ED); 794 patients consented. If patient consent was not obtained, data were not used.</pre_assignment_details>

      <desc>Due to the low-risk intervention relative to participants' serious health condition, AEs were not collected if they did not meet the criteria for SAEs or were at least possibly attributable to study procedures (none were).
Consented patients who died during the index hospitalization were reported. 786 were discharged alive.</desc>

          <description>At the start of the trial, the IRB requested every death in the pre-hospital period be reported because we put on the study electrocardiogram device in the field with waiver of consent so as not to cause a delay for patients reaching the hospital with possible heart attack. They were consented after they reached the hospital. However, IRB removed this requirement after 40 pre-consent/pre-hospital deaths were reported. The number of pre-hospital participants assessed before and after the IRB changed the reporting requirements cannot be determined from study data, but &quot;NA&quot; is not a valid entry in the &quot;At Risk&quot; field.</description>
