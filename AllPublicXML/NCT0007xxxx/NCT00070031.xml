      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as edotecarin use different ways to stop tumor
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well edotecarin works in treating women with
      locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that has not responded to previous chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of edotecarin in women with anthracycline- and
           taxane-refractory or chemoresistant locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to tumor response and duration of response in patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the clinical benefit of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive edotecarin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 31-65 patients will be accrued for this study.
