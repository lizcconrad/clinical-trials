  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to determine whether robotic-assisted gait training is
      better than standard physical therapy treatments for improving walking ability in hemiparetic
      stroke patients.

      Subjects enrolled into the study will be randomly assigned to one of 2 groups. The first
      group will receive one hour of conventional gait training, consisting of lower extremity
      strengthening exercises, stretching, and full weight bearing walking as tolerated, with
      appropriate physical assistance from a therapist. The second group will receive walking
      therapy using a Lokomat, which is a special treadmill that works in conjunction with 2
      light-weight robotic arms that assists the subject to move their legs while they try to walk
      on the treadmill. Some of the subjectâ€™s body-weight will be supported using a harness. During
      Lokomat training sessions, subjects will receive feedback of their walking performance on a
      computer monitor to help them walk. Both groups will be trained for 8-10 weeks, 3 times per
      week, for 1 hour training sessions (24 total sessions). Resources for transportation to the
      National Rehabilitation Hospital will be provided to all study participants.
