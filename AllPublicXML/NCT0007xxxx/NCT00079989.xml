  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of tigecycline in the treatment of subjects with selected
      serious infections caused by resistant gram-negative bacteria, eg, Acinetobacter baumannii,
      Enterobacter species, Klebsiella pneumoniae or other resistant gram-negative pathogens, for
      whom antibiotics have failed or who cannot tolerate other appropriate antimicrobial
      therapies. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the clinical response.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects aged 18 years or older

          -  Isolation of a resistant gram-negative pathogen, eg, Enterobacter species,
             Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or other resistant gram-negative
             pathogens, alone or as 1 isolate of a polymicrobial infection

          -  Resistant gram-negative organisms are defined by the likely presence of ESBL or
             related mechanisms which limit the therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of
             complicated infections

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with any concomitant condition or taking any concomitant medication that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, could preclude an evaluation of a response or make it
             unlikely that the contemplated course of therapy or follow-up assessment will be
             completed or that will substantially increase the risk associated with the subject's
             participation in this study

          -  Anticipated length of antibiotic therapy &lt; 7 days

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to tigecycline or other compounds related to this
             class of antibacterial agents (eg, tetracyclines, minocycline, doxycycline)
