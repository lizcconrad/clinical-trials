      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of first-line treatment using
      Niaspan (an extended release version of niacin) and statins versus other drugs that lower
      lipid levels, in subjects with elevated fat levels in their blood (dyslipidemia). Statins are
      a class of medication that is often prescribed to patients who need to lower their
      cholesterol levels.

      Name of Drugs: Niaspan (niacin extended-release tablets), Lipitor® (atorvastatin), Zocor®
      (simvastatin), Zetia™ (ezetimibe), and Crestor® (rosuvastatin)

      Study Treatment: Four open-label parallel treatment groups for 12 weeks of observation

        -  Niaspan and atorvastatin combination treatment titrated to 2000 mg and 40 mg,
           respectively;

        -  combination treatment of simvastatin titrated to 40 mg and ezetimibe maintained at 10
           mg;

        -  rosuvastatin monotherapy treatment titrated to 40 mg; and

        -  Niaspan and rosuvastatin combination treatment titrated to 1000 mg and 20 mg,
           respectively.

      Objective: To evaluate the relative efficacy of first-line therapy using the combination of
      Niaspan and atorvastatin versus the combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe versus
      rosuvastatin monotherapy versus the combination of Niaspan and rosuvastatin in patients with
      dyslipidemia.

      Population:

        -  Male or female patients 21 years of age or older

        -  Patients who are eligible for treatment based upon National Cholesterol Education
           Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) recommendations at the end of the
           Qualification period;

        -  All patients must have mean triglycerides (TG) ≤ 300 mg/dL.

      Design: A Phase IV, 12-week, randomized, multi-center, open-label, four-arm, parallel-group
      study evaluating the efficacy of Niaspan and statin therapy versus other lipid-modifying
      therapies preceded by a four-week washout of any previous lipid-lowering therapy.

        All of the following criteria must be answered “Yes”:

             study;

          2. Patient has read, signed, and agreed to the items listed in the informed consent form
             and HIPAA authorization form prior to the initiation of any study procedures and/or
             discontinuing any medications;

          3. Patient is eligible for treatment following the drug washout period based upon the
             NCEP ATP III entry criteria and the LDL-C variability ≤ 15%;

          4. Patient has mean triglyceride level (TG) ≤ 300 mg/dL;

          5. Patient is willing to withdraw from any current anti-dyslipidemic medications or other
             prohibited medication for approximately 6 weeks prior to randomization (4 weeks prior
             to qualification visits) and for the duration of the study;

          6. If the patient is female, the patient must not be pregnant or breast-feeding and not
