      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as 3-AP and gemcitabine, work in different ways
      to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. 3-AP may help gemcitabine kill
      more tumor cells by making them more sensitive to the drug.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving 3-AP together with gemcitabine works
      in treating patients with recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of 3-AP (Triapine®) and gemcitabine, in terms of
           complete and partial response and 6-month progression-free disease, in patients with
           recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the objective response rates, median survival, 1-year survival rate, duration
           of response or stable disease, and progression-free survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive 3-AP (Triapine®) IV over 2 hours and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days
      1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete or partial response
      receive an additional 2 courses of therapy beyond response.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 7-13
      months.
