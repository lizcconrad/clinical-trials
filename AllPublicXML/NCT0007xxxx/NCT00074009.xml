      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary
      for their growth.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bortezomib in treating patients who
      have unresectable or metastatic gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of bortezomib in patients with unresectable or metastatic gastric
           or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine possible predictors of response to this drug, using pretreatment tumor
           immunohistochemistry, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every
      3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-33 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-12
      months.
