  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether the combination of the drugs daclizumab and sirolimus can
      effectively treat adults with uveitis, an eye inflammation. Daclizumab is a monoclonal
      antibody that is designed to prevent a specific chemical interaction needed for immune cells
      called lymphocytes to produce inflammation. Sirolimus is an immune-suppressing drug that also
      controls lymphocyte activity and is marketed to prevent organ rejection in kidney
      transplants.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with non-infectious uveitis in one or both eyes who are
      being treated with daclizumab and have not had a relapse or disease flare for 6 months before
      entering this trial may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical
      history and physical examination, blood tests, complete eye examination, and pregnancy test
      for women who can have children. Women of child-bearing potential who enroll in this study
      will have a pregnancy test every 12 weeks.

      After enrollment, participants have the following additional exams:

        -  Fluorescein angiography: This test is done to check for abnormalities of eye blood
           vessels. A yellow dye is injected into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in
           the eyes. Pictures of the retina are taken with a special camera that flashes a blue
           light into the eye. The pictures show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the
           retina, indicating possible abnormalities. This test is done at enrollment and after 1
           year, unless additional tests are needed for medical management.

        -  Pelvic ultrasound and urine test: These tests are done at enrollment and after 1 year to
           check the kidneys, lymph nodes, and pelvic area.

        -  Blood tests: Blood tests are done at enrollment and every 3 to 6 months for laboratory
           and immunology study

      Patients receive daclizumab subcutaneously (under the skin) or in infusions at regularly
      scheduled visits for 52 weeks. At each treatment, blood pressure, pulse, breathing rate, and
      temperature are monitored. After the first 52 weeks, patients whose disease remains quiet
      increase the time between injections to 6 weeks and then to 8 weeks. Patients who are doing
      well at this time may stop daclizumab.

      One or 2 days after the first daclizumab treatment, patients receive 6 mg of sirolimus by
      mouth. Their blood pressure, pulse, breathing rate, and temperature are monitored for at
      least 60 minutes. Two days after the first dose, patients begin 2-mg maintenance doses every
      other day for 2 weeks. If there are no intolerable side effects, the dose is increased to 2
      mg daily for the next 2 weeks. Patients who have no intolerable side effects at that dose
      continue the medication for another 4 weeks. Patients who experience intolerable side effects
      may decrease the medication to every other day or withdraw from the study. After week 78 of
      the study, if the daclizumab treatments are stopped, the sirolimus dose is reduced within 8
      weeks and may eventually be discontinued if the patient continues to do well.

      Patients who experience any of the following will leave the study:

        -  Inflammation flare that requires concomitant treatment with additional systemic
           immunosuppressive medications, such as prednisone or cyclosporine

        -  Disease flares more than twice in the first year

        -  Any disease flares in the second year

      We propose to investigate the possible efficacy of combination daclizumab and sirolimus
      therapy to induce peripheral immune tolerance in participants presenting with non-infectious
      intermediate and posterior uveitis. This will be performed using a Phase I/II pilot study.
      Subjects on daclizumab monotherapy will receive a 6 mg loading dose of oral sirolimus at week
      0, followed by a 2 mg dose every other day for 2 weeks. If tolerated, the subject will be
      increased to a 2 mg daily dose. After one year of combination therapy, the subject will be
      tapered off daclizumab first and then sirolimus. The primary outcome will be the ability of
      the participant to be successfully tapered off daclizumab and sirolimus while their disease
      remains quiet (vitreous haze less than or equal to Trace) for 24 weeks on no systemic
      immunosuppressive medications (approximately week 134).
