  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder in which the body recognizes
      certain normal components of blood and/or cell membranes as foreign substances and produces
      antibodies against them. Patients with these antibodies may experience miscarriages and blood
      clotting disorders, including heart attacks and strokes. APS may occur in people with
      systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases, or in otherwise healthy
      individuals.

      The Antiphospholipid Syndrome Collaborative Registry (APSCORE) is a national registry and
      tissue repository for patients with APS. This registry will collect clinical information and
      blood samples from people with APS.

    <textblock>
      Registry participants will have a blood sample drawn and will be interviewed about their
      medical histories. Participants will be asked to return for a follow-up visit after two
      years. Clinical, demographic, and laboratory data will be collected. Registry resources will
      be made available to researchers and medical practitioners to support a broad range of
      research on the causes, diagnosis, mechanisms, and treatment of APS.

      The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is the coordinating center and an enrollment
      site for the registry. There are seven other enrollment sites: Ball Memorial Hospital,
      Muncie, IN; Duke University, Durham, NC; Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY; Johns
      Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD; Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA; University of
      Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX; and University of Utah Health Science Center,
      Salt Lake City, UT.
