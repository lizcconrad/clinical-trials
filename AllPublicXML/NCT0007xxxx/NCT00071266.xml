      The purpose of this study is to compare the dose response and safety of Niacin ER/Lovastatin,
      Niaspan® and Lovastatin with each other, in subjects with leg pain caused by a narrowing of
      their leg arteries.

      At least 870 subjects, with leg pain caused by a narrowing of their leg arteries will take
      part in this study.

      Both Niaspan and lovastatin (Mevacor®) are approved by the United States Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) to treat high cholesterol. Niacin ER/Lovastatin (Advicor®), a
      combination of these two drugs, is also approved by the FDA to treat high cholesterol. The
      use of Niacin ER/Lovastatin to treat narrowing of leg arteries and relieve “intermittent
      claudication” (leg pain caused by narrowing of the arteries in the leg) is considered
      investigational. An investigational use is one that is not approved by the FDA.

      This is a Phase 3, 32-week, double-blind, diet-intervention, randomized, parallel group,
      ten-arm, multi-center, multi-national, dose titration study evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of NL in patients with intermittent claudication (IC).

      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NL in patients with
      IC. The primary efficacy analysis will be the percent change from baseline in Peak Walking
      Time (PWT) calculated from the natural logarithm of the ratio of the time walked on treadmill
      at the Week 32 Visit divided by the time walked at baseline. Other efficacy measures will
      include Claudication Onset Time (COT) percent changes from baseline to Week 32 , changes in
      Ankle Brachial Index (ABI), Quality of Life (QoL) percent changes at Weeks 20 and 32, lower
      limb amputations, composite of cardiovascular events (MI, stroke, and vascular death), and
      coronary and peripheral artery revascularizations. Safety variables will include serum
      transaminases, routine chemistry parameters, hematology, and adverse events. Pharmacokinetic
      analyses will be conducted as well.
