  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A series of allergy shots may reduce symptoms of seasonal ragweed allergies. This study will
      determine whether taking a drug called omalizumab (also known as Xolair) before getting the
      allergy shots is more effective than allergy shots alone or other treatments, such as
      prescription antihistamines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis affects 20 to 40 million Americans annually. Allergy symptoms, which can
      range from mild to seriously debilitating, may affect quality of life. Left untreated,
      allergic rhinitis can exacerbate or trigger more serious conditions, such as asthma and sinus
      inflammation.

      Individuals with allergies react to harmless particles such as dust or pollen. Proteins in
      the blood called IgE antibodies treat the harmless particles as invaders and trigger an
      immune system response. The immune response results in harmful inflammation of healthy
      tissues. In ragweed allergy, inflammation occurs in the airways and causes familiar allergy
      symptoms like sneezing, coughing, and general discomfort.

      Omalizumab is an investigational drug that has been shown to block the effects of IgE
      antibodies. The blocking effect of omalizumab is temporary, but giving the drug to people
      before their regular allergy shots may make the shots more effective.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive injections of omalizumab or a
      placebo before an accelerated course of allergy shots (given over 12 weeks). The participants
      will return for follow-up for up to one year, and they may have as many as 27 study visits.

    <measure>Average daily allergy severity score</measure>
    <time_frame>2003 ragweed pollen season</time_frame>
    <description>The average daily allergy severity score will be calculated from participants' 5 symptom scores (sneezing; rhinorrhea/runny nose; itchy nose, throat, and palate; itchy, watery eyes; and nasal congestion/stuffiness) during the ragweed pollen season. Symptom scores are recorded twice daily (AM and PM). The sum of the individual symptom scores will be averaged over AM and PM to give a daily score. Each daily score will then be averaged to obtain one measure of the average daily allergy severity score for each participant. The ragweed pollen season begins when the ragweed pollen counts rise to 10 ragweed pollen grains/m3/24 hours or above on two consecutive recorded days, and the ragweed pollen season ends when the ragweed pollen counts fall below 10 ragweed pollen grains/m3/24 hours on two consecutive recorded days. The ragweed pollen season is from approximately August 15, 2003 to October 1, 2003, but varies among the sites.</description>
