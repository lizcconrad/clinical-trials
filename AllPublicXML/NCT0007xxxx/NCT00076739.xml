      This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine which areas of the brain are
      involved in performing certain cognitive tasks. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio
      waves to produce images of body tissues and organs that provide information about structure
      and function of tissues.

      Healthy normal volunteers between 21 and 40 years of age may be eligible for this study.
      Candidates must be native English speakers and must be right-handed. They must have no
      history of nervous system disease or psychiatric disorder. Candidates are screened with
      questionnaires and a neurological examination.

      Participants undergo functional MRI scanning. For this procedure, the subject lies on a
      stretcher that moves into the scanner - a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic
      field. During the scan, he or she is asked to make various decisions about whether words are
      related or not. Two words are presented visually, separated by a variable time delay. The
      subject reads both words, decides as quickly and accurately as possible whether the two words
      are related or not, and indicates the answer by pressing a button. The test takes about 2
      hours. When it is completed, the subject completes a written questionnaire concerning his or
      her experience in the scanner.

      Objective. The purpose of the protocol is to extend the structured event complex (SEC) model
      developed by the principal investigator. Grafman (Grafman, 1995) proposed that action
      sequences are represented in form of SECs in the human prefrontal cortex (PFC). An SEC is a
      goal-oriented set of events that is sequentially structured and represents thematic
      knowledge, morals, abstractions, concepts, social rules, event features, event boundaries,
      and grammars. There are both temporal and semantic associative relations between
      subcomponents of SEC knowledge. We will investigate hypotheses regarding the role of
      different regions within the PFC in processing associative relations. We will also
      investigate how SECs differing in psychological dimensions such as temporal duration,
      complexity, and familiarity are represented and activated in the PFC. We will further examine
      the temporal and semantic organization of SEC subcomponents by investigating how the goal and
      outcome structure of event knowledge is represented and activated in the PFC. Further, we
      will investigate how the temporal location of events within SECs are represented and
      activated in the PFC. We will also investigate how goals and outcomes specifying the temporal
      order and duration of SEC subcomponents are processed within the PFC. Additional objectives
      are to (1) investigate the neural representation of human emotions and decision-making based
      on utility estimation; (2) investigate the relationships between cognitive and neural
      substrates of moral emotions and judgment (Moll et al., 2002a; Moll et al., 2002b) with those
      of the SEC model developed by the principal investigator (Grafman, 1995); and (3) probe a new
      construct of cognitive dimensions incorporating critical explanatory variables in social
      cognition such as moral emotions and social event knowledge.

      Study Population. In nineteen separate studies, healthy, normal adult volunteers will
      participate in experiments dealing with different kinds of associative relations in SECs
      using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

      Design. The experiments we are conducting will employ within-subject, rapid event-related
      fMRI designs to determine whether different types of SEC associative and other types of
      relations are stored in dissociable networks in the PFC. In nineteen experiments; we hope to
      automatically activate lexical, event-based and temporally-based associative and other types
      of relations in SECs.

      Outcome Measures. The data collected will consist of accuracy and response time measures of
      cognitive performance reflecting automatic priming of associative relations and fMRI
      activation images corresponding to each kind of associative relation, and accuracy and
      response time measures of cognitive performance reflecting how temporal duration, complexity,
      and familiarity are represented and activated. Experiments 10 and 11 will also record
      donation choices made by the subjects. The results gained from this protocol will provide
      further evidence for modifying, supporting, or rejecting aspects of the SEC model, and will
      provide further evidence for modifying, supporting, or rejecting aspects of a framework of
      social cognition such as moral behavior and social event knowledge.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        In all the studies, subjects will consist of healthy, native English-speaking, right-handed
        volunteers, as measured by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory.

        Subjects will range in age from 21 to 40 years old and they will be included regardless of
        race or gender.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Non-native English speakers and non-right handers will be excluded as mentioned above, as
        will non-neurologically normal volunteers.

        Subjects younger than 21 and older than 40 will be excluded.

        A pregnancy test will be employed with all women of childbearing age. The results must be
        negative in order to proceed with the MRI.

        Subjects with any of the following: aneurysm clip; implanted neural stimulator; implanted
        cardiac pacemaker or auto-defibrillator; cochlear implant; ocular foreign body, e.g. metal
        shavings; permanent eyeliner; insulin pump; or irremovable body piercing will be excluded
        from the study due to the possible dangerous effects of the magnet upon metal objects in
        the body.

        Subjects taking central nervous system active medications will be excluded.
