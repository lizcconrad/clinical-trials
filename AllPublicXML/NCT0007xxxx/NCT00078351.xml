      This study will examine the effectiveness of injected hylan (Synvisc) for treating pain
      associated with osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joint (jaw joint) and improving
      function of the joint. Hylan is a synthetic product very similar to a component of normal
      healthy joint fluid (synovial fluid), which is present in much lower quantities and is
      abnormal in osteoarthritis. Hylan injections have been beneficial in treating osteoarthritis
      of the knee.

      Patients with temporomandibular (TMJ) joint pain of at least 3 months duration who have mouth
      opening limitation and moderate to severe joint pain made worse by joint movement may be
      eligible for this study. Patients must not have any TMJ growth disturbances and must not have
      had any TMJ surgery for 6 months before entering the study. Candidates are screened with
      questionnaires, a medical history, and a physical examination of the TMJs, including x-rays
      and magnetic resonance imaging.

      Participants are randomly assigned to receive three injections, each a week apart, of either
      Synvisc or placebo (a salt-water solution) into the affected joint. Before the first
      injection, a sample of synovial fluid is collected from the joint by needle aspiration for
      laboratory analysis. Patients return for follow-up visits 3, 6, and 12 months after the last
      treatment for a clinical examination of the jaw joint and review of jaw joint symptoms. A
      second aspiration is requested at the 3-month visit, but is not mandatory. All injections and
      aspirations are done after anesthetizing the overlying skin and joint capsule to minimize
      pain or discomfort. Participants record their daily use of pain relief medication throughout
      the study.

      The proposed clinical trial will evaluate the effects of high molecular weight hylan
      (Synvisc) injection in comparison with control treatment (saline injection) for
      osteoarthritis (OA) affecting the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Patients with TMJ OA of at
      least three-month duration and who have not responded to conservative treatments will be
      included. Patients will be randomly assigned to either high molecular hylan injection or
      control. At baseline and follow up visits, clinical outcome measures will be assessed such as
      pain and range of motion. Positive findings in clinical outcome measures will provide
      evidence for the clinical utility of Synvisc in patients with painful TMJ OA. In addition to
      clinical outcome measures, a sample of synovial fluid from the affected joint will be
      obtained at the baseline visit and at 12 week follow up, and levels of tumor necrosis factor
      alpha (TNF alpha), Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase
      (TIMP) will be analyzed. By studying the synovial fluid levels of TNF alpha, MMP and TIMP, we
      will assess the effects of viscosupplementation with Synvisc on the local inflammatory
      process and proteolytic activity in TMJ OA in comparison with control treatment. Positive
      findings in clinical symptoms and synovial fluid analysis will also provide implications of
      clinical utility of Synvisc in patients with painful TMJ OA. Furthermore, this analysis of
      synovial fluid may identify biomarkers associated with OA affecting the TMJ.

        INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        We will recruit patients with TMJ OA defined by the Research Diagnostic Criteria. Patients
        are required to have chronic preauricular pain for more than 3 months, even though they
        have received some palliative treatment (NSAIDs and/or stabilization splint therapy).
        Radiological imaging is indicated in addition to clinical evaluation to confirm the
        diagnosis of TMJ OA. Radiographic evidence of OA includes flattening of condyle, increased
        opacity of cortical bone of condyle, or osteophyte formation. Prior to being admitted to
        the study, patients will be screened with standard temporomandibular joint radiological
        imaging, including panoramic, tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies.
        Radiological imaging will not be repeated at the end of the study unless medically
        indicated. The patients are required to have mouth opening limitation (less than normal)
        and moderate to severe joint pain aggravated by jaw movement. Patients who have undergone
        any TMJ surgery within the preceding 6 months will be excluded, as well as those who have
        taken analgesic, anti-inflammatory, steroids or narcotic medications during the last 15
        days. Further exclusion criteria will be patients who have any TMJ growth disturbances.
        Patients with red, hot, swollen, tender TMJ, or those with history consist of infectious
        arthritis, crystal induced arthropathies, and musculoskeletal disorders will also be
        excluded. Patients with rheumatic disease will also be excluded, this will be determined by
        baseline blood tests (CBC, chem. 7, ESR, Rheumatoid factor).

        Patients will be screened for any positive history of liver or kidney dysfunctions. Any
        patients with a medical history of diabetes, congestive heart failure, any chronic
        infections will also be excluded. Subjects that have primary psychiatric disease or score
        above average in comparison with normative scores on Symptom Checklist (SCL-90R) will not
        be able to participate. Pregnant women will not be included in the study, this will be
        determined by a pregnancy test, and subjects will be required to use 2 forms of
        contraception for the first 3 weeks of the study (to cover the synvisc injections). It is a
        standard practice in chronic pain study not to include patients who are involved in
        litigation. Patients with sepsis or with known hypersensitivity to hyaluronan and any of
        its components will be excluded to the study.
