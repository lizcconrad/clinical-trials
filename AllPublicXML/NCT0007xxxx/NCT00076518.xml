  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of fish oil supplements combined
      with the drug fenofibrate in treating elevated triglyceride levels in people taking anti-HIV
      drugs. The participants in this study will have shown no response to fish oil supplements or
      fenofibrate alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has decreased the morbidity and
      mortality caused by HIV infection, its use has been associated with lipid abnormalities,
      particularly elevations in serum triglycerides. Hypertriglyceridemia is a risk factor in the
      development of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease as well as pancreatitis.
      Lipid-lowering drugs called fibrates have been part of the recommended treatment for elevated
      triglycerides, but the response to fibrates is incomplete in a large proportion of people.
      Fish oil capsules containing large amounts of omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to decrease
      serum triglycerides. However, fish oil supplements or fibrates alone are often inadequate for
      treating hypertriglyceridemia in people taking HAART. This study will determine whether the
      combination of the two therapies will lower serum triglycerides in people on HAART more
      effectively than either therapy alone.

      This study comprises two steps. In Step I, participants will be randomly assigned to receive
      either fish oil supplements or fenofibrate. Participants will be evaluated for treatment
      response at Week 8. Those who have responded to their treatment will remain on their original
      single agent therapy through Week 18. Those who have not responded to treatment at Week 10
      will move on to Step 2 and begin combination therapy with both fenofibrate and fish oil until
      Week 18. All participants will return at Week 22 for a follow-up visit. Except at the Week 10
      visit, participants will be expected to fast prior to all study visits. Participants will
      remain on their individual HAART regimens for the duration of the study.
