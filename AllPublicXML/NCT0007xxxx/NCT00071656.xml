  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and implement a treatment that focuses on behaviors
      to reduce symptom severity and functional impairment in patients with Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly Inattentive Type (ADHD-I). The long-term goal of this
      study is to apply the treatment to larger-scale trials to determine its effectiveness and
      generalizability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ADHD-I is a highly prevalent and serious childhood disorder that affects academic and social
      development. The symptoms of ADHD-I differ from those of the well-studied ADHD Combined Type.
      Unfortunately, studies of psychosocial interventions for ADHD-I are currently unavailable.
      Effective treatments for ADHD-I are still needed.

      Participants are randomly assigned to receive either a behavioral intervention or treatment
      as usual for 10 to 12 weeks. The behavioral intervention includes parent and child skill
      development groups, family meetings, and consultation with the child's teacher to address
      attention problems and areas of impairment at home and school. Parent and child interviews,
      teacher and child ratings, and psychoeducational testing are used to assess participants.
      Participants are assessed post-treatment and at a 2-month follow-up visit.
