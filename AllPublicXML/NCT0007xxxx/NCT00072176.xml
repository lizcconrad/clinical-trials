  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well temsirolimus works in treating patients with endometrial
      cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or has spread from where it started to
      nearby tissue or lymph nodes and has come back after a period of time during which the cancer
      could not be detected. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy (response rate &amp; duration of stable disease) of CCI-779
      (temsirolimus) given intravenously (IV) weekly in patients with metastatic and/or locally
      advanced recurrent carcinoma of the endometrium.

      II. To assess the adverse events, time to progression and response duration of CCI-779 given
      IV weekly in patients with metastatic and/or locally advanced recurrent carcinoma of the
      endometrium.

      III. To correlate objective tumor response with phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN)
      expression in the tumor tissue obtained at diagnosis (primary tumor).

      IV. To explore the relationship between objective tumor response with other molecular
      measures in diagnostic tumor tissue.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 3
      months.

             indicate in writing to the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group
             (NCIC CTG) Study Coordinator that such clearance has been obtained, before the trial
             can commence in that centre; because of differing requirements, a standard consent

             patients enrolled on this trial will have had a prior hysterectomy or pelvic
             irradiation; however, if the patient is of childbearing potential, a urine beta-human
             chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) must be proved negative within 7 days prior to
             registration; women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately

          -  Patients with known brain metastases; (a head CT is not necessary to rule out brain

             according to the protocol including, but not limited to:

               -  History of significant neurologic or psychiatric disorder which would impair the
                  ability to obtain consent or limit compliance with study requirements

               -  Active uncontrolled infection

               -  Active peptic ulcer disease
