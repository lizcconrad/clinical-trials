    <textblock>
      To investigate safety and antitumor activity of SGN-30 in patients with Hodgkin's Disease and
      anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL).

      As of March 22, 2005, interim analysis of the Hodgkin's Disease (HD) arm has been completed
      per the statistical plan in the protocol. SG030-0003 is now closed to further recruitment of
      HD patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SGN-30 is the chimeric form of a novel murine monoclonal antibody (mAb), AC-10, that has
      specificity for CD30. The CD30 antigen has a very low expression on normal cells, but is
      expressed on malignant cells in Hodgkins disease and anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

      This study is designed to define the toxicity profile and antitumor activity of SGN-30 in
      patients with refractory or recurrent Hodgkin's disease and with refractory or recurrent
      anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Patients will receive 6 weekly intravenous (IV) infusions of
      SGN-30 followed by a 4 week observation period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have refractory or recurrent HD or refractory or recurrent ALCL.

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed CD30+ HD or ALCL.

          -  Patients must have bidimensional measurable disease on physical examination or
             radiologic evaluation.

          -  Patients must have failed systemic chemotherapy either as initial therapy for advanced
             disease or as salvage therapy after initial radiotherapy for early stage disease.

          -  Patients may have received no more than four treatments (radiation, chemotherapy,
             and/or biologics) prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients may have received no more than one stem cell transplantation.

          -  Patients who have undergone stem cell transplantation must have received at least one
             therapy post-transplantation. Patients who have not had stem cell transplantation must
             be considered ineligible or refuse treatment by stem cell transplantation.

          -  Patients must have completed radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy at least four weeks
             prior to enrollment. Any prior treatment with nitrogen mustard agents, melphalan, or
             BCNU must have been completed at least six weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients who have been treated previously with any anti-CD30 antibody

          -  Patients who have received any mAb unless a recent serum testing reveals no antibody

             antibodies (HACA) in the peripheral circulation

             enrollment or any other investigational agent within four weeks of enrollment

          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to recombinant proteins or any excipient
             contained in the drug formulation

          -  Patients with a history of other malignancies during the past five years with the
             exception of adequately treated basal or squamous cell skin cancer or cervical
             carcinoma in situ

          -  Patients with known active viral, bacterial, or systemic fungal infection; patients
             who are known to be HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C positive.

          -  Patients with symptomatic cardiac disease including ventricular dysfunction, coronary
             artery disease, or arrhythmias

          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastases requiring treatment

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Patients with any serious underlying medical condition that would impair their ability
             to receive or tolerate the planned treatment

          -  Patients with dementia or altered mental status that would preclude understanding and
             rendering of informed consent
