      This study will examine communication and trust between patients in the kidney transplant
      process and their health care providers. It will assess patients' perception of trust in
      their physician and nurse coordinator; determine the patients' level of trust in the areas of
      competence, compassion, control, communication, and confidentiality; and determine how the
      trust level varies as patients progress in the transplant process.

      Patients 18 years of age and older who are in various stages of the kidney transplant process
      at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the NIH Clinical Center may be eligible for this
      study. Candidates include individuals who:

        -  are on dialysis but not on a transplant waiting list

        -  are on the organ waiting list and are also on dialysis

        -  are on the organ waiting list but are not on dialysis

        -  have had a kidney transplant within the last year.

      Participants will be interviewed by someone who is not their direct health care provider
      about the doctor/patient, primary provider/patient, or nurse/patient relationship, their
      health history, medical condition, and ideas about their care. With the patient's permission,
      parts of the interview will be tape-recorded. The interview will take about 30 to 40 minutes.

      Health disparities related to the provision of, and access to, healthcare in the United
      States are well documented across racial and ethnic groups. One area of particular interest
      to health disparities researchers has been solid organ transplantation. Both provider and
      patient behaviors are implicated as contributing to ethnic variance of medical care in kidney
      transplantation. This pilot study will explore the perceptions of trust among patients in the
      kidney transplant process at the Warren Magnuson Clinical Center at the National Institutes
      of Health and at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. For sampling purposes the transplant
      process is defined as 1) patients currently on dialysis; 2) patients on the transplantation
      waiting list receiving dialysis; 3) patients on the transplantation waiting list not
      receiving dialysis; 4) patients newly transplanted (less than or equal to one year since
      transplantation) and 5) patients transplanted for greater than one year. Five dimensions
      contributing to trust have been identified in the literature: competence, compassion,
      control, communication and confidentiality. Face-to-face interviews to explore these five
      dimensions will include questions regarding demographic variables, the Trust in Physician
      Scale; the Trust in Nurse Scale, and the Patient Trust Scale. Results will be analyzed using
      descriptive statistics, Chi-square for categorical comparison of means and multivariate
      analysis for differences between groups.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The investigators will interview a cohort of patients from Walter Reed Army Medical Center
        and the NIDDK intramural program in various stages of the transplant process. The stages
        are divided into the following categories:

          1. individuals on dialysis but not on a waiting list

          2. individuals on the organ waiting list who are also on dialysis

          3. individuals on the organ waiting list but not on dialysis

          4. individuals who have had a kidney transplant within the last year

          5. individuals who have had a kidney transplant greater than one year

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients less than 18 years old will not be included in this study. The interview
             questions and responses to the instruments may be inappropriate for children.

          2. All other exclusions are as stated in the NIDDK and WRAMC parent protocols.
