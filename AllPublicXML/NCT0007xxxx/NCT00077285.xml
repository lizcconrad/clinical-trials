      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan and carboplatin, work in different
      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving more than one drug
      may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving irinotecan together with carboplatin
      as upfront window therapy (first-line therapy) works in treating patients with newly
      diagnosed intermediate-risk or high-risk rhabdomyosarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with newly diagnosed intermediate- or high-risk
           rhabdomyosarcoma treated with upfront window therapy comprising irinotecan and
           carboplatin.

        -  Determine the acute toxic effects of this regimen combined with radiotherapy in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the rate of local control achieved in patients treated with this regimen in
           combination with intensity-modulated radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of administering maintenance therapy comprising
           irinotecan to patients with high-risk rhabdomyosarcoma treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate, preliminarily, in vitro measurements of angiogenesis with clinical features
           (extent of disease), response to therapy, and outcome in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of improved outcomes,
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

        -  Courses 1 and 2: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and irinotecan IV
           over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a total of 2
           courses.

        -  Courses 3-5: Patients receive vincristine IV on days 1, 8, and 15; dexrazoxane IV over
           15-30 minutes, doxorubicin IV over 15-30 minutes, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on
           days 1 and 2; and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily beginning on
           approximately day 3 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every
           21 days for a total of 3 courses.

      Some patients may undergo surgical resection of the tumor after completion of course 5. After
      course 5, patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 4-5.5 weeks.

        -  Courses 6 and 7*: Patients receive vincristine IV and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day
           1; irinotecan IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 8-12; and G-CSF SC once daily beginning on
           approximately day 13 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every
           21 days for a total of 2 courses.

      NOTE: *Patients who develop disease progression during courses 1 or 2 do not receive further
      irinotecan and carboplatin. Instead, patients receive ifosfamide and etoposide as in courses
      8 and 9.

        -  Courses 8 and 9: Patients receive vincristine IV on day 1; etoposide IV over 1 hour and
           ifosfamide IV over 2 hours on days 1-5; and G-CSF SC once daily beginning on
           approximately day 6 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every
           21 days for a total of 2 courses.

        -  Course 10: Patients receive vincristine IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43;
           dexrazoxane IV over 15-30 minutes, doxorubicin IV over 15-30 minutes, and
           cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 2; and filgrastim SC beginning on
           approximately day 3 and continuing until blood counts recover (1 course).

        -  Course 11 and 12: Patients receive etoposide IV over 1 hour and ifosfamide IV over 2
           hours on days 1-5 and G-CSF SC once daily beginning on approximately day 6 and
           continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a total of 2
           courses.

      Patients with high-risk disease proceed to maintenance therapy.

        -  Maintenance therapy*: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 8-12.
           Treatment repeats every 21 days for a total of 6 courses.

      NOTE: *Patients who develop disease progression during courses 1 or 2 do not receive further
      irinotecan.

      In all courses, treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression or recurrence after initial response.

      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1
      year, and then annually thereafter.

      *Starting with A(8), patients will undergo PET Scans instead of Bone Scans, at the discretion
      of the PI.
