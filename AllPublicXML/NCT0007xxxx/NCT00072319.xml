      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel,
      use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving
      chemotherapy drugs before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it can be removed during
      surgery. Giving chemotherapy drugs after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Pilot trial to study the effectiveness of neoadjuvant or adjuvant epirubicin,
      cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel in treating women who have stage I, stage II, or stage III
      breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the feasibility and safety of neoadjuvant or adjuvant epirubicin,
           cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel, in terms of the absence of any grade 3 or higher
           toxicity (aside from alopecia), in women with high-risk stage I-III breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

        -  Neoadjuvant or adjuvant EC therapy: Patients receive epirubicin IV over 3-5 minutes and
           cyclophosphamide IV (EC) on day 1 and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days 2-9 or
           10. Treatment repeats every 10-11 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Neoadjuvant or adjuvant paclitaxel therapy: After the completion of EC therapy, patients
           receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Patients also receive G-CSF as in EC
           therapy. Treatment repeats every 10-11 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients who have not had prior surgery undergo definitive surgery after the completion of
      chemotherapy. Patients also may receive adjuvant radiotherapy and/or hormonal therapy at the
      discretion of the treating physician.

      Patients are followed every 4 months for 3 years and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 11-38 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
