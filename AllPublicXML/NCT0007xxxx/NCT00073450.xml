  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of an oral Farnesyl Protein
      Transferase Inhibitor (Lonafarnib/SCH 6636) as a single agent in Adult Patients With Squamous
      Cell Carcinoma of the Head &amp; Neck and will help determine if further development is
      justified.
