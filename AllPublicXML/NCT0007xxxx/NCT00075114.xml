      The purpose of this study is to determine the capacity of self-efficacy to predict
      maintaining a behavior change at four years post urinary control intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study that will monitor and compare attitudes and strategies that women use to
      maintain behavior changes that prevent urination problems. Women will complete
      questionnaires, do muscle strength exercises, and bladder training at 3 months, one year, and
      4 years post intervention.
