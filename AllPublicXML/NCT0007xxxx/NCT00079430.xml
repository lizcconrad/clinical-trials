    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of adjuvant intraperitoneal
      carboplatin when given together with paclitaxel and bevacizumab in treating patients who have
      undergone debulking surgery for stage II , stage III, or stage IV ovarian epithelial, primary
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and
      paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways.
      Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help
      kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether carboplatin,
      paclitaxel, and bevacizumab are more effective than carboplatin and paclitaxel in treating
      ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intraperitoneal carboplatin when administered with
      paclitaxel during course 1, in patients with stage II-IV ovarian epithelial, primary
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who had initial debulking surgery.

      II. Determine the feasibility of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the
      feasibility of adding IV bevacizumab to this regimen in courses 2-6.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients. II. Determine the
      toxicity profile of paclitaxel and bevacizumab IV in combination with intraperitoneal
      carboplatin in these patients.

      III. Determine the response rate (in patients with measurable disease who are in the expanded
      cohort) and progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of intraperitoneal carboplatin.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by intraperitoneal carboplatin over 15
      minutes on day 1 in course 1. Beginning in course 2, patients also receive bevacizumab IV
      over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of carboplatin until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional
      20-40 patients are treated at that dose level.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.
