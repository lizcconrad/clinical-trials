  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether treatment with Armodafinil
      (CEP-10953) is more effective than placebo treatment for patients with residual excessive
      sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) by measuring
      mean sleep latency from the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) (30 minute version)
      (average of 4 naps at 0900, 1100, 1300, and 1500) and by Clinical Global Impression of Change
      (CGI C) ratings (as related to general condition) at week 12 (or last postbaseline visit).

    <description>The Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) is an objective assessment of sleepiness that measures the ability of a subject to remain awake. Long latencies to sleep are indicative of a patient's ability to remain awake. The change from baseline in the mean sleep latency from the MWT (average of 4 tests at 0900, 1100, 1300, and 1500) was analyzed at weeks 4, 8, and 12. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from the baseline assessment in MWT sleep latency as assessed at week 12 (or last post-baseline visit).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Had at Least Minimal Improvement in CGI-C Ratings at Week 12 or Last Post-baseline Visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks or last post-baseline visit</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants who had at least minimal improvement in CGI-C ratings at Week 12 or last post-baseline visit. The CGI-C uses the following categories and scoring assignments: 1=Very much improved; 2=Much improved; 3=Minimally improved; 4=No change; 5=Minimally worse; 6=Much worse; and 7=Very much worse. Severity of illness was assessed at baseline by the CGI-S, which consists of the following categories: 1=Normal (shows no signs of illness); 2=Borderline ill; 3=Mildly (Slightly) ill; 4=Moderately ill; 5=Markedly ill; 6=Severely ill; and 7=Among the most extremely ill patients.</description>

        Diagnosis and Criteria for Inclusion: Patients are included in the study if all of the
        following criteria are met:

          1. Written informed consent is obtained.

          2. The patient is an outpatient, man or woman of any ethnic origin, 18 to 65 years of age
             (inclusive).

          3. The patient has a complaint of excessive sleepiness despite nCPAP therapy being
             effective and being a regular user of nCPAP therapy.

          4. The patient has a current diagnosis of OSAHS according to International Classification
             of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) criteria.

          5. The patient meets the following nCPAP therapy requirements:

               -  Adequate education and intervention efforts to encourage nCPAP therapy use must
                  be documented.

               -  A patient's nCPAP therapy regimen must be stable for at least 4 weeks.

               -  nCPAP therapy is shown to be effective, with effectiveness defined as having an
                  apnea hypopnea index (AHI) of 10 or less during nocturnal PSG, and, in the
                  opinion of the investigator, nCPAP is effective therapy.

               -  Following demonstration of effectiveness, evidence of regular nCPAP usage must be
                  shown during a 2 week evaluation period (ie, nCPAP usage for at least 4
                  hours/night on at least 70% of the nights).

          6. The patient is in good health as determined by a medical and psychiatric history,
             physical examination, ECG, and serum chemistry and hematology.

          7. Women must be surgically sterile, 2 years postmenopausal, or, if of child bearing
             potential, using a medically accepted method of birth control (ie, barrier method with
             spermicide, steroidal contraceptive [oral, implanted, and Depo Provera contraceptives
             must be used in conjunction with a barrier method], or intrauterine device [IUD]) and
             agree to continued use of this method for the duration of the study.

          8. The patient has a Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Illness (CGI S) rating of
             4 or more.

          9. The patient has an ESS score of 10 or more.

         10. The patient does not have any medical or psychiatric disorders that could account for
             the excessive sleepiness.

         11. The patient is able to complete self rating scales and computer based testing.

         12. The patient is willing and able to comply with study restrictions and to attend

        <title>Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT)</title>
        <description>The Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) is an objective assessment of sleepiness that measures the ability of a subject to remain awake. Long latencies to sleep are indicative of a patient’s ability to remain awake. The change from baseline in the mean sleep latency from the MWT (average of 4 tests at 0900, 1100, 1300, and 1500) was analyzed at weeks 4, 8, and 12. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from the baseline assessment in MWT sleep latency as assessed at week 12 (or last post-baseline visit).</description>

        <description>Number of participants who had at least minimal improvement in CGI-C ratings at Week 12 or last post-baseline visit. The CGI-C uses the following categories and scoring assignments: 1=Very much improved; 2=Much improved; 3=Minimally improved; 4=No change; 5=Minimally worse; 6=Much worse; and 7=Very much worse. Severity of illness was assessed at baseline by the CGI-S, which consists of the following categories: 1=Normal (shows no signs of illness); 2=Borderline ill; 3=Mildly (Slightly) ill; 4=Moderately ill; 5=Markedly ill; 6=Severely ill; and 7=Among the most extremely ill patients.</description>
