  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE), which is naturally produced by our body, has a key
      role in generating asthma attacks. In patients with allergies, there is an exaggerated
      production of IgE in response to specific substances such as pollens. Omalizumab is a new
      drug that inactivates IgE. This study tested the safety and efficacy of omalizumab against
      asthma attacks in children with allergic asthma.

      This study was designed to provide one year efficacy and safety data for subcutaneous (SC)
      omalizumab, compared to placebo in children (6 to &lt; 12 years) with moderate to severe
      persistent asthma who have inadequate asthma control despite treatment according to National
      Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) step 3 or 4 (at least medium dose inhaled
      corticosteroids with or without other controller asthma medications).

    <measure>Rate of Clinically Significant Asthma Exacerbations Per Patient in the 24-week Fixed-dose Steroid Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of the fixed-dose steroid treatment period (Week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>A clinically significant asthma exacerbation was defined as a worsening of asthma symptoms, as judged clinically by the investigator, requiring doubling of the baseline inhaled corticosteroid dose and/or treatment with systemic rescue corticosteroids for at least 3 days. The exacerbations rate per patient was derived using Poisson model adjusted by time at risk and the following covariates: country, exacerbation history, and dose schedule. A patient's person-days at risk was taken as the total amount of time (in days) he/she spent in the 24-week fixed-dose steroid treatment period.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to the end (last 4 weeks) of the 24-week fixed-dose steroid treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Nocturnal asthma symptom was measured daily on a scale of 0 to 4 in response to the question &quot;How did you sleep last night?&quot;, with 0 as the best response and 4 as the worst response. The mean of the last 4 weeks of the 24-week fixed-dose steroid treatment period was calculated; for patients who discontinued prematurely, the mean of the last 28 days before discontinuation was calculated. A negative change in mean score indicated improvement.</description>

    <description>A clinically significant asthma exacerbation was defined as a worsening of asthma symptoms, as judged clinically by the investigator, requiring doubling of the baseline inhaled corticosteroid dose and/or treatment with systemic rescue corticosteroids for at least 3 days. The exacerbations rate per patient was derived using Poisson model adjusted by time at risk and the following covariates: country, exacerbation history, and dose schedule. A patient's person-days at risk was taken as the total amount of time (in days) he/she spent in the 52-week treatment period.</description>

    <measure>Change in Mean Daily Number of Puffs of Asthma Rescue Medication From Baseline to the End (Last 4 Weeks) of the 24-week Fixed-dose Steroid Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to the end (last 4 weeks) of the 24-week fixed-dose steroid treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were instructed to record the number of puffs of rescue medication they took twice daily in a diary. The mean daily number of puffs during the last 4 weeks of the 24-week fixed-dose steroid treatment period was calculated; for patients who discontinued prematurely, the mean of the last 28 days before discontinuation was calculated. A negative change in mean daily number of puffs indicated reduced use of rescue medication.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (Standardized) [PAQLQ(S)] Scores From Baseline to the End of the 24-week Fixed-dose Steroid Treatment Period (Week 24)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to the end of the 24-week fixed-dose steroid treatment period (Week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>PAQLQ measures functional problems that are most troublesome to children with asthma. PAQLQ has 23 questions in 3 domains (activity limitation=5, emotional function=8, symptoms=10). Patients responded to each question on a 7-point Likert scale. Overall PAQLQ score is mean of 23 questions; each domain score is mean of questions in that domain. Minimum possible value is 1 (maximum impairment); maximum possible value is 7 (no impairment). Positive change indicated improvement. The analysis included country, baseline PAQLQ value, and dosing schedule (2-weekly/4-weekly) as factors and covariates.</description>

    <description>Participants received omalizumab administered by subcutaneous injection every 2 or 4 weeks for a duration of 52 weeks. The omalizumab dose was based on the patient's body weight and total serum IgE level at Screening. The first 24 weeks of the treatment period was a fixed steroid phase where the steroid dose was maintained constant; in the following 28 weeks the steroid dose was adjustable, depending on the patient's condition. Following the 52-week treatment period, patients were followed up for an additional 16 weeks.</description>

        <description>Nocturnal asthma symptom was measured daily on a scale of 0 to 4 in response to the question “How did you sleep last night?”, with 0 as the best response and 4 as the worst response. The mean of the last 4 weeks of the 24-week fixed-dose steroid treatment period was calculated; for patients who discontinued prematurely, the mean of the last 28 days before discontinuation was calculated. A negative change in mean score indicated improvement.</description>

        <title>Rate of Clinically Significant Asthma Exacerbations Per Patient in the 24-week Fixed-dose Steroid Treatment Period</title>
        <description>A clinically significant asthma exacerbation was defined as a worsening of asthma symptoms, as judged clinically by the investigator, requiring doubling of the baseline inhaled corticosteroid dose and/or treatment with systemic rescue corticosteroids for at least 3 days. The exacerbations rate per patient was derived using Poisson model adjusted by time at risk and the following covariates: country, exacerbation history, and dose schedule. A patient’s person-days at risk was taken as the total amount of time (in days) he/she spent in the 24-week fixed-dose steroid treatment period.</description>

          <title>Change in Mean Daily Number of Puffs of Asthma Rescue Medication From Baseline to the End (Last 4 Weeks) of the 24-week Fixed-dose Steroid Treatment Period</title>
          <description>Patients were instructed to record the number of puffs of rescue medication they took twice daily in a diary. The mean daily number of puffs during the last 4 weeks of the 24-week fixed-dose steroid treatment period was calculated; for patients who discontinued prematurely, the mean of the last 28 days before discontinuation was calculated. A negative change in mean daily number of puffs indicated reduced use of rescue medication.</description>

        <title>Change in Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (Standardized) [PAQLQ(S)] Scores From Baseline to the End of the 24-week Fixed-dose Steroid Treatment Period (Week 24)</title>
        <description>PAQLQ measures functional problems that are most troublesome to children with asthma. PAQLQ has 23 questions in 3 domains (activity limitation=5, emotional function=8, symptoms=10). Patients responded to each question on a 7-point Likert scale. Overall PAQLQ score is mean of 23 questions; each domain score is mean of questions in that domain. Minimum possible value is 1 (maximum impairment); maximum possible value is 7 (no impairment). Positive change indicated improvement. The analysis included country, baseline PAQLQ value, and dosing schedule (2-weekly/4-weekly) as factors and covariates.</description>
