      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy given directly
      into the bladder in treating patients who are undergoing surgery to remove all or part of the
      bladder. Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may help the body build an effective immune
      response to kill tumor cells. Giving a vaccine directly into the bladder before surgery may
      cause a stronger immune response and keep tumor cells from coming back after surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of intravesical administration of recombinant fowlpox virus encoding
      three different costimulatory molecules (B7.1, ICAM-1,LFA-3) called TRICOM (-rF-TRICOM)
      (recombinant fowlpox-TRICOM vaccine) and/or recombinant fowlpox encoding sargramostim
      (GM-CSF) (rF-GM-CSF) (recombinant fowlpox GM-CSF vaccine adjuvant) in the treatment of
      patients with carcinoma of the bladder scheduled for cystectomy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the kinetics of viral infection and gene function as well as host response to
      intravesical recombinant fowlpox virus in the treatment of bladder cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are alternately assigned to Arms A and B.
      Once Arms A and B have finished accrual, patients are assigned to Arm C.

      ARM A (closed to accrual 10/2004): Patients receive recombinant fowlpox GM-CSF vaccine
      adjuvant intravesically over 2 hours for 4 weekly doses (on days 1, 8, 15, and 22) with the
      last dose given 4-6 days prior to cystectomy.

      ARM B (closed to accrual 10/2004): Patients receive recombinant fowlpox-TRICOM vaccine
      intravesically over 2 hours for 4 weekly doses (on days 1, 8, 15, and 22) with the last dose
      given 4-6 days prior to cystectomy.

      ARM C: Patients receive recombinant fowlpox-TRICOM vaccine combined with recombinant fowlpox
      GM-CSF vaccine adjuvant intravesically over 2 hours for 4 weekly doses (on days 1, 8, 15, and
      22) with the last dose given 4-6 days prior to cystectomy.

      In all arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. All patients undergo cystectomy 4-6 days following the last intravesical
      instillation.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years and
      then annually for 3 years.
