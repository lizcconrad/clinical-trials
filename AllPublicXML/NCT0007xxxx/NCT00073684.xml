      This study will determine the necessity of including abuse-focused interventions in the
      treatment of sexually abused children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Child sexual abuse is a serious public health problem that places children at high risk for
      developing anxiety, mood, conduct, sexual, and substance abuse disorders. It also increases
      their likelihood of experiencing further victimization. It is imperative that abused children
      are provided with effective interventions to minimize their risk of developing problems that
      can be disruptive to their psychosocial development. Evidence suggests that cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) can effectively ameliorate many abuse-related symptoms exhibited by
      sexually abused children and their parents. However, it is unknown whether CBT treatment
      should include gradual exposure (GE), an intervention that involves the gradual confrontation
      of abuse-related thoughts and memories with therapist feedback to assist the child in
      effectively processing the abusive experience. Because this component of CBT may be more
      difficult for children and their parents, it is important to determine if and when GE is
      essential for optimal recovery in abused children.

      Children and their parents will be randomly assigned to receive one of four treatments: brief
      abuse-focused treatment, brief coping skills treatment, extended abuse-focused treatment, and
      extended coping skills treatment. Assessments will be conducted before, during, and after
      treatment and at 6- and 12-month follow-up visits. Standardized evaluations will be conducted
      to assess parents' distress and support levels; parent reports of children's behavior
      patterns, sexualized behaviors, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms; and
      children's self-reports of PTSD, depression and anxiety symptoms, body safety skills, and
      victimization experiences.

    <description>This study aims to: (1) examine the differential effects of CBT with and without trauma narrative interventions; (2) examine the comparative efficacy of brief and extended (8 vs. 16 sessions) individual CBT; (3) make developmental comparisons between 4-7 year olds and 8-11 year olds as to the appropriateness and therapeutic necessity of exposure interventions and longer treatment; and (4) identify child and parent factors that may significantly mediate the relationships between treatment conditions and outcomes. The findings of this study will help establish clinical as well as developmental markers for the early identification of sexually abused children who may require more focused (i.e., including trauma narrative) and/or longer treatment to achieve optimal outcomes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Sexual abuse that has occurred within 24 months of the study. The abuse must have been
             substantiated by child protective services, charges must have been pressed by the
             prosecutor's office, or there must have been independent confirmation of abuse by a
             professional with recognized expertise in conducting investigative evaluations.

          -  Kiddie-Sads-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) criteria for partial or full
             post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

          -  Parental consent

          -  Caretaker who has not abused the child

          -  Psychotic disorder

          -  Serious medical illness that could interfere with the study

          -  In temporary, emergency foster care. If a child is returned home or placed in
             short-term foster care that is anticipated to last a minimum of 4 months, then the

             to participate. In addition, children who have contact with a psychiatrist for
             medication monitoring purposes may be included if their medication and dosage have
             remained stable for at least 6 weeks prior to study start
