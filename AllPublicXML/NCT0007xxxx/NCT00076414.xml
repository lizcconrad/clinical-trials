      This study will examine how the anti-HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir (KaletraÂ®
      (Registered Trademark)) affects the function of the endothelium (lining of the arteries).
      Medications such as protease inhibitors can dramatically change the course of HIV infection
      in many patients; however, among their side effects is development of abnormal lipid levels
      resulting in high cholesterol and insulin resistance. These side effects may damage the
      lining of the arteries that supply blood to the heart, leading to premature coronary artery
      disease. The study will determine whether lopinavir/ritonavir directly affects endothelial
      function and whether it alters cholesterol levels, glucose tolerance, and markers of
      inflammation in people who take the drug for 4 weeks.

      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 40 years of age may be eligible for this study.
      Candidates must be HIV-negative and have no history of heart disease, hypertension, or
      diabetes mellitus. They must not have smoked for at least 6 weeks before entering the study.
      Volunteers will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood tests
      (including a pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential), and electrocardiogram. In
      addition, candidates will have an oral glucose tolerance test (see description below).

      Participants will undergo the following procedures:

        -  Lopinavir/ritonavir: 4 weeks (3 capsules twice a day) beginning study day 1

        -  Flow-mediated vasodilatation test (study days 0 and 29) - An ultrasound device for
           measuring the size of the brachial artery (artery in the upper arm) is placed just above
           the elbow. The size of the artery is measured before and 5 minutes after blood flow to
           the arm is stopped for 5 minutes, using a blood pressure cuff. The artery is also
           measured before and after taking nitroglycerin, a medicine that dilates blood vessels.
           These measurements tell how well the drug treatment works on the cells lining the
           brachial artery, which is an indicator of coronary artery function. This test takes
           about 1.5 hours.

        -  Forearm blood-flow test (study days 1 and 30): Small tubes are inserted into an artery
           and vein in the forearm at the inside of the elbow. Blood pressure cuffs are placed
           around the upper arm and wrist, and a strain gauge (a rubber band-like device) is placed
           around the forearm. When the blood pressure cuffs are inflated, blood flows into the
           forearm, stretching the strain gauge at a rate proportional to the blood flow. When the
           devices are in place, a salt water solution is injected in the small tube in the artery.
           After 20 minutes, small doses of the following drugs are given through the catheter at
           various intervals: 1) L-NMMA (blocks production of nitric oxide, a substance produced by
           the blood vessels that causes them to dilate); 2) sodium nitroprusside (dilates blood
           vessels, increasing blood flow); 3) acetylcholine (lowers blood pressure); and 4)
           acetylcholine plus L-NMMA. The effect of the different drugs on blood flow in the
           forearm is measured. The study takes about 2 hours to complete.

        -  Blood tests (screening and study days 1,15, 30, and 44)

        -  Electrocardiogram (at screening and on study day 30)

        -  Oral glucose tolerance test (at screening and on study day 30) - A blood sample is
           collected. Then, the subject drinks 300 milliliters of a glucose solution (a liquid that
           contains sugar dissolved in water). Two hours after drinking the solution, blood is
           drawn again to examine how the body responds to the increase blood sugar levels.

    <textblock>
      With the advent of the highly active antiretroviral (ARV) therapy era, patients with human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have had significantly decreased mortality and morbidity.
      Concomitant with more patients chronically taking antiretroviral therapy, there has been an
      increase in atherogenic lipoprotein profiles (high cholesterol, high triglycerides, low
      HDL's), insulin resistance, fat redistribution and coronary artery disease. HIV viral
      replication, anti-retroviral treatment regimens, lipids, glucose intolerance, host immune
      response or a combination of factors may contribute to the increase in cardiovascular risk
      factors. HIV positive patients, independent of the effect on lipids, appear to have increased
      cardiovascular risk. Studies are not entirely consistent, but the most convincing study to
      date, the D.A.D. study from EURO-SIDA, shows a 27% relative increased rate of myocardial
      infarction per year of exposure over the first seven years of ART.

      Lopinavir-ritonavir is one of the most commonly used antiretroviral therapy. It also produces
      lipid abnormalities. Thus, an important part of the investigating factors contributing to
      atherosclerosis would be to determine if this drug can adversely influence endothelial cells
      in the absence of HIV infection or low CD4 counts. This would suggest that this drug directly
      or indirectly could predispose to atherosclerosis. Endothelial function is an important
      contributor to atherosclerosis. Invasive and non-invasive methods to evaluate endothelial
      cell function have been validated as predictors of coronary artery disease. These techniques
      have been used at NIH for clinical investigation for many years.

      This protocol is designed to determine whether there is a pathologic effect on endothelial
      function from the lopinavir/ritonavir. By measuring endothelial function in HIV non-infected
      subjects both before and after four weeks of therapy, we will be able to investigate whether
      the medications have a direct toxic effect on the endothelium. Collection of metabolic data
      will allow us to evaluate whether endothelial function occurs in conjunction or separate from
      lipoprotein and glucose metabolic changes. As ARV options increase, it may be possible to
      choose specific regimens that may minimize acceleration of cardiovascular risk factors
      associated with endothelial dysfunction, especially in patients with other cardiovascular
      risk factors. These findings may help elucidate the pathophysiology of premature
      cardiovascular disease in HIV positive patients and also plan interventions to minimize
      endothelial dysfunction and subsequent cardiovascular disease.
