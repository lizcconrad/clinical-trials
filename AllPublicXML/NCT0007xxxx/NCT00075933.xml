  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ARQ 501, an investigational anticancer drug, is intended to selectively kill cancer cells and
      spare normal cells by restoring and activating cellular checkpoints known to be defective in
      cancer using the Company's unique biology platform, Activated Checkpoint Therapyâ„¢ (ACT).

      ARQ 501 has the potential for improved activity and reduced toxicity over other molecular
      approaches and traditional cancer chemotherapy.
