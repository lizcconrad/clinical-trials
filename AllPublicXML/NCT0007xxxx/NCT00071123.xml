      This study will evaluate emotional processing biases in the brain while viewing facial
      expressions in adults with current or remitted major depressive disorder and healthy
      volunteers.

      The goal of this research is to elucidate the neurophysiological abnormalities associated
      with processing emotionally valenced stimuli in MDD. Neuroimaging technology has led to the
      identification of specific abnormalities in the amygdala, ventral striatum and medial
      prefrontal cortex in response to affective pictures. Much of the knowledge involving these
      structures in emotion processing has been elucidated through animal models including
      classical fear conditioning and reversal-learning paradigms. Functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) studies have applied similar techniques in humans to study emotional
      processing. The amygdala has been shown to play a role in the learning of fear (aversive)
      conditioning to emotional stimuli, the ventral striatum has been shown to play a role in
      appetitive conditioning, and areas of the prefrontal cortex are recruited for extinction of
      conditioned responses. These areas have also been implicated as key structures in the
      abnormal expression of emotion in MDD. Dysregulation of connections between the amygdala and
      prefrontal cortex has been hypothesized to influence depressed subjects' tendency to ruminate
      on emotional events and memories, which may be associated with an inability to properly
      regulate emotional processing through habituation and extinction mechanisms. Research
      suggests that depressed individuals have an impaired ability to disengage from or habituate
      to emotional stimuli perceived as sad.

      In addition to studying emotional processing at a conscious, cortical level, significant
      evidence suggests that many aspects of emotional processing occur below conscious awareness,
      at a preconscious level. The technique of backward masking assesses the automaticity of
      emotional processing and responses to affective stimuli. In MDD, backward masking serves to
      avoid confounding interpretation by the presence of other cognitive processing, which may
      result from depressed subjects perseverating on emotional stimuli. The proposed study builds
      on previous fMRI research to investigate neurophysiological differences in the processing of
      aversively conditioned emotional stimuli in depressed compared to healthy individuals. Using
      fMRI technology and a variation of the paradigm developed by Morris et al., subjects with MDD
      will be classically conditioned to the presence of an unmasked specific target face (angry or
      sad) and the subsequent neural responses to the stimuli will be assessed utilizing the
      backward masking technique. The BOLD hemodynamic response and rates of habituation and
      extinction to the faces will be compared between depressed subjects with MDD and healthy
      controls, currently depressed versus currently remitted subjects with MDD, and MDD subjects
      pre- and post-antidepressant therapy.

      The present amendment proposes to include an additional paradigm in the testing battery. This
      new paradigm has been extensively examined under different pharmacological manipulations, and
      in healthy individuals undergoing fMRI but has yet to be examined in patient populations. The
      task complements the paradigms presently included by extending the research to encompass
      appetitive as well as aversive emotional processing.

      This research will be used to evaluate neural processes involved in emotional dysregulation
      in MDD and may direct future research to potential therapeutic approaches for the treatment
      of mood and anxiety disorders with abnormalities in emotional processing.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Healthy Volunteers (n=65)

        Healthy Control Sample (n = 30, phase 1; n = 15, phase 3; n=20, phase 5): Right-handed
        subjects (ages 18-55) will be selected who have not met criteria for any major psychiatric
        disorder, have no known first-degree relatives with mood disorders, and have a current
        score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS; 17 item) in the not depressed range
        (less than or equal to 7). Control subjects will be matched to depressed subjects for age,
        gender, and education.

        MDD Samples (n =80)

        MDD Sample-Currently Depressed (n = 30, phase 1; n = 15, phase 3; n=20, phase 5):
        Right-handed subjects (ages 18-55) will be selected with primary MDD currently depressed by
        DSM-IV criteria for recurrent MDD and current HDRS score in the moderately-to-severely
        depressed range (greater than or equal to 18).

        MDD Sample-Remitted Depressed (n = 15, phase 2): Right-handed subjects (ages 18-50) will be
        selected with a past history of MDD by DSM-IV criteria.

        Healthy Relatives of MDD Subjects (n=45)

        Right-handed subjects (ages 18-55) will be selected who have a first-degree relative with
        MDD but do not themselves meet criteria for a psychiatric disorder. Subjects will be
        matched to depressed and control subjects for age, gender, and education.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects will be recruited who are drug-na ve or who have not received psychotropic drugs
        for at least 3 weeks (8 weeks for fluoxetine) prior to scanning. Effective medications will
        not be discontinued for the purposes of the study. Subjects will also be excluded if they
        have a) serious suicidal ideation or behavior, b) psychosis to the extent that the ability
        to provide informed consent is in doubt, c) medical conditions or concomitant medications
        (see Appendix III) that are likely to influence cerebral blood flow or neurological
        function including cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine and neurological diseases, d) a
        history of drug or alcohol abuse within 1 year or a lifetime history of alcohol or drug
        dependence (DSM-IV criteria), e) current pregnancy (as documented by pregnancy testing
        prior to scanning), f) general MRI exclusion criteria, g) history of non-response to Zoloft
        or of intolerable or adverse side effects during Zoloft treatment. Additional exclusion
        criteria applied to control subjects are: a) subjects with a current or past history of
        other axis I psychiatric conditions, b) subjects with first-degree family members with
        current or past history of mood disorder.

        Subjects beyond age 55 are excluded to reduce the biological heterogeneity encompassed by
        the MDD criteria, and to reduce the variability of the BOLD signal. Subjects whose first
        major depressive episodes arose temporally after other major medical or psychiatric
        conditions will also be excluded, since their functional imaging results generally differ
        from those reported in primary MDD.
