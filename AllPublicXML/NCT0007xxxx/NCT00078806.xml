  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: etanercept inhibits the effects of tumor necrosis factor, which plays an important
      role in the progression of rheumatoid arthritis. A study of children with polyarticular
      course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis showed that Enbrel had efficacy and was generally well
      tolerated in children ages 4-17 who had moderately to severely active disease and who failed
      treatment with one or more disease modifying antiarthritic drugs. The children in the study
      may have had arthritis onset of pauciarticular, polyarticular, or systemic nature. Systemic
      onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (SOJRA) may result in approximately one-third of patients
      having significant long-term disability. Purpose: the Phase 4 study is designed to further
      define the safety and efficacy of etanercept in those children with SOJRA.
