      The purpose of this trial is to test the short-term effectiveness of valerian, a medicinal
      herb, to improve sleep in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with PD have exceptionally poor sleep. Sleep in patients with PD is characterized by
      excessive activity in surface electromyographic (EMG) recordings from many different muscle
      groups. Despite sleep disturbances, approximately 50% of patients experience a transient (1
      to 3 hour) reduction in waking motor symptoms upon arising in the morning. This effect has
      been termed Sleep Benefit. This study will evaluate the effects of valerian, a medicinal
      herb, on the sleep of patients with PD.

      This is a 17 day study where participants will be evaluated by polysomnography on days one,
      two, three, sixteen and seventeen.. Polysomnographic measurements will include customary
      variables such as total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and sleep latency, as well as EMG
      measures of periodic and isolated muscle activity during sleep. Participants will be required
      to keep a detailed sleep log of their self reported sleep characteristics across the entire
      17 study nights. Outcomes will include measures of both nocturnal sleep and waking motor
      function. Assessments of motor function will be made the morning immediately following Nights
      3 and 17 in order to test for improvement related to improved sleep. On the morning following
      Night 17, participants are provided with a one-week supply of valerian in an Open Label
      extension. Participants are provided an additional Sleep Log for this week and asked to
      return the Sleep Log when they complete the Open Label phase.
