      This study will evaluate the benefit of adding sertraline (ZoloftÂ®) to Trauma-Focused
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) for sexually abused children who have Posttraumatic
      Stress Disorder (PTSD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult research has demonstrated the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
      (SSRIs) in decreasing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms; to date the SSRIs are
      the only medication class with demonstrated efficacy in treating all three PTSD symptom
      clusters (reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal). No studies have evaluated the impact
      of SSRIs on PTSD symptoms in children or adolescents. Trauma-focused CBT has been shown in
      several studies to be efficacious in decreasing PTSD symptoms in sexually abused children and
      adolescents. Many children and youth with PTSD are currently prescribed SSRIs and other
      medications. This study will evaluate whether adding the SSRI sertraline provides additional
      benefits over TF-CBT treatment for sexually abused children and adolescents with PTSD. If
      adequate numbers of children with comorbid PTSD and depressive and/or anxiety disorders are
      included, it may also be possible to evaluate whether any benefit of adding sertraline is
      restricted to those children with comorbid disorders.

    <description>Change in PTSD parameters as determined by changes in score. At enrollment, participants either did or did not have a PTSD diagnosis. The three categories displayed show participants who had the PTSD diagnosis at the time of enrollment but did have evidence of PTSD at the end of their participation, participants who had PTSD at enrollment and who continued to exhibit PTSD at the end of their participation, and those who did not have a PTSD diagnosis at the start of the trial. There are numerous criteria used to determine a PTSD diagnosis; they are not individually listed. The diagnosis was sufficient for the purposes of the study.</description>

Participants in the &quot;clinical symptom present at enrollment&quot; category were tested to see if their status changed during the trial.</description>

The three categories displayed show participants who had the PTSD diagnosis at the time of enrollment but did have evidence of PTSD at the end of their participation, participants who had PTSD at enrollment and who continued to exhibit PTSD at the end of their participation, and those who did not have a PTSD diagnosis at the start of the trial. There are numerous criteria used to determine a PTSD diagnosis; they are not individually listed. The diagnosis was sufficient for the purposes of the study.</description>
