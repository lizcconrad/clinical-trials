  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib in treating young
      patients with refractory or recurrent leukemia. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer
      cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth.

      OBJECTIVES: Primary I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of
      bortezomib in children with refractory or recurrent leukemia.

      II. Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary I. Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.

      II. Determine, preliminarily, the biologic activity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5-36
      months.
