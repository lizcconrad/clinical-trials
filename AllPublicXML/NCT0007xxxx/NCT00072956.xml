      This study will examine the action of sensory tricks on an occurrence known as surround
      inhibition when there is a disorder of muscle tone affecting a single body part in isolation.
      Surround inhibition refers to a situation that suppresses unwanted movements, known as
      dystonia, in surrounding muscles during voluntary actions. There are tricks-various
      actions-that people use to temporarily stop those unwanted movements. Such tricks can include
      touching the affected body part, placing an object in the mouth, pulling the hair, and
      others. Often these tricks are beneficial early in the illness but become less effective as
      it progresses. This study is guided by a hypothesis that sensory tricks will restore surround
      inhibition and by another hypothesis that it is the application of the tricks, not simply
      sensory input, that is effective in doing that restoring. Emphasis is on cervical dystonia,
      involuntary actions affecting the neck, in which the tricks commonly involve the cheeks and
      chin. The technique used in the study is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

      Patients ages 18 and older who have cervical dystonia with at least one effective trick and
      patients with no effective trick may be eligible for this study. There will also be a control
      group of healthy participants.

      Participants will be asked to show the sensory trick and may be asked to be videotaped.
      During the TMS procedure, they will be seated in a comfortable chair, with hands placed on a
      pillow on the lap. Small electrodes-soft strips that stick to the skin-will be placed on the
      skin to record the electrical activity of some muscles in the neck that are activated by the
      stimulation from TMS. In TMS, there will be a wire coil held over the scalp. A brief
      electrical current will be passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates
      the brain. Patients will hear a click and may feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the
      coil. There may be muscle twitches of the face, arm, or leg. In addition, patients may be
      asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions so that the coil can
      be positioned appropriately. Patients will sometimes be asked to bite down and tap their
      teeth slightly for about 1-1/2 minutes at a time. They will be asked to show the sensory
      trick. The stimulation is usually not painful, although sometimes strong contractions of the
      scalp muscles can cause discomfort or a headache. Patients can ask to have the procedure
      discontinued at any time. The testing session takes about 2 hours, done on an outpatient
      basis.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the mechanism of sensory tricks on surround
      inhibition in the motor cortex in focal dystonia. Sensory tricks or Geste antagoniste, are
      various manoeuvres used by dystonic patients to transiently diminish their spasms. Many of
      these manoeuvres involve motor as well as sensory input and here we use the term 'tricks' to
      refer to both phenomena. Little is known of this unique feature that is an evidence for the
      abnormality of sensorimotor integration in focal dystonia. The relief of dystonic symptoms by
      the application of tricks suggests its potential as a clue to the understanding of the yet
      unclear mechanism of dystonia. There is evidence that surround inhibition, a cortical
      phenomenon that functions to suppress unwanted movements in surrounding muscles during
      voluntary actions, is impaired in dystonia. Since tricks transiently relieve the dystonic
      symptoms, we hypothesize that the mechanism of tricks is the normalization of surround
      inhibition which is defective in dystonia.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Nineteen patients age 18 or over with cervical dystonia with a minimal of one effective
        trick, 15 patients age 18 and over with cervical dystonia with no effective trick will be
        recruited for the study.

        For patients, the selection criteria are the presence of cervical dystonia and the minimal
        of one sensory trick in the patient with trick group, and no trick in the patient without
        trick group.

        The interview of dystonic patients will be focused on medical history, neurologic
        examination and effectiveness of the patient's tricks which will be accessed by measuring
        the degree of head rotation before and during trick application.

        The diagnosis of dystonia will rely on review of medical record, history, and clinical
        evaluation.

        For the patients that are receiving botulinum toxin injections, the evaluation will be done
        3 months after their last injection.

        Their gender, age, or ethnic origin will not provide bias for inclusion to the study.

        There is no evidence of higher prevalence of dystonia in any particular race, thus the
        races and ethnicity of the subjects recruited for this study will approximate that of the
        general population.

        Fifteen normal subjects age 18 and over will be recruited for the control group.

        The controls will not have dystonia or any other neurological condition.

        All subjects will sign an informed consent prior to participation in the trial, and the
        trial will be approved by the NINDS IRB committee.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Exclusion criteria for the trial covering both the normal control and dystonia group will
        include;

          1. Any concurrent medical or surgical condition as well as neurological or psychiatric
             illnesses.

          2. Any individual who is on medications with potential influence of the nervous system
             function (antidepressants, antianxiolytics, anticonvulsants, antipsychotic,
             antiparkinsonian, hypnotics, and stimulants).

          3. Patients who have received Botulinum toxin injections within 3 months of starting the
             protocol.

          4. Individual who has a pacemaker, an implanted medical pump, a metal plate or medical
             object in the skull or eye (for example, after brain surgery)

          5. Individual with a history of seizures.
