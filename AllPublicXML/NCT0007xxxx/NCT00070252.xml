      Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of neoadjuvant tipifarnib combined with docetaxel
      and capecitabine in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors or
      stage IIIA or stage IIIB breast cancer. Tipifarnib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      docetaxel and capecitabine, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die. Combining tipifarnib with docetaxel and capecitabine may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose of capecitabine in combination
      with docetaxel and tipifarnib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
      (Phase Ib) II. Determine the complete pathological and clinical response rate in patients
      with stage IIIA or IIIB breast cancer treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. II. Determine disease-free and
      overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of capecitabine. Patients in phase II
      are stratified according to type of breast cancer (inflammatory vs noninflammatory).

      Phase Ib: Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily and oral capecitabine twice daily on
      days 1-14 and docetaxel IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of capecitabine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Phase II: Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily for 6 days. Beginning at least 48
      hours after completion of the initial dose of tipifarnib, patients receive treatment as in
      phase Ib for up to 6 courses at the MTD of capecitabine. Patients in phase Ib are followed at
      3 months.

      Patients in phase II are followed every 4 months for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-53 patients (9-18 for phase Ib and 15-35 for phase II) will
      be accrued for this study within 14-35 months.
