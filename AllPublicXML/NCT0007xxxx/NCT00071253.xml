          -  DSM-IV-TR primary diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder as confirmed by the SCID

          -  Outpatient receiving treatment with a combination of Depakote plus olanzapine for
             their bipolar illness and considered clinically stable (e.g., no more than minimal
             symptoms, no psychiatric hospitalizations, no increase in intensity of clinical
             interventions) for the preceding 4 months

          -  Identified at Screening a most bothersome side effect listed in the UKU which makes
             switching to monotherapy desirable

          -  MRS total score &lt; 12 on two consecutive ratings, separated by at least 5 days
             (Screening and Day 1)

          -  DSS score &lt; 13 on two consecutive ratings, separated by at least five days (Screening
             and Day 1)

          -  CGI-S score &lt; 3 on two consecutive ratings, separated by at least five days (Screening
             and Day 1)

          -  Serum valproate level &gt; 45 mcg/mL, and a maximum allowable dose of Depakote of 3000
             mg/day at Screening

          -  Olanzapine dose between 5 and 20 mg/day at Screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder

          -  Has taken antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, or anticonvulsants (unless specifically
             for seizure control) other than Depakote or olanzapine in the four months prior to
             randomization. Other psychotropics (e.g., antidepressants, anxiolytics) with the
             exception of stimulants, that have been used routinely to maintain stability in the
             preceding four months may be continued, but not increased or decreased

          -  Has first manic episode after age 60

          -  Has ever taken clozapine

          -  Has received depot neuroleptic medication within six months of randomization

          -  Known history of non-response to either Depakote or olanzapine monotherapy for the
             treatment of bipolar disorder
