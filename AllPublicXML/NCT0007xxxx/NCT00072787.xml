      The purpose of the phase 1 portion of the study is to determine the safe dose of S-1 and
      cisplatin that can be administered in gastric cancer patients.

      The purpose of the phase 2 portion of the study is to determine the antitumor activity of the
      S-1 and cisplatin regimen established from phase 1 in patients with advanced gastric cancer.

      S-1 is an oral fluoropyrimidine which combines tegafur (a 5-FU prodrug) with two classes of
      modulators which:

        -  inhibit dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and

        -  block phosphorylation of 5-FU in gastrointestinal tissues.

      S-1 is designed to enhance the the clinical utility of an oral fluoropyrimidine while
      ameliorating the disadvantage of gastrointestinal toxicity.

      5-Fu and cisplatin have been used as a standard treatment in gastric cancer and preliminary
      data indicate that S-1 plus cisplatin may result in superior tolerability and efficacy in
      advanced gastric cancer.

      S-1 is currently approved in Japan for treatment of gastric cancer and head and neck cancer.
