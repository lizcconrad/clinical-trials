      RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as anakinra, may interfere with the growth of the tumor
      cells and slow the growth of metastatic tumors that express the interleukin-1 gene.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of anakinra in
      treating patients with metastatic cancer that expresses the interleukin-1 gene.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of anakinra in patients
           with metastatic cancer expressing the interleukin-1 gene.

        -  Determine the steady state pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the antitumor efficacy of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine gene expression changes in tumor biopsies and circulating leukocyte and
           cytokine levels in these patients before and after treatment with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive anakinra subcutaneously 1-3 times daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of anakinra until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional 6
      patients are treated at that dose.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.
