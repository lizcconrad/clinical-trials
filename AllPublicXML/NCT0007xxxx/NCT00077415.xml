      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as 3-AP and gemcitabine, work in different ways
      to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving more than one drug may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving 3-AP together with gemcitabine as
      second-line therapy works in treating patients with recurrent stage III or stage IV non-small
      cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with stage III or IV recurrent
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with 3-AP (Triapine®) and gemcitabine as second-line
           therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response duration, median time to progression, and overall survival of
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of 3-AP (Triapine®) on gemcitabine pharmacokinetics and cellular
           uptake into peripheral mononuclear cells in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center.

      Patients receive 3-AP (Triapine®) IV over 4 hours and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days
      1, 8, and 15*. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *For course 1 only, gemcitabine is administered alone on day 1 and in combination with
      3-AP (Triapine®) on days 8 and 15.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-31 patients will be accrued for this study within 7.5-21
      months.
