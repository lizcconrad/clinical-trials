      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of treating uveitis, an eye
      inflammation, with a monoclonal antibody called daclizumab. Monoclonal antibodies are
      genetically engineered proteins made in large quantities and directed against a specific
      target in the body. Daclizumab is designed to prevent a specific chemical interaction needed
      for immune cells called lymphocytes to produce inflammation. In an ongoing NIH study of 10
      adults with uveitis, 8 patients were able to decrease corticosteroids and other
      immunosuppressive medicines they were taking while receiving daclizumab for months or even
      years. Seven patients continue to take the drug.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with active non-infectious intermediate or posterior
      uveitis in both eyes who require treatment for their disease may be eligible for this study.
      Candidates will be screened with the following tests and procedures:

        -  Medical history and physical examination.

        -  Eye examination to measure visual acuity and eye pressure, and examine the lens, retina,
           pupils and eye movements.

        -  Blood tests to measure the number and types of blood cells.

        -  Fluorescein angiography to check for abnormalities of eye blood vessels. A yellow dye
           injected into an arm vein travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the
           retina are taken with a special camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The
           pictures show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating
           possible abnormalities.

      Participants come to the NIH Clinical Center for treatment and follow-up visits. The first
      daclizumab treatment is given as a 90-minute infusion through a vein. A second IV infusion is
      given 7 days later. If the treatment has successfully reduced the eye inflammation after 2
      weeks, then subsequent treatments are given through injections under the skin once a month
      for up to 1 year. Patients whose eye disease is not improved after 2 weeks stop the study
      treatments and receive alternative therapy.

      Follow-up visits are scheduled 7, 14, and 21 days after enrollment and at each treatment
      visit to evaluate the response to treatment and drug side effects. During these visits,
      patients repeat the exams done at screening. Extra blood samples are taken at certain visits
      to measure blood levels of daclizumab and to perform clinical laboratory and immunology
      tests. Fluorescein angiography is done at enrollment and after 1 year.

      Uveitis refers to intraocular inflammatory diseases that are an important cause of visual
      loss. Standard systemic immunosuppressive medications used for uveitis can cause significant
      toxic side effects, especially with prolonged use. Consequently, an effective treatment with
      a safer side effect profile is highly desirable. Daclizumab is a humanized monoclonal
      antibody directed against the high affinity IL-2 receptor CD25 or Tac subunit. The IL-2
      receptor system plays a central role in mediating immune responses. Blocking this system
      impedes immune responses and can inhibit local inflammatory responses, including uveitis.
      Pilot studies using intravenous or subcutaneous daclizumab treatments suggest that daclizumab
      treatments at 1 mg/kg every 2-4 weeks for quiescent uveitis may effectively replace the other
      immunosuppressive medications in a majority of cases.

      Because we have little experience using daclizumab for active uveitis, this feasibility study
      will enroll five study participants that would normally be treated with systemic, high-dose
      corticosteroids or other cytotoxic, systemic immunosuppressive medications. Since daclizumab
      for other indications can be tolerated with repeated dosing at 8-10 mg/kg, we will administer
      daclizumab to reach high serum levels with a pair doses at 8 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg two weeks
      apart. The primary objective of this study is to collect preliminary information on the
      utility of acute daclizumab therapy on active ocular inflammation. The primary outcome is
      resolution of active disease defined as the reduction of vitreous haze by at least 2 steps
      (from 2+ to Trace, or 1+ to none) and is assessed at 21 days after the initial daclizumab
      injection. Secondary outcomes will include fluorescein retinal vascular leakage, CME,
      anterior chamber cells, and visual acuity. In addition all adverse events will be collected
      regardless of possible relation to daclizumab. Participants who show a 2 step reduction in
      vitreous haze at day 21 will be permitted to continue SC daclizumab maintenance treatments
      beginning at Day 28 at 2 mg/kg every 4 weeks for a year. At any time during the followup
      period, if a participant loses greater than 3 lines of visual acuity from baseline study
      treatments will be discontinued.

             likely have an impact on the participant's ability to comply with the visit schedule.
             Such conditions may include, for example, recent heart attack, significant COPD,
             brittle diabetes, kidney disease, severe emphysema, organ transplant (requiring
             corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications), hepatitis or other liver
             disease, or uncontrolled psychiatric illnesses.
