      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of levalbuterol 90 ug (2
      actuations, 45 ug each) versus placebo (2 actuations) in the treatment and prevention of
      bronchoconstriction in adolescent and adult subjects with asthma, with all treatments
      administered 4 times a day (QID).

      A double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group trial
      of levalbuterol in subjects 12 years of age and older with asthma. Study participation will
      include one 1-week single-blind placebo run-in and an 8-week, randomized,double-blind,
      active-treatment period with four treatment groups. This study was previously posted by
      Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and
      in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.
