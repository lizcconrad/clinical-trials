  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of multiple biweekly intravenous doses of Replagal over
      26 weeks in 25 children with Fabry disease and the way in which that agent can improve the
      health of this patient population. Fabry disease is a genetic disorder inherited as an
      X-linked recessive trait. It causes a deficiency in the enzyme alpha galactosidase, which
      normally breaks down a lipid, or fatty substance, called ceramidetrihexosidase, a building
      block in all cells of the body.

      The deficiency in breaking down the lipid eventually causes that lipid to accumulate and
      injure cells. Problems in the blood vessels, kidneys, heart, and nerves are the result. The
      disease typically occurs in childhood or adolescence, with repeated episodes of severe pain
      in the extremities and other symptoms. There is no definitive treatment, but pain management
      is important in caring for patients with Fabry disease. Although it is not known exactly how
      lipid accumulation brings about such problems, studies of another lipid storage disorder,
      Gaucher's disease, have shown that the illness can be reversed if the lipid is removed when
      an appropriate enzyme, Replagal, is given intravenously. In this study, the gene response of
      the body's cells to Fabry disease will be described, as will any gene responses that change
      when the enzyme is used.

      Patients 7 to 17 years of age who have Fabry disease may be eligible for this study. They
      will undergo the following tests and procedures:

        -  Physical examination.

        -  Neurological examination.

        -  Vital signs.

        -  Urinalysis.

        -  Blood tests to determine complete blood count and chemistries.

        -  Questionnaire on pain.

        -  Tests pertaining to sweating.

        -  Electrocardiogram.

        -  Doppler blood flow study.

        -  Diary for recording symptoms and the use of pain medications.

      Participants will go through the evaluation, over a period of about 5 days, either as an
      inpatient or outpatient. Participants will receive an intravenous infusion of Replagal every
      other week, at the dose of 0.2 mg/kg of body weight. Vital signs will be measured before the
      infusion and immediately and after and 1 hour afterward. There will be careful monitoring for
      allergic reactions and side effects. The infusion time takes approximately 40 minutes.

      This study will last 6 months, with the possibility of being extended another 6 months-a
      maintenance study in which patients will continue to receive Replagal at the same dose every
      2 weeks.

      The objectives of this clinical trial are to evaluate: 1) the safety of multiple biweekly
      (i.e. every other week) intravenous (IV) doses of Replagal over 26 weeks in 25 children ages
      7-17 years old with Fabry Disease, and 2) the pharmacokinetics of Replagal in this patient
      population. Safety will be determined by standard clinical and laboratory measurements.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Male hemizygote with Fabry Disease as documented by clinical evidence and by laboratory
        evidence of alpha-galactosidase A deficiency.

        Or

        Female heterozygote with Fabry Disease as documented by gene analysis showing a mutation of
        the alpha-galactosidase A gene. Female patients of child-bearing potential must have a
        negative pregnancy test at baseline and agree to the use of effective contraception such as
        oral contraceptive or double barrier method for study entry and while participating in the
        study.

        7-17 years of age.

        Adequate general health (as determined by the investigators) to undergo the specified
        phlebotomy regimen and protocol related procedures.

        The child must assent to participate in the protocol and the parent(s) or legally
        authorized guardian(s) must have voluntarily signed an Institutional Review
        Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) approved informed consent form after all
        relevant aspects of the study have been explained and discussed with the child and the
        child's parent(s) or legal guardian(s).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patient has previously participated in a multi-dose clinical study of an investigational
        therapeutic agent for Fabry Disease.

        Patient and/or the patient's parent(s) or legal guardian(s) are unable to understand the
        nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study.

        Patient is unable to comply with the protocol, e.g., uncooperative with protocol schedule,
        refusal to agree to all of the study procedures, inability to return for safety
        evaluations, or is otherwise unlikely to complete the study, as determined by the
        investigator or the medical monitor.
