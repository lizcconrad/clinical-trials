      This primary objective of this study is to assess whether the combination of Azithromycin
      with chloroquine is non-inferior to the combination of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus
      chloroquine, when used to treat uncomplicated cases of malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum
      in adults in India.
