      Despite substantial knowledge about adolescent suicide risk factors, few studies have been
      conducted to identify effective interventions for suicidal adolescents.

      Youth-Nominated Support Team (YST) is an intervention designed to help suicidal adolescents
      after hospitalization. It is a psychoeducational social network intervention that targets
      poor treatment adherence and difficulties with social support. YST is designed to be a
      supplement to traditional or usual treatments.

      Participants are randomly assigned to receive either treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU plus YST
      for 3 months. Adolescents who receive TAU plus YST nominate three or four adults from their
      family, school, and community settings to function as support persons. The support persons
      participate in a psychoeducation session that focuses on the adolescent's psychiatric
      disorder(s), individualized treatment plan, importance of treatment adherence, and suicide
      risk factors. They also maintain regular contact with the adolescent to support treatment
      adherence and progress toward treatment goals. Adolescents have assessments at 6 weeks, 3
      months, 6 months, and 12 months. Internalizing behavior problems, perceived social support,
      treatment adherence, adaptive functioning, severity of depression and anxiety, severity and
      frequency of suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempts are assessed.
