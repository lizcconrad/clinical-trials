  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is being conducted in pediatric patients with Hypothalamic Obesity. This generally
      occurs in people who have had an injury to or tumor in their hypothalamus (gland or organ
      that secretes hormones). The purpose of this trial is to see how an investigational treatment
      controls the hormone insulin by lowering the level of insulin in the body resulting in a
      weight loss in children who are at least 6 years of age but less than 18 years of age. Some
      children in this trial will receive placebo.

      To qualify for this study, you and your child's doctor must feel that your child's weight is
      inadequately controlled within a year from the time of injury to the hypothalamus or tumor of
      the hypothalamus. This study will help to determine if an investigational treatment is of
      benefit in controlling a child's weight.

        -  Male and female patients ages 6 to less than 18

          -  Patients who are at least one year out following therapy for their tumor

          -  Patients who have severe cardiovascular dysfunction (for example cardiomyopathy,
             congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV), unstable angina, sustained
             ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation) will be excluded

          -  Patients with severe neurologic handicaps which preclude normal physical activity will
             be excluded.

          -  Patients confined to bed and those patients who are wheelchair bound which prevents
             them from activities of daily living or normal physical activity, i.e. walking, will
             be excluded from the trial

          -  Your child must be greater than 120% of their ideal body weight for their height or
