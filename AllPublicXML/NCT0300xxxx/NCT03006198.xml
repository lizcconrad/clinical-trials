      The objective of this study is to explore and describe the disease characteristics, treatment
      and outcomes of participants with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic
      arthritis, Crohn's Disease or ulcerative colitis as the major disease treated with REMICADE,

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) Score for Crohn's Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Year 2/early withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>The IBDQ is a 32-item questionnaire used to assess quality of life in participants with inflammatory bowel diseases. Each question has graded responses from 1 (worst situation) to 7 (best situation). Total score ranges from 32 (worst) to 224 (best). Higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinical Response as Assessed by Mayo Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 2/early withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response is defined as a decrease from baseline in the Mayo score by greater than or equal to 30 percent and &gt;= 3 points, and a decrease from baseline in the rectal bleeding sub score to 0 or 1. The Mayo score consists of 4 sub scores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy findings, and physician's global assessment), rated as 0 (normal) to 3 (severe). Total score is calculated as the sum of 4 sub scores and values range from 0 to 12 scores, where 3 to 5 = mild; 6 to 10 = moderate; and 11 to 12 = severe. Higher scores indicate worsening of the disease.</description>

    <description>Clinical remission is defined as a Mayo score less than or equal to 2 points, with no individual sub score greater than 1. The Mayo score consists of 4 sub scores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy findings, and physician's global assessment), rated as 0 (normal) to 3 (severe). Total score is calculated as the sum of 4 sub scores and values range from 0 to 12 scores, where 3 to 5 = mild; 6 to 10 = moderate; and 11 to 12 = severe.
