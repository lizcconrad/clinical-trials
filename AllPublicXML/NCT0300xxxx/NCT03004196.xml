    <textblock>
      Orthodontic appliance causes increase in plaque accumulation, especially around brackets,
      wires and attachments. Advances in orthodontics in recent time have led to improved quality
      of appliance and treatment procedures ultimately resulting in improvised standard of patient
      care.

      These bacteria metabolize different kind of carbohydrates accumulated around orthodontic
      appliances and create acidic environment in the oral cavity leading to enamel
      demineralization around the brackets and white spot lesions.

      This study was carried out to evaluate and compare the efficacy of probiotic toothpaste and
      chlorhexidine mouthwash in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment with individuals who are
      not using them.

      INTRODUCTION - When the basic oral hygiene is poor, orthodontic appliances create areas where
      plaque gets accumulated, especially around brackets, bands, wires, and other attachments;
      this facilitates the development of white spot lesions. Probiotics act by competitively
      inhibiting the pathogenic bacteria because they have greater adhesion to the tissues while
      Chlorhexidine is often used as an active ingredient in mouthwash designed to reduce dental
      plaque around orthodontic appliances. AIM &amp; OBJECTIVE - The objectives of the study is to
      evaluate and compare the effects of the topical application of probiotic toothpaste and
      chlorhexidine mouthwash on the Streptococcus Mutans levels in the plaque of orthodontic
      patients hence improving the oral micro-flora of oral cavity by competitive inhibition of
      Streptococcus Mutans in plaque present around brackets.

      MATERIAL &amp; METHOD - The study consists of thirty randomly selected orthodontic patients
      undergoing fixed appliance treatment. The patients were divided into three groups - Control
      Group (Group 1), Probiotic Toothpaste Group (Group 2) &amp; Chlorhexidine Mouthwash Group (Group
      3). Samples were collected at two times interval: before the study began (Phase 1) and after
      thirty days (Phase 2).
