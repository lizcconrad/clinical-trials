  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study we aim at validating the computation of FFRangio values from the
      angiogram by comparing them to measured wire-based FFR values, in a larger scale and in a
      completely blinded manner. Investigation of a wide range of users in various conditions may
      strengthen the reliability of the FFRAngio measurements.
