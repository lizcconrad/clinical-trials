  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: The common clinical manifestations of hemophilia are skeletal muscle bleeds,
      especially hematomas and hemarthrosis. Repeated episodes of joint bleeding in certain joints,
      causing a progressive joint deterioration. Secondary disorders to this joint degeneration
      include: biomechanical alterations, loss of range of movement and periarticular muscle
      atrophy.

      Design. A prospective, multicenter and longitudinal pilot study to evaluate the efficacy of a
      treatment protocol with fascial therapy applied in patients with hemophilic arthropathy of
      the elbow.

      Aimed: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a physiotherapy treatment by fascial therapy in
      patients with hemophilic arthropathy of the elbow Patients: A total of 60 patients with
      hemophilia and prophylactic treatment will be recruited for inclusion in the study. Patients
      will be recruited in 6 centers, from different regions of Spain.

      Intervention: Each session will last approximately 50 minutes, with three physiotherapy
      sessions taking place over a period of 3 weeks. The treatment program includes 11 maneuvers
      that must be administered bilaterally:

      Measuring instruments and study variables: goniometric evaluation (range of movement); visual
      analog scale (joint pain); Haemophilia Joint Health Score (joint status); DASH Questionnaire
      (functionality of upper limbs); SF-36 Questionnaire (perception of quality of life). At the
      same time, the study will allow to determine joint bleeding caused by applied physiotherapy
      treatment.

      Expected results: First, it is intended to demonstrate the safety of this physiotherapy
      technique in patients with hemophilia. Likewise, an improvement in the perception of elbow
      pain and joint mobility is expected. An improved functionality of the upper limb is also
      foreseen and with it, an enhanced perception of quality of life of these patients.

    <description>After the first session of physiotherapy patients will be given a self-register where they can record all the observations they feel (from hematomas or hemarthros, to any other discomfort or perception). Similarly, the principal investigator of the study will monitor all patients within 48 hours after each physical therapy session.</description>

    <description>Change from range of movement of elbow during treatment and follow-up period at 3 months. The range of motion of the elbow joint will be measured using a universal goniometer, using the protocol for measuring joint motion described by Felipe Querol.

    <description>All patients included in the experimental group should be on prophylactic treatment with FVIII / FIX concentrates. Likewise, the factor should be administered on the same day that they receive each of the fascial therapy treatment sessions. Each session will last approximately 50 minutes, with three physiotherapy sessions taking place over a period of 3 weeks. The treatment program includes 11 maneuvers that must be administered bilaterally:</description>

    <description>Subjects included in the control group will not receive physical therapy through fascial therapy and will continue with their usual routine of physical activity and exercise, and with the same pharmacological treatment regimen with FVIII / FIX. At the end of the study period the intervention will be applied under the same conditions as the experimental group, analyzing the overall sample at the end of the study.</description>
