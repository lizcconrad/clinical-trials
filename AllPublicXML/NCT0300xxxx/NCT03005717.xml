      Study LIPO-202-CL-31 is a multi center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of two different doses of LIPO-202 versus placebo on
      submental bulging due to subcutaneous fat. Approximately 150 participants of either gender
      who have a &quot;Moderate Bulge&quot; or &quot;Large Bulge&quot; in the submental fat (on Patient-Reported
      Submental Bulging Scale [PR-SBS] and Clinician-Reported Submental Bulging Scale [CR-SBS])
      will be recruited for this study.

      Potential subjects will present and complete the Screening Visit. All qualifying subjects
      will be randomized to one of three treatment groups and treated with up to 30 subcutaneous
      injections of the assigned study drug into submental fat, once a week for 8 weeks. Upon
      completion of treatment visits, subject will return to the clinic for a follow-up visit and
      end of study visit, one and four weeks after the last treatment. The number and pattern of
      injections will be based on the area (cm x cm) of submental fat at baseline. At each visit
      the subjects will also undergo an examination of the treatment area, collection of vital
      signs and questioning about possible adverse events (AEs).

      The study consists of 11 visits: a Screening Visit, eight Treatment Visits, a Follow up Visit
      and an End of Study Visit.
