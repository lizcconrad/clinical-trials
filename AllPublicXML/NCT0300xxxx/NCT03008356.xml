  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      supplementation with L-carnitine that is available both as an FDA-approved therapy for
      primary carnitine deficiency, as well as widely available as an over-the-counter ergogenic
      aid will improve wellbeing and function measured by questionnaires in patient with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

      based on our review of literature that addition of health coaching (HC) to L-carnitine will
      yield greater gains.

    <measure>Change in Exercise Capacity as Measured by the Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, end of 8 week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWT is a widely studied, standardized and widely utilized test that evaluates the global and integrated responses of all the systems involved during exercise, including the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems, systemic circulation, peripheral circulation, blood, neuromuscular units, and muscle metabolism. The self-paced 6MWT assesses the submaximal level of functional capacity. Most patients do not achieve maximal exercise capacity during the 6MWT; instead, they choose their own intensity of exercise and are allowed to stop and rest during the test.</description>

    <measure>Change in Health-Related Quality of Life as Measured by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, end of 8 week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The CRQ is a widely utilized and validated interviewer-administered questionnaire measuring both physical and emotional aspects of chronic respiratory disease. There are 20 questions, with each item graded on 7-point Likert scale. Scores can range from 20 to 100. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Change in Physical Fatigue as Measured by the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire (CFQ-11)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, end of 8 week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The CFQ-11 is a well-known, widely utilized and validated self-administered questionnaire for measuring the extent and severity of fatigue. The scoring incorporates two self-assessment scales measuring components indicative of physical fatigue [8 items] and mental fatigue [5 items]. The 11 individual items are scored from 0 (better than usual) to 3 (much worse than usual); total score range: 0-33.</description>

    <measure>Physical Activity as Measured by the SenseWear Armband</measure>
    <time_frame>end of 8 week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The SenseWear Armband system (Temple Healthcare) is a versatile arm-band monitor allowing convenient and accurate collection of raw data regarding energy expenditure, sleep duration and quality, physical activity and movement in subjects in a free-living environment, allowing them to go about their normal daily activities. Patients will be shown how to wear the activity monitor and be asked to use it for at least 5 days for 23 hours a day. They will be provided instructions and pre-paid shipping materials for wear and return of the monitor.</description>
