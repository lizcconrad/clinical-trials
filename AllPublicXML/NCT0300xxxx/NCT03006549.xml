  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite increasing interest in emergency manuals (EMs), relatively little is known about
      their effectiveness and limitations in the perioperative setting. Prior studies have been
      limited in that they evaluated EMs using crises that were tailor-made to match one of their
      chapters, and there has been minimal participation by attending surgeons and other
      experienced personnel. The Investigators' preliminary experience suggests less-than-expected
      EM use and suboptimal usage, which may be due to the simulation scenario falling &quot;halfway
      between&quot; two different chapters of the EM, raising the question of whether limitations were
      due to the EM content, team dynamics, or inadequate training in the EM use. In this
      randomized, prospective, two-center simulation-based study, the investigators utilize
      clinical scenarios specifically designed to observe the patterns of use and to test the
      limitations of the EMs. The hypothesis is that EMs may not improve, and may even worsen,
      clinical performance in situations that do not exactly match a specific chapter of that EM,
      and that EM usage patterns will identify both strengths and limitations of the tools and its
      implementation. The participating healthcare providers consisting of experienced surgeons,
      anesthesiologists, and nurses will be randomized into four experimental groups, each exposed
      to either a &quot;specific&quot; or &quot;non-specific&quot; simulation scenario, along with or without the
      availability of the EM. The major experimental endpoint will be how many &quot;critical actions&quot;
      each team performs, scored as the percentage of actions taken from a pre-determined list. The
      goal of this study is to improve EM content and use by understanding its limitations during
      interprofessional team-training simulations and to study whether EMs enhance or detract from
      clinical performance. This is especially a concern in situations that do not exactly match a
      specific chapter of the EM, such as cases that are vague and represent multi-factorial
      diagnostic dilemmas such as hypotension and hypoxemia. The ultimate goal is to strengthen
      patient safety by providing guidance for improving EM content, use, and training protocols.
