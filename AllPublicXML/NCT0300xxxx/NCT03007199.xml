  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AGNES case-control set consists of individuals with a first acute ST-elevation myocardial
      infarction. AGNES cases have ECG- registered ventricular fibrillation occurring before
      reperfusion therapy for an acute and first ST-elevation myocardial infarction. AGNES controls
      are individuals with a first acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction but without ventricular
      fibrillation. All cases and controls are recruited at seven heart centers in The Netherlands.
      The investigators' exclude individuals with an actual non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction,
      prior myocardial infarction, congenital heart defects, known structural heart disease, severe
      comorbidity, electrolyte disturbances, trauma at presentation, recent surgery, previous
      coronary artery bypass graft or use of class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs. Individuals who
      develop ventricular fibrillation during or after percutaneous coronary intervention are not
      eligible. Furthermore, because early reperfusion limits the opportunity of developing
      ventricular fibrillation, potential control subjects undergoing percutaneous coronary
      intervention within 2 h after onset of myocardial ischemia symptoms were not included. This
      time interval is based on the observation that &gt;90% of cases develop ventricular fibrillation
      within 2 h after onset of the complaint of symptoms.

        Cases are patients with a first ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) referred for
        primary percutaneous intervention (PCI), who develop ventricular fibrillation between the
        onset of acute myocardial infarction (chest pain, ECG changes) and reperfusion. Reperfusion
        can either be spontaneous or by PCI.

        Control patients are patients with a first STEMI, referred for PCI who do not develop
        ventricular fibrillation.
