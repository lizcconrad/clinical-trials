  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community colleges have 45% of the nation's undergraduates and have a higher smoking
      prevalence rate than 4-year colleges. California's community colleges comprise the nation's
      largest higher education system, and Sacramento has the second largest community college
      district. As more colleges are encouraged to become smoke and tobacco-free campuses, smokers
      enrolled at community college campuses need greater support. However, community colleges may
      lack the student health clinic resources that 4-year colleges have for students who live on
      campus. Little evidence to date demonstrates effective interventions for smokers on community
      college campuses.

      This pilot study seeks to demonstrate the feasibility and promising outcomes of two cessation
      interventions, compared with usual care on a community college campus. The first intervention
      was based on a promising model of brief motivational interviewing delivered by peer
      educators, developed by the community lead Breathe California of Sacramento-Emigrant Trails
      (BCSET) through the Sacramento Taking Action Against Tobacco Dependence (STAND) project. The
      second intervention was based on direct enrollment into the California Smokers' Helpline,
      which has demonstrated utility for promoting smoking cessation among young adults with low
      socioeconomic status. Usual care consisted of students going to the student health center for
      smoking cessation assistance.
