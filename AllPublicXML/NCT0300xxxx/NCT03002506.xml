      This study will help provide information about how patients with burn handle two antibiotics
      (ceftolozane and tazobactam) and use that information to guide dosing recommendations for
      these patients. The 12 patients who complete the study will receive a single dose of 3 grams
      ceftolozane/tazobactam intravenously. We will collect blood and urine samples to determine
      how much of each antibiotic is in the body and urine at various times over a 24 hour period.
      This information will be used with previously published information from microbiology
      laboratories to perform simulations that will provide recommendations on optimal dosing
      recommendations of these antibiotics in patients with burns.

      A single dose pharmacokinetic study of ceftolozane and tazobactam will be conducted in
      patients with burns at the Burn Center at Parkland Memorial Hospital. The Burn Center was
      established in 1962 and was expanded last year to include 12 intensive care unit beds and 18
      acute care beds. The Burn Center meets the criteria of the American Burn Association's Burn
      Center Verification/Consultation Program has Burn Center Verification status. A total of 12
      adults aged 18 to 80 years with &gt;/= 20% percent total body surface area burned will be
      required to complete the study. A single intravenous dose of ceftolozane and tazobactam of 2
      grams/1 gram will be administered over 60 minutes and whole blood will be obtained predose
      and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 24 hours following the start of infusion.
      Urine samples (5 ml) will be collected from a urine collection bag (if the patient has
      urinated) at the following timepoints: 0-0.5, 0.5-1, 1-2, 2-4, 4-8, 8-12, and 12-24 hours for
      analysis of ceftolozane and tazobactam content. Urine for collected during each time period
      will be measured to determine urine volume for urine clearance calculations. The volume of
      urine in the urine over the entire 24 hour period and an aliquot sent for analysis of urine
      creatinine content to determine the patient's 24 hour creatinine clearance.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects, ages 18-80 years, of all racial and ethnic origins.

          2. Non-English Spanish speakers will be included in the study.

          3. We are recruiting 12 patients with thermal burn injuries (percent total body surface
             area burned &gt;/= 20%). Patients will be at least five days from the date of the burn
             injury.

          4. Patients will have central venous or arterial line access.

          5. Patients will be already be receiving standard of care antimicrobial therapy for a
             suspected infection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or nursing or unwilling to use a reliable contraception method during the
             study. The effects of ceftolozane and tazobactam on pregnancy are unknown. In
             addition, the metabolic changes that accompany pregnancy may alter the
             concentration-time profile of ceftolozane and tazobactam, so that the pregnancy and
             post-partum state would be a confounding variable.

          2. Abnormal liver function tests: transaminases &gt;10 times upper limit of normal, Alkaline
             phosphatase &gt;5 times upper limit of normal, total bilirubin &gt;5 times upper limit of
             normal.

          3. History of allergies to beta-lactam antibiotics.

          4. Patients unwilling to comply with study procedures.

          5. Current or previous participation within 28 days of enrollment in another research
             study that involves the use of medication, contrast, or any other compound that may
             alter blood count and/or blood chemistry (liver function, kidney function or
             electrolyte balance), unless waved by principal investigator (PI).

          6. Donation of 450mL (one unit) of blood or more within 8 weeks (56 days) prior to study
             enrollment, unless waved by PI.

          7. Creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min as estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation.

          8. Patients who are receiving piperazillin/tazobactam or have received
             piperacillin/tazobactam within the past 48 hours.

          9. Patients who are receiving vasopressors.

         10. Patients with a total body weight &lt; 60 kg or &gt; 130 kg.
