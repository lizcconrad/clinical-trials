  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Australia was one of the countries to implement a universal school-based male vaccination
      program - in 2013. This research project will examine the prevalence of HPV among young men
      who have sex with men (MSM) who have been offered school-based HPV vaccination.

      HYPER-2, will be a cross-section study, using the same recruitment and testing strategies
      used in HYPER 1, which determined the prevalence of anal, genital and oral HPV among men who
      have sex with men aged 16-20 years. Given the differing age groups that will have been
      offered vaccination over the 2 study period, men aged 16-19 will be recruited in the first
      year (2017) and men aged 16-20 will be recruited in the second year (2018) to ensure that the
      participants included in the HYPER-2 study would have been eligible for the free male HPV
      vaccine in Australia. A total of 200 men will be recruited over a 2-year period, and HPV
      vaccination status for each participant will be verified against the National HPV Vaccination
      Program Register.

      This 2-year cross-sectional study will recruit men who report sex with men aged from 16 to 20
      years.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome of interest will be the prevalence of quadrivalent vaccine types (6, 11, 16 and 18) among 16-20 year old MSM and comparison of these with non-quadrivalent vaccine HPV types which would be expected to remain high unless there is significant cross protection. Oral, penile, and anal HPV prevalence will be calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Persistent HPV infection</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Detection of same HPV type at the same site at both visits (day 0 and 7). The objective of repeat sampling at day 7 is to investigate whether this might distinguish transient HPV detection from infection. A brief questionnaire will be self-completed by participants at day 7 to ascertain whether there has been any sexual re-exposure between day 0 and 7 that might explain repeat HPV positivity at day 7.</description>
