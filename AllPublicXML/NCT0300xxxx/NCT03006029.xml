  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended
      Phase 2 dose of TAB08 when administered intravenously (i.v.) to patients with advanced solid
      malignancies.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, sequential groups, dose escalation study of TAB08 in
      patients with metastatic or unresectable advanced solid malignancies. The study will consist
      of 2 parts: a dose-escalation part with a standard &quot;3+3&quot; design, followed by a dose-expansion
      part once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been determined.

      Patients must have documented recurrent or refractory solid tumors; patients enrolled in the
      dose-expansion part of the trial must have least one lesion that may qualify as a target
      lesion based on the RECIST 1.1 criteria. Following the provision of signed informed consent,
      patients will be screened for entry into the study.

             consent.

          2. Subjects must have histological or cytological evidence of a solid neoplasm for which

             lesion.
