  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Serum vitamin A (VA) concentration is not an authenticate indicator of VA status, while
      existing deuterium- VA isotope dilution methods to determine whole body VA status require 3
      weeks and not applicable for infants and children. Our research group has recently developed
      a new simplified equation to measure VA pool size in 4-5 days, highly correlated with
      compartmental model-predicted value and estimate VA pool size in adults with high precision.
      However, it is not clear whether this new simplified equation also works in infants and
      children. In this proposed study, we validate the method in healthy infants with or without
      inflammatory condition.

      Hypothesis:

      Whole-body VA status in infant can be estimated without accounting for fractional catabolic
      rate in the context of inflammatory condition in infants

      Methods:

      At firstly we need to undertake one feasibility study to verify whether the oral dose of 400
      μg 13C10 or 13C3- retinyl acetate (isotopic VA) that we propose to use in this study would
      work in infants as we observed in adults, secondly, whether PENTA valent vaccines induce
      inflammation in infants (plasma CRP as maker) that closely mimics natural infection. To
      minimize the taking of multiple blood samples from each infant, a &quot;super kid study&quot; design
      will be adopted that ensure no more than 2 venous blood samples from each infant, even though
      multiple time points (at least 5 subjects / time-point) over a 28-day study period will be
      available for mathematical modelling. A total of 115 infants (9-11 mo) will receive an oral
      dose of 13C10- retinyl acetate (400 μg) dissolved in 0.5 mL of sunflower oil and then blood
      samples will be taken from 6h to 16th day at 9 different time-points. On day 16, a single
      dose PENTA vaccine will be provided to the randomly selected 50% of infants. On day 17,
      another type of stable isotopic VA e.g. 13C3- retinyl acetate (400 μg) will be orally
      supplemented to all infants. Blood sample will be collected from day 16 to day 28 at 11
      different time-points for each of the vaccine and non-vaccine groups. Specific activity of
      13C10-VA and 13C3-VA from the blood samples will be measured by liquid chromatography-tandem
      mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS).

      without inflammation
