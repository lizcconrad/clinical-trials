  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the RCT is to analyse clinical and histopathological particularities for
      excisional biopsies of fibrous hyperplasia in the buccal mucosa performed with Er:YAG laser,
      CO2 laser and scalpel. The primary outcome parameter is to evaluate the thermal damage zone
      on the excised specimens. Secondary parameters are time of surgery, intraoperative bleeding,
      the need for additional electrocoagulation or sutures and patient's postsurgical perception
      of pain, other postsurgical effects and use of analgesics.

    <description>Biopsy specimens fixed in a 4% neutral-buffered formalin solution, embedded in paraffin, sectioned in slices of 5 μm, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin.
Measurements of the thermal damage zone (in μm) on histopathological specimens by pathologist, blinded to the surgical method used. Measurements of the maximal and the minimal thermal damage zone on a representative section on both lateral edges of the fibrous hyperplasia.</description>

    <measure>Postoperative Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Registration of pain on VAS scale (ranging 0-100) during 14 days. The first VAS value was filled in before surgery, the second value in the evening after surgery and then on each of the following days on a study form handed out to patient.
Intake of Analgesic (type, dose) are also filled in by patient on the study form i a specific section.</description>
