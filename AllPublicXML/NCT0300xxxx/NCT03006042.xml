  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The transversus abdominis plane block (TAP block) is an effective method of postoperative
      pain management after cesarean section (C-section). Up to now, there are no data available
      about bupivacaine (BPV) plasma levels after TAP block in adults. In the current study, the
      investigators aimed to assess BPV pharmacokinetic parameters after ultrasound-guided TAP
      block using BPV in parturients undergoing C-section and to report its effects on corrected QT
      interval.

      The investigators led a prospective observational study in pregnant women undergoing elective
      C-section under spinal anesthesia (SA) using 10 mg of hyperbaric BPV. After surgery, they
      received bilateral ultrasound-guided TAP block with 50 mg of BPV in each side. Venous blood
      samples were collected immediately before and at 10, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 720 and
      1440 minutes after both TAP blocks. The investigators used high performance liquid
      chromatography (HPLC) to measure BPV total plasma concentrations. Mean BPV area under the
      curve (AUC) was calculated from 0 to 24 hours according to the linear trapezoidal rule. Mean
      peak of total BPV plasma concentration (Cmax) and time to reach the peak (Tmax) were
      recorded. Electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings were also repeated at 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours to
      investigate the effect of BPV on corrected QT (QTc) intervals. Data were computed using SPSS
      20®. Quantitative data were expressed as means ± SD. Qualitative data were expressed as
      percentages.
