             at least 3 months), involving at least 10% and up to 20% of the body surface area (not
             including the head [ scalp, face], hands, feet, and intertriginous areas).

          4. Subjects with an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) of disease severity of at
             least moderate severity (score ≥ 3) as an overall assessment.

          5. Subjects with a target lesion which has the following characteristics:

               1. located on the extremities (i.e., arms or legs ) and has an area of ≥25 cm2;

               2. has a minimum plaque erythema of at least moderate severity (PASI grade ≥ 3);

               3. has a minimum plaque scaling severity of at least moderate severity (PASI grade ≥
                  3);

               4. has a minimum plaque elevation of at least moderate severity (PASI grade ≥ 3);

          6. If females of childbearing potential, the subject must have a negative urine pregnancy
             test, and must have been using an acceptable form of birth control for at least two
             months prior to Visit 1/Screening and are willing to continue birth control throughout
             the study.

          7. Subjects must be willing and able to understand and comply with the requirements of
             the study, apply the assigned investigational product as instructed, return for the
             required treatment period visits, comply with therapy prohibitions, and be able to
             complete the study.

          8. Subjects must be in good health, as confirmed by medical history and physical exam,
             and free from any clinically significant disease/condition, other than plaque
             psoriasis, that might interfere with the study evaluations.

          9. Subjects must be willing to limit sun exposure overall. Subjects are prohibited from
             sunbathing or intentional tanning or intense sun exposure including the use of tanning
             booths/lights or other artificial UV light sources throughout the study.

             plaque psoriasis (e.g., atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, tinea corporis,
             cutaneous lymphoma, etc.).

          5. Presence of pigmentation, extensive scarring, or pigmented lesions in the treatment
             areas, which could interfere with the rating of efficacy parameters.

          6. Subjects with unstable medical disorders, life-threatening disease, or current
             malignancies.

          7. Subjects with clinically significant ECG or laboratory abnormalities at Visit
