  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is one of established treatments in the end stage renal disease
      patients. Volume overload is a predictor of mortality in PD patients. In this Randomized
      controlled trial, the investigators use the Body Composition Monitor (BCM), a multifrequency
      bioimpedance device, to measure the level of overhydration in PD patients and explore its
      value in fluid management in peritoneal dialysis patients as well as their prognosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Optimal fluid management is one of the primary objectives of dialysis treatment, and there is
      significant concern that peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients can become progressively
      fluid-loaded with time on treatment, especially as residual kidney function declines. Body
      Composition Monitor (BCM) has the potential to enable better management of fluid balance. The
      investigators undertake a prospective, randomized, open-label, controlled trial to determine
      whether availability of longitudinal BCM measures help clinicians maintain stable fluid
      status over 24 months in 300 peritoneal dialysis patients.
