  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a randomised open-label parallel study involving women with polycystic ovary syndrome
      (PCOS). The patients will be randomised either to metformin 1500mg or empagliflozin 25mg
      daily for three months. The aim of the study is to examine the effect of empagliflozin on
      hormonal, metabolic and cardiovascular risk markers and quality of life in women with PCOS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a very common condition in women that may present with
      irregular periods, excessive hair growth on the face and body, acne and cysts in the ovaries.
      PCOS is also associated with increased risk of problems later in life like diabetes, high
      cholesterol levels and heart disease.

      In this study, a medication named Empagliflozin will be tested. Empagliflozin belongs to a
      class of medicines known as SGLT-2 inhibitors. SGLT-2 stands for sodium glucose
      co-transporter 2. Empagliflozin, in simple terms, helps in reducing high blood glucose levels
      by increasing the amount of glucose passed in your urine. This medicine is usually used in
      patients with type 2 diabetes and has led to improved blood pressure and weight loss in
      addition to improving blood glucose levels.

      We want to give Empagliflozin to women with PCOS to see its effect on hormones related to
      PCOS and the risk factors for diabetes and heart disease. We will be comparing its effects to
      metformin (another drug for diabetes) which has already been used in PCOS with very good
      results.
