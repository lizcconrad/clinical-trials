    <textblock>
      To everyone knows, more and more patients received repeated caesarean section in China.
      However, at present it is not known what is it like about their postoperative pain intensity,
      and is it different from those patients who received primary caesarean section. Thus through
      postoperative follow-up, the current study aimed to investigate and compare the postoperative
      pain between patients received primary and repeated caesarean section.

      According to whether or not to receive repeated caesarean patients were grouped into group P
      or group R. For all maternal,standardized epidural anesthesia and caesarean section were
      performed. Then the pain VAS scores and Ramsay scores at 4h, 8h, 12h, 24h and 48h after the
      surgery were recorded. And sleep quality at 1 day and 2 day after the surgery were recorded.
      In addition, pain situation at 1 week and 4 weeks after the surgery was followed up.
