  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and the reliability of a
      telemonitoring system during pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with chronicle obstructive
      pulmonary disease.

      The feasibility is assessed using the patient's satisfaction and it ease of use.

      The reliability of the remote telemonitoring system is assessed comparing the local data
      (extracted from the monitoring device itself) and the data transmitted through the
      telemonitoring platform.

    <measure>Reliability between the heart rate (HR) acquired directly with the oximeter (Nonin 3150) and HR provided by the telemedicine gateway during the 1st session of 45 of aerobic training.</measure>

    <description>5 consecutive patients with chronicle obstructive pulmonary disease are offered to participate in the protocol when they have reached 45 min of aerobic training during their pulmonary rehabilitation program.
During 5 sessions of 45 min, they are monitored with an oximeter device (Nonin 3150) which records heart rate (HR) and oxygen transcutaneous saturation (SpO2). The device also communicates with a telemedicine medical gateway which sends these data to a remote telemedicine center. Data are then provided on a secured online platform and compared with data recorded on the device (Nonin 3150).</description>
