    <textblock>
      Given recent increasing opioid-related deaths and evidence showing against the use of opioids
      for non-malignant chronic pain, there is growing need for non-narcotic pain management.
      Fibromyalgia is a difficult to treat chronic pain condition that is often treated with
      opioids despite existing evidence. The prevalence of fibromyalgia is increased among Veterans
      returning from the gulf war and is already a significant burden in senior Veterans who may
      have suffered with chronic pain for decades already. Many treatment options for fibromyalgia
      carry intolerable side effects. PENFS (percutaneous electrical neural field stimulation) is a
      FDA-approved, non-pharmacologic therapy that is currently utilized within the military and VA
      system, but sufficient evidence regarding its outcomes and neural mechanisms have not been
      adequately investigated. An understanding of its neural underpinnings and analgesic effects
      could lead to 1) improvements in pain management and quality of life, 2) cost-savings and 3)
      development of new techniques to address pain.

      BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain syndrome that consists of chronic widespread pain,
      decreased physical function, fatigue, psychoemotional/sleep disturbances, and various somatic
      complaints, affecting anywhere from 5-10 million Americans, with ~1,500 Veterans carrying a
      diagnosis of fibromyalgia seen per year at the Atlanta VAMC alone. It is estimated that
      fibromyalgia costs the American population over $20 billion/year in lost wages and
      disability. Initial therapies often include complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)
      therapies, which are generally considered safe, although their efficacy has not been
      thoroughly evaluated for fibromyalgia. Thus, non-pharmacologic alternatives require more
      rigorous scientific investigation for the treatment of fibromyalgia. There is evidence to
      support the use of percutaneous electrical neural stimulation (PENS) in the treatment of pain
      conditions, which may have increased effects relative to acupuncture based on systematic
      reviews. While fMRI data for acupuncture and fibromyalgia exists, no such data exists for
      PENS treatment. An evolved form of PENS, percutaneous electrical neural field stimulation
      (PENFS) of the auricle is already used in the military and VA systems for the treatment of
      chronic pain, but evidence regarding its mechanisms and effects is lacking. Stimulation of
      the vagus nerve, which has auricular branches, has been previously studied for pain relief in
      fibromyalgia. However, application of PENS-type stimulation to the auricle has not been
      previously studied with fMRI, and this type of therapy may lead to neural changes worthy of
      further exploration. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of using fMRI as a biomarker for
      the neural substrates of pain and functional changes following PENFS treatments. HYPOTHESIS:
      PENFS will result in decreased functional connectivity between the insula and default mode
      network as evaluated by fMRI, which will correlate to more significant improvements in pain
      and function relative to standard therapy for fibromyalgia. METHODS: Subjects who meet study
      criteria will receive baseline assessments including resting state fMRI, collection of
      biobehavioural information such as cognitive and psychological assessments on standardized
      forms, eating, sleeping and drinking habits, Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS),
      PROMIS measures, arm curl, 30-s chair stand, and handgrip strength tests, [measures from the
      realms &quot;Activity and Participation&quot; from the International Classification of Functioning,
      Disability, and Health,] and baseline analgesic consumption. Subjects will be stratified
      based on age and gender and then divided into standard therapy control (medication management
      and physical therapy) or PENFS (series of 4, weekly) treatments and assessed for fMRI changes
      2 weeks after the final treatment. Pain and function will also be assessed at the 2 weeks, 6
      weeks and 12 weeks following the final treatment. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: [Auricular PENFS has
      not been studied with fMRI. Stimulation of the auricle may produce neural changes that differ
      from traditional therapies. Understanding the underlying neural mechanisms of auricular PENFS
      could assist in developing targeted treatments for fibromyalgia and chronic pain.] Further,
      if PENFS can significantly improve pain relief and function over standard therapies, it could
      decrease the need for opioid analgesics and their associated risks, which is a primary
      objective of the VA Opioid Safety Initiative. The present investigation will not only serve
      to elucidate neural changes with PENFS, but could be directly applicable to our Veterans
      suffering from fibromyalgia by providing evidence regarding the relative effectiveness of
      this already clinically-employed non-pharmacologic treatment (or lack thereof), and result in
      evidence-based implementation and potential cost savings to the VA system.

    <description>Veterans with fibromyalgia who meet study criteria and are randomized to the experimental group will receive standard therapy in addition to percutaneous electrical neural field stimulation (PENFS), which involves placement of small electrodes through a similar process to ear acupuncture to the ear. These electrodes are attached to a battery pack that is taped behind the ear and worn for 5-day intervals. The intention of this FDA-approved device is to relieve pain, though data on its effectiveness is still limited. Device placement (series of 4, weekly) will be performed by an Anesthesiology Pain Clinic provider. fMRI evaluation of neural changes, assessment of function and quality of life improvements will be performed at the beginning and end of the study.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be male and female Veterans age 20-60 with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia
             as diagnosed by a clinician, by chart review, and by the most recent American College
             of Rheumatology 2010 criteria for the diagnosis of fibromyalgia. 70,71

          -  Subjects must self-report consistent, daily pain (greater than 5 on the VAS) &gt;90 days.

          -  Subjects must have intact skin free of infection at the site of implantation.

          -  Subjects must be willing to participate and understand the consent.

          -  Subjects must be right-handed in order to provide consistency in brain structure and
             function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must not be currently pregnant, since effects of fMRI and electrical current
             on the developing fetus are not well-known.

          -  Subjects must not have an implanted electrical device such as a vagal stimulator,
             pacemaker, or spinal pain pump, which are not compatible with MRI.

          -  Subjects must not have a history of seizures or neurologic condition that may alter
             the structure of the brain.

          -  Subjects must not have a history of drug abuse or severe, uncontrolled psychiatric
             illness such as schizophrenia or major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation.

          -  Subjects must not have psoriasis vulgaris or other skin conditions that may increase
             the risk of infection at the implantation site.

          -  Subjects must not have severe anxiety, claustrophobia, or other conditions that may
             prevent their ability to lie at rest in an MRI scanner. This will be determined after
             discussion with the patient regarding their own perceived ability to lie at rest in an
             MRI scanner without the use of additional sedating medications.

          -  Subjects must not introduce new medications or treatments for fibromyalgia symptoms
             during the course of the study to prevent confounding results.

          -  Subjects must not have a concurrent autoimmune or inflammatory disease that causes
             pain such as systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid
             arthritis, since this could decrease the effect of treatment.
