    <textblock>
      The trial enrolls patients with moderate to severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). The primary
      goal of the trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IFX-1 administered over 8
      weeks in these patients. In addition the trial aims to characterize the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of IFX-1 as well as to generate preliminary data on the efficacy of IFX-1 on
      clinical endpoints (e.g., Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR), Dermatology
      Life Quality Index (DLQI), Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for disease, VAS for pain, Hidradenitis
      Suppurativa - Physician's Global Assessment (HS-PGA), Modified Sartorius Score (mSS)).
