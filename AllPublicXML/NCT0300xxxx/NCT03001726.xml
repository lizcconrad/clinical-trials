      Investigators assessed the effectiveness of conversional gastrectomy compared with
      chemotherapy alone following docetaxel, oxalipaltin and S1 therapy for advanced gastric
      cancer with a single non-curable factor.

    <textblock>
      Palliative chemotherapy is still the standard of care for incurable advanced gastric cancer.
      Several retrospective, single institutional studies have shown that the addition of
      gastrectomy to chemotherapy might improve patient survival among patients with metastatic
      gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor. However, REGATTA trial, a phase 3,
      randomized controlled trial, concluded an opposite conclusion that gastrectomy followed by
      chemotherapy did not show any survival benefit compared with chemotherapy alone in advanced
      gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor. Interestingly, five patients initially
      assigned to chemotherapy alone in the study had got survival benefit form gastrectomy with
      curative intent because of complete disappear of all non-curable factors during chemotherapy.
      This finding raised the question as to conversional radical surgery following upfront
      chemotherapy could be a possible treatment option. We assessed the effectiveness of
      conversional radical surgery following docetaxel, oxalipaltin and S1 therapy for advanced
      gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor.
