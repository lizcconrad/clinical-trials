  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-agent, open label, one-arm phase 2 pilot study of avelumab in patients with
      advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the small intestine.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objectives

        -  To describe any antitumor activity of avelumab monotherapy, as measured by the response
           rate in patients with advanced or metastatic small intestinal adenocarcinoma.

        -  To describe the safety profile of avelumab monotherapy in patients with advanced or
           metastatic small intestinal adenocarcinoma.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine overall survival, progression-free survival, and duration of response of
           avelumab monotherapy in patients with advanced small intestinal adenocarcinoma.

        -  To evaluate the association of tumor PD-L1 and PD-1 expression, MSI status, lymphocytic
           infiltration, and somatic mutation burden with response.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent.

          -  Male or female ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1.

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the small intestine that is advanced (not
             amenable to surgery) or metastatic (clinical stage IV). Note: Tumors such as ampullary
             carcinoma or duodenal cancer having intestinal features upon pathological examination
             are eligible.

          -  At least one prior systemic treatment (including neoadjuvant therapy) for
             adenocarcinoma of the small intestine, with intolerance to prior therapy, failure of
             the most recent therapy (of any line) or recurrent disease.

          -  At least one measurable lesion as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria that has not been previously irradiated and which
             can be followed by CT or MRI.

          -  Adequate organ function including:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 109/L

               -  Platelets ≥ 100 × 109/L

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9/g/dL (may have been transfused)

               -  Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) ≤
                  2.5 × ULN (or ≤ 5 × ULN if liver metastases are present)

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min as
                  calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) equation

          -  Archival tissue [paraffin block(s) or unstained slides from paraffin block(s)] from
             the primary tumor and/or a metastatic site judged reasonably available prior to
             initiating treatment, or willingness to undergo fresh pre-treatment tumor biopsy.
             (Prior to initiating treatment, the screening team must have documentation that an
             archival or fresh tumor specimen has been requested from a local or outside facility.
             However, physical possession of requested tissue or waiting for histological analysis
             or confirmation that an acquired specimen contains tumor tissue sufficient for
             analysis is not a requirement prior to initiating treatment.) If no archival tissue is
             available and patient consents to a fresh biopsy, but the patient's lesion is deemed
             inaccessible to safe biopsy, the patient will be allowed to enroll if otherwise
             eligible.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential and male patients able to father children
             who have female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use one highly
             effective method (defined as less than 1% failure rate per year) and one additional
             effective method of contraception (Appendix 4) from 15 days prior to first trial
             treatment administration until at least 60 days after study participant's final dose
             of avelumab.

                  sterile or post-menopausal (i.e. patient has not had a bilateral tubal ligation,
                  a bilateral oophorectomy, or a complete hysterectomy; or has not been amenorrheic
                  for 12 months without an alternative medical cause). Post-menopausal status in
                  females under 55 years of age should be confirmed with a serum
                  follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level within laboratory reference range for
                  postmenopausal women.

               -  Male patients able to father children are defined as those who are not surgically
                  sterile (i.e. patient has not had a vasectomy).

          -  Serum pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential) negative at screening.

          -  Re-enrollment of a subject that has discontinued the study as a pre-treatment screen

             re-enrolled, the subject must be re-consented. Only the screening procedures performed
             outside of protocol-specified timing must be repeated.

        Exclusion Criteria:

               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses ≤10 mg/day of prednisone or
                  equivalent are permitted;

               -  A brief (less than 3 weeks) course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g. CT
                  scan premedication against contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of

             (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior; or laboratory
             abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             treatment administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results
             and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for
             entry into this study.
