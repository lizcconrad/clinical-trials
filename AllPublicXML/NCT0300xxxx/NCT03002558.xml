      Objectives:

      Main objective: To assess the impact of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and its treatment on
      cardiovascular outcomes (morbidity and mortality) in patients with resistant hypertension
      (RH).

      Secondary objectives: i) to identify the subclinical organ damage profile at baseline and its
      association with OSA, and to identify if long term blood pressure control and number of
      antihypertensive drugs needed is different depending on OSA diagnosis and its treatment; ii)
      to identify epigenetic profiles and clinical, biological and polygraphic variables with a
      predictive value for cardiovascular outcomes in RH patients with OSA; iii) to validate the
      HIPARCO-SCORE tool in men in an independent cohort and elaborate a new tool to be used in
      women; and iv) to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate the impact of OSA
      diagnosis and treatment in patients with RH.

      Methodology: Prospective cohort study. 1,371 RH patients will be recruited. Ambulatory blood
      pressure monitoring (ABPM), socio-demographic, clinical, OSA-related, biochemical and
      subclinical organ damage variables and biological samples at baseline will be collected from
      all the subjects included. A sleep study will be performed in all the subjects at the study
      inclusion date. Subsequently, the OSA subjects will be managed as per local standard
      practice. Follow-up variables will be annually collected (including blood samples). On the
      basis of OSA and its treatment, three cohorts of RH subjects will be defined: control
      (non-OSA), OSA-treated and OSA nontreated.

      A minimum follow-up of 5 years has been established. During the follow-up, an annually
      programmed visit will be carried on to all patients, collecting variables from subjects'
      interview in the office.The baseline and follow-up variables will be collected using
      questionnaires.

      The variables that will be collected are:

      BP variables; Anthropometric variables; Compliance with CPAP in the case of CPAP-treated OSA
      patients; blood samples extraction; outcomes (heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, kidney
      disease, vascular disease). All the cardiovascular events will be independently evaluated by
      two doctors to establish a diagnostic. In case of discordance a third external doctor will
      assess the case. The date of each event will be recorded.
