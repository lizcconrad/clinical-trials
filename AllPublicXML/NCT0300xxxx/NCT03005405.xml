  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol aims to assess the cost-efficacy and applicability of the treatment of lesions
      moderate caries using sealants as an alternative to the restorations on occlusal surfaces of
      deciduous teeth. Initially, a non-inferiority study was designed in order to verify if
      sealing could be non-inferior than restoration. In this case, it could be preferable since it
      is less invasive. Therefore, cost will be put forward into the analysis considering even
      reintervention during the follow-ups (cost-efficacy analyses). Finally, the acceptability
      could be another differential point between treatments.

      This study aims to evaluate the cost-efficacy and applicability of the treatment of lesions
      moderate caries using sealants as an alternative to the restorations on occlusal surfaces of
      deciduous teeth. 96 children aged 3-6 years will be selected. Children must have at least one
      occlusal surface classified as scores 3 or 4 of International Caries Detection and Assessment
      System (ICDAS). Children will be randomly allocated according to the treatment: glass ionomer
      sealant and restoration with glass ionomer. After treatment, teeth will be assessed
      clinically after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months by trained and blinded examiners regarding the
      treatment received. The need of reintervention initially treated, either by failures that
      require repeating of the same procedure or for progression of caries lesions will be
      considered as primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes will be the chil's acceptability to
      the treatment.

After cleaning, It will be analyzed the clinical evaluation of restorations and sealants, will be assessed the presence of caries lesions in dentin and / or evolution of ICDAS scores and if will be necessary other types of treatment, such as endodontics and extraction of teeth included.</description>
