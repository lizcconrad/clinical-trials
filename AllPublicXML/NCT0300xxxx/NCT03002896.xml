  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project is a pilot randomized control trial of the Pep-Pal (Psychoeducation and
      Skills Based Intervention) versus a treatment as usual control group. A total of 120
      caregivers; 40 caregivers of patients with HSCT (Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation), 40
      caregivers of patients enrolled in phase I oncology trials, and 40 caregivers of patients
      with advanced cancer (Stage IV, solid tumor) will be enrolled in this study. The
      investigators do not expect different outcomes from these three groups, rather these
      populations are selected to optimize recruitment within a short time frame. The caregivers
      will be randomized to either treatment as usual or Pep-Pal intervention.

      The proposed project is a pilot randomized control trial of the Pep-Pal intervention versus a
      treatment as usual control group. A total of 120 caregivers; 40 caregivers of patients with
      HSCT, 40 caregivers of patients enrolled in phase I oncology trials, and 40 caregivers of
      patients with advanced cancer (Stage IV, solid tumor) will be enrolled in this study. The
      investigators do not expect different outcomes from these three groups, rather these
      populations are selected to optimize recruitment within a short time frame. The caregivers
      will be randomized to either treatment as usual or Pep-Pal intervention. The proposed study
      population is based on prior research indicating that caregivers of patients receiving HSCT,
      caregivers of patients enrolled in phase I oncology trials, and caregivers of patients with
      advanced cancer experience significant distress. In addition, an initial study of caregivers
      of patients receiving allogeneic-HSCT were able to benefit from a brief, cognitive behavioral
      stress management treatment approach. A study examining distress in phase I oncology clinical
      trial patient caregivers highlighted the need for more support for this significantly
      distressed population. Furthermore, initial results of the qualitative development study for
      Pep-Pal yielded support for a mobilized platform delivery of resources for caregivers to
      manage distress because they acknowledged many barriers to engaging in in-person treatment to
      manage distress.

    <description>Qualitative feedback will be gathered from the first 15 Pep-Pal completer's for individual interviews (5 from Phase I group, 5 from Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) group, 5 from medical oncology) upon completion of the follow-up assessments at 12 weeks about usage, acceptability of content, and impressions of using Pep-Pal.</description>

    <description>The Investigators will assess feasibility by examining recruitment, retention, as well as reasons for refusal, frequency of sessions watched and length of time spent watching each session. Self report usage of peppal: Usage of Pep-Pal will be quantitatively assessed by asking each participant in the intervention group about their usage including frequency; how many times they watched each session and length of viewing for each session (partial or complete). They will be asked to rate level of usage based on a Likert-scale ranging from not at all to very often for each session (0-10). They will be asked to rank order the list of sessions from most helpful to least helpful.</description>

    <description>If the caregiver is assigned to the Pep-Pal intervention condition, the RA will provide access to the mobilized website (passcode) through an email. Caregivers will be instructed to watch each session at least once. It will be recommended that caregivers watch one to two new sessions per week so that they can have enough time to practice the skills between sessions. In addition, they will be told that they can go back and watch the sessions for review as many times as they like. Full participation will be defined as watching at least 7/9 sessions (75% of program) based on previous criteria for similar intervention completion in a prior trial with advanced cancer patients.</description>

    <description>Pep-Pal is designed to complement the utilization of other resources, provide support when no other resources can be obtained, or provide support in the interim until greater resources can be obtained. In this way, Pep-Pal is a resource for our most hard to reach caregivers.</description>
