  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of infographics, compared to standard
      PLS and scientific abstract format, in presenting information, in terms of understanding and
      remembering research results by physicians.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with three different
      formats of the same systematic review summary (Infographics, PLS, scientific abstract). The
      content of these three formats is based on the same systematic review, but the ways of data
      presentation will differ: visual presentation in plain language, plain language only, and
      text with scientific abbreviations. The interventions will be delivered online in January
      2016, with physicians who are currently working at Clinical Hospital Split. The trial will be
      preformed online, and it will be voluntary and anonymous. The survey will consist of 5 parts,
      in the following order: 1) one format of the summary (randomly assigned), 2) health numeracy,
      3) demographic data 4) comprehension test of the information given in the summary, and 5)
      user friendliness of information and overall satisfaction with the given summary assessed by
      survey.

    <description>This section of the survey will include 5 questions about the experience of participants about the text they read, measured on a 10-point Likert type scale, where 1 means do not agree at all and 10 means fully agree. The total score is the sum of scores on all five answers (maximum 50).</description>

    <description>This section of the survey will have 5 questions concerning how easy it was for the participant to find relevant information, measured by a10-point Likert type scale where the answer 1 means I do not agree at all and 10 means I fully agree. The total score is the sum of scores on all the answers (maximum 50).</description>

    <measure>Health numeracy</measure>
    <time_frame>One month (30 days)</time_frame>
    <description>This section will use 6-item General health numeracy test (Osborne et al., 2013) in order to determine how much our participants understand the basic health instructions regarding numeracy dimension. For each correct answer, the participants receive one point and the total score is the sum of all correct answers.</description>
