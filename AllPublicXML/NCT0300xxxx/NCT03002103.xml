  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized, and controlled trial to test the
      superiority of EndoTAG®-1 in combination with paclitaxel and gemcitabine versus paclitaxel in
      combination with gemcitabine.

      An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be established to decide on the
      recommended dose (RD) of EndoTAG®-1, paclitaxel and gemcitabine to be used throughout the
      trial and to monitor the patients' safety and treatment efficacy data

             requirements.

          3. Metastatic TNBC confirmed histologically by a certified local laboratory (or existing
             medical record for confirmation is acceptable for patients in the safety run-in stage)
             using archival paraffinated material from the original surgery specimens or from later
             materials, if available. Results of the certified local laboratory must be available
             to allow for randomization.

             Tumors should be considered negative for ER and PrR by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (&lt;
             1% positive tumor nuclei, as per American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of
             American Pathologists [ASCO/CAP] guideline recommendations, Hammond et al 2010) and
             negative for HER2 by IHC or fluorescent or chromogenic in situ hybridization (FISH or
             CISH). Patients with equivocal HER2 results by IHC should have the negativity status
             confirmed by FISH.

          4. Patients must have had prior adjuvant treatment with either sequential or concurrent
             anthracycline- and/or taxane-based chemotherapy. Patients may have received

             chemotherapy as well.

          5. Patients with a disease-free interval (DFI) on anthracycline- and/or taxane-based

             are allowed to participate in the study).

          3. Major surgery &lt; 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

             would prohibit the understanding and giving of informed consent, or would interfere in
             the clinical and radiological evaluation of central nervous system during the trial.

         15. Concurrent treatment with other experimental products. Participation in another
             clinical trial with any investigational product within 30 days prior to study entry.
