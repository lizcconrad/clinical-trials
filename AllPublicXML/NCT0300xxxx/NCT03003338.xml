  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 1:1 randomized double-blind Placebo-controlled moncenter Phase IV study to
      investigate whether a successful interferon-free treatment of HCV-infection with
      ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (OBV/PTV/r) in combination with dasabuvir (DSV) improves
      the patients' attention ability as compared to placebo as measured with the Att Test Sum
      Score change from baseline to week 12. A total of 30 patients with non-cirrhotic genotype 1b
      HCV infection will be randomly assigned to receive 12 weeks verum followed by 12 weeks
      Placebo (arm A) versus 12 weeks Placebo followed by 12 weeks verum (arm B). Patients will be
      followed up for 48 weeks.

         10. Confirmation of chronic genotype 1b HCV infection documented by the following:

             Positive for anti-HCV antibody or HCV RNA at least 6 months before Screening, and
             positive for HCV RNA and anti-HCV antibody at the time of Screening

         11. Per local standard practice, documented results of:

          3. Pregnant or nursing female or male with pregnant female partner

          4. Recent (within 6-months prior to study drug administration) history of drug or alcohol
             abuse that could preclude adherence to the protocol.

          5. Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV; defined as HBsAg-positive) or human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

          6. Use of any medication that are contraindicated for use with OBV/PTV/r and DSV within 2

             colitis).

         11. Chronic liver disease of a non-HCV etiology (e.g., hemochromatosis, autoimmune
             hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, Wilson's disease, α1 antitrypsin deficiency,
             cholangitis)

         12. Difficulty with blood collection and/or poor venous access for the purposes of
             phlebotomy.

         13. Clinical hepatic decompensation (i.e., clinical ascites, encephalopathy or variceal
             hemorrhage).

         14. Solid organ transplantation.

         15. Significant pulmonary disease or significant cardiac disease.

         16. Significant drug allergy (such as anaphylaxis or hepatotoxicity).

         17. Contraindications for MRI study

         18. Screening laboratory analyses show any of the following abnormal laboratory results:

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 10 × upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 10 × ULN

               -  Calculated creatinine clearance (using CKD-EPI equal) &lt; 30 mL/min

         19. Screening ECG with clinically significant abnormalities

         20. Consideration by the Investigator, for any reason, that the subject is an unsuitable
             candidate to receive the study medication

         21. Donation or loss of more than 400 ml blood within 2 months prior to Baseline/Day 1
