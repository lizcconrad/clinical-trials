  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking and perhaps secondary smoking is associated with many perioperative and postoperative
      complications, especially respiratory events. Hypoxemia and airway damage can be associated
      with secondary smoking. The aim of study is to predict the incidence of hypoxemia and airway
      damage during one lung ventilation for lobectomy.

      Sixty patients undergoing lobectomy using one lung ventilation by double lumen tube will be
      included in this study. These patients will be divided into 2 groups. Groups S which will be
      included non smoking and secondary smoking and group SS which will be included secondary
      smoking ( smoking near him more than 10 cigarettes per day fore more than 5 years). Intra and
      postoperative arterial oxygen tension, arterial carbon dioxide tension and intraoperative
      peak airway pressure will be compared between the two groups.
