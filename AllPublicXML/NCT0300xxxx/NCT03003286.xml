    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a new treatment, Unstuck and On Target
      (UOT), works better, worse, or the same as the best treatment that is available now,
      Contingency Behavioral Management (CBM), for low income children with Autism Spectrum
      Disorder (ASD) or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

    <textblock>
      This project will compare the effectiveness of an innovative community-based
      cognitive-behavioral Executive Functioning (EF) treatment, Unstuck and On Target (UOT) to the
      current standard of care, a Contingency Behavioral Management (CBM) program in typically
      underserved children with ASD or ADHD. Minimizing the impact of EF deficits in these
      pediatric disorders has broad public health implications, providing the opportunity for
      improvement in the real-world, long-term outcomes that stakeholders have told the
      investigators are most important to them: more educational and vocational success, more
      functional independence and improved Activities of Daily Living skills, and better physical
      health, with reduced morbidity and mortality. The health disparity that this project
      addresses is the poorer outcomes and limited treatment choices associated with being a child
      from a low-income family who also has ADHD or ASD. The research questions are:

        1. Which works better for low-income children with ASD, UOT or CBM? Researchers will test
           the comparative effectiveness of UOT to CBM treatments with low-income children with
           ASD.

        2. Which works better for low-income children with ADHD, UOT or CBM? Researchers will test
           the comparative effectiveness of UOT to CBM with low-income children with ADHD, a new
           patient population for UOT.

        3. Are the effects of UOT and CBM sustained 9-12 months after treatment? Researchers will
           assess whether any benefits ascribed to the interventions are maintained about a year
           after the treatment is completed.

      Patients with ASD and ADHD will be recruited for the study from school systems. Half will
      receive UOT and half will receive CBM. Researchers will recruit interested Title 1 schools
      that serve very different and diverse populations. Recruitment will occur in several stages.
      Specifically, school districts will invite individual schools to participate in the trial
      that have a sufficient number of qualifying children. Interested schools will then contact
      families and provide information about the study. Interested families will initiate contact
      with study staff, and individual schools will be entered into the study if they have three or
      more patients whose families contact study staff. Children will then be scheduled for
      cognitive/diagnostic evaluation. Recruitment will continue until the target enrollment is
      reached, and all remaining interested families from enrolled schools are included. Subjects
      with appropriate assent and consent will be evaluated for eligibility and their school will
      be randomly assigned to treatment condition.

      Cognitive problem-solving abilities, flexibility, planning and organizing, self-regulation,
      behavior problems, coping skills, and the child's use of non-routine urgent medical care will
      be measured before and after treatment through a multi-method, multi-informant format,
      including parent report, blinded classroom observations and blinded direct child measures.
      Researchers chose measures that have the greatest relevance to functional outcomes and &quot;real
      world&quot; functioning. Rather than define a single outcome, researchers chose multiple outcome
      variables, anticipating differential impacts of the treatment modalities on the outcome
      domains. All of the measures and observations will be gathered at pre- and post-treatment
      time-points in each treatment year.

      Data will be analyzed using a Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) v20 and R. A
      comparison of baseline characteristics will be performed between the treatment groups to
      assess that the randomization was successful. The characteristics will include demographics
      as well as the direct child assessments and the behavioral scales. These comparisons will be
      performed using standard statistical methods, such as t-tests for continuous variables or
      (exact) chi-squares for dichotomous variables. If any characteristic is unbalanced between
      treatments, which will be possible with the sample size, secondary analyses will adjust for
      that characteristic.

    <description>Unstuck and on Target (UOT) is a novel and innovative cognitive-behavioral treatment that directly addresses executive functioning and self-regulation deficits in ASD and ADHD. UOT is the first contextually-based EF treatment that targets flexibility, goal-setting and planning through a cognitive-behavioral program centered on self-regulatory scripts that are consistently modeled and reinforced. Parents, teachers, and interventionists will be taught to model and support flexibility across settings. Children will also participate in a peer group intervention setting.</description>

    <description>The Contingency Behavior Management (CBM) intervention was developed by the researchers and called Parents and Teachers Supporting Students (PATSS) as a current best practice intervention that was comparable in design to Unstuck and on Target. The goal is to improve child behavioral outcomes by training parents, teachers and interventionists in core principles of behavior management like social learning and behavioral change. Children were also included in small group sessions where they identify their own behavior goals and meaningful reinforcers.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The investigators will recruit children who are referred by teachers and staff at
             their school for concerns of flexibility (rather than those who are responding to an
             advertisement), so that the research will have a &quot;real world&quot; group of children to
             test the effectiveness of the treatments.

          -  The recruited participants will have symptoms of ASD or ADHD, will be receiving a
             combination of mainstream and special education supports, and will qualify to attend
             pull-out groups in school. All the schools involved are eligible for Title 1
             governmental support, indicating that the children are from primarily low-income
             communities, although the investigators will not be requiring that participant's
             families themselves meet income cutoffs.

          -  Potential participants will be evaluated individually and included in the study if
             they achieve a Full Scale IQ score&gt;70, a verbal mental age&gt;6 years old, and meet
             DSM-IV-TR criteria for either a Autism Spectrum Disorder or ADHD. IQ and verbal mental
             age will be measured with the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, 2nd addition
             (WASI-2) Verbal, Performance and Full Scale IQ scores (represented as Standard Scores:
             mean=100; SD=15).

          -  To evaluate for ASD, research-valid clinical psychologists will administer the Autism
             Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition Module 3 (ADOS-2), a gold standard
             structured play/conversational interview that elicits symptoms of ASD. It produces
             non-standardized raw scores; higher scores indicate more symptoms. To be included in
             the study, each child must obtain an ADOS diagnostic algorithm &gt;'ASD' threshold and
             parents will be asked to complete the Social and Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). In
             order to include the full autism spectrum, these criteria are relatively inclusive.

          -  To confirm diagnosis of ADHD, parents will complete the ADHD portion of the MINI-Kid
             ADHD interview with a trained interviewer, and their child must meet DSM-IV criteria
             for any Attention Disorder. The researchers will include children who had observable
             symptoms in two of three settings. As all children will be referred for the study
             because teachers or staff at their school observed symptoms, the children will have to
             also meet criteria on the MINI-Kid interview or the trained clinician completing their
             testing will have to observe notable symptoms, or both, for the child to be included
             in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be excluded from the study if they have a diagnosis of bipolar
             disorder, schizophrenia, or major depression that is currently preventing them from
             participating in classroom activities.

          -  Students with anxiety, mild depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder or other
             problems that do not prevent them from participating in the majority of classroom
             activities will not be excluded.

          -  Exclusion will be determined through a two-stage process: First, participants will be
             screened for comorbid symptoms using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The CBCL for
             6-18 year olds has 118 items that describe specific behavioral and emotional problems.
             Parents rate their child for how true each item is now or within the past 6 months.
             One of the PIs, both of whom are licensed psychologists with active clinical
             practices, will follow-up with a child's teacher if a child scores above a T score of
             75 on any of the six DSM-oriented scales other than Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity
             Problems (Affective Problems; Anxiety Problems; Somatic Problems; Oppositional Defiant
             Problems; and Conduct Problems).

          -  The investigators will ask teachers targeted questions to determine to what degree the
             identified symptoms interfere with the child's ability to participate in the classroom
             activities or in the treatment group such as &quot;Do you feel that the child can
             participate in most classroom activities? If not, why? Can they listen to and follow
             written and verbal instructions? Can they participate in activities with other
             children when given structure and support?&quot; However, because the school programs
             involved in this study use an inclusion model, students in these mainstream classrooms
             are unlikely to meet exclusion criteria.
