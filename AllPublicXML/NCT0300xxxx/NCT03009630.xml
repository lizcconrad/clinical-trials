      The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of electromagnetic
      navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of
      early-stage peripheral lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ENB guided RFA for the treatment of
      patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study is designed as a
      single-center prospective trial with one arm. The participating centers are Department of
      pulmonary medicine and endoscopy, Shanghai Chest Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong
      University, China. Patients diagnosed with early-stage NSCLC will be enrolled into the study.
      Fifty patients are expected to be enrolled totally.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients discovered with peripheral lung nodules that have demonstrated to be
             non-small cell lung cancer by pathology with the clinical stage of IA.

          2. The tumors are solid or part-solid peripheral lung nodules and the length-diameter of
             the nodules are more than 10 mm and no more than 30 mm.

          3. Patients are unsuitable for surgery assessed by multi-modality treatment and agree to
             the primary treatment of ablation.

          4. Patients have good compliance and sign the informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients cannot receive bronchoscopy for the severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction and
             other indications.

          2. Patients have contraindications of general anesthesia.

          3. Chest CT suggests that navigation bronchoscopy technology cannot guide treatment
             equipment to reach the peripheral lung lesion.

          4. Chest CT or bronchoscopy shows that the bronchial lumen occlusion or deformation
             leading to the guided and treatment equipment cannot reach the peripheral lung lesion.

          5. There are large blood vessels or important structures adjacent to peripheral lung
             lesion.

          6. Researchers consider the patient do not fit for the study.
