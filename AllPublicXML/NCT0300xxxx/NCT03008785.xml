  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluate if 10 weeks of mixed exercise combined with isoflavones could have
      greater effects on climacteric symptoms than exercise alone in postmenopausal women. the
      participants will be randomly assigned to the group: placebo and exercise or 100mg of
      isoflavone and exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several endocrine metabolic changes occur during the climacteric period, due to the lack of
      estrogen and also by the aging process and some studies show that ingestion of isoflavones by
      postmenopausal women may have benefits. Theoretically the isoflavone potentiate the effects
      obtained during exercise
