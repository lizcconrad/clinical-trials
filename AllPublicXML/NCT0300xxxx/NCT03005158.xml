  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome account for a tenth of all presentations to
      the Emergency Department and up to 40 per cent of unplanned hospital admissions. The majority
      of patients do not have a heart attack (myocardial infarction), and may be safely discharged
      from the Emergency Department.

      The investigators propose to evaluate whether the use of the HighSTEACS pathway in patients
      with suspected acute coronary syndrome reduces length of stay and allows more patients to be
      safely discharged from the Emergency Department. This pathways utilizes high-sensitivity
      cardiac troponin I testing and will rule out myocardial infarction if troponin concentrations
      are &lt;5 ng/L on presentation, with further testing indicated at 3 hours only in those
      presenting early or with troponin concentrations between 5 ng/L and the 99th centile.

      In six secondary and tertiary centres across Scotland, the investigators will introduce the
      pathway as part of a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial. Sequential hypothesis
      testing will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the pathway. The primary efficacy end-point
      will be length of stay from time of presentation until final hospital discharge and the
      primary safety end-point will be survival free from type 1 or 4b myocardial infarction or
      cardiac death from discharge to 30 days. The study population will consist of those patients
      with cardiac troponin concentrations within the normal reference range (&lt;99th centile) at
      presentation.

    <description>Implementation of the HighSTEACS pathway to rule out myocardial infarction in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome. Myocardial infarction will be ruled out if presentation cardiac troponin concentrations are &lt;5 ng/L in those with at least 2 hours of symptoms at the time of blood sampling. In patients with less than two hours of symptoms, or where cardiac troponin concentrations are between 5ng/L and the 99th centile, repeat testing will be recommended at 3 hours. Myocardial infarction will be ruled out at 3 hours if cardiac troponin concentrations are unchanged (&lt;3 ng/L change) and remain ≤99th centile on retesting. Those remaining ≤99th centile on retesting but demonstrating a significant change will require admission for further testing at 6-12 hours.</description>
