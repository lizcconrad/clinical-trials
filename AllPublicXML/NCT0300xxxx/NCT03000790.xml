      To evaluate the effectiveness of Lingual Ring Splint For Management of Anterior Disc
      Displacement With Reduction.

      PICO P- Patient with symptomatic anterior disc displacement with reduction . I- use of
      Michigan splint C- use of anterior repositioning splint (ARS) . O- Clinical outcome. Pain
      relief and improvement of mouth opening , lateral excursion and protrusion

      Outcome:

        -  1ry outcome: Patients' subjective pain experience. Each patient will be asked to rate
           his or her current and worst pain intensity on numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0-10 with
           zero being no pain and ten corresponds to the worst pain that the patient ever had.

        -  2ry outcome:

             1. Maximum mouth opening (MMO). Assessment of MMO will be performed by measuring the
                distance in mm between the incisal edges of the upper and lower central incisors
                using a ruler.

             2. lateral excursion . Assessment of lateral excursion will be performed by measuring
                the distance in mm between midline of upper and lower jaws

             3. protrusion. The distance in mm from the incisal edge of the maxillary central
                incisor to the incisor edge of the mandibular incisor will measured in the maximum
                protruded position.
