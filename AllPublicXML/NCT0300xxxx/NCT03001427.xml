      This application proposes to extend an ongoing NHLBI clinical trial (NCT02342808) examining
      the efficacy of a lifestyle intervention combining the Dietary Approaches to Stop
      Hypertension (DASH) diet with caloric restriction and aerobic exercise to lower and control
      BP in individuals with RH. In the parent trial, participants with RH will be randomized to
      either: (1) a 4-month adjunctive lifestyle intervention designed to lower BP through exercise
      and diet (C-LIFE), or; (2) a standardized education and physician advice (SEPA) control
      condition.

      The current protocol will collect additional assessments of neurocognition (executive
      function, processing speed, and memory), endothelial function (brachial artery flow-mediated
      dilation), and cerebrovascular reserve (a measure of prefrontal cortex tissue oxygenation) in
      120 participants at baseline, following completion of the 4-month intervention, and again
      after one year, in order to examine neurocognitive improvements and their potential
      mediators.
