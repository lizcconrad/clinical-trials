      The purpose of this study is to test the reliability and validity of the Turkish
      Feeding/Swallowing Impact Survey among caregivers of pediatric patients with swallowing
      disorders.The internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and criterion validity of
      T-EAT-10 will be investigated. The internal consistency will be assessed using Cronbach's
      alpha. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) value with 95 % confidence intervals will be
      calculated for test-retest reliability. The criterion validity of the scale will be
      determined by assessing the correlation between the Turkish Feeding/Swallowing Impact Survey
      and Karaduman Chewing Performance Scale, Tongue Thrust Rating Scale, Pediatric version of the
      Eating Assessment Tool. The validity will also be determined by completion of the Turkish
      Feeding/Swallowing Impact Survey before and after swallowing rehabilitation of pediatric
      patients.
