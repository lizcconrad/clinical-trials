    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare cardio-metabolic risk, glucose tolerance, and night
      time blood pressure between healthy control subjects and patients with adrenal insufficiency.
      No intervention will be administered and the study is observational only.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to use a case control design to test the main hypothesis that as compared to
      healthy control subjects matched for sex, age, adiposity and race/ethnicity, patients with
      adrenal insufficiency, whether primary or secondary, have disturbances of the circadian
      system that are associated with high day to day variability of sleep time as well as elevated
      markers of cardio-metabolic risk, including abnormal oral glucose tolerance and reduced
      nocturnal blood pressure dipping.

      A secondary hypothesis of the study is that adrenal insufficiency patients on a replacement
      regimen (as part of their standard of care ongoing treatment) that results in daytime
      cortisol profiles approximating the normal diurnal variation will have better
      cardio-metabolic function than adrenal insufficiency patients who have grossly abnormal
      cortisol profiles.

    <time_frame>day 1 to day 7</time_frame>
    <description>On each day, the midpoint (time in hours and minutes) of the sleep period will be calculated and the variability over 1 week will be quantified by the standard deviation</description>

    <measure>nocturnal blood pressure dipping</measure>
    <time_frame>day 8 to 9</time_frame>
    <description>a 24-h recording of blood pressure will be conducted in the laboratory with concurrent sleep recording. Dipping will be calculated as the difference between the daytime mean and the nighttime mean</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>oral glucose tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>day 11 to 12</time_frame>
    <description>A 3-h 75g oral glucose tolerance test will be performed in the laboratory after an overnight fast. Glucose tolerance will be quantified by the total area under the glucose curve over the 3-hour period of sampling.</description>
