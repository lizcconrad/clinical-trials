      This cross-disciplinary study will assemble and longitudinally follow a large, diverse birth
      cohort to determine the relationships between early life antibiotic exposure, microbiome
      development, and growth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to prospectively determine mechanistic links between antibiotic exposure,
      disruption of the infant gut microbiome development, and obesity in children. Given the
      prevalence of early life antibiotic use and the health consequences of obesity, evidence of
      the proposed association will have important implications for public health and pediatric
      medicine. Currently in the United States, 32% of all laboring women receive intrapartum
      antibiotics that reach the unborn baby and almost 10% of all newborns are given
      broad-spectrum antibiotics immediately after birth. After discharge from the nursery, infants
      and young children have the highest rates of antibiotic prescribing of any age group in the
      US, with approximately 15% of all children receiving a systemic antibiotic by six months of
      age. Animal studies have linked antibiotic-induced alterations in the microbiome to
      adiposity, but large prospective human studies exploring associations between the entire
      spectrum of early life antibiotic exposure, gut microbiome development, and obesity have not
      been conducted.

      In order to address these knowledge gaps, the study will assemble and longitudinally follow a
      large, diverse birth cohort of approximately 420 individuals to determine the relationship
      between (1) antibiotic exposure and microbiome development; (2) antibiotic exposure and
      weight gain; and (3) microbiome development and weight gain. To accomplish this, the study
      will examine routine intrapartum, neonatal, and infant antibiotic exposures; use bacterial
      taxonomic marker gene sequencing, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics to measure
      antibiotic-related shifts to the microbiome taxonomic carriage, biodiversity, and rate of
      maturation of the infant gut microbiome; and perform comprehensive, serial anthropometric
      measurements to assess weight gain and adiposity over the first 24 months of life.
