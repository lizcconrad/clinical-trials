      Single Arm, prospective, OUS multi-center feasibility study enrolling up to 30 subjects with
      superficial femoral or popliteal lesions. The study will capture acute angiographic data to
      compare the pre- Serranator™ inflation vs post inflation effects.

      The study population will consist of subjects with claudication or ischemic rest pain, with
      de novo or non-stented restenotic lesions in femoropopliteal arteries having lesion length
      less than or equal to 10 cm, total occlusion up to 6 cms in length and reference vessel
      diameter of 4 mm to 6 mm, inclusive.

          7. Estimated life expectancy &gt; 1 year.

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Lesion(s) located within the SFA and or popliteal arteries.

          2. Target lesion(s) has stenosis &gt;70% by visual assessment.

          3. Reference vessel diameter is between 4.0mm and 6.0mm, inclusive.

          4. One long or multiple serial lesions that are up to 10 cms, (total occlusions up to
             6cm) in length that can be covered by a single balloon.

             treated during the same procedure using standard angioplasty and or stenting but use
             of atherectomy is excluded. The inflow lesion(s) must be treated first, prior to
             consideration of treatment of the target lesion. Subject can be enrolled if the inflow
             lesion(s) are treated and results in &lt;30% residual stenosis and no evidence of
             embolization or significant complications.

             investigator would preclude them from receiving this treatment and the procedures and
             or participating in evaluations pre- and post-treatment.

         20. Thrombolysis of the target vessel within 72 hours prior to the index procedure, where

         22. History of neutropenia, coagulopathy, or thrombocytopenia that was unexplained or is
             considered to be at risk for reoccurrence.
