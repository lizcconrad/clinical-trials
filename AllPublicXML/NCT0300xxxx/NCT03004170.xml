  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a brief behavioral intervention delivered over
      the telephone is effective at reducing occasions of condomless sex in persons living and
      aging with HIV.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Estimated rates of condomless anal and vaginal intercourse among HIV-positive older adults
      remain high. Brief motivational interventions delivered face-to-face have demonstrated
      efficacy at reducing condomless sex in HIV-positive persons. However, these interventions are
      not contextualized to the unique sexual health needs of HIV-positive older adults. Further,
      many HIV-positive older adults have difficulty accessing face-to-face services due to
      transportation, stigma, and other barriers. Telehealth interventions represent one delivery
      approach that overcomes such barriers.

    <description>The Telephone-Administered Motivational Interviewing Plus Behavioral Skills Training (teleMI+BST) intervention comprises 5 sessions lasting approximately 45-50 minutes each. Sessions occur in weeks 3, 4, 8, and 12 post-enrollment, with a follow-up booster session in week 24. The Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) Model (Fisher &amp; Fisher, 1992) provides the theoretical framework for behavior change mechanisms of teleMI+BST. The IMB posits that knowledge about condom use practices, condom use motivation, and acquisition and application of requisite condom use skills lead to engagement in condom-protected sex. The focus of this intervention is to help participants process ambivalence about engaging in condomless sex acts that risk HIV transmission.</description>

    <description>The Telephone-Administered Coping Effectiveness Training (teleCET) intervention is the attention-equivalent comparator and also comprises 5 sessions lasting approximately 45-50 minutes each. The teleCET intervention is based on the Lazarus and Folkman Transactional Model of Stress and Coping (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984) and uses cognitive-behavioral principles to: (a) appraise stressor severity, (b) develop problem- and emotion-focused coping skills, (c) determine the match between coping strategies and stressor controllability, and (d) optimize coping through use of social support resources.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  English speaking

          -  Have access to a landline or cellular telephone

          -  Be 50 years of age or older at some point during study participation

          -  Report engaging in one or more occasions of condomless anal and/or vaginal intercourse
             with an HIV-negative or unknown HIV serostatus sex partner in the 3 months prior to
             study enrollment. An exception to this criterion is participants whose HIV viral load
             is undetectable and whose only condomless sex is in the context of a monogamous sexual
             relationship with an HIV-negative partner.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active suicidal ideation as determined by the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item
             Depression Module
