      This purpose of this database is to collect, store and use appropriately derived data from
      routine patient care in a specialist dental practice. Comprehensive observational data will
      be gathered, systematically organised and be continuously updated. This data will be used to
      evaluate treatment outcomes and identify areas for improvement. This will contribute to the
      existing evidence base to validate new and current clinical concepts in dentistry. Patient
      consent will be sought for this, and all data extracted from patient notes will be stored and
      used anonymously. Use of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP) -14 questionnaire pre and post
      treatment will be used to assess patient satisfaction with outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specialist dentistry uses a combination of techniques resulting from joint decisions between
      clinicians and patients, aimed at giving the patient what is perceived to be the best
      possible outcome. However, as new techniques and approaches develop, there is capacity for
      more evidence to justify one treatment option over another, both clinically and most
      importantly, from the patient perspective.

      The aim of this project is to set up a research database which will enable the collection and
      storage of appropriately derived data from routine patient care and from patient
      questionnaires (using OHIP-14). This data will be used in cohort studies/case series
      reports/comparative studies with other practices.

      It is believed that this process will provide an effective way of evidencing predictable
      outcomes, assist in the development of improved clinical techniques, provide additional
      guidance and support for patients, and further clinical research in dental practice. In
      addition, implementation of studies to track patient satisfaction with clinical outcomes will
      provide advanced support in the decision making process.

      All adult patients treated at The Campbell Clinic will be approached for consent. This will
      be an ongoing process, to maximize sample size. Treatment decisions will be continue to be
      made jointly by clinician and patient and will not be altered by participation in this study.
      Patient consent will be sought, and all data will be anonymised for storage in the database.
