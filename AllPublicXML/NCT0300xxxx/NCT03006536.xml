  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed mechanism of action for LI-ESWT in ED is that it improves endothelial function
      and triggers angiogenesis through induction of local growth factors and endothelial nitric
      oxide synthase. The literature generally confirms that LI-ESWT is safe and cohort studies
      investigating the clinical effects have been encouraging. Meanwhile, randomized trials have
      shown contradictory results. Thus, a randomized trial in 67 PDE5-I responders showed
      statistically greater improvements in the Erectile Function Domain of the International Index
      of Erectile Function (IIEF) with active LI-ESWT treatment compared to a sham treatment
      (p=0.032).
