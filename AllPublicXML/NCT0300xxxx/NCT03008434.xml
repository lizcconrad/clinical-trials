      This long-term goal of this project was to advance best practices in occupational therapy in
      conjunction with yoga. To address the long-term goal, this research team developed a pilot
      yoga intervention. The intervention was designed to focus on balance, balance confidence,
      body responsiveness, pain, physical ability and quality of life. Assessments were then chosen
      to address these areas pre and post yoga intervention. A manual and protocol were developed
      for the intervention and then the intervention was implemented with a group of individuals
      with chronic traumatic brain injury.

      This was an 8-week yoga intervention, focused on demonstrating the preliminary feasibility
      and efficacy of yoga for individuals with chronic traumatic brain injury. The study was a
      mixed-methods longitudinal study. Assessments were conducted 8 weeks prior to the yoga
      intervention and then just following the 8 week yoga intervention. The objectives of this
      feasibility and efficacy study was to 1) further develop, standardize, and manualize the yoga
      for the traumatic brain injury intervention and 2) assess change in balance, balance
      confidence, body responsiveness, pain, physical ability, and quality of life.
