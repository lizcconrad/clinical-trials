    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the use of the Human Acellular Vessel (HAV) in adults with arterial
      trauma in the lower limb who are undergoing vascular reconstructive surgery. All subjects
      will be implanted with a HAV as an interposition vessel or bypass using standard vascular
      surgical techniques. There is no control arm.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, single arm, non-randomized phase 2 study in up to 20
      adult patients with limb-threatening damage to the superficial femoral or popliteal artery
      who require surgical repair. Subjects will be implanted with a Humacyte Human Acellular
      Vessel (HAV) as an interposition vessel or bypass using standard vascular surgical
      techniques. There is no control arm.

      The active study duration for each study participant will be 12 months from HAV implantation
      or until HAV failure/ removal/ death if earlier. Additional follow up at 6 month intervals
      until 36 months will involve the capture of information on assessments performed at &quot;standard
      of care&quot; routine clinic visits or by telephone follow up with the patient or his/her
      physician. There are no study specific visits or procedures after 12 months.

      The total expected duration of the clinical study is 24 months (12 months of enrollment and
      12 months of study specific visits) plus 2 years additional follow up at routine clinical
      visits or via telephone contact with the subject and/or the physician designated to continue
      long term care of the subject.

    <description>This is the only study arm. Patients with lower limb vascular trauma which threatens the viability of the leg and requires reconstruction of the superficial femoral or popliteal artery will be implanted with a Humacyte Human Acellular Vessel (HAV) as an interposition vessel or bypass using standard vascular surgical techniques.</description>

    <description>The investigational medicinal product (IMP) is a Humacyte Human Acellular Vessel (HAV), which is a tissue-engineered vascular prosthesis for arterial bypass or reconstruction in patients with peripheral arterial disease or peripheral arterial trauma. It is a sterile, non-pyrogenic acellular tubular vessel composed of human collagen types I and III and other extracellular matrix proteins, including fibronectin and vitronectin. The vessel is 6 mm in diameter and approximately 42 cm in length. The product is supplied on a silicone mandrel immersed in sterile phosphate buffered saline in a sealed and labeled plastic container. The Humacyte HAV is implanted using standard vascular surgical techniques similar to placement of predicate peripheral vascular prostheses.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with lower limb vascular trauma which threatens the viability of the leg and
             who require reconstruction of the superficial femoral or popliteal artery

          2. Preoperative ultrasound or angiography or CT angiography or clinical examination
             indicates damage to the superficial femoral artery (SFA) or popliteal artery requiring
             reconstruction with an interposition bypass vessel AND required bypass length of â‰¤
             38cm

          3. Proximal anastomosis is expected to be to the common femoral artery below the inguinal
             ligament or to the superficial femoral artery or popliteal artery

          4. Distal anastomosis is expected to be to the SFA, popliteal artery or the
             tibio-peroneal trunk

          5. Autologous vein graft is either not feasible in the judgment of the treating surgeon
             (e.g. because of lack of availability of suitable conduit, presence of severe venous
             insufficiency) or is not desirable because of the urgency of revascularization

          6. Aged 18 to 85 years old, inclusive

          7. Able to communicate meaningfully with investigative staff and able to comply with
             study procedures. If the patient is unconscious then information from a reliable
             witness indicates that the patient would normally be able to understand and comply
             with study procedures

          8. Patient or legal representative is able, willing and competent to give informed
             consent

          9. Life expectancy of at least 1 year

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Limb at high risk of amputation despite vascular reconstruction e.g., because of crush
             injury

          2. Life threatening head, chest, or abdominal injuries that make survival unlikely

          3. Distal anastomosis planned to a tibial or pedal artery

          4. Pregnant women

          5. Known medical condition which would preclude long term dual antiplatelet therapy after
             resolution of acute injuries

          6. Any other condition which in the judgment of the investigator would preclude adequate
             evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the Humacyte Human Acellular Vessel (HAV)

          7. Previous enrollment in this study

          8. Employees of the sponsor or patients who are employees or relatives of the
             investigator
