    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a unique methodology of studying infection and vaccination history
      and immune responses. As most studies in infection history are conducted on mice, limitations
      are inherent on their applicability to humans. A longitudinal comparison study following
      older adults (over the age of 65) hospitalized for influenza are followed through to their
      hospital discharge and vaccination in the following season. This will allow for the
      investigation of the course of infection, as well as impact on the response to vaccination.

      Significance: This study will provide critical information on the best technique in vaccine
      candidate testing and improve influenza treatment approaches. The long-term goal of this
      research is to identify the T-cell responses that are surrogates (biomarkers) of serious
      complications of influenza in older adults and predict vaccine efficacy (prevention of
      influenza illness) and vaccine effectiveness (prevention of serious complications). Further,
      translating new insights into age-related immune dysfunction to the design of new influenza
      vaccines is critical to addressing this unmet need in the population aged 65 and older.

      Innovation: The study will help in the validation of clinical tools and biomarkers as
      prognostic indicators of influenza illness severity in vaccinated older adults, point-of-care
      diagnostics that would direct other preventive strategies to reduce the impact of influenza
      illness in vaccinated older adults, and correlates of protection to evaluate the potential of
      new influenza vaccines to enhance protection against the serious complications of influenza
      illness. The investigators have established that GrzB activity and the IFNg: IL-10 ratio in
      influenza-stimulated PBMC correlate with protection against influenza, and preliminary data
      to show that low GrzB activity in influenza-stimulated PBMC correlates with more severe
      disease and higher levels of frailty. The innovations of this project are the established
      methods for developing correlates of protection, the clinical insights into how frailty
      affects immune-mediated protection against influenza, and the direct translation of this
      research to provide a reasonable method for primary care clinicians to estimate vaccine
      effectiveness in an individual older person. These results will translate to the practical
      design of clinical trials to evaluate the potential for new influenza vaccines to better
      protect against the serious complications of influenza and complement those based on antibody
      titers and/or clinical outcomes alone.

    <description>PBMCs from adults hospitalized for laboratory confirmed influenza illness (LCII) will be collected at admission and 30 days post hospitalization. These samples will be matched with hospitalized non-LCII adult controls.

    <description>Older adults hospitalized for influenza illness the previous season will be compared to matched, hospitalized older adults with influenza-like illness (non-LCII). PBMCs will be collected from each group, before receiving influenza vaccination and 4 weeks after vaccination. PBMCs will be challenged ex vivo with influenza virus and gene expression of CTL related genes will be measured and compared between each group.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent provided by the participant.

          2. Age 65 years of age or older admitted to Health Sciences North with at least one the
             following:

               -  Laboratory confirmed influenza illness

               -  Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD).

               -  Any respiratory or influenza-like symptoms (dyspnea, cough, sore throat, myalgia,
                  arthralgia, fever, delirium/altered level of consciousness) that a test for
                  influenza was negative.

          3. Willing to receive influenza vaccination in the subsequent flu season

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients whose reason for hospital admission was unrelated to influenza or (for
             example patients admitted due to trauma, elective surgery, or patients who have an
             alternative diagnosis that is clearly not respiratory).

          2. Chest x-ray positive for pneumonia.
