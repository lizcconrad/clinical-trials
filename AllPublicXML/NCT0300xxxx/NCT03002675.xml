  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The obesity epidemic has led to a enormous increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (T2D), dyslipidemia and cardiovascular events. Particularly South Asians, who
      comprise 1/5 of the world population, are at increased risk of developing a disadvantageous
      metabolic phenotype and these diseases. Moreover, T2D occurs at a younger age and at a lower
      BMI when compared to white Caucasians. Recent research has shown that South Asians not only
      have a lower energy expenditure than their Caucasian counterparts, but also less active brown
      adipose tissue (BAT).

      For some time, it has been known that adult humans have active BAT. This metabolic tissue
      produces heat by combusting triglycerides, in contrast to white adipose tissue, which stores
      this form of energy. It has been shown that activation of BAT has a positive effect on whole
      body metabolism, via increasing energy expenditure and improving glucose- and lipid
      metabolism. For this matter, BAT has been proposed as a major key player in energy
      homeostasis, which may be implemented in the current combat against the obesity epidemic.
      Aside from cold exposure, more research focuses on pharmacological activation of BAT.

      Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone which is produced by intestinal
      L-cells and upon food intake stimulates insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells. The GLP-1
      analogue Exenatide is a currently much used antidiabetic drug to reduce hyperglycemia via
      this aforementioned mechanism. Beyond its blood glucose-improving effects, Exenatide has also
      shown to lower body weight and improve dyslipidemia in T2D patients. Elucidation of the
      underlying mechanism of these beneficial effects is highly relevant.

      Recent preclinical research in our group has shown that central activation of the GLP-1
      receptor through exenatide increases BAT activity and thereby contributes to weight loss and
      improvement of dyslipidemia. The aim of this research project is to investigate whether
      exenatide is also able to activate BAT and increase resting energy expenditure, thereby
      improving glucose- and lipid metabolism and reducing fat mass and body weight in humans.
      Moreover, the investigators aim to validate the MRI scan as a novel way to measure BAT
      activity. The investigators hope that these forthcoming findings lead to the discovery of new
      treatment strategies against obesity.

      The current study is an open-label single arm prospective design, including 24 healthy young
      lean males (BMI between 18 and 25 kg/m2), of whom 12 Dutch South Asians and 12 Dutch
      Caucasians. After a medical screening, included subjects will receive 12 weeks of treatment
      with the GLP-1 analogue exenatide (Bydureon; 2 mg s.c. 1x/wk). Study subjects will visit the
      LUMC weekly. Before and after treatment there will be a study day, in which BAT (by means of
      18F-FDG PET-CT scan and MRI scan), resting energy expenditure (measured by indirect
      calorimetry) and fat mass (by bio-impedance analysis) will be measured. Moreover, blood will
      be drawn to investigate the effects of exenatide on lipid- and glucose metabolism.
