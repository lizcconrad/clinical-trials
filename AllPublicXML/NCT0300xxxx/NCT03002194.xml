      treatment with radiofrequency and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy.

      This study is an open-label, baseline-controlled, single-center study to measure the change
      in skin elasticity after combined radio frequency (RF) and pulsed electromagnetic field
      (PEMF) treatment. Forty-five adult females will undergo weekly treatments over a period of 8
      weeks. Skin elasticity will be measured by a Cutometer® prior to beginning treatment, week 7
      and 3 months after completion of treatment. Photographs will be taken prior to treatment, at
      week 4, week 7 and 3 months after completion of treatment. Patient discomfort/pain and
      satisfaction questionnaires will be completed before, during and after treatment.

    <description>Each subject is to receive 8 weekly study treatments. The study treatment consists of Glide (medical grade glycerin) being applied thoroughly to the study treatment area (face). The energy will be delivered by the Diamondpolar applicator attached to the Venus Versa, a medical device approved by health regulatory authorities, to deliver combined radiofrequency (RF) and pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) energies. Change in skin elasticity will be measured by Cutometer. Change in appearance will be assessed by independent reviewer using photographs.</description>
