      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of the CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib
      when given together with doxorubicin in treating patients with soft tissue sarcomas that has
      spread to other places or that cannot be removed by surgery. Ribociclib may stop the growth
      of sarcoma tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving ribociclib for a week prior to standard treatment with doxorubicin may work
      better in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-escalation study of the CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib in combination with
      standard-dose doxorubicin.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ribociclib in combination with
      doxorubicin in subjects with advanced soft tissue sarcomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity of ribociclib in combination with doxorubicin in
      subjects with advanced soft tissue sarcomas (Progression-Free Survival and Overall Response
      Rate).

      II. To characterize the safety and tolerability of ribociclib in combination with
      doxorubicin.

      A mandatory biopsy will be obtained after 7 days of ribociclib treatment.

      TREATMENT: Patients receive ribociclib orally (PO) daily on days 1-7, and doxorubicin
      intravenously (IV) on day 10. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 6 courses, patients may
      receive maintenance treatment with ribociclib PO daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      STARTING DOSE COHORT: Ribociclib 400 mg with doxorubicin 75 mg/m2.

      FOLLOW-UP: After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then
      every 12 weeks for 12 months.

      RATIONALE: Over-expression of CDK4 or loss of the CDK4 inhibitor p16 are common in sarcomas
      and result in a selective growth advantage by bypassing normal cell cycle checkpoints. Intact
      pRb is required for CDK4/6 inhibition to be effective, therefore all eligible subjects must
      have documented pRb expression by IHC on archival tissue. Synergy between CDK4 inhibition and
      chemotherapy has been documented in preclinical models when given sequentially, suggestion a
      role for cell cycle synchronization.
