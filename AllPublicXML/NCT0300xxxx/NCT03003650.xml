      First-In-Man Study on the ACURATE TF™ Transfemoral Aortic Bioprosthesis Implantation in
      Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis to collect human feasibility data pertaining to the
      safety and performance of the device.

    <textblock>
      A single arm, prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, open trial, up to 5 Years follow-up
      with the Symetis ACURATE TF™ Transfemoral Aortic Bioprosthesis for minimal invasive
      implantation via transfemoral access to treat patients with severe aortic stenosis where
      conventional aortic valve replacement(AVR) via open heart surgery is considered to be
      associated with high risk for evaluating the feasibility and performance of the implantation
      and the safety at 30-Day Follow-up.
