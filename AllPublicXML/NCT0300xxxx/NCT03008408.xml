  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of everolimus,
      letrozole, and ribociclib can help to control recurrent (has returned after treatment) or
      progressive endometrial cancer. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      Participant will take everolimus, letrozole and ribociclib by mouth and should be swallowed
      whole without opening, chewing, or crushing 1 time every day at the same time. Participant
      will take the dose in the morning with a full cup of water (about 8 ounces). Participant
      should fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for up to 2 hours before and after each
      dose of study drugs.

      When participant comes to clinic for a visit, participant should wait to take participant's
      drugs until the study team tells participant to take them.

      Length of Treatment:

      Participant may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in
      participant's best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drugs if
      the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to
      follow study directions.

      Participation on the study will be over after follow-up.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Each Cycle:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check for
           hepatitis. If participant has had the hepatitis screening test during screening, it will
           not be repeated.

        -  On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond, participant will have an EKG.

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 3 and every 3 cycles after that (Cycles 6, 9, 12, and so on), part of
           the routine blood draw will be used to check the level of fat in participant's blood.

      On Day 15 of Cycle 1:

        -  Blood (about 3 ½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and pharmacodynamic PD testing.

        -  Participant will have three EKGs 5 minutes apart before the dose and then 2-4 hours
           after.

      On Day 15 of Cycle 2, participant will have an EKG before and then 2-4 hours after the dose.

      At the end of Cycles 2, 4, 6 and every 3 cycles after that (Cycles 9, 12, 15, and so on) (+/-
      7 days):

        -  Participant will have an MRI and/or CT scan. If participant has signs of disease in the
           chest chest disease, participant will have a CT scan of the chest.

        -  If the disease could be felt in the pelvis at the beginning of the study, participant
           will have a pelvic exam.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      Within 4 weeks after the last dose of study drugs:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Participant will have an MRI and/or CT scan. If participant has signs of disease in the
           chest, participant will have a CT scan of the chest.

      Follow-Up:

      At 30 days after participant's last dose of study drugs and then every 3 months (+/- 1 month)
      after that, a member of the study staff will contact participant by phone or at a regularly
      scheduled clinic visit to ask how participant is doing and about any side effects participant
      may have had. These calls or visits should last about 5-10 minutes each time.

      This is an investigational study. Everolimus is FDA approved and commercially available to
      treat kidney, breast, and pancreatic cancers. Letrozole is FDA approved and commercially
      available to treat breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Ribociclib is not FDA approved or
      commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. The
      combination of everolimus, letrozole, and ribociclib to treat endometrial cancer is
      investigational.

      Up to 92 patients will have screening tests to learn if they are eligible to take part in
      this study. Up to 76 patients that are found eligible will be enrolled in this study. All
      will take part at MD Anderson.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has signed the Informed Consent (ICF) prior to any screening procedures being
             performed and is able to comply with protocol requirements.

          2. Patients must have histologically-confirmed endometrial carcinoma (endometrioid and
             mixed endometrioid tumors, any grade).

          3. Patients must have advanced or recurrent disease that is refractory to curative
             treatment based on imaging or clinical exam.

          4. Patient must consent to allow for a baseline tumor biopsy. Tumor material from
             biopsies done before the screening period are acceptable if the biopsy was performed
             within 3 months prior to the planned treatment start and no other systemic cancer
             therapy was administered in the interim. If a biopsy is performed and the specimen is
             considered non-diagnostic or dose not have enough tissue, this does not prevent the
             patient from proceeding with the treatment.

          5. Patients must have had no more than two prior chemotherapeutic regimens for recurrent
             endometrial carcinoma. Chemotherapy administered in conjunction with primary radiation
             as a radio-sensitizer is not counted as a prior treatment for recurrent or advanced
             disease.

          6. Prior radiation therapy of any kind is allowed.

          7. Prior treatment with letrozole is allowed if the patient meets the washout period of
             10 days.

          8. All patients must have measurable disease per RECIST version 1.1 defined as at least
             one &quot;target lesion&quot; that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (&gt;/= 10
             mm longest dimension to be recorded; Lymph nodes must be &gt;/= 15 mm per short axis).
             Each lesion must be &gt; 20 mm when measured by palpation or conventional imaging
             techniques (CT or MRI - based on primary physician preference) or &gt;10 mm with spiral
             CT scan. Measurable lesions must be at least 2 times the slice thickness in
             millimeters. Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as
             &quot;non-target&quot; lesions unless progression is documented. Ascites and pleural effusions
             are not considered measurable disease. If the measurable disease is confined to a
             solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology/histology.

          9. Patients must not be pregnant, breastfeeding or of child-bearing potential. Patients
             are considered not of child-bearing potential if they are surgically sterile (they
             have undergone a total hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral
             oophorectomy) or they are postmenopausal for greater than 12 months (If patient is
             uncertain of amenorrhea for 12 months, a pregnancy test will be done to confirm
             pregnancy status). Patients in whom ovaries are present and were not previously
             menopausal at the time of hysterectomy, should have a serum estradiol &lt;10 pm/mL to
             confirm ovarian senescence

         10. Patients must be off all other anti-tumor therapies (including immunologic agents) for
             at least four weeks prior to study registration. Patients on hormonal agents require a
             washout for 10 days.

         11. Age &gt;/= 18 years

         12. GOG performance status of 0 to 1

         13. Patient has adequate bone marrow and organ function as defined by the following
             laboratory values at screening: a. Absolute neutrophil count &gt;/=1.5 × 109/L b.
             Platelets &gt;/=100 × 10^9/L c. Hemoglobin &gt;/=9.0 g/dL d. INR &lt;/=1.5 e. Serum creatinine
             &lt;/= 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance &gt;/=50 mL/min f. In the absence of liver
             metastases, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;2.5 x
             ULN. If the patient has liver metastases, ALT and AST &lt;5 x ULN g. Total bilirubin &lt;
             ULN; or total bilirubin &lt;/=3.0 x ULN or direct bilirubin &lt;/=1.5 x ULN in patients with
             well-documented Gilbert's Syndrome. h. i.h. Fasting serum cholesterol &lt;/=240 mg/dL OR
             &lt;/=7.75 mmol/L AND fasting triglycerides &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN. NOTE: In case one or both of
             these thresholds are exceeded, the patient can only be included after initiation of
             appropriate lipid lowering medication.

         14. Patient with available standard 12-lead ECG with the following parameters at
             screening: a. QTcF interval at screening &lt;450msec (using Fridericia's correction). b.
