    <textblock>
      Introduction:

      In 2010, the vaccination recommendations for pregnant women against seasonal influenza were
      published by the German Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO). This work deals with the
      immunization coverage and the influencing factors.

      Method:

      A cross-sectional study was realized at two Level 1 perinatal centers in two German federal
      states during the influenza saisons 2012/2013 and 2013/2014. Pregnant women were interviewed
      by using a standardized and pre-tested questionnaire covering their knowledge about the
      influenza vaccination and other factors influencing the vaccination decision. Furthermore,
      data from the vaccination card and the pregnancy record booklet have been evaluated.
