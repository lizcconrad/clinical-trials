    <textblock>
      BIM deletion polymorphism might be associated with a poor clinical response to EGFR-TKIs in
      patients who had NSCLC with EGFR mutations. In the study, the investigators want to use
      EGFR-TKI with/without chemotherapy as first line treatment in stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients
      with both EGFR mutation and BIM deletion polymorphism.

      BIM deletion polymorphism was a poor clinical response marker to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients
      who had EGFR mutations. In the study, the investigators want to use EGFR-TKI with
      chemotherapy as 1 st treatment in stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients with both EGFR mutation and
      BIM deletion polymorphism.
