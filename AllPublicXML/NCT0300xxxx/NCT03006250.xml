      The effects of desflurane versus sevoflurane in adult patients undergoing LMA anesthesia on
      respiratory events during a less than 2-hour elective surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) anesthesia is generally performed for ambulatory surgery to avoid
      the use of neuromuscular blocking agents and to facilitate rapid emergence from anesthesia.
      Inhaled anesthetics are simply and popularly used during maintenance of anesthesia. The two
      most recent volatile anesthetic agents, desflurane and sevoflurane, are the two most commonly
      used in clinical practice for an ambulatory setting.

      Desflurane is the volatile agent with low blood: gas partition coefficient (0.42).
      Desflurane's uptake and elimination from the body of a patient are rapid, which results in a
      fast onset of anesthesia and a fast recovery from anesthesia. This property provides
      desflurane as an ideal agent for the ambulatory anesthesia. However, its pungent odor is
      concerned to irritate the upper airway and may cause significant respiratory complications.
      Sevoflurane has a blood: gas partition coefficient of 0.65, which is slightly greater than
      desflurane. The major advantage over desflurane is the better scent. It is considered to be
      less airway irritation in LMA anesthesia with smooth induction and recovery.

      The limitation of desflurane on its odor leads to a controversy if desflurane is similar to
      or worse than sevoflurane for LMA anesthesia. This is non-inferiority study designed to
      compare the occurrence of respiratory complications between desflurane and sevoflurane during
      LMA anesthesia.

    <description>Desflurane group: The rule of 24 will be applied, which means that the fresh gas flow (l/ min) multiplied by volume percent of desflurane must not exceed 24. Therefore, once the patients return of spontaneous ventilation, an anesthesiologist turns on oxygen 1 l/ min, nitrous oxide 1 l/ min, and desflurane 12 vol% for 1-2 minutes. When the end-tidal desflurane reaches 3-3.5% (approximately 0.5 MAC), the anesthesiologist will decrease oxygen and nitrous oxide to each 0.5 l/ min and desflurane to 6 vol% (1 MAC). Desflurane concentration will be adjusted to maintain the end-tidal desflurane around 3-6% (0.5-1 MAC).</description>

After that, the flow of oxygen and nitrous oxide is reduced to each 0.5 l/ min and concentration dial of sevoflurane is set to 2 vol% (1 MAC). During the operation, sevoflurane concentration will be adjusted to maintain the end-tidal sevoflurane around 1-2% (0.5-1 MAC)</description>
