  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), also known as emphysema, is the leading cause
      of hospitalization for older adults in the U.S., and a leading cause of death. Although there
      is no cure for COPD, a program called pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), which combines exercise
      and education, can help decrease re-hospitalizations and improve patients' quality of life.
      Unfortunately, very few COPD Latino and African-American patients actually get PR. These
      patients are unlikely to get referrals or to be able to attend PR due to lack of insurance,
      lack of transportation, or lack of a PR center in their area. Telehealth is a way of using
      computers to deliver healthcare long-distance, eliminating the need for a patient to travel
      to receive care. By using telehealth for PR, the patient can exercise on a stationary bike in
      his or her home, while being supervised by videoconference by a respiratory therapist (RT).
      The RT can &quot;see&quot; the patient, and deliver education by videoconference, and the patient can
      &quot;see&quot; the RT, so the patient does not need to leave home to get PR.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Telehealth-delivered PR has been shown to be as effective as standard PR (patients go to an
      outpatient setting) at improving quality of life, and patients' exercise capacity. However,
      this has not been studied in the Latino and African-American population and it is not known
      how effective telehealth PR will be among this population.

      For this study, the investigators hope to see if they can help COPD Latino and
      African-American patients with access to this needed resource through telehealth PR. They
      will compare standard PR and telehealth PR to determine if telehealth results in better
      outcomes for patients with moderate to severe COPD who were recently discharged from the
      hospital for COPD. The primary outcome the investigators will assess will be change in
      re-hospitalization rates. The secondary outcomes will include: change in quality of life,
      preparation to make decisions about clinical care, improved functional capacity, decreased
      dyspnea, anxiety, and depression.

      The study will involve randomly assigning participants to make sure that they are just as
      likely to be in one group as the other to receive either: 1) referral for
      telehealth-delivered PR, or 2) referral to standard (outpatient) PR. Both PR programs consist
      of exercise and education twice a week for 8 weeks. The investigators will give the patients
      surveys to complete before they start the program and at the end of the program, to see if PR
      had any effect on the outcomes that are being measured. The investigators will enroll about
      276 patients - with 138 patients in each group (telehealth PR or standard PR), so they can
      compare outcomes to see if telehealth PR was more, less, or equally effective as standard PR.
