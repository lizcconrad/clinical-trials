      Supraspinatus tendinosis is a degenerative process of tendon. It can be caused by external
      trauma episode and imbalanced of self-repair process. It can cause patients with shoulder
      pain when shoulder over head exercise and heavy lifting. It can also influence the sleep
      quality due to pain symptoms of shoulder. Usually these patients had limited response to
      medication and physical modality. Moreover, it can cause shoulder tear or rupture, which can
      disability with aging. Prolotherapy is an injection therapy for chronic painful
      musculoskeletal conditions. It involves the injection of small volumes of an irritant agent,
      most commonly a hyperosmolar dextrose solution, at multiple painful tendon and ligament
      insertions where they connect to bone, over several treatment sessions. The injection of an
      irritant solution initiates an inflammatory cascade at the site of injection, which causes
      fibroblast proliferation and subsequent collagen synthesis, resulting in a stronger tendon or
      ligament. Hyperosmolar dextrose appears to be the most commonly used agent today, with
      morrhuate sodium used slightly less often. There is promising recent evidence for
      prolotherapy, with hyperosmolar dextrose in treating painful tendinopathies. The aim of this
      study is to hypertonic injection in supraspinatus tendinosis patients about clinical and
      ultrasound image presentation. We conducted a double blinded randomized controlled trial for
      60 participants with chronic shoulder pain for 3 months with supraspinatus tendonsis. In
      study group, one injection with 20% dextrose water was injection in supraspinatus tendon and
      control group received normal saline and Lidocaine. SPADI, VAS and ultrasound data were
      obtained before intervention and 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks after injection after
      intervention. The ANOVA and independent t test are applied for analysis by SPSS 20.0 with P
      value less than 0.05 as statistical significance.

    <description>Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), a self-administered assessment tool that was used to measure pain and disability related to shoulder disease. The SPADI consists of 5 pain and 8 disability items that are measured on a visual analog scale. Pain and disability subscales were calculated as the mean of the corresponding items on a 0-100 scale; the highest score indicated the most severe pain and disability. The total outcome score used for statistical analysis was calculated as the sum of the pain and disability subscales.</description>

    <measure>Ultrasound</measure>
    <time_frame>Week0 Week2 Week6 Week12</time_frame>
    <description>The ultrasound evaluated the status of the biceps and supraspinatus patency was evaluated using both longitudinal and transverse views. The findings of the ultrasound examinations were classified as either normal or abnormal (tear or tendonitis). A tear was defined as a discontinuity in the normal homogeneous echogenicity of the tendon, whereas tendonitis was defined as a thickening or hypoechogenicity of the tendon in the absence of a border defect. The diagnostic criteria of biceps tenosynovitis was defined as tendon sheath fluid accumulation (abnormal hypoechoic or anechoic accumulation relative to subdermal fat; occasionally isoechoic or hyperechoic) in intra-articular material that is displaceable and compressible at â‰¥ 3 mm.</description>

    <measure>Shoulder ROM (Range of Motion)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week0 Week2 Week6 Week12</time_frame>
    <description>Pain-free passive range of motion (PROM) of the shoulder was designated as the range of motion attained at the most painful position and was measured using a digital goniometer in 6 directions flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, external rotation and internal rotation. Five directions of the shoulder joint were measured (flexion, abduction, adduction, internal rotation, and external rotation) while participants were lying in a supine position. Additionally, shoulder extension was measured in the side-lying position.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain (VAS, Visual Analogue Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week0 Week2 Week6 Week12</time_frame>
    <description>Shoulder pain was assessed according to an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS). This tool was simple to use and was highly correlated with the visual analog scale, verbal rating scale, and Faces Pain Scale-Revised. The NRS is considered a valid and reliable pain assessment tool. The pain intensity was graded from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the most intense level of pain). The participants reported their pain level at rest and during the movement of shoulder joint in all direction. The most painful movement score was used for further data analysis.</description>
