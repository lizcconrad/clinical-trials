  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators want to explore the feasibility and effect of a simple
      intervention provided by primary care physicians on treatment for overweight in general
      practice. Regular patients visiting their ordinary family physician will be asked for
      participation if they comply with the inclusion criteria. If so, they will follow a detailed
      food list for 12 months with regular visits to the doctor. At each visit, the participating
      patients will be asked about their progress on weight loss and all measurements will be made.
      Simultaneously a control group of primary care physicians will also recruit patients that
      fulfill the inclusion criteria. These patients will also provide data that will serve as
      Control to the intervention group.

      The number of patients with overweight is increasing and a daily issue in general practice.
      Many patients wish to discuss their weight problem with their family physician but many of
      these feel helpless to guide their patients in how to reduce weight. Providing useful and
      correct information should not be so difficult but many doctors choose to refer their
      patients to dietary courses or follow-up in specialist health care.In this study the
      investigators wish to implement a simple tool for treatment of overweight in primary care by
      providing the patients a detailed list for all meals that will ensure a weight loss. The
      patients will be given a close follow-up by their doctor, and the motivating conversation and
      list of meals will be the only treatment given.

      The study is a cluster randomised controlled trial where all general practices in the area of
      Moss city in Norway will be asked to participate. Half of the physicians will constitute the
      intervention group while the other half will serve as control group. Each participating
      doctor in both groups will recruit patients according to the eligibility criteria. The
      doctors in the intervention group will be provided with a course to learn the intervention
      and have a manual to follow for each patient. All participating patients of both groups will
      be asked to meet regularly for data collection.

      According to the power calculation, a number of 12 physicians in each group will be
      sufficient if they recruit 10 patients each.

      The intervention will be conducted for 12 months and thereafter data will be continued to be
      collected at 6 and 12 months after.

    <description>12 Family physicians in primary care will constitute the Intervention group. They will enroll 10 patients each from their ordinary practice. The physicians will be provided with a specific course on the treatment model of the study, including how to collect and register data. They will have a detailed manual indicating the content of each visit.
Following recruitment and consent, the patient will meet for the first visit in the study one week later. At this visit the patient will be provided with detailed information on the content and preparation for all meals. Data will be collected.
The manual describes a diet in accordance with official guidelines providing the patient 1600Kcal per day.
The following visits will take place after 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 4 months, 8 months and 12 months from the first visit. Data will be collected at all visits, and also at 6 and 12 months follow-up.</description>

    <description>12 Family physicians in primary care will constitute the Control group. They will enroll 10 patients each from their ordinary practice. The physicians will not be provided with any information of the treatment model of the study but they will have all information about how to collect and register data.
The patients on this group will also sign consent to provide data and therefore they will know about the study but they do not get any specific information about weight loss other than the general information that their physician may tell them.
The patients in the Control Group will be asked to give data on inclusion visit and again 12 months later, and also at 6 and 12 months thereafter (i.e. 0, 12, 18 and 24 months from inclusion).</description>
