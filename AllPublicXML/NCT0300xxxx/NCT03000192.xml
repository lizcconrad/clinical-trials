      The purpose of this study is to invite all people diagnosed with cancer who meet the
      eligibility criteria to complete questionnaires before their treatment begins and at regular
      intervals over time to assess the impact of cancer and its treatment on people's lives in the
      short, medium and long term. We will explore a range of factors to determine their role in
      both recovery of health and well-being and self-management. Although it is known that people
      who have had cancer are likely to experience a number of physical and psychological problems
      as a result of the disease and treatment, it is not known what the 'typical' course of
      recovery of health and well-being looks like, how long it takes and how this can be
      influenced. We will determine pathways to recovery of health and well-being following cancer
      diagnosis (initially breast cancer diagnosed &lt;50 years, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and
      gynaecological cancers) and identify what factors influence this. This includes assessing the
      relative importance of the person's illness, personal attributes, perceived burden of
      treatment, role of the environment they live in, including health / social care and personal
      networks of support, and their ability and capacity to self-manage. We will identify who is
      most at risk of problems and what environmental supports and resources people are able to
      mobilise to support their self-management. We will also explore who has the confidence and
      ability to manage during and beyond treatment and what factors influence this and whether
      this leads to earlier problem resolution and restoration of health and well-being. This
      knowledge will be used to develop and test future supportive interventions to enhance the
      rapid recovery of health and well-being - our long term aim being to design ways of helping
      people with cancer in areas we identify as problematic for them.

        The aim is to recruit people diagnosed with non-metastatic cancer through their clinical
        teams prior to primary treatment. Participants will be identified and recruited from NHS
        treatment centres across the UK, with centres chosen from those who express an interest
        through the Cancer Research Network (CRN) or directly to the HORIZONS Coordinating Centre.
        Centres will be selected for their proven research capability in these cancer types.
        Centres will indicate that they can approach a total sample of eligible patients and before
        treatment begins. Additionally, Centres will be selected to ensure the Study covers a wide
        range of geographical locations across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland,
        ethnically diverse populations and varying-sized hospitals.
