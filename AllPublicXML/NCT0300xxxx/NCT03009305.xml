  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to describe hemodynamic effects of lower body negative pressure (LBNP).

        1. If and how changes in cerebral oxygen saturation (StO2) measured by near infrared
           spectroscopy (NIRS) relate to changes in blood flow in the carotid arteries during
           progressive LBNP.

        2. If and how mean systemic filling pressure (MSFP) can be measured by brief occlusion of
           blood flow to an arm and if this relates to LBNP-level.

        3. If and how pulse pressure variations and photoplethysmographic amplitude variations
           during positive expiratory pressure (PEP) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
           relate to LBNP-level.

      20 healthy volunteers will be included. The study protocol consists of two parts.

        1. LBNP is applied stepwise (20 mmHg increments). At each LBNP-level, after 2 min
           stabilization, blood flow in internal and external carotid arteries is measured.
           Thereafter, MSFP is measured. LBNP is applied to -80 mmHg, but terminated sooner if the
           subject experiences signs of decompensation.

           Changes in cerebral StO2 will be related to relative changes in blood flow in the
           carotid arteries. After these measurements, blood flow to one arm will be occluded for
           30 s. Venous pressure measured in an antecubital vein approximates MSFP. This will be
           related to volume status (LBNP-level and stroke volume reduction).

        2. LBNP is applied stepwise (20 mmHg increments). At each LBNP-level, after 2 min
           stabilization, PEP and CPAP are applied at 0, 5 and 10 cmH20. LBNP is applied to -80
           mmHg, but terminated sooner if the subject experiences signs of decompensation.

      Flow in carotid arteries is measured by ultrasound/Doppler. Skin blood flow in the forehead
      measured by laser Doppler flowmetry and transcutaneous oxygen saturation.

      If possible, blood flow velocity in a. cerebri media will be measured by transcranial
      Doppler.

      Central venous pressure will be approximated by measuring pressure in the left subclavian
      vein (&quot;half-way&quot; catheter).

      Cardiac stroke volume will be measured by suprasternal Doppler. Expiratory carbon dioxide
      (CO2) will be measured and recorded. Acral skin photoplethysmography performed using
      proprietary and custom-made photoplethysmographs.

      Arterial blood pressure approximated by finger volume-clamp method.

      The measurements above will be used for analyses of possible physiological mechanisms and
      post-hoc analyses.
