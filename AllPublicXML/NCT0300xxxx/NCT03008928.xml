      New technologies offer potential ways to provide and deliver preventative interventions. With
      respect to unhealthy alcohol use, offering people tools to assess and manage their risk at
      any given time using their smartphone may represent an additional opportunity to disseminate
      preventative interventions. Nevertheless, there is a lack of knowledge on the acceptability
      and efficacy of smartphone applications for unhealthy alcohol use. Alcooquizz, a smartphone
      app, has been previously evaluated using a before/after design without randomization, with
      participants reporting reductions in drinking over time. The current trial proposes to
      conduct an RCT, comparing reductions in alcohol consumption between participants provided
      access to Alcooquizz to a no intervention control.

      Participants will be recruited through Amazon's MTurk crowdsourcing platform. Potential
      participants identified as problem drinkers based on an initial survey will be invited to
      complete another survey in 6 months time. Those who agree to be followed-up will be
      randomized to be provided a link to download the Alcooquizz app or to a no link control
      condition. At six-months post-baseline, the MTurk portal will be used to send invitation
      emails that contain a link to the follow-up survey that asks about their drinking and their
      impressions of the app. The primary hypothesis to be tested is that participants receiving
      access to the Alcooquizz app will report a greater level of reduction in number of drinks in
      a typical week between the baseline survey and six-month follow-up as compared to
      participants in the no information control condition.
