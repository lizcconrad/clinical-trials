  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to assess the efficacy of adding pentoxifylline to losartan in
      comparison with increasing dose of losartan in type 2 diabetes patients with nephropathy.
      also the effect of pentoxifylline on N terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP) and
      C-reactive protein

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Addition of pentoxifylline to losartan provides antiproteinuric effects in type 2 diabetes
      patients with nephropathy that might relate to its effect on N terminal brain natriuretic
      peptide (NT-pro BNP) and C-reactive protein.

      Pentoxifylline is a phosphodiestrase inhibitor with anti-inflammatory effects that was used
      in type 2 diabetes patients with nephropathy for treatment of diabetes complications.

      NT-Pro BNP, which is released from the heart due to wall stress and pressures, is known as a
      diagnostic and prognostic marker for heart failure and cardiovascular mortality in type 2
      diabetes.
