      This stepped wedge, randomized controlled trial will test the effectiveness of a Supported
      Self-Management intervention for depression among adults in Vietnam. The intervention will be
      delivered at the community level in 8 Vietnamese provinces by primary care providers and
      social workers. The intervention group will receive the Supported Self-Management
      intervention, while the control group will receive enhanced treatment as usual. The primary
      outcome measure for depression is the Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 (SRQ-20). The World
      Health Organization's Disability Assessment Scale (WHODAS 2.00 and the CAGE
      (Concern/Cut-down, Anger, Guilt, and Eye-opener) measures are also used to assess functional
      ability and alcohol misuse.
