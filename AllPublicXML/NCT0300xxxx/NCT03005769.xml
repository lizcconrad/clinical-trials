  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, retrospective, non-interventional study that will include
      schizophrenic patients who were initiated with aripiprazole once-monthly as per normal
      clinical practice at least 6 months before the data collection starts (inclusion visit), and
      is designed to evaluate demographic and clinical predictors of persistence with this
      treatment.

      Data from each patient will be collected after informed consent is signed (inclusion visit),
      and will include retrospective information from the start of aripiprazole once-monthly
      treatment initiation (index date) until the follow-up/inclusion visit (minimum of 6 months
      after the index date). Data will be retrospectively collected from all visits occurring as
      per clinical practice (usually once monthly).
