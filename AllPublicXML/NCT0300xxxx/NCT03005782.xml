      The primary objectives in the dose escalation phase are to evaluate safety and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) in order to determine a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of REGN3767 as
      monotherapy and in combination with REGN2810 in patients with advanced malignancies,
      including lymphoma. The primary objectives in the dose expansion phase are to assess
      preliminary anti-tumor activity of REGN3767 alone and in combination with REGN2810
      (separately by cohort) as measured by objective response rate (ORR).

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Dose escalation cohorts: Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed
             diagnosis of malignancy (including lymphoma) with demonstrated progression of a tumor
             for whom there is no available therapy likely to convey clinical benefit AND who have
             not been previously treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor. These patients do not require
             measurable disease

          -  Dose expansion cohorts: Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed
             diagnosis of 1 of specified tumors with measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 or Lugano
             criteria. Some patients may have been previously treated with a PD-1 or PD-L1
             inhibitor

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 - Adequate organ and
             bone marrow function

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with any LAG-3 targeting biologic or small molecule

          -  Radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to randomization and not recovered to baseline
             from any AE due to radiation

          -  Untreated or active central nervous system metastases - Ongoing or recent (within 5
             years) evidence of significant autoimmune disease

          -  Corticosteroid therapy (&gt;10 mg prednisone/day or equivalent) within 1 week prior to
             the first dose of study drug

          -  Myocardial infarction within 6 months

          -  Documented allergic or acute hypersensitivity reaction attributed to antibody
             treatments
