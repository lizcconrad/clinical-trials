  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The heart rate variability (HRV) is a measure of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). In the
      model of anorexia nervosa, ANS is disturbed with mostly a predominance of activation of the
      parasympathetic nervous system and a decrease of the sympathetic system. Various explanations
      of this these dysfunctions are proposed in literature, mainly malnutrition, physical
      hyperactivity, anxiety, that are known characteristics of anorexia nervosa.

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate correlation between ANS dysfunction and anxiety
      in anorexia nervosa.

      Other objectives of this study are firstly to evaluate correlation between ANS dysfunction
      and others parameters (weight, body mass index, depression, physical activity, purgative ou
      restrictive type, duration of disease, smoking) in anorexia nervosa and secondly to see if
      HRV is a predictive parameter of the evolution of anorexia nervosa.

    <description>The composite measure consists of the following :- Time and spectral-domain measures of HRV measured by nocturn registration with heart rate monitor and polar RS800CX Time domain - NN (normal-to-normal R-R interval), HRV index (total number of all NN/ the height of the histogram of all NN), SDNN (standard deviation of the NN), RMSSD (the root mean square of differences of successive NN), NN50 (Number of pairs of adjacent NN intervals differing by more than 50 ms in the entire recording) and pNN50 (NN50/total number of all NN), SDANN (Standard deviation of the average of NN intervals in all 5-minute segments of a long recording), SDNNIDX (Mean of the standard deviation in all 5-minute segments of a long recording) Frequency domain - VLF Power (very low frequency; &lt;0.04 Hz), LF Power (low frequency; 0.04~0.15 Hz), HF Power (high frequency; 0.15~0.4 Hz), LF/HF ratio value
