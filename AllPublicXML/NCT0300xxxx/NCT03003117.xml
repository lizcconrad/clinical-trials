  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial among 800 socially
      disadvantaged pregnant women and their families to test the effectiveness of a
      multi-component home visitation nutrition program, compared to usual care, in promoting
      healthy feeding practices and growth in young children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will test an early home based multi-component intervention
      program designed to promote healthy feeding practices and diet in socially disadvantaged
      pregnant women and their families. It first seeks to build knowledge, skills and social
      support regarding maternal diet and feeding practices (with a focus on breastfeeding and
      complementary feeding), within the frame of the French Nutrition and Health Program
      (Programme National Nutrition Santé, PNNS) while accounting for the cultural background and
      barriers of the targeted population (component 1). It also involves fresh fruit and vegetable
      baskets being made available at a reduced price from the 3rd trimester of pregnancy to when
      the toddler is aged 24 months (component 2), along with the provision of follow-on formula
      and baby food vouchers from 6 to 24 months (component 3). The intervention group (n=400) will
      benefit from these 3 program components. The control group (n=400) will receive usual care,
      restricted to general information on healthy eating provided by the food guides of the PNNS.
      The ECAIL study will assess the program's effectiveness on diet and growth in the first 2
      years of life.

    <description>The home based educational component from the 3rd trimester of pregnancy to when the child is aged 24 months seeks to build knowledge, skills and social support (social cognitive theory, anticipatory guidance) to the parents regarding feeding practices (focussing on breastfeeding and complementary feeding), consistent with the French Nutrition and Health Program (PNNS) guidelines (component 1). Fresh fruit and vegetable baskets are made available at a reduced price from the 3rd trimester of pregnancy to when the toddler is aged 24 m (component 2), along with the provision of follow-on formula and baby food vouchers from 6 to 24 m (component 3).
One home visit is scheduled during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Another visit will take place in the maternity ward after the child is born. Five further home visits will take place when the child is aged 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 m.</description>

    <description>Usual Care reflects the standard treatment currently provided within the frame of the French health care system. One home visit is scheduled during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Another visit will take place in the maternity ward after the child is born. Five further home visits will take place when the child is aged 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 m. If nutritional questions are raised by parents, dieticians will restrict their responses based on the food guides of the PNNS.</description>
