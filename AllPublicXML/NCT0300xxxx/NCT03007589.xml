    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess how sunscreens and sun protection fabrics perform in
      natural sunlight compared to their labeled claims, indoor testing methods (existing or
      modified) and instructions.

    <textblock>
      To evaluate the difference in the level of erythema and persistent pigment darkening sun
      protection following a single period of natural sunlight exposure or laboratory solar
      simulator exposure afforded by application of sunscreens, use of fabrics, and use of pass
      through glass filters.

Determination made by blinded evaluator on-site or using chroma-meter and photographs.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Fitzpatrick Type I, II, III, IV or V type skin.

          3. Able to read, write, speak and understand the English language.

             disclosure) and Photograph Release

          5. Generally in good health based on medical history reported by the subject

          6. Healthy male or female subjects with no history or evidence of clinically relevant
             medical disorder, as determined from a brief medical history interview.

          7. Willing and able to follow the study instructions, including:

               -  Remain outdoors exposed to the sun or in the laboratory for up to 4 hours on Day
                  1 during the study with exposed skin on back protected by sunscreens and fabrics

               -  Apply the specific sunscreens and fabrics to designated sites on the back and lie
                  motionless.

               -  No visual signs of recent sun exposure to the back.

               -  No sunscreens or lotions recently used on the back.

               -  Attend scheduled visits and intend to successfully complete the study

               -  Stay out of the sun or stay indoors from sun exposure until after observation on
                  Day 2.

               -  Women are discouraged from using a bra that applies pressure to the skin site
                  areas that may make it difficult to assess erythema or PPD on Day 2.

               -  Refrain from using other sunscreen products or tanning bed use during the
                  duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Individuals with known allergies or sensitivities to sunscreens or any ingredient
             contained in the test products or common topical skincare products, including
             adhesives.

          2. Perceptible erythema, PPD on the back as determined by the PI or designee.

          3. Women known to be pregnant or nursing.

          4. Individuals with any disease or condition of the skin (e.g., active [i.e. flaring]
             eczema or psoriasis, skin cancer, atypical nevus, polymorphic light eruption (PMLE),
             porphyria, systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), xeroderma pigmentosa (XP)) that could
             interfere with the study or increase risk to the subject.

          5. Individuals with self-reported UNCONTROLLED metabolic conditions, such as diabetes,
             hypertension, hyper/hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia

          6. Subjects who are taking medication for chronic conditions that may make a subject more
             sun sensitive (e.g., Tetracyclines, antifungals, certain diuretics, etc.)

          7. Skin diseases on tested sites (e.g., photosensitivity disorders, etc.), which may
             influence the outcome of the study

          8. An individual who has any condition which in the PI's judgment makes the candidate an
             inappropriate subject for study participation

          9. Individuals with a condition or situation which, in the PI's opinion, may put the
             subject at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere
             significantly with the subject's participation in the study

         10. Individual viewed by the PI as not being able to complete the study
