      This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized phase III clinical trial. Planning 320 cases.

      This study will be divided into two stages. Phase one, 120 cases of local advanced breast
      cancer (LABC)who need neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Gene prediction model test(PERS) is performed
      before treatment(ddEC-T+/-H), verify the prediction efficacy of PERS.

      Phase two, 200 cases of LABC primary resistant of antharcycline and taxans. Patients were
      randomized to Arm ddEC-T+/-H and Arm PERS (regimens according to PERS,eg
      NVB+DDP,capacitabine,gemcitabine and so on) pCR rate and DFS is observed.
