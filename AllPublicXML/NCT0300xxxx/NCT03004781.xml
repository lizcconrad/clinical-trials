    <textblock>
      This research compared the efficacy of two parenting interventions that vary according to the
      number and the nature of variables in reducing preschoolers' externalizing behavior (EB). The
      goal was to identify which parenting intervention format (one-variable versus two-variable)
      caused higher behavioral adjustment in children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first format was a one-variable intervention manipulating parental self-efficacy beliefs.
      The second format was a two-variable intervention manipulating both parents' self-efficacy
      beliefs and emotion coaching practices. The two interventions shared exactly the same design,
      consisting of eight parent group sessions. Effect on children's EB and observed behaviors
      were evaluated through a multi-method assessment at three points (pre-test, post-test and
      follow-up).
