        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. At least one cardiologist and one cardiac surgeon agree that it is difficult for the
             patient to receive a surgical procedure due to medical factors such that the subject
             has various comorbidities and he/she is more likely to die or suffer from severe
             diseases than to have significant improvements by a surgical procedure.
