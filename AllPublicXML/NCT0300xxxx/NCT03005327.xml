      The overall objective is to evaluate X4P-001 in the treatment of patients with WHIM Syndrome.

      The primary objective of Phase 2 is to determine the safety, tolerability, and dose selection
      of X4P‑001 for Phase 3 in patients with WHIM syndrome.

      The primary objective of Phase 3 is to demonstrate that X4P-001 is an effective treatment for
      patients with WHIM syndrome, as demonstrated by sustained increases in circulating
      neutrophils and lymphocytes that are associated with improvements in clinical manifestations
      of WHIM syndrome.

          3. Has a genotype-confirmed mutation of CXCR4 consistent with WHIM syndrome.

          4. Agree to use effective contraception as follows:

               -  women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) agree to use highly effective
                  contraceptive methods from Screening, through the study, and for at least 4 weeks
                  after the last dose of study drug (see Section 7.4.1.1 for the definition of
                  non-childbearing potential.)

               -  males, agree to use a condom with any WOCBP sexual partner from Day 1 of study
                  treatment, through the study, and at least 4 weeks after the last dose of study
                  drug.

          5. Be willing and able to comply with this protocol.

          4. Has, at Screening, laboratory tests meeting one or more of the following criteria:

               -  A positive antibody test for hepatitis C virus (HCV), unless documented to have
                  no detectable viral load on two independent samples.
