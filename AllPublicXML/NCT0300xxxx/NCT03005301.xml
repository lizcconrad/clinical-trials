      The present study is a prospective, two-center, randomized, controlled, open-label,
      non-inferiority trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of a new intelligent
      electroacupuncture instrument in treating neck pain caused by cervical spondylosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 160 eligible patients will be included in this trial and randomly assigned to
      experimental group and control group in a 1:1 ratio. In experimental group, selected
      acupoints will be stimulated by the new intelligent electro-acupuncture instrument; while for
      control group, electroacupuncture treatment will be accomplished by a pre-existing
      electro-acupuncture instrument. The duration of treatment will be 2 weeks. The primary
      outcome is the change of visual analog scale score after one course of treatment. The
      secondary outcomes are visual analog scale score after each treatment, the responder rate,
      drug-usage rate of non-steroidal antipyretic analgesics, the occurrence rate of adverse
      events, defect rate of instrument, and excellent rate of instrument.
