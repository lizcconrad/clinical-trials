  <brief_title>To Assess Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of BI 730357 in Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Partially Randomised, Single-blind, Placebo-controlled Trial to Investigate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Single Rising Doses of BI 730357 Administered as Oral Solution and Tablets to Healthy Subjects, and a Randomized, Open-label, Single-dose, Three-way Cross-over Bioavailability Comparison of BI 730357 as Tablet Versus Oral Solution and Tablet With and Without Food</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the SRD part (trial part 1) is to investigate the safety and
      tolerability of BI 730357 in healthy subjects following oral administration of single rising
      doses after fasting and/or non-fasting conditions. The secondary objective is the exploration
      of the pharmacokinetics (PK) including dose proportionality, and pharmacodynamics of BI
      730357 after single dosing.

      The objective of the Bioavailability (BA) part (trial part 2) will be to explore the relative
      bioavailability of tablet fasted versus oral solution fasted and the influence of food on the
      bioavailability of tablet fasted versus tablet fed.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male according to the Investigator's assessment, based on a complete medical
             history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate
             (PR)), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 45 years (incl.)

          -  Body Mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)
             or Electrocardiogram (ECG)) is deviating from normal and judged as clinically relevant
             by the Investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 50 to 90 beats per minute (bpm)

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the Investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the
             Investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy and/or surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with

          -  Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day)

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking on specified trial days

          -  Alcohol abuse (consumption of more 30 g per day for males)

          -  Drug abuse or positive drug screening

          -  Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial
             medication or intended donation during the trial

          -  Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to
             administration of trial medication or during the trial

          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site

          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are
             repeatedly greater than 450 ms) or any other relevant ECG finding at screening

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the Investigator, for instance,
             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a
             condition that would not allow safe participation in the study

        In addition, the following trial-specific exclusion criteria apply:

        - Male subjects with Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) partner who are unwilling to
        use male contraception (condom or sexual abstinence) from the first administration of trial
        medication until 30 days after last administration of trial medication
