      This is a double blind, randomized, active controlled, phase 3 study. Subjects will be
      randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups (CJ-12420 50mg, CJ-12420 100mg,
      esomeprazole 40mg).

      All subjects will be asked to take three tablets at the same time each day throughout the
