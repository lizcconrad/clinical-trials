    <textblock>
      Chinese pediatric massage has been practised as an option for the treatment of pediatric
      diarrhea for hundreds of years (since Ming Dynasty). The history of Chinese pediatric massage
      for health promotion is much longer, it can be traced back to more than one thousand years
      ago (652 AD). Many of the acupoints adopted in Chinese pediatric massage are unique if it is
      compared with those for adult massage. The manipulation is found to be easily accepted by
      children, as the strength of massage is gentle and soft. No severe adverse reaction in
      regards of Chinese pediatric massage was reported, the mild adverse reaction such as skin
      abrasion can be completely avoided with correct operating instructions.

    <description>Patients will receive Montmorillonite Powder and racecadotril granules as usual care according to different age or weight. Intravenous infusion, Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS), Zn,and antibiotics will be used if the pediatrician in charge considers necessary. Patients will receive Chinese pediatric massage once per day and for three days continuously. A cloak which can cover the child's hands and upper body will be required to put on, all the manipulations will be done under the cloak. Six acupoints will be adopted,i.e. Neibagua, Dachang,Xiaochang, Banmen, Fu, Tuishang Qijiegu. Each visit, children who are under 2 years old will receive manipulations on Neibagua for 500 times, 300 times for the other 5 acupoints each; if they are from 2-3 years old, the manipulations on Neibagua will be 700 times and 500 times for the other 5 acupoints respectively; while the manipulations on Neibagua will be 1000 times, and 800 times for the other 5 acupoints if the children are from 4-6 years old.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive the same usual care as the experimental group. For the sham massage, the therapist will use one hand to hold the childrens' hand or just put one hand on childrens' body and the other hand will do the manipulations on the therapist's own hand instead childrens' hand or childrens' body. Patients will be required to put on the same kind of cloak as that for the the experimental group, all the manipulations will be done under the cloak. The manipulation times for each acupoints will be the same as those for experimental group in accordance with different age. The sham massage will be given once per day for 3 days continuously.</description>
