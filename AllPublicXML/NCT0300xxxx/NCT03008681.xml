      The aim of the study was to determine the changes in Oral Health-Related Quality of Life
      (OHRQoL) in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and temporomandibular joint
      (TMJ) disorders who underwent functional therapy for 24 months to assess the age and sex
      group in which the functional therapy was most effective.

      This prospective interventional study included 93 patients with JIA and TMJ disorders at the
      start of functional orthodontic therapy. Children were prospectively followed in the 24
      months of treatment and completed the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) before treatment
      (T0), and at 6 months (T1), 12 months (T2), and 24 months (T3) after the start of therapy.

    <description>All the enrolled patients was applied the Andresen Activator (a removable orthodontic appliance) 12-14 hours in a day in total.
Functional appliances helped the movement of the teeth, with the achievement of good facial muscle function. All patients in the cohort were treated with the andresen actovator appliancev for deep bite and class II malocclusion correction.
The appliances were individually manufactured of acrylic resin, with a central screw and a vestibular arch, fabricated through a wax bite registration; the patient was guided to close the mouth in mandibular protrusion with coincidence of the upper and lower midlines. The registration bite was very thin in order to obtain a minimum vertical dimension. The activator was modified every three months increasing its posterior vertical dimension in order to stimulate the mandibular ramus growth thanks to the dislocation of the mandibular condyle.</description>

    <description>Included patients were treated for 24 months with a Functional removable orthodontic appliance, the Andresen activator. The initial checks were performed after 6 weeks with subsequent checks being carried out every 8th week, with the final follow-up at 24 months. The patient underwent functional treatment using the activator described in the protocol with midlines coincidence.</description>
