      1. The investigators will design, test and implement a education curriculum for anesthesia
           residents teaching geriatric anesthesiology.

        2. The investigators will randomize 42 anesthesia residents so that half receive an
           innovative, e-learning curriculum while the other half receives the current standard
           curriculum. We will assess their medical knowledge, and the amount of anesthesia
           delivered to patients after the curriculum is implemented.

        3. The investigators will analyze any changes in clinical practice of residents in the care
           of elderly patients. Enrollment will be voluntary for all residents. Also, the
           investigators will not interfere with clinical management of any patients by residents
           which are done under direct supervision of faculty.

    <description>The investigators will use an electronic learning (E-learning) curriculum with an educational video and a user-centered checklist for anesthesia residents. This E-learning curriculum will cover how to care for geriatric patients in the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative settings, and specific interventions that have been shown to improve postoperative outcomes in older patients.
The checklist will be user-centered. It will remind providers of what they learned in the video and online curriculum, and how to apply these lessons in real-time while they are caring for older patients.</description>
