      Umbilical pilonidal sinus (UPS) is a rare disease of young, hirsute, dark men with deep
      navels and poor personal hygiene; however, it can be seen in females. UPS could easily be
      misdiagnosed and mistreated due to its rarity and lack of awareness in physicians. Diagnosis
      is easy to establish with physical examination and a detailed history. Treatment is generally
      depending on the severity of the disease, ranging from good personal hygiene to surgical
      excision of umbilical complex. The treatment of choice for chronic, intermittent cases is
      surgical removal of the affected portion; paying special attention to cosmetic appearance
      especially in female patients. In this report, we present two cases of UPS, one in a man and
      one in a woman with the explanation of its etiopathogenesis and surgical treatment.

      Introduction: Umbilical pilonidal sinus (UPS) is a rare disease of young, hirsute, dark men
      with deep navels and poor personal hygiene. It is being diagnosed and reported more
      frequently; however, there is still no consensus regarding its best treatment options.

      Presentation of cases: In this report, we present two cases of UPS, one in a man and one in a
      woman who had typical symptoms with pain, swelling and intermittent malodorous discharge from
      the umbilicus. They had small sinus openings with hair protruding deep in the navel. Because
      patients had previous history of failed conservative treatments an umbilicus preserving
      surgery was performed for both cases.

    <description>Primary outcome was the cure rate. Absence of recurrence within two year after the first treatment was considered as a cure.
Recurrence was defined as the appearance of a new, active discharging sinus or granulation tissue with/without a bit of hairs in the deep of the umbilicus within two years after therapy.</description>
