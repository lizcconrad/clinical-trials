    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study to integrate techniques producing images of the brain (also
      called neuroimaging techniques) with non-invasive brain stimulation to investigate factors
      that may be associated with chronic pain in patients with Trigeminal Neuropathic Pain (TNP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trigeminal neuropathic pain (TNP) disorders, such as classical trigeminal and post-surgical
      neuralgia, are debilitating chronic conditions with pain that is either spontaneous or that
      can be intensely evoked by light touch to the facial skin. Although neuroimaging techniques
      have provided insights into some brain mechanisms of experimental trigeminal pain in humans
      (DaSilva et al., 2002; Borsook et al., 2003), it is not well understood how structural and
      molecular mechanisms are affected during the course of TNP, and how they can be safely
      modulated for therapeutic and research purposes. Understanding these processes is crucial to
      determine the structures engaged in the development and persistence of TNP.

      We will test the hypothesis that chronicity of TNP is sustained by changes at cellular and
      molecular levels in neural circuits associated with pain perception and modulation, rather
      than by the initial peripheral etiology, and that this dysfunction can be safely targeted and
      modulated as a therapeutic approach by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). To
      achieve this goal we will use a neuroimaging technique, PET, employing a mathematical model
      that permits the quantification of opioid receptor availability in vivo.

    <description>Two 90 minute scans whose maximum radiological dose is 15 mCi [11 C] carfentanil, a selective and specific mu-opioid receptor radioligand. The first one provided baseline data, and the second occurred with the sequence of sham tDCS and tDCS as described in each arm description.</description>
