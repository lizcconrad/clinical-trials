  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective,multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled clinical
      trial,aims to assess the clinical noninferiority of 3 months (short-term) vs 12 months
      (long-term) of Dual Anti-Platelet Therapy (DAPT) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary
      intervention implanted sirolimus target- eluting stent with abluminal grooves containing a
      biodegradable polymer (Firehawk™ stent). All participants met the inclusion criteria begin
      taking aspirin and open-label thienopyridine therapy before index procedure, and will be 1:1
      randomized to 3 months or 12 month of DAPT at index procedure.

      This study will recruit 2,446 subjects with stable coronary artery disease in no more than 40
      research centers in China. All participants met the inclusion criteria will be 1:1 randomized
      to 3 months or 12 month of DAPT after implanting Firehawk™ coronary stent.Clinical follow-up
      will be carried out at 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 2 years and 3 years
      after index procedure.The primary study endpoint is Net Adverse Clinical and Cerebral Events
      (NACCE), a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), cerebral vascular
      accident (CVA) and major bleeding (academic research consortium [ARC] definition and GUSTO
      definition) at 18 months. Subjects that complete of 18 months follow-up will be regarded as
      having completed the primary endpoint. The secondary study endpoints contain ARC defined
      stent thrombosis (ST) at all study time-points; NACCE at 30 days,6,12,24 and 36 months of
      follow-up;major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE),major adverse cardiovascular and
      cerebral events (MACCE),target lesion revascularization (TLR),target lesion failure(TLF),ST
      at 30 days,6,12 ,18,24 and 36 months of follow-up; major bleeding at 1, 3, 6, 12 ,18,24 and
      36 months of follow up; as well as cost-effective at 18 months of follow-up.
