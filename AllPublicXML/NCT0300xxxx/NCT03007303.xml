  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the relationship of circulating microRNA-30e and schizophrenia, and
      shows the relevance of the aberrant microRNA-30e expression in plasma with the variation
      disease status.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The plasma samples from 15 individuals with schizophrenia (with a diagnosis of ICD-10) and
      the equivalent healthy controls will be conducted with the quantification analysis of the
      microRNA-30e via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR).

      The 15 patients enrolled should be the first-episode and have not been treated, or were drug
      free 3 months recently at least.

      This research measures the expression level of microRNA-30e in schizophrenia respectively
      before the beginning treatment with atypical psychotics or combined with MECT, after the
      4-week treated , the 8-week treated compared with 15 healthy controls.
