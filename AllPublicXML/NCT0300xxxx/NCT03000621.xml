  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives are to:

        1. validate a panel of tissue-specific miRNAs that are differentially expressed in the
           plasma of patients with and without liver injuries

        2. investigate the physiological range of the circulating miRNA panel in Healthy Subjects
           and under stress

        3. investigate the dysregulation of circulating miRNA panel and their prognostic and
           predictive values in clinical outcomes in identifying patients at high risk for
           mortality and acute liver failure.

      This trial involves peripheral blood sampling from subjects at their earliest presentation
      and remaining stays in the hospitalization in the emergency department. The investigators
      will develop panels of miRNAs that are specific indicator of early onset of major organ
      failures, and correlate clinical outcomes with these miRNAs.

      The ICU patients after surgery or under chemotherapies in sponsor's institutes will be
      enrolled in this observational cohort of investigation. Whole blood samples will be separated
      immediately into plasma for storage. The participants will have their 2nd and 3rd samples
      obtained at 24-48 hours and 48-72 hours respectively. The schedule of most of sampling
      schedule is designed in concordance with the ICU routines to avoid extra burdens on patients.
      The plasma samples will be used as prognostic markers in prognostic and predictive values in
      identifying patients at high risk for mortality and acute liver failure. Patients who are
      discharged will be tracked for any clinical recurrence of the diseases every 28 days to
      assess the diagnostic accuracy of the miRNA biomarkers that are measured.

      The 2nd objective will be assessed by measuring the concentration of miRNAs in recruited
      healthy volunteers before and after a brief public speech. The circulating miRNAs will be
      detected directly from 1 - 5 ul of plasma samples with the miRFLP assay. This capillary
      electrophoresis-based miRNA quantification method detects multiple miRNAs in absolute copy
      number in smaller sample signature with negligible batch to batch variation, thus providing a
      standardizable miRNA detection method.

        This research project will recruit a cohort of prospective observational cancer patients in
        ICU after surgery or chemotherapy. Admitted patients will be followed-up in the inpatient
        units in concordance with ICU protocols. Upon discharged, patients will be followed-up in
        every 28 days for any disease recurrence and clinical outcomes. Healthy controls will also
        be recruited to demonstrate the physiological level of different circulating miRNAs.
