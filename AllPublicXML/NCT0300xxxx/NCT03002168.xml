  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Investigator hypothesizes that the currently used dose of dietary ingredient
      alpha-cyclodextrin (α-CD) will result in greater loss of dietary fat in the stool compared
      with placebo. The proposed studies will address the degree to which α-CD increases dietary
      fat loss.

      The Investigator will conduct the study and analyze the samples at Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
      Minnesota.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, two-way crossover
      trial in healthy volunteers. The primary objective is to determine the fat losses in stool
      associated with alpha-cyclodextrin use as compared to placebo using a radiotracer. The study
      design will include two treatment periods, assigned in random order:

        -  Treatment 1 consists of subjects receiving α-CD and a meal containing the fatty acid
           radiotracers

        -  Treatment 2 consists of subjects receiving placebo and a meal containing the fatty acid
           radiotracers

      All subjects randomized to receive α-CD will orally ingest two tablets containing α-CD, or
      placebo, with a standardized liquid breakfast (100 µ Ci of [3H]triolein and 20 µ Ci of [14C]
      tripalmitin). The tablets will be consumed with 150 ml of still (uncarbonated) water
      immediately prior to consuming each meal.

      Subjects will be observed for a period of 48 hours as an in-patient, and then an additional
      24 hours as an out-patient following the breakfast meal containing the radiotracers. During
      this time the participants will undergo a meal fatty acid metabolism study, through hourly
      blood and fecal sampling, to assess meal fatty acid oxidation and storage.

      The participants will then undergo a further ≥ 14 day washout period before crossing over to
      the alternate treatment, where all evaluations will be repeated.
