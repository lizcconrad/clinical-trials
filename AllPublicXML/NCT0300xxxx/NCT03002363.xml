      The purpose of the current study is to determine if pre-exposure through video modeling will
      enhance testing compliance in a population of children who are receiving a diagnostic
      evaluation for Autism. Another purpose of this study is to determine if pre-exposure to the
      test setting can increase the compliance on individual test measures. To test the central
      hypothesis and accomplish the study objective, 2 aims guide the proposed study.

        1. Determine the extent to which pre-exposure to expectations and tasks that occur during
           the audiological evaluation will increase audiological testing compliance. Hypothesis:
           Children receiving the intervention video, which will model what they will experience
           during the audiological evaluation, will show greater compliance during the evaluation
           than children who receive the placebo video.

        2. Determine the extent to which enhanced testing compliance will increase the number of
           test measures obtained during an audiological evaluation. Hypothesis: Children who are
           more compliant during the audiological evaluation will allow the audiologist to obtain
           more test measures in a single appointment than the children who are less compliant.

Compliance is measured as either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to each of the tests in order to measure how many audiology tests are completed at the visit.

    <description>Prior to arrival of the audiological evaluation, the child and caregiver will be required to watch one of two videos created by the research personnel. One video, the intervention video, is a behavior modeling video walking through the entire audiological evaluation. It also includes tips for caregivers to practice with their child before the appointment. The other video is a placebo video that discusses hearing, listening and ears, that does not discuss tips for caregivers to practice with their child before the appointment. The placebo video is not related to the audiological evaluation.</description>
