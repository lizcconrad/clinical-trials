      This phase II trial studies efficacy of extracorporeal photopheresis and low dose aldesleukin
      (interleukin-2) in treating patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) that does
      not respond to upfront treatment with steroids. In graft-vs-host disease, patients have a
      small quantity of a white blood cell called T regulatory cells or T-reg cells that helps to
      control the immune system. Extracorporeal photopheresis is a procedure where patient's blood
      is removed and treated with ultraviolet light and drugs that become active when exposed to
      light. The treated blood is then returned to the patient and may be effective in increasing
      T-reg cells in patients with cGVHD. Aldesleukin increases the activity and growth of white
      blood cells, and it has shown to enhance T-reg cells in patients with cGVHD and may be
      effective improving GVHD symptoms.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the anti-cGVHD activity of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) when combined
      with low dose IL-2 (interleukin 2) (aldesleukin), in patients with steroid refractory cGVHD,
      as assessed by overall cGVHD response rate (complete response [CR]+partial response
      [PR]+stable disease [SD]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Characterize and evaluate toxicities, including type, frequency, severity, attribution,
      time course and duration.

      II. Estimate overall and failure-free survival, non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse,
      through 1 year after initiation of treatment.

      III. Characterize chronic GVHD Symptom Scale scores -self-report (with assistance from
      register nurses [RNs] and medical doctors [MDs]).

      IV. Assess the immunologic effects of low-dose daily subcutaneous (SC) IL-2 + ECP.

      V. Correlate clinical endpoints of response with ECP performance parameters.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) daily for 12 weeks. Patients also undergo
      ECP twice weekly on weeks 1-4 and then receive 2 ECP treatments every 2 weeks on weeks 5-12.
      Patients responding to upfront therapy with aldesleukin and ECP have the option to continue
      combination therapy per the discretion of the treating physician until clinical benefit is
      maintained or toxicities develop.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

             composition to IL-2

          -  Patients must not have received prior chemotherapy (pentostatin) within 4 weeks before
