  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain images (pictures) of normal oral tissue, which occur
      inside the mouth, using a special camera. These pictures will be used in our research to
      evaluate a new technology that uses a laser and takes pictures of the microscopic structure
      of tissue. The technology is called &quot;reflectance confocal microscopy.&quot;

    <description>Each image will be scored either 1 (completely unacceptable), 2 (unacceptable), 3 (possibly acceptable), 4 (acceptable) or 5 (very acceptable) relative to a reference standard The reference standard for appearance of adequate sectioning, resolution and contrast and for detectability of nuclear and cellular features will be the appearance of images and image quality, which we are intimately familiar with, based on the past several years of experience with the existing RCM device for which images of oral mucosa have been well-characterized, well-correlated to histology, and thus are well-understood.</description>
