      Sodium (Na+) hemostasis is abnormal in CKD patients, and this element can be deposited in the
      skin, muscle and skeleton - to cope with long term sodium loading. It is known that sodium
      stored in this non-osmotically active way, is profoundly inflammatory. Furthermore,
      inflammation has been associated with a number of uremic symptoms. The investigators will use
      novel Na+ MRI imaging to examine the Na+ deposition in skin, muscle and skeleton of three
      groups of patients: 1) chronic 3-times-a-week in-center hemodialysis patients, 2) peritoneal
      dialysis patients, and 3) patients with CKD stage 4-5; and compare these results to age and
      sex matched healthy controls. Additionally, they will investigate the association between
      sodium deposition in these tissues with uremic symptomatology and biochemical markers of
      metabolism.

    <textblock>
      Kidneys have a key role in sodium hemostasis through their excretory function. In patients
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD), kidney function is impaired; thus, suggesting that sodium
      handling is abnormal in this setting with long-term sodium loading (from oral intake) and
      lack of adequate urinary excretion. Yet, sodium concentration needs to stay relatively
      constant to prevent fatal intra-cellular accumulation, which would result in cell injury and
      death. In hemodialysis patients, at least a part of this extra sodium has been shown to be
      non-osmotically active and deposited in the skin, muscle and skeleton.

      Furthermore, it has become increasingly recognized that sodium (once accumulated in tissues)
      is directly pro-inflammatory, affecting innate immune system by regulating the activity of
      macrophages in skin. This linkage between sodium and inflammation indicates a potential link
      between sodium deposition and uremic symptoms experienced by patients.

      There have been no studies to date examining the sodium deposition in the skin, muscle and
      skeleton of patients with different kidney function and renal replacement therapy.

      The investigators therefore propose to use novel Na+ MRI imaging to examine the Na+
      deposition in skin, muscle and skeleton of three groups of patients: 1) chronic
      3-times-a-week in-center hemodialysis patients, 2) peritoneal dialysis patients, and 3)
      patients with CKD stage 4-5; and compare these results to age and sex matched healthy
      controls. Additionally, they intend to investigate the association between sodium deposition
      in these tissues with uremic symptomatology and biochemical markers of metabolism.

      This is an observational cohort imaging study involving a single center recruiting patients
      from the prevalent conventional hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and CKD stage 4-5
      population of London, Ontario, compared to healthy controls. Once recruited, participants
      will undergo a study session (on a non-dialysis day for hemodialysis patients). This session
      will include symptom questionnaires, blood work, and an MRI study of the thigh detecting
      sodium content. The investigators' aim is to characterize Na+ deposition in these different
      patient groups and analyze their association with biochemical markers, and uremic symptom
      severity.
