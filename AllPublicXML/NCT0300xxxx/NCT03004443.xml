  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased inflammation has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a number of
      neuropsychiatric illnesses including mood disorders, which affect almost 30 million adults in
      the United States alone. One mechanism by which inflammation may alter behavior is through
      increasing brain glutamate, a neurotransmitter that in excess has been implicated in neuronal
      toxicity and resistance to conventional antidepressant therapy. The goal of the proposed
      research is to test the hypothesis that inflammation alters behavior through increasing
      glutamate in specific brain regions, ultimately leading to behavioral changes.

      The proposed research is designed to determine the cause and effect relationship between
      inflammation and CNS glutamate as well as the relationship between CNS glutamate and specific
      symptoms. To accomplish these aims, investigators will administer a single infusion of either
      the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist infliximab or placebo (n=30 per group) to patients
      with high inflammation (CRP&gt;3mg/L). A CRP&gt;3mg/L was chosen because it is considered high
      inflammation according to guidelines by the American Heart Association. Moreover, a CRP&gt;3mg/L
      is associated with significantly increased basal ganglia glutamate and with a clinical
      response to infliximab. Inflammatory biomarkers, basal ganglia glutamate as measured by MRS,
      and motivation and psychomotor activity will be assessed at baseline and days 1 and 3 and
      weeks 1 and 2 following infliximab or placebo administration.

      This study aims to test the hypothesis that increased inflammation causes increased basal
      ganglia glutamate and consequently anhedonia and psychomotor retardation in patients with
      major depressive disorder (MDD). Excessive inflammation and glutamate excitotoxicity are two
      pathways that have received increasing attention regarding the pathophysiology of
      neuropsychiatric disease including mood disorders. Patients with depression exhibit increased
      peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) markers of inflammation as well as altered CNS
      glutamate as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). In addition, drugs that block
      either inflammation or glutamate signaling can reverse depressive symptoms, especially in
      depressed patients with treatment resistance.

      Inflammatory cytokines are known to inhibit glutamate reuptake and increase glutamate release
      from astrocytes, and glutamate antagonists have been shown to block inflammation-induced
      depressive-like behavior in mice. Moreover, using MRS, data has shown that administration of
      the inflammatory cytokine interferon (IFN)-alpha significantly increases glutamate in the
      basal ganglia in association with IFN-alpha-induced anhedonia and psychomotor slowing. In
      addition, increased inflammation as reflected by peripheral blood C-reactive protein (CRP) is
      correlated with increased basal ganglia glutamate in association with decreased motivation
      and psychomotor speed in patients with MDD. Nevertheless, the data to date has been
      correlational, and whether increased inflammation causes increased glutamate in the basal
      ganglia, which in turn contributes to behavioral changes in patients with depression has not
      been established.

      To test this hypothesis, investigators plan to determine the cause and effect relationship
      between increased inflammation and increased CNS glutamate by blocking inflammation in
      depressed patients with high inflammation (CRP&gt;3mg/L) using the highly specific tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist infliximab (n=30) versus placebo (n=30). In addition, the
      study team will examine whether changes in basal ganglia glutamate are linked to changes in
      behaviors related to the basal ganglia including anhedonia and psychomotor retardation.

    <measure>Change in Effort-Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 3, Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The EEfRT task is a multi-trial game in which participants are given an opportunity on each trial to choose between two different task difficulty levels in order to obtain monetary rewards. For all trials, participants make repeated manual button presses within a short period of time. Each button press raises the level of a virtual ''bar'' viewed onscreen by the participant. Participants are eligible to win the money allotted for each trial if they raise the bar to the ''top'' within the prescribed time period.Lower proportions of hard task choices indicate decreased motivation.</description>

    <measure>Change in Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS-C) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 3, Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) is a self-administered, paper-pencil questionnaire with 14 items assessing four domains of pleasure response/hedonic experience: interest/pastimes, social interaction, sensory experience, and food/drink. Either of the Disagree responses receives a score of 1 and either of the Agree responses receives a score of 0. The SHAPS is scored as the sum of the 14 items so that total scores ranged from 0 to 14. A higher total SHAPS score indicated higher levels of anhedonia. A cut-off score of 2 provides the best discrimination between &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;abnormal&quot; level of hedonic tone.</description>

    <measure>Change in Mood and Pleasure Scale (MAP) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 3, Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The mood and pleasure questionnaire is an 18-item self-report inventory that was created to disentangle state-wise motivational and consummatory components of everyday activities over a 24-hour period. A score of 5-9 is positive for Mild Depression. A score of 10-14 is positive or Moderate Depression. A score of 15 or more is positive for Severe Depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Finger Tapping Task (FTT) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 3, Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The FTT uses a specially adapted tapper that the subject taps as fast as possible using the index finger. The subject is given 5 consecutive 10-second trials for the preferred and non-preferred hands. The finger tapping score is the mean of 5 trials and is computed for each hand. The FTT is designed to assess subtle motor impairment and is altered in subjects with basal ganglia disorders and lesions. A lower score indicates motor impairment.</description>

    <description>The RTT measures simple and choice movement and reaction time and is divided into 5 stages requiring increasingly complex chains of responses and providing distinction between reaction (or decision) time and movement latencies. A longer reaction time may indicate cognitive impairment.</description>

The test involves graphimotor speed, visual scanning and memory, with about half of the variance being accounted for by graphimotor speed, a third by visual scanning and 4-5% by memory.Performance on the DSST has been found to correlate with subcortical atrophy in disorders involving basal ganglia.</description>
