      The aim of this cluster randomised control trial is to test the efficacy of a repeated taste

      The aim of this study is to test the efficacy of a repeated taste exposure intervention, a
      nutritional educational intervention and combination of both to increase intake of an
      unfamiliar vegetable in preschool aged children (aged 3-5 years). In particular the study
      will assess whether these strategies are effective to encourage intake of an unfamiliar
      vegetable in children who are fussy eaters or going through the food neophobia phase. The
      effectiveness of these interventions will also be observed overtime at 3 and 6 months post
      intervention.

      Nurseries will be randomised into one of four conditions over the 12 week intervention
      period; these include educational intervention only, taste exposures only, taste exposures
      and educational intervention or no intervention (control group). All children will be offered
      an unfamiliar vegetable prior to the intervention and after the intervention to evaluate
      changes in intake of the unfamiliar vegetable. The repeated taste exposure groups will be
      offered the novel vegetable repeatedly (1 exposure per week) over the 12 week period. For the
      educational intervention nursery staff will be advised to deliver two components of an
      existing PhunkyFoods educational programme over the same period.

      Parents will be asked some general demographic questions, child food behaviour questions and
      questions about their feeding practices. Finally nursery staff will be requested to provide
      feedback to evaluate intervention feasibility, barriers and efficacy.

      It is predicted that children's intake of the unfamiliar vegetable will vary by intervention.
      The primary hypothesis to be tested is that children who receive the repeated taste exposures
      are more likely to increase their intake of the unfamiliar vegetable compared to those in
      educational only or control conditions. The second hypothesis is that repeated taste
      exposures will increase intake of an unfamiliar vegetable in fussy eaters more than
      education.

    <description>Children will be repeatedly offered the single vegetable which is unfamiliar to them over the 12 week period. Children will be in their natural setting at nursery and will be offered 40g of the vegetable by their usual nursery staff. The vegetable will be weighed before and after using a digital scale by the researcher.</description>

    <description>Nursery staff will be trained by the PhunkyFoods team to deliver the nutritional education programme. Children will be taught Eat Well (learning about different food groups) and Strive for Five (learning about eating fruits and vegetables) components of the PhunkyFoods education programme by their usual nursery staff. Nurseries will be advised to deliver as much as possible of the two components over the 12 week period.</description>
