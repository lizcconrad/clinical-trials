  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate a short term influence of the Spinal Manipulation (SM) on
      the wrist muscles spasticity and manual dexterity in children with spastic Cerebral Palsy.

      Effect of SM and imitation of the SM has to be compared in the double-blinded randomized
      clinical trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Muscle spasticity is an important clinical syndrome of Cerebral Palsy (CP) resulting from
      upper motor neuron lesion, and its reduction is a significant therapeutic target for
      optimizing motor performance.

      Investigator's recent study describes decrease in spasticity after SM in a group of children
      with CP. But that case series has no control group and the sample size was small so it does
      not prove the influence of the SM on the muscle spasticity.

      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate influence of the SM on muscle spasticity and
      on manual dexterity of the child with CP in a double-blind randomized clinical trial with two
      arms: SM (experimental group) and imitation of SM (control group).

      Children admitted to the International Clinic of Rehabilitation are selected according to
      inclusion-exclusion criteria and invited to participate. After getting the permission the
      baseline assessment is performed.

      Patients are allocated to the experimental or control group using stratified randomization.
      Medical doctor certified in Manual Therapy performs the intervention (SM in the experimental
      group and imitation in the control group) and in 15 minutes the second assessment is
      performed. Investigators, children and parents are blinded to group allocation.

    <measure>Change of muscle spasticity after the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline assesment and 15 min after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Quantitative, instrumental spasticity measurement is preformed using the Neuroflexor device. It is measuring resistance to passive movements of the wrist performed with different speed and calculates components of muscle tone, separating spasticity as reflex phenomenon from resistance due to secondary changes of the muscles and tendons.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline assesment and 15 min after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Manual dexterity is evaluated using Box and Blocks test. The score is the number of blocks carried by hand from one compartment to the other in one minute.</description>

    <description>Spinal manipulation (SM) is a therapeutic intervention performed on spinal articulations in which force is applied to the spine. The selected joint is moved to its end range of motion, followed by application of an rapid impulse or thrust to achieve a gapping of the target joint.
SM is performed by an orthopedic medical doctor certified in Manual Therapy. After manual evaluation, high-velocity low-amplitude SM is carried out in all regions of the spine, including thoracic adjustments in the prone position, lumbar manipulation in lateral recumbent position, and cervical manipulation in sitting position.</description>

    <description>Imitation of the SM physically and visually resembles the act of SM. It comprises placing the patient in the same positions and performing the same movements as during SM but without applying the force in the end range of motion.</description>
