      We aim to measure the impact of a transition program in congenital cardiology in terms of
      health-related quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of adults with congenital heart diseases (CHD) is increasing. However, many young
      adults are lost to follow-up even in experienced tertiary care centers. American and European
      guidelines recommend to improve the management of young adults with CHD. Structured
      therapeutic education programs are therefore needed to optimize the transfer to adult
      healthcare. Our tertiary care CHD center recently implemented a transition program and
      simultaneously we decided to measure its impact. Indeed we need data from randomized trials
      in this filed. After previous controlled quality of life studies among children and adults
      with CHD, we chose to use the health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) as primary endpoint in
      this randomized study to focus on patient related outcomes.

      We assume that patients who participate in our program will improve their quality of life
      compared to controls. If we demonstrate the benefit of our program, it will have important
      consequences for patients with CHD and eventually for patients with other chronic medical
      conditions.
