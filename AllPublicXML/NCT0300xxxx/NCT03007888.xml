      Primary Objective:

      To compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and multiple doses of IPX203 with Immediate
      release carbidopa-levodopa (IR CD-LD) in subjects with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD).

      Secondary Objectives:

      To compare the pharmacodynamics of single and multiple doses of IPX203 with IR CD-LD.

      To compare the efficacy of IPX203 with IR CD-LD following multiple doses.

      To evaluate the safety of IPX203.

      IPX203 is an investigational product containing CD‑LD.

      IPX203-B16-01 Study Design:

      A randomized, open-label, rater-blinded, multicenter, 2-treatment, 2‑period, multiple-dose
      crossover study.

      Approximately 30 qualified IR CD-LD-experienced advanced PD subjects will be randomized.

      The study duration will be approximately 8 weeks, including the screening period.

        Eligibility will be determined at screening and Visit 1 of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with idiopathic PD at age ≥ 40 years who are being chronically treated with
             stable regimens of CD-LD but experiencing motor complications.

          -  For the 4 weeks prior to the Screening, the subject experiences daily &quot;wearing-off&quot;
             episodes with periods of bradykinesia and rigidity and experiences an &quot;off&quot; state upon
             awakening on most mornings by history.

          -  Responsive to CD‑LD therapy and currently being treated on a stable regimen with CD‑LD
             for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1

          -  Typically experiences an &quot;on&quot; response with the first dose of IR CD‑LD of the day (by
             subject history).

          -  By history, efficacy of the first morning dose of IR CD-LD lasts less than 4 hours

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of medical conditions or of a prior surgical procedure that would interfere
             with LD absorption, such as gastrectomy or proximal small-bowel resection.

          -  Liver enzyme values ≥ 2.5 x the upper limit of normal; or history of severe hepatic
             impairment.

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within the 12 months prior to Screening.

          -  Received within 4 weeks of Visit 1 or planning to take during participation in the
             clinical study: any doses of a controlled-release (CR) LD apart from a single daily
             bedtime dose or any doses of Rytary, additional CD (eg, Lodosyn) or benserazide (eg,
             Serazide), or catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitors (entacapone or tolcapone) or
             medications containing these inhibitors (Stalevo). Received within 4 weeks of Visit 1
             or planning to take during participation in the clinical study: nonselective monoamine
             oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, apomorphine, or dopaminergic blocking agents including
             antiemetics.

          -  History of psychosis within the past 10 years.

          -  Treatment with any dopamine antagonist antipsychotics for the purposes of psychosis or
             bipolar disorder within the last 2 years.

          -  Based on clinical assessment, subject does not adequately comprehend the terminology
             needed to complete the PD Diary.
