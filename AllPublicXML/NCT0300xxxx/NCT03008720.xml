      Introduction: It is suggested that increased cortical activity, induced by cerebral
      stimulation associated or not with other rehabilitation techniques, may potentiate the motor
      and functional therapeutic effects in individuals with neurological deficits. Objectives: To
      evaluate the electrical activity of the anterior tibial muscle (TA) and postural control of
      individuals with hemiparesis due to stroke following treatment with transcranial direct
      current (tDCS) stimulation and functional electrical stimulation (FES), associated or
      isolated). (EMG) and postural control by the Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest). Both
      of which were collected at four different time points: pre-treatment, immediately after 10
      treatment sessions, and 30 days follow-up after the interventions. Patients will be
      randomized into 4 experimental groups: tDCS anodic active + active FES+ active contraction
      TA, tDCS sham + active FES+ active contraction TA, tDCS anodic active+ placebo FES+ active
      contraction TA, tDCS sham+ FES sham+ active contraction TA. tDCS (2mA) will be applied over
      the motor (Cz) and cathodic vertex over the supraorbital region of the normal hemisphere and
      FES over hemiparetic TA by a researcher who will not be the one who will evaluate the
      anesthesia patient. The treatment will last 10 sessions, twice a week, with a time of 20
      minutes.

    <description>Functional electrical stimulation (FES) active will be administered using QUARK® FES VIF 995 DUAL device. The duration of active FES will be 20 minutes, associated with active contraction of the TA muscle. The pulse width will be 250 μs, modulated at a frequency of 50 Hz, with one to two stimulation cycles (6 seconds on and 12 seconds off) and the intensity will be increased until reaching the motor threshold.</description>
