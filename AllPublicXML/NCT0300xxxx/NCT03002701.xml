      Delirium is a common disorder in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients and is associated with
      serious short- and long-term consequences. This study focuses on a program of standardized
      nursing and physical therapy interventions to prevent delirium in the ICU, and determines the
      effect of the program on the number of delirium-coma-free days in 28 days and several
      secondary outcomes in a multicenter randomized controlled trial.

    <textblock>
      Delirium is a common disorder in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients and is associated with
      serious short- and long-term consequences, including re-intubations, ICU readmissions,
      prolonged ICU and hospital stay, persistent cognitive problems, and higher mortality rates.
      Considering the high incidence of delirium and its consequences, prevention of delirium is
      imperative. This study focuses on a program of standardized nursing and physical therapy
      interventions to prevent delirium in the ICU, called UNDERPIN-ICU (nUrsiNg DEliRium
      Preventive INterventions in the ICU).

      Objective: To determine the effect of the UNDERPIN-ICU program on the number of
      delirium-coma-free days in 28 days and several secondary outcomes, such as delirium
      incidence, the number of days of survival in 28 and 90 days and delirium-related outcomes.

      Design and Setting: A multicenter stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial.

      Methods: Eight to ten Dutch ICUs will implement the UNDERPIN-ICU program in a randomized
      order. Every two months the UNDERPIN-ICU program will be implemented in an additional ICU
      following a two months period of staff training. UNDERPIN-ICU consists of standardized
      protocols focusing on several modifiable risk factors for delirium, including cognitive
      impairment, sleep deprivation, immobility and visual and hearing impairment.

      Participants: ICU patients aged ≥ 18 years (surgical, medical, or trauma) and at high risk
      for delirium, E-PRE-DELIRIC ≥35%, will be included, unless delirium was detected prior ICU
      admission, expected length of ICU stay is less then one day or when delirium assessment is
      not possible.
