  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A non-fission sourced, solvent generator produced 99mTc intravenous injection, as 99mTc -MDP,
      is to be used as a bone scan diagnostic radiopharmaceutical for assessment of bone pathology
      using the same oncologic indications as nuclear reactor sourced 99mTc, as 99mTc-MDP.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will be a comparison of diagnostic and imaging equivalency of 99mTc
      Pertechnetate intravenous injection (labeled with commercial MDP kits) produced by a
      non-fission sourced/solvent generator and a nuclear reactor/column sourced generator. Each
      oncologic participant acts as their own control to reduce error variance.

      Condition Intervention Phase Oncologic indication for which a bone scan would normally be
      indicated. Participant having recently had a bone scan using Technetium (99mTc) Medronate
      Injection USP labeled with 99mTc derived from fission-sourced 99Mo. Drug: Technetium (99mTc)
      Medronate Injection USP labeled with 99mTc derived from neutron-activation-produced 99Mo.

    <limitations_and_caveats>Early termination. Despite a relatively comprehensive review of the first four subject's bone imaging scans a cause of an observed altered biodistribution is not apparent. As such study recruitment will be terminated.</limitations_and_caveats>
