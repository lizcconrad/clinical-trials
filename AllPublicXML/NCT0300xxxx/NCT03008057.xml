    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effects of vitamin D or placebo for 3 months on the
      gene expression of glyoxalase enzyme, RAGE, and YKL40 in the peripheral blood mononuclear
      cell (PBMC) and serum levels of YKL40,AGEs, TNF-α, PAI-1, IL-6, and HbA1c of diabetes type 2
      patients.

      The aim of this study is to determine the effects of vitamin D or placebo for 3 months on the
      gene expression of plasma human cartilage glycoprotein 39(YKL40), receptor for advanced
      glycation end products (RAGE) and glyoxalase enzyme in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell
      (PBMC) and serum levels of YKL40 ,plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), TNF-α, advanced
      glycation end products (AGEs ), IL-6, and HbA1c of diabetes type 2 patients.

      In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial, placebo-controlled study, 84 women and men
      with type 2 diabetes are enrolled from the Iranian Center of diabetes. At the start of study,
      all participants will sign informed consent and complete a general information form. 24-hour
      food record for 3 days will be taken from the patients at the beginning and the end of the
      study. Selected samples by using stratified randomization method based on sex, gender and
      body mass index (BMI) are classified into 2 groups: 1) receiving vitamin D supplement 2)
      receiving vitamin D placebo bo.

      The vitamin D supplement group will receive 4000 IU (100 microgram) daily for 3 months. The
      vitamin D placebo group will also receive placebo containing starch both similar in terms of
      color, shape and size. participants are advised to maintain their diet, level of physical
      activity and medication dose during the study. Blood samples will be collected after
      anthropometric parameter measuring then target biochemical parameters, gene expression and
      serum levels and physical activity will be measured before and after the trial.
