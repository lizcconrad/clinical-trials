      Comparison of treatment efficacy and safety of pretreatment with ablative fractional laser
      versus microdermabrasion combined with large-area photodynamic therapy with methyl
      aminolevulinate for actinic keratoses
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For each study participant, two test areas (A and B) are demarcated in the same anatomical
      region, with each area containing no less than 5 actinic keratoses (AKs). Test areas are
      randomized to receive skin pretreatment of EITHER ablative fractional laser OR
      microdermabrasion prior to photodynamic therapy using methyl aminolevulinate.

      Efficacy, local skin reactions and safety of both test areas are evaluated over a 12-15 week
      follow up period.

    <description>Ablative Fractional Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Laser treatment is randomly allocated to one of two tests areas in each study participant. Laser treatment consists of targeted ablation of actinic keratoses and field laser treatment of the entire test area. After laser treatment, application of methyl aminolevulinate (MAL), a topical photosensitising agent, is performed. The test area thereafter undergoes 2 hours of daylight photodynamic therapy.</description>

    <description>Microdermabrasion (processing of the skin with a sandpaper-like material) is randomly allocated to one of two tests areas in each study participant. Microdermabrasion treatment consists of targeted treatment of actinic keratoses and field treatment of the entire test area. Afterwards, application of methyl aminolevulinate (MAL), a topical photosensitising agent, is performed. The test area then undergoes 2 hours of daylight photodynamic therapy.</description>
