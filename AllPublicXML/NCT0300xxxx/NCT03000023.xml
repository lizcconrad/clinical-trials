  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is both qualitative and quantitative, gathering patient's perceptions of HCV
      treatment benefits before and after HCV treatment by administering surveys and conducting
      in-depth qualitative patient interviews. The study seeks to understand all anticipated and
      actual benefits patients perceive before and after viral eradication.

      This study employs a mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative) pre-post study design
      utilizing in-depth qualitative interviews and patient reported outcome surveys. Pre-treatment
      surveys and interviews will be conducted before HCV therapy commences to understand all
      potential psychological, social, physical and medical consequences perceived to be related to
      HCV and the patients' anticipation (hope for) of improvements in these factors after viral
      eradication. Post-treatment surveys and interviews will occur 4 to 8 months after treatment
      ends to examine long-term treatment benefits, i.e., changes in HCV-related factors, such as
      symptoms, functioning, and health status.
