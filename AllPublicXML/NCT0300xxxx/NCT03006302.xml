  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll patients who have metastatic pancreatic cancer and have progressed on
      prior chemotherapy.

      Half of participants will receive epacadostat/pembrolizumab/cyclophosphamide(CY)/GVAX
      pancreas vaccine followed by epacadostat/pembrolizumab/CRS-207 (Arm A), while the other half
      will receive epacadostat/pembrolizumab/CRS-207 (Arm B).

      The primary objectives of this study are to determine the recommended dose of epacadostat in
      this combination and assess survival of subjects in both treatment groups.
