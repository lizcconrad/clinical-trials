      The aim of this phase II trial is to assess the DCR, local control, non-progress survival,
      overall survival, safety and tolerability of SBRT to treat patients with oligometastases in
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who have received initial
             treatment for the primary site including surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. Primary
             tumor site without progression at registration. The sites of allowed metastases are:
             peripheral lung, central lung, medistinal/cervical lymph node, liver,
             spinal/paraspinal, osseous, and abdominal-pelvic lymph node. All metastases not
             resected must be amenable to SBRT.

          2. 1-4 radiographically distinct metastases of any distribution in 2 or less allowed
             anatomical sites. The diameters of lesions should be less than or equal to 5cm.

          3. Initial treatment should be completed at least 6 months prior to study registration.

          4. All the metastases treated with SBRT should not be treated with surgery, radiation,
             radio frequency ablation or other regional therapeutic modalities prior to study
             registration. The other (s) lesions should have been surgically removed.

          5. Age ≥ 18 and ≤ 75. PS ECOG 0-2，wight loss&lt;30% during the latest 6 months.

          6. Evaluation by a radiation oncologist that the patient could tolerate the treatment of
             SBRT.

          7. Patient must provide study specific informed consent prior to study entry.

          8. For females of child-bearing potential, negative serum/urine pregnancy test within 14
             days prior to study registration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Progression of primary tumor site at time of registration.

          2. Metastases with indistinct borders making targeting not feasible.

          3. Known brain metastases.

          4. Prior palliative radiotherapy to metastases.

          5. Metastases located within 3 cm of the previously irradiated structures:

             a).Spinal cord previously irradiated &gt;80Gy(Biological equivalent dose with α/β=2),
             b).Brachial plexus previously irradiated to &gt; 100Gy(Biological equivalent dose with
             α/β=2), c).Small intestine, large intestine, or stomach previously irradiated to &gt;
             90Gy (Biological equivalent dose with α/β=2), d).Whole lung previously irradiated with
             prior V20Gy &gt; 30% (delivered in ≤ 3 Gy/fraction), e).Primary tumor irradiated with
             SBRT, f).Metastasis irradiated with SBRT.

          6. Pregnant or breast-feeding women or people during the birth-period who refused to take
             contraceptives.

          7. Drug addiction,Alcoholism or AIDS.

          8. Patients with severe heart diseases, cerebral vascular diseases, hepatic diseases,
             renal diseases or Acute bacterial or fungal infection who are considered not suitable
             to enroll the study at the time of registration.
