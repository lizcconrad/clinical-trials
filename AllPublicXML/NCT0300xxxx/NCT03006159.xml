    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple dose escalation study to investigate the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of SHR0534. The study will be
      conducted with dose of 5 mg, 10mg and 25 mg. Chinese Type 2 Diabetic patients will be
      randomized in each cohort to receive the study drug or placebo.
