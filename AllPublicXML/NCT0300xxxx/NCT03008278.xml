    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of olaparib when given
      together with ramucirumab and how well they work in treating patients with gastric or
      gastroesophageal junction cancer that has spread to other places in the body, has come back,
      or cannot be removed by surgery. Olaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ramucirumab, may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving olaparib and ramucirumab
      may work better in treating patients with gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safe dose of olaparib with ramucirumab, but not to exceed olaparib dose
      of 300 mg twice daily (tablet formulation). (Phase I) II. To determine the efficacy of
      olaparib plus ramucirumab as measured by the objective response rates (ORR) stratified by
      BROCA-HR biomarker status. (Phase II).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate median progression-free survival (PFS) stratified by BROCA-HR biomarker
      status.

      II. To estimate median overall survival (OS) stratified by BROCA-HR biomarker status.

      III. To measure the prevalence of the BROCA-HR biomarker in our study population.

      IV. To determine toxicity of olaparib and ramucirumab combination.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the correlation between the signature 3 status, and mutations in BROCA-HR panel.

      II. To evaluate the association between findings from BROCA-HR panel with response to
      therapy.

      III. To evaluate the association between findings from BROCA-HR panel and signature 3 results
      with response to therapy.

      IV. To determine results of immunoassay for poly-ADP-ribosylated (PAR) substrates in tumor
      tissue.

      V. To create a PDX model to study deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair in gastric tumors
      treated with PARP inhibitors (PARPi) from both pre-treatment biopsy and repeat biopsy after
      16 weeks of treatment.

      VI. Development of a novel genomic assay for BRCAness VII. Defining T cell receptor diversity
      of gastric cancer patients +/- BRCAness VIII. Biobank additional tumor tissue for future
      genomic analysis. IX. Biobank peripheral blood for future genomic analysis and assessment of
      circulating tumor DNA.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of olaparib followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and ramucirumab
      intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 3-6
      weeks thereafter.
