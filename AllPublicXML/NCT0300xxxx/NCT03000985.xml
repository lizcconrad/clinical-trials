    <textblock>
      The involvement of family members is crucial and improves the prognosis of psychiatric
      patients and reinforces therapeutic adherence and reduces the frequency of relapses. For
      schizophrenia, the scientific literature clearly shows that it's in the interest of the
      patient to offer to his family a psychoeducational program.

      Therapeutic education programs are now part of the recommendations of good clinical practice
      and in the French health through the law n Â° 2009-879 of July 21, 2009 on the reform of the
      hospital and relating to patients, health and territories.

      Objectives We conducted a randomized study in two groups to evaluate the impact of a
      psychoeducational program for caregivers.

      Methods 60 patients with a DSM-V diagnosis of schizophrenia and their families' caregivers
      are recruited. Families' caregivers are randomly assigned to receive either a 6 session
      psychoeducation program, or no psychoeducation.

      Baseline evaluations:

      Patients: symptomatology (PANSS), medication adherence (MARS); Families' Caregivers: Quality
      of Life (S-CGQoL), Burden (Zarit), knowledge of disease (KAST), therapeutic alliance (4PAS
      caregivers), depression (CES-D), medication adherence (CRS).
