      Despite exercise training decrease blood pressure in 'average' terms, there is a wide
      interindividual variability after exercise training, being yet unknown what mode of exercise
      (e.g. endurance, strength, concurrent, or high intensity interval training) produce more/less
      non-responder (NR) prevalence (i.e., percentage of subjects who experienced a
      non-change/worsened response after training in some outcome).

    <description>Pre-hypertensive group was compared with healthy groups in the 2 manin variables systolic/diastolic blood pressure, as well as in other co-variables in pre-post changes. Thus, after the training intervention, and following the R and NR classification, we will compare the NR prevalence between both Pre-hypertensive and Healthy group.</description>
