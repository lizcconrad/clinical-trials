    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect information about what happens when people pause, or
      temporarily stop taking, ART, and to collect blood samples from these people at frequent
      intervals. We will also study the safety of pausing ART under close observation.

        Step 1 Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

        NOTE: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a US FDA-approved kit, which is required for all IND
        studies, or for sites located in countries other than the United States, a kit that has
        been certified or licensed by an oversight body within that country and validated
        internally.

          -  For Cohort A participants, ART initiated during chronic infection (e.g., more than 6
             months after estimated date of infection, or as determined by site investigator and/or
             available medical records).

          -  For Cohort B, diagnosis of acute HIV infection (AHI) (as defined by the criteria
             listed below) and initiation of ART within 45 days after AHI diagnosis (defined as

                  indeterminate Western blot.

        NOTE: Candidates who were diagnosed with AHI based on this criterion (&quot;c&quot; above) must have

             24 months prior to the screening HIV-1 RNA and one documented HIV-1 RNA that is below
             the limit of detection of the FDA-approved assays (limit of detection: 75, 50, 40, or
             20 copies/mL) collected fewer than 12 months prior to the screening HIV-1 RNA.

        NOTE: A single unconfirmed &quot;blip&quot; (i.e., plasma HIV-1 RNA over limit of detection but &lt;200
        copies/mL) is allowed if preceded and followed by values below the limit of detection and
        if the blip occurred more than 6 months prior to study entry.

          -  Prior history of difficulty establishing venous access or current contraindication for
             leukapheresis, in the opinion of the site investigator and based on assessments.

          -  Receipt of any vaccination within 1 week prior to entry.
