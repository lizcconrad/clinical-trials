      The aim of this study is to compare the influence of two different energy densities for
      photobiomodulation on recovery of palatal donor area after free gingival graft technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, parallel and controlled clinical trial. The population evaluated in
      the study was selected at Science and Technology Institute (STI) -São José dos Campos,
      College of Dentistry.

      Patients were assigned to one of the three treatment groups:

        -  Group 1: ridge preservation surgery through free gingival graft and photobiomodulation
           (PBM) application through a gallium aluminum arsenide laser (GaAlAs) in the donor area
           using a 60 Joule/cm² dose

        -  Group 2: ridge of preservation surgery through free gingival graft and PBM through a
           gallium aluminum arsenide laser (GaAlAs) in the donor area using a 15 Joule/cm² dose

        -  Group 3: ridge preservation surgery through free gingival graft and PBM Sham.

      All surgeries were performed by the same expert periodontist (MPS). A blade 15c
      (Swann-Morton® - Sheffield, England) mounted on No. 3 scalpel handle will make an
      intrasulcular incision around the tooth indicated for exodontia. Then, the tooth will be
      extracted through the use of appropriate instruments in order to obtain a minimally traumatic
      exodontia.

      After the exodontia, curettage and irrigation of the dental socket will be performed. After
      that, the socket will be filled with xenogenous bone graft (GenOx Inorg; Campinas, SP), and
      sealed with a free gingival graft removed from the palate. For the free gingival graft
      removal, a circular template of 5 millimeters in diameter will be used. This mold has the
      objective of standardizing the palatal graft removal ensuring the wounds will have always the
      same size. After the circular incision, the graft will be removed with a thickness of 2
      millimeters. After free gingival graft removal from palate, it will be adjusted to the
      entrance of the socket and sutured with Vicryl® 5.0 reabsorbable (Ethicon Johnsons do Brasil,
      São José dos Campos - SP).

      The evaluated parameters were wound remaining area (WRA), scar and tissue colorimetry (TC),
      tissue thickness (TT) and postoperative discomfort (D), evaluated at baseline and 7, 14, 45,
      60, and 90 days after surgery.

      Statistical Analysis: All data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation or expressed in
      percentages during the descriptive phase. Data were analyzed according to distribution by the
      Shapiro-Wilk test. For the remaining wound area, tissue colorimetry, tissue thickness, and
      postoperative discomfort parameter analysis, two way repeated measures ANOVA was performed
      for intra- and intergroup analysis. T test was used for intergroup comparison of the number
      of analgesics taken. The presence or absence of scars was measured by Q-square test.
      Statistical analysis was performed using Sigma Plot 12.0. In all tests a significance level
      of 0.05 was chosen.

    <description>The defect area was measured after 90 post-operative days. For this, standardized photographs were taken (in terms of brightness, distance, and angle). A scale was used as a reference to measure the area. These photographs were exported to image software (Image J—NIH, Bethesda, USA), and the wound area was measured in square millimeters (mm²)</description>

    <measure>Tissue colorimetric evaluation analyzed through photographs</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tissue color similarity between the region adjacent to the operated area and the post-operative image were analyzed through photographs. The photographs were exported to image software (Adobe Photoshop 3, München, Germany), and two areas were used: one from the wound and another adjacent area. The areas were measured through the Adobe Photoshop red-green chroma scale and the yellow-blue chroma scale and the results were presented in Bit/Pixels for both scales.</description>

    <description>The scar area was measured after 90 post-operative days. For this, standardized photographs were taken (in terms of brightness, distance, and angle). A scale was used as a reference to measure the keloid area.

    <description>The areas were compared using brightness parameters. The photographs were exported to image software (Adobe Photoshop 3, München, Germany), and two areas were used: one from the wound and another adjacent area. The areas were measured through the Adobe Photoshop, and the results were expressed in a scale from 0 (black) to 255 (white) units of brightness.</description>

    <description>The patients allocated to the control group will receive sham irradiation. For this, black rubber protection will be placed at the tip of the laser device, which do not allow the light to reach the tissue. The applications will be performed by a different operator from the one who will measure the study parameters. During irradiation, the tip of the laser probe will be placed perpendicularly with slight contact on the area. Laser therapy will be initiated in the immediate postoperative period (just after sutures) and will be repeated by four more applications performed every other day, with a total of 5 laser applications.</description>

    <description>The irradiation will be performed with a GaAlAs diode laser that continuously emits a wavelength of 660 nm with a power of 30 milliwatts (mW). The patients allocated for the group 60 will receive the following protocol for laser application: Five (5) points of irradiation will be performed using a total energy density (fluence) of 60 Joules/cm2 and a time of 56 seconds per point (1,68 Joules/cm2 per point). During irradiation, the tip of the laser probe will be placed perpendicularly with slight contact on the area. Laser therapy will be initiated in the immediate postoperative period (just after sutures) and will repeated by four more applications performed every other day, with a total of 5 laser applications.
