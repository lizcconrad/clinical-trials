  <brief_summary>

      frequency and intensity of hot flashes and night sweats in men undergoing chemotherapy

      The Cooling Vest is a vest manufactured by Nanohealth, Inc. It is a cool therapy device
      intended to provide moderate, controlled cooling (approximately 15C/59F) by absorbing heat.
      The material in the vest is safe, non-toxic, and eco-friendly.

      This study attempts to collect data on the effects of the Cooling Vest in men with hot
      flashes and night sweats due to the side effects of chemotherapy. Participants will use the
      vest for 4 weeks and questionnaires will be used to determine effect.
