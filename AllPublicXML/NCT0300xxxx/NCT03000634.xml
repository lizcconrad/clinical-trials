    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effectiveness and safety of maintenance therapy with continuous
      bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRD) compared to maintenance therapy that
      alternates VRD with Elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (Elo RD) every eight weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Past studies conducted at the Myeloma Institute have shown that many patients with low-risk
      disease (as determined by gene array studies - studies that look at specific genes using
      special equipment) respond very well to treatment. However, about 15% of low-risk patients
      still relapse during the first three years of treatment, which means that better treatments
      are still needed.

      This study will compare the effectiveness and safety of maintenance therapy with continuous
      bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRD) compared to maintenance therapy that
      alternates VRD with Elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (Elo RD) every eight weeks.

      Elotuzumab, bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone are all approved by the FDA for the
      treatment of patients with multiple myeloma. VRD is the standard maintenance regimen
      prescribed at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Myeloma Institute for
      patients with low risk disease. The investigators want to learn if alternating VRD with Elo
      RD during maintenance therapy will result in better outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age and not older than 75 years of age at the
             time of enrollment.

             diagnosed multiple myeloma consisting of induction chemotherapy and stem cell
             transplant within 4 months of study enrollment. The completed regimen may have also
             included post-transplant consolidation therapy, but post-transplant consolidation is
             not required. The regimen must have included, at minimum, a proteasome inhibitor, an
             immunomodulatory agent, and a corticosteroid.

          -  Patients must have low-risk disease, defined as an existing myeloma prognostic risk
             score risk score &lt; 50.4 from a prior bone marrow biopsy sample in which plasma cells
             were present.

          -  Patients must have high risk cytogenetic abnormalities, defined as one or more of the
             following chromosomal aberrations detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization: 17p-,

          -  Patients must have absolute neutrophil count(ANC) ≥ 1,000/mm3 and a platelet count of
             ≥ 100,000/µL, unless lower levels are due to extensive bone marrow plasmacytosis.

          -  Patients must have a baseline serum creatinine level of &lt; 3 mg/dL and baseline alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 3x Upper limit of normal (ULN)

             Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.

          -  Female patients must be:

               -  Postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR

               -  Surgically sterile, OR

               -  If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 simultaneous effective
                  methods of contraception, from the time of signing the informed consent form
                  through 90 days after the last dose of study drug, OR

               -  Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and
                  usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods
                  of contraception.)

          -  Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (ie, post-vasectomy) must agree to one of
             the following:

               -  Practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period
                  and through 90 days after the last dose of study drug, OR

               -  Practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual
                  lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation,

          -  History of poorly controlled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, active or uncontrolled
             hepatitis, or other serious medical or psychiatric illness that could potentially
             interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol, or that in the
             opinion of the investigator would constitute a hazard for participating in this study.
