  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      to evaluate the effect of a single intraligamentary injection of piroxicam on postoperative
      pain associated with endodontic procedures.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pain after endodontic treatment is commonly severe in the first 24 hours after treatment,
      then it will reduce gradually until commonly disappearing after 7-10 days in most cases.
      Since piroxicam has a half-life of 50 hours in the plasma, it will be effective in
      controlling the most intense pain which occurs after endodontic treatment It appears that
      optimal clinical benefits can be achieved by administering drugs such as local anesthetics
      and NSAIDs before the onset of postoperative pain. Administering these drugs before a
      surgical or an endodontic procedure may be of benefit for longer procedures or for minimizing
      peripheral sensitization, which is a result of the cascade of inflammatory mediators that are
      released by tissue injury and fuel the subsequent inflammatory process

    <measure>The degree of postoperative pain at 6, 12, 24 and 48 postoperative hours which will be measured by Numeric Rate Scale , where the patient will be asked to rate the progress of pain on the NRS and inform the investigator with the results.</measure>

    <description>Primary outcome will be collected by the operator through Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)20 which is an 11-point scale consisting of numbers from 0 through 10; 0 reading represents &quot;no pain&quot; , 1- 3 readings represent &quot;mild pain&quot; , 4- 6 readings represent &quot;moderate pain&quot; , 7- 10 readings represent &quot;severe pain&quot; No or mild pain will be considered as success while moderate or severe pain will be regarded as failure.</description>
