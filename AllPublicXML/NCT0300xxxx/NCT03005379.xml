      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Fecal Microbiota Therapy (FMT) is effective
      vs. placebo in the prevention of C. difficile infection recurrence.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is one of the most common nosocomial infections and is
      increasingly seen in non-hospitalized patients. Although more than 90% of patients have
      symptom resolution with a course of standard antimicrobial therapy, subsequent recurrence
      rates range from 15-30% (after the first CDI episode) to 40-50% (after the second and
      subsequent episodes). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has shown promise as an adjunct
      to standard antimicrobial therapy, reducing recurrence among FMT recipients to 15%.

      The primary study goal is to assess the efficacy of FMT for the prevention of subsequent
      recurrent CDI, when administered after successful treatment of recurrent CDI with standard
      antimicrobial therapy. Secondary goals are to evaluate, the efficacy of FMT in terms of CDI
      severity, duration, the safety of FMT, and in the event of a positive study result, establish
      a mechanism for providing FMT within the VA system.

      This study will enroll 390 participants. Participants will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to FMT
      or placebo, stratified by number of prior recurrent CDI episodes (1 versus &gt;1). They will be
      assessed for symptoms of CDI, other study outcomes and any treatment-related adverse events
      at 2, 14, 28, 42, and 56 days, and month 3, 4, 5 and 6 after administration of the study
      treatment.

      The primary outcome is recurrent CDI (definite or probable) or death within 56 days of
      randomization. Definite recurrence is defined as: new onset of more than 3 loose or watery
      stools in 24 hours for 2 consecutive days with laboratory confirmation of C. difficile from a
      stool specimen; or ileus, toxic megacolon or colectomy with laboratory confirmation. Probable
      recurrence is defined identically as above but WITHOUT laboratory confirmation of C.
      difficile (not tested or negative test).

    <description>Safety outcomes to be collected include:
Serious adverse events, with a focus on SAEs involving hospitalization (new or prolonged), and all-cause mortality
Adverse events which may be related to FMT treatment. This includes adverse events which Site Investigators consider related/possibly related to the study treatment and all adverse events which occur within 14 days of study treatment (since an aggregate analysis of events temporally linked to treatment could show a causal relationship when compared to placebo)
Infectious transmissions which are plausibly linked to FMT treatment.
Development of new conditions theoretically linked to alterations in gut microbiota.</description>
