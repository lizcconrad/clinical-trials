  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radium-223 is indicated for the treatment of patients with mCRPC with symptomatic bone
      metastases and no known visceral metastatic disease. However, very few data have been
      reported in patients with mCRPC who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Recently, results
      from an International Expanded Access Program have also suggested a benefit of radium-223 in
      asymptomatic patients with mCRPC. In addition, the mechanism of action of radium-223 should
      not be correlated with the presence/absence of the AR-V7 mutation, although this issue has
      not yet been evaluated.

      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of radium-223 in asymptomatic patients with
      mCRPC, and to establish the association between AR-V7 status and radium-223 activity.

      Primary objective:

      To assess the efficacy of radium-223 in asymptomatic patients with mCRPC who have progressed
      while on abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide treatment.

      Primary endpoint:

      To determine the efficacy of radium-223 in terms of radiological rPFS.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Safety profile.

        -  To determine the association between AR-V7 status (positive vs. negative) and PFS.

        -  To establish the relationship between CTCs number with radium-223 efficacy.

      Secondary endpoints:

      Safety AEs will be evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
      of the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) version 4.0 [20]. Grade 3 or 4 AEs and serious
      adverse events (SAEs) will be assessed to determine the safety and tolerability of the
      various combinations of drugs.

      Efficacy

        -  Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) depending on AR-V7 status.

        -  Overall survival (OS).

        -  Time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE).

        -  Time to PSA progression according to the ALSYMPCA study criteria.

        -  Determination percentage of PSA progression.

        -  Alkaline phosphatase level response (AF), normalization of alkaline phosphatase level,
           according to the ALSYMPCA study criteria.

      Molecular aspects

        -  Assessment of AR-V7 mutation evolution during the study treatment.

        -  Determination changes in CTCs number during the study treatment.
