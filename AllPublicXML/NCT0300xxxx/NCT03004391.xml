  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2015 the Danish Health authorities initiated major changes in the national follow-up (FU)
      program for ovarian cancer patients. The new FU program argues that there is no effect of
      routine monitoring of tumour marker CA125. Now every patient needs to choose if they wish
      routine measurement of CA 125 to be part of the follow-up program.

      Shared Decision Making (SDM) can help health professionals develop a more individualized care
      plan in collaboration with the patient, as stated in the revised national FU program. Due to
      the complexity and challenges within ovarian cancer care, this is an evident area of focus.

      SDM is defined as an approach in which the clinician and patient go through all phases of the
      decision-making process together and share the preference for treatment and reach an
      agreement on treatment choice. Clinicians have information about disease, tests and
      treatments, whereas patients hold information about their life circumstances, goals of life,
      and preferences for healthcare. SDM thereby offers a way of individualizing recommendations,
      according to patients' special needs and preferences. SDM has potential to give the patients
      a higher quality of healthcare by putting the patient in the center of care.

      Decision aids (DA) are tools that can provide information and systematically describe the
      advantages and disadvantages of a specific intervention or monitoring, which can help
      patients become involved in decision making. Using evidence-based DA leads to improvement in
      knowledge, better understanding of screening, prevention and treatment options, and more
      accurate perception of risks for the patients.

      All participants fill in a demographic and Decisional Conflict Scale questionnaire at
      baseline. After having been presented with the decision aid and made a choice as to CA125,
      the participants will complete the CollaboRATE and Decisional Conflict Scale questionnaire
      dealing with confidence as to the choice made and the level of shared decision making
      experienced. Six months later the Decision Regret Scale questionnaire is to be completed to
      reveal any regrets in relation to the CA125 decision.

      For a preliminary investigation of the applicability of the DA, 15-20 patients not eligible
      for this study will be asked for their opinion.
