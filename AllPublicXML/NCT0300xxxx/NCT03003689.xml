  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental bacterial plaque is the most frequent modifiable finding in patients with periodontal
      (gum) diseases. Many studies have provided evidence that mechanical removal of dental plaque
      is critical for improving the periodontal health. The standard initial treatment of
      periodontitis (gum disease) is to remove plaque and calculus form the teeth and root
      structures using sclaing and root planing (SRP). Typically hand instruments and an ultrasonic
      scaler are used for SRP

      While this method removes some of the bacteria that leads to periodontitis, microorganisms
      are not completely eliminated through SRP. Studies have shown that after 3 months, the
      bacteria initially present prior to scaling and root planing had recolonized. In order to
      prevent recurrence of periodontitis, it is recommended that oral bacteria be kept at low
      levels.

      When used at the proper wave length, dental lasers have been shown to effectively removes
      calculus, without damaging surrounding tissue. The Er:YAG laser has been FDA-approved for the
      use of scaling and root planing in Dentistry. While studies on the Er:YAG laser have shown
      that it is effective in removing calculus and preserving the tooth root structure, there is
      no consensus of the level of calculus removal. The Er:YAG laser may also be more effective in
      removing microbial bacteria than SRP with hand instruments and ultrasonic scaler.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Er:YAG laser, as an adjunct
      to scaling and root planing, in removing microbial bacteria. Participants with chronic
      periodontitis will be randomized to have one quadrant undergo scaling and root planing using
      hand instruments and ultrasonic scaler alone, while a second quadrant will receive the same
      treatment, with the addition of the Er:YAG laser. Outcomes studies will be traditional
      periodontal clinical parameters at 6 weeks and 3 months after treatment. Microbial cultures
      will be performed at baseline and 3 months to compare survival and re-population by
      periodontal microorganisms.

      Primary Aim: The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Er:YAG laser as an
      adjunct to mechanical scaling and root planing periodontal therapy by comparing probing depth
      and clinical attachment levels.

      Secondary aim: The secondary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Er:YAG laser as
      an adjunct to mechanical scaling and root planing periodontal therapy by comparing gingival
      bleeding index and plaque index.

      Tertiary aim: The tertiary aim of this study is to compare the microbial outcomes of
      mechanical periodontal therapy alone vs. mechanical therapy combined followed with Er:YAG
      laser therapy at the same time.

    <description>Microbial load will be measured by the total number of cultivable bacteria measured by total viable colony forming units (CFUs) on non-selective and selective media. Percent cultivability of periodontal pathogens will be measured by number of pathogen specific CFUs in proportion to total cultivability.
Differences in microbial load will be investigated with the paired t-test. If the assumption of normality is unmet, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used instead.</description>
