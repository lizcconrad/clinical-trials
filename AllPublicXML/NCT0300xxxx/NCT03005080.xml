  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a 22 gene pharmacogenomics panel on 30 children with persistent
      Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) who have not responded to therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the clinical utility of pharmacogenomics testing in the clinical
      management of children with refractory GERD, despite adequate therapy and the role of
      pharmacogenomics in selecting the right acid suppressive therapy based on each patient's
      symptoms and pharmacogenomics results.
