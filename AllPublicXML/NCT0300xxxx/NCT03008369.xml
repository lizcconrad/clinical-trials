  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well lenvatinib works in treating patients with
      pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma that has spread to other places in the body or cannot be
      removed by surgery. Lenvatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the anti-tumor activity of lenvatinib (overall response rate; [ORR]) in
      patients with metastatic or advanced unresectable pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine progression-free survival (PFS). II. To determine overall survival (OS). III.
      To determine duration of tumor response. IV. To determine safety and tolerability of
      lenvatinib. V. To assess patient reported quality of life using EuroQol Five-Dimensional Five
      Level Scale Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General
      (FACT-G).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For patients with secretory tumors, to examine changes in plasma metanephrine levels and
      urinary catecholamine and/or metanephrine levels.

      II. For patients with secretory tumors, to examine whether lenvatinib-induced changes in
      plasma metanephrines and urinary catecholamine and/or metanephrine levels during the first
      cycle of treatment may be associated with objective tumor response.

      III. To examine associations between tumor response and somatic mutational status in archived
      tumors, or germline mutational status (presence of SDHD, SDHB, RET, VHL, neurofibromatosis
      type-1).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive lenvatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days for up to 5 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 or 6 months for up to 5
      years.
