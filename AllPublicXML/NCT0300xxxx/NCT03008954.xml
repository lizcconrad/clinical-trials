      The FLOW (First Loss Of Weight) study is designed to assess the effects of repeated
      administration of GSP3, an investigational product, on body weight. It is a multicenter,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study. FLOW is being
      conducted in 5 medical centers in Italy, Czech Republic, and Denmark, and will randomize 123
      overweight and obese adult males and females to receive either placebo, GSP3 (2.25g), or GSP3
      (3.75g) in addition to a hypocaloric diet (-600 kcal/day) for 12 weeks.
