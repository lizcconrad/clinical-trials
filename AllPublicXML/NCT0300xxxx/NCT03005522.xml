  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An individual's quality of life can be seriously affected by the severity of dental pain. The
      emergency department is a common place to find those seeking relief from their dental pain-
      often times seeking removal of the affected tooth, dental anesthetic injections or oral pain
      medications. There are a number of dental infections that cause this type of debilitating
      pain. One such dental infection is termed periapical abscess. This infection involves the
      tooth pulp. These infections can arise in three ways: introduction through a defect in the
      enamel and dentin; from a periodontal pocket or an adjacent tooth; or hematogenous seeding of
      the pulp from mechanical irritation. As this disease process continues there are a number of
      complications including chronic pain and, more seriously, the spread of infection into deep
      spaces which can be a life threatening condition.

      The Emergency Department treatment of this infection includes pain control, antibiotics and
      dental referral for ultimate management of the infection.

      The purpose of our study is to investigate whether the addition of oral steroids will alter
      the time until patient experiences improvement in their dental pain. Steroids are a commonly
      used anti-inflammatory that is used in the Emergency Departmentfor the purpose of pain relief
      from throat pain. As the pain from periapical infection is thought to be largely from the
      pressure we speculate that the anti-inflammatory effects of steroids may decrease the
      inflammation thus the pressure and may ultimately lead to a decrease in time until the
      patient experiences some relief from their pain.

    <description>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the addition of oral steroids will alter the time until patient experiences improvement in their dental pain from an acute dental periapical abscess. The patients will be randomized to receive either dexamethasone or placebo. The patients will be contacted over a period 72 hours to assess their level of pain resolution.</description>
