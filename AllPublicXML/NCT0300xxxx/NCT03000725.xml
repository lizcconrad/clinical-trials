      The purpose of this study is to adapt Project UPLIFT for Hispanic adults with epilepsy and
      depression. Project UPLIFT (Using Practice and Learning to Increase Favorable Thoughts) is a
      home-based intervention that teaches cognitive and mindfulness skills to people with epilepsy
      by phone to reduce their depression and improve quality of life (QOL); it was developed at
      Emory University with CDC funding. The purpose of this study is to adapt Project UPLIFT for
      Hispanic adults with epilepsy and depression. Project UPLIFT (Using Practice and Learning to
      Increase Favorable Thoughts) is a home-based intervention that teaches cognitive and
