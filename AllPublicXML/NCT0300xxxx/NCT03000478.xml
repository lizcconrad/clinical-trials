    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects a significant number of combat soldiers, with
      some studies suggesting 20% have PTSD. PTSD is related to a number of other detrimental
      effects, on the individual, such as mood disorders and alcohol abuse, on family members, and
      on society at large. Although effective treatments for PTSD exist, primarily types of
      cognitive behavior therapy, their uptake is very low. Studies have shown that a variety of
      factors act as barriers to care. These include not having the time for therapy, no therapy
      being locally available, and general stigma about therapy. In military populations, this
      stigma includes worries about the attitudes of unit members and commanding officers. As a
      result, many combat veterans do not seek therapy. Recently, it has been suggested that
      providing therapy in non-conventional settings might overcome some of these barriers. Studies
      over the last decade have shown that using Virtual Reality is a potential option. Virtual
      reality is a computer based environment that allows the therapist complete control over its
      multimedia components. VR is easily adaptable to exposure based treatments, where patients
      gradually come into contact with feared situations. VR for PTSD following combat, terror and
      motor vehicle accidents have all shown to be effective treatments. The studies so far are
      few, involve a small number of patients, and have often not adhered to gold standards of
      controlled trials. In addition, VR for combat in Israel has never been developed or tested.

      The current study is a randomized controlled trial, that will compare traditional
      face-to-face treatment with Virtual Reality, for combat related PTSD. Blind assessors will
      examine levels of PTSD and other disorders before treatment, immediately after treatment, and
      at 6 month follow up.
