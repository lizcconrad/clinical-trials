    <description>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is made up of 16 pairs of alternative descriptors of mood and attention at either end. The Bond-Lader of a 10 cm line. Participants will rate their feelings at the time of assessment by indicating the point on the line which best represent their mood. Each item is scored by measuring the position relative to the left hand end of the line and levels of anxiety, sedation, and dysphoria are then calculated from the combined scores of selected items. The score ranges from 0 to 100, with a high score reflecting a high level of anxiety, sedation or dysphoria.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male participants between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive

          -  Participants must have a body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 30.0 kilogram per
             square meter (kg/m^2), inclusive (BMI = weight/height square)

          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history,
             vital signs, and 12-lead ECG [incl. QTcF less than or equal to [&lt;=] 450 milliseconds
             (msec) for males] performed at screening and admission to the clinical unit. Minor
             abnormalities in electrocardiogram (ECG), which are not considered to be of clinical
             significance by the investigator, are acceptable. The presence of Left Bundle Branch
             Block (LBBB), AV Block (second degree or higher), or a permanent pacemaker or
             implantable cardioverter defibrillator [ICD] will lead to exclusion

          -  Participants must be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at
             screening. If the results of the serum chemistry panel, hematology, or urinalysis are
             outside the normal reference ranges, the Participant may be included only if the
             investigator judges the abnormalities to be not clinically significant. This
             determination must be recorded in the Participant's source documents and initialed by
             the investigator

          -  A man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and has not had a
             vasectomy must agree to use a barrier method of contraception e.g., either condom with
             spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository during the study and for a minimum of 1
             spermatogenesis cycle (defined as approximately 90 days) after receiving the last dose
             of study drug. All men must also not donate sperm during the study and for 3 months
             after receiving the last dose of study drug. In addition, their female partner should
             also use a highly effective method of contraception for at least the same duration.
             Examples of highly effective contraceptives include implantable progestogen-only
             hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation; intrauterine device
             (IUD); intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS); vasectomized partner; sexual
             abstinence (sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined
             as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk
             associated with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be
             evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual
             lifestyle of the participant.), combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing)
             hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral, intravaginal,
             and transdermal; progestogen-only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of
             ovulation: oral and injectable.

             rheumatologic, psychiatric, or metabolic disturbances, any inflammatory illness or any
             other illness, though minor deviations, which are not considered to be of clinical
             significance to both the investigator and to the Janssen Safety Responsible Physician,
             are acceptable

          -  Current or past history of any psychiatric disorder as classified according to
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) or DSM-V, with the
             exclusion of an anxiety disorder (i.e., panic disorder with or without agoraphobia,
             social anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder)

          -  Participant has any liver function test (including alanine aminotransferase [ALT],
             aspartate aminotransferase [AST], gamma-glutamyltransferase [gGT], alkaline
             phosphatase [ALP and bilirubin] at screening exceeding the upper limit of normal

          -  Participant has estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 milliliter per minute
             (mL/min)/1.73m^2 at screening (provided by the local laboratory)
