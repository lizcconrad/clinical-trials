  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participation in routine dental care is a significant challenge for children with autism
      spectrum disorder (ASD) due to a variety of factors, including considerations related to ASD
      symptoms and associated anxiety and behavioral challenges. Lack of routine, effective dental
      care has contributed to a substantial unmet healthcare need for children with ASD, who are at
      increased risk for excessive plaque, caries, and oral infections.

      The purpose of this study is to test a parent-training intervention designed to improve home
      dental hygiene, compliance with dental office visits, and oral health outcomes in children
      with autism spectrum disorder. Families of children ages 3 to 13 years with an existing
      diagnosis of ASD will be recruited for participation. All families will receive the Autism
      Intervention Research Network on Physical Health (AIR-P) Dental Toolkit, which is designed to
      provide parents with guidance and information about dental care and support strategies for
      children with ASD. Some families will also participate in a 10-week behavioral
      parent-training intervention focused on improving home dental care and dental office visit
      experiences.

      The study has three primary aims: 1) To improve children's functional and behavioral
      compliance with home dental hygiene, 2) To improve children's oral health, and 3) To reduce
      child anxiety and improve compliance with dental visits.
