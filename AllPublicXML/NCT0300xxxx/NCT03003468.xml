      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      The phase Ib dose escalation will evaluate the combination of pembrolizumab and Imprime PGG
      for subjects with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after progression on
      first-line systemic therapy. The phase II trial will test whether addition of Imprime PGG to
      pembrolizumab will increase median progression-free survival (PFS) in second line therapy
      setting in NSCLC.

      PHASE Ib DOSE ESCALATION INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:

      Cohort 1 will consist of 3-6 patients who will receive

        -  Imprime PGG 2 mg/kg IV on Days 1, 8, 15 for Cycles 1-4

        -  Imprime PGG 2 mb/kg IV on Day 1 for Cycles 5-16

        -  Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on Day 1 (cycle = 21 days)

      Cohort 2 will consist of 3-6 patients who will receive

        -  Imprime PGG 4 mg/kg IV on Days 1, 8, 15 for Cycles 1-4

        -  Imprime PGG 2 mb/kg IV on Day 1 for Cycles 5-16

        -  Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on Day 1 (cycle = 21 days)

      If none of the 3 subjects experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first cycle of
      therapy, an additional three subjects will be enrolled at dose level 2. If all subjects in
      dose level 2 complete the first cycle of therapy without DLT, 3 more subjects will be
      enrolled into dose level 2 to ensure only 0-1 of 6 subjects have a DLT. There will be no
      further escalation beyond dose level 2.

      PHASE II INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:

      Pembrolizumab will be given on Day 1 of each 21 day cycle after Imprime PGG, and the RP2D
      dose of Imprime PGG will be given on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21 day cycle. Treatment will
      continue up to 16 cycles, or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, subject
      refusal, or subject death either from progression of disease, the therapy itself, or from
      other causes.

      Life expectancy: of 6 months or greater

      The following baseline labs must be completed within 28 days prior to registration for
      protocol therapy:

      Hepatic:

        -  total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) OR direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for
           subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 x ULN (except subject with Gilbert's
           Syndrome, who can have total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dl)

        -  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 × ULN or ≤ 5 × ULN for subjects with known
           hepatic metastases

        -  alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN or ≤ 5 × ULN for subjects with known hepatic
           metastases

      Renal:

        -  Serum creatinine ≤ 3 mg/dL OR

        -  if serum creatinine &gt; 3mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 20 mL/min

      Hematopoietic:

        -  hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, subjects requiring transfusion will not be eligible to start study

        -  and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 10^9/L

        -  and platelet count ≥ 100 × 10^9/L

      Coagulation:

        -  INR &lt; 1.5 × ULN OR

        -  for subjects receiving anticoagulant, the subjects must, in the investigator's opinion,
           be clinically stable with no evidence of active bleeding while receiving anticoagulant
           therapy. The INR for subjects on warfarin should be in the therapeutic range. Low
           molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is allowed.

             Subjects with neurological symptoms must undergo a head CT scan or brain MRI to
             exclude brain metastasis. NOTE: Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may
             participate provided

          -  they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline),

          -  have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and

          -  are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to study registration. This exception
             does not include carcinomatous meningitis, which is excluded regardless of clinical

          -  Previously received a solid organ transplant or allogeneic progenitor/stem cell
             transplant.

             chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza
             vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however,
             intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are
             not allowed.

          -  History of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, or deep vein thrombosis unless on adequate
             anticoagulant therapy as determined by the treating investigator (subject must be on

             (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive
             drugs) or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome
             that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. NOTE: Replacement therapy
             (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for
             adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic
             treatment.

          -  Received prior chemotherapy, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study registration or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1
             or at baseline) from adverse events from previously administered agents. NOTE:
             Subjects with alopecia, grade ≤ 2 sensory neuropathy or other grade ≤ 2 AEs not
             constituting a safety risk based on investigator judgement are an exception to this
             criterion and can still be considered for the study.

          -  Any clinically significant infection defined as any acute viral, bacterial, or fungal
             infection that requires specific treatment. NOTE: Anti-infective treatment must be

             diabetes, 28 days prior to study registration) or unstable congestive heart failure
             (Stage III-IV of the New York Heart Association Functional Classification)

             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration, interfere with protocol compliance, or may
             interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the
             investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for enrollment in this study.

          -  Presence of any non-healing wound, fracture, or ulcer within 28 days prior to study
             registration.
