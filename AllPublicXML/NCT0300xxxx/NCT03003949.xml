  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women in the menopause transition ('perimenopause') are exposed to extreme hormone
      variability, tend to experience a unique set of severe stressors (e.g., divorce, death of
      loved ones), and are also at substantially elevated risk to suffer from mood and anxiety
      disorders. The purpose of this research is to understand the mechanisms by which variability
      in estradiol (E2) is associated with the symptoms of anxiety and anhedonia (loss of interest
      and pleasure - a common symptom of depression). By stabilizing E2 variability with a hormonal
      manipulation, this research will determine the degree to which the E2 variability (or E2
      levels) plays a causal role in perimenopausal anxiety and anhedonia symptoms and whether it
      does so by affecting biological responses to stress.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Framed within a diathesis-stress model, the primary objective of this research is to
      determine the pathophysiological mechanisms of estradiol (E2) in the clinical anxiety and
      anhedonia seen in the menopause transition (MT). Specifically whether E2 variability or E2
      levels predict exaggerated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity and impaired
      recovery to stress and, in turn, deficits in behavioral indices of threat responsivity and
      approach motivation and symptoms of anxiety and anhedonia. The secondary objective of the
      research is to use a hormonal manipulation as a mechanistic probe to stabilize E2 variability
      in premenopausal ranges and determine if: a) HPA axis reactivity/recovery represents a
      biomarker of behavioral and symptom responses to E2 stabilization; b) whether recent severe
      life stress predicts the HPA axis response to hormone stabilization.

      A total of 170 women in the early or late MT who are eligible for the hormonal probe will be
      recruited to reflect the full continuum of anxiety and anhedonia symptoms based on
      self-report to the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale,
      respectively. However, the investigators will over-represent the clinically impairing end of
      the anxious and anhedonic phenotype (75% of the sample). Over an 8-week baseline, anxiety and
      anhedonia symptoms and serum E2 measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
      (LC-MS/MS) will be assessed on a weekly basis. At baseline week 8, HPA axis (plasma cortisol
      and ACTH) response to the Trier Social Stress Test and behavioral measures of threat
      responsivity (via Dot-Probe task) and approach motivation (Effort Expenditure for Rewards
      Task 'EEfRT') will be determined. Using transdermal E2 as a pharmacological probe to
      stabilize variability of E2 in premenopausal ranges, women will then be randomized to
      transdermal E2 (0.10 mg) or placebo for 16 weeks. This is not a clinical efficacy trial. The
      investigators will use an randomized control trial (RCT) design with a hormonal manipulation
      in order to investigate the pathophysiologic role of E2 variability (or E2 levels) in HPA
      axis dysregulation and, in turn, threat responsivity and approach motivation. Serum E2 will
      be assessed weekly during weeks 9-16, and HPA axis reactivity to stress and behavioral
      responses to the Dot-Probe and EEfRT tasks will be assessed every four weeks during the 16
      week probe.

    <description>The State-Trait anxiety inventory is consists of 20 questions on a 4-point force-choice Like-type response scales (scores 0 - 3). The 20 questions are summed together for final score. The score can range from 0 to 60 with higher scores representing higher levels of anxiety. This questionnaire was used to evaluate the anxiety level from participants receiving E2 transdermal to placebo.</description>

    <ipd_description>The investigators will submit data to the Research Domain Criteria Database (RDoCdb) and/or the National Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Illness (NDCT). The investigators will work with RDoCdb and NDCT staff to define data structures for any data being collected as part of the study. Descriptive data will be submitted two times per year and provide supporting documentation as necessary for others to more fully understand the manner in which data were collected. The investigators will submit cumulative data each submission cycle and will review data for any personally identifiable information and ensure that data are loaded correctly. The investigators will share data within 4 months after submission and submit experimental data within 12 months after study completion. Study data for each publication will be created and submit a link to the RDoCdb study along with any publications so readers of articles can link back to the data used in RDoCdb and NDCT.</ipd_description>
