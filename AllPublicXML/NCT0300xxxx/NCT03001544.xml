  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1 study of the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
      of TS23 in healthy male volunteers.TS23 is a monoclonal antibody that inactivates alpha
      2-antiplasmin. Four dose cohorts of six subjects will be studied in a single ascending dose
      trial at one clinical center.
