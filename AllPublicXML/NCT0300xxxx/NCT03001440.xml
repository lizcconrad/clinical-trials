  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Branded bupropion hydrochloride products including ZYBAN and WELLBUTRIN range are approved
      for the treatment of smoking cessation and depressive disorders respectively. The Risk
      Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for ZYBAN was initially approved in 2010 and
      consists of a Medication Guide and a timetable for REMS assessments submission at 18 months,
      3 years and 7 years from the date of initial approval of REMS. The present study is a 7-year
      REMS assessment to evaluate subjects' understanding of the potential serious risk of
      neuropsychiatric adverse events associated with the use of ZYBAN, WELLBUTRIN, WELLBUTRIN SR,
      and WELLBUTRIN XL. The assessment will be a 20-minutes Knowledge, Attitudes and Behavior
      (KAB) survey and will be conducted among approximately 125 subjects currently using or who
      have filled a prescription for a branded bupropion product for smoking cessation within the 6
      months prior to survey administration. ZYBAN, WELLBUTRIN, WELLBUTRIN SR, and WELLBUTRIN XL
      are registered trade marks of the GSK group of companies.

    <description>The proportion of correct answers to survey questions concerning the risks associated with branded bupropion hydrochloride products will be summarized by use of formulation of ZYBAN or WELLBUTRIN. Smoking behavior, demographic information, information related to the receipt and reading of the Medication Guides and how the branded bupropion hydrochloride product is normally received will also be reported. Point estimates for the proportion with correct responses will be calculated for each question about the risks of branded bupropion products. In the case of multiple choice questions, the number and proportion of subjects reporting each response will also be provided.</description>
