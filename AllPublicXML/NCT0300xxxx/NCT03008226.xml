  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to investigate the efficacy of 9 mm intrabronchial
      valve treatment in patients with heterogeneous emphysema and to gain further insights and
      experience on the treatment with this valve size.

      This study is designed to evaluate performance of the 9 mm valve system in patients with at
      least one airway to be treated . Patients with severe airflow obstruction, severe emphysema,
      significant hyperinflation, and moderate to severe dyspnea are eligible to be evaluated for
      enrollment in this study. In this study, eligible patients will have severe emphysema in a
      target lobe with an intact fissure. Patients must be able to tolerate a flexible bronchoscopy
      procedure. After evaluation of all inclusion and exclusion criteria, with review of the CT
      data by the core laboratories, patients will be enrolled in the study. The indications for
      endoscopic reduction of pulmonary volume with intrabronchial valves are presented in various
      preliminary examinations. The duration of the study is about 7 months for each patient. It
      involves an examination before the valves are inserted, the valves are inserted within the
      scope of a bronchoscopy, followed by a follow-up examination directly after the valves are
      inserted, a follow-up period of at least 3 nights in the appropriate clinic and follow-up
      visits 14, 30 each , 90 and 180 days after the valves are inserted.

      The study is expected to enroll up to 30 patients who complete the 6 month follow-up visit at
      up to 4 sites with up to 15 patients per site.
