    <textblock>
      Hypothesis:

      Patients that were previously discharged from the emergency department with a subsequent
      non-diagnostic 30 day external patch monitor for suspected arrhythmia will benefit from early
      Reveal LINQ™ Insertable Cardiac Monitoring System placement.

      Primary Study Objectives:

      To evaluate the outcome of an intensive monitoring strategy (patients with a negative 30 day
      SEEQ™ Mobile Cardiac Telemetry (MCT) System result are purposed over for a Reveal LINQ™
      Insertable Cardiac Monitoring System) in patients with suspected but no previously documented
      arrhythmias that result in a clinically actionable event.

    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be enrolled after presentation to the Emergency Department of St.
      Elizabeth Healthcare with symptoms suggestive of cardiac arrhythmia and prior to leaving the
      emergency department. Patients will be exited from the study and considered complete at the
      identification of a cardiac arrhythmia as defined in the protocol (endpoint), or 12 months
      from enrollment date, whichever occurs first.

      Protocol defined endpoints

        1. Planned insertion of a permanent pacemaker, implantable cardiac defibrillator or chronic
           resynchronization device.

        2. Planned cardiac ablation procedure.

        3. Initiation of medical therapy for the purpose of treating dysrhythmia.

        4. Diagnosis of arrhythmia not requiring medical or invasive arrhythmia management.
