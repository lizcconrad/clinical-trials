  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized withdrawal study in which responders to open-label treatment with tofacitinib
      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to tofacitinib or placebo in a double-blind phase. In the
      double-blind phase &quot;time to sJIA flare&quot; will be evaluated as primary endpoint and subjects
      will be discontinued once they experience sJIA flare. Once 31 flares are reported the study
      will be completed.
