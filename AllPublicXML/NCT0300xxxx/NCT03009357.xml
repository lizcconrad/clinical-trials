    <textblock>
      The study is a single-center prospective cohort study of clinical application of continuously
      monitored data by wearable activity trackers in the patients with thyrotoxicosis. The purpose
      of the study is to evaluate the association between parameters of pulse rate, activity, and
      sleep from wearable activity trackers and the thyrotoxic status along with the treatment.
