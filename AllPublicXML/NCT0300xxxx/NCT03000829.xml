  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter randomized trial will employ in-situ cardiac arrest simulations (&quot;mock
      codes&quot;) to test whether using telemedicine technology to add an intensive care physician as
      the &quot;copilot&quot; for cardiac arrest resuscitation teams influences chest compression quality,
      resuscitation protocol adherence, team function, and provider experience.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Only 15-30% of patients who suffer in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) survive to hospital
      discharge. Factors associated with lower mortality and improved function include provision of
      high-quality, minimally-interrupted chest compressions and swift defibrillation of eligible
      arrhythmias. Unfortunately, resuscitation teams provide suboptimal care to 25-40% of IHCA
      victims. A dedicated IHCA team &quot;copilot&quot; may improve resuscitation team performance by
      providing the team leader with parallel analysis, situational awareness augmentation, action
      checking, protocol verification, and error correction. Critical care physician involvement
      via a telemedicine link could allow experienced specialists to fill the &quot;copilot&quot; role in a
      cost and resource-efficient manner, particularly in smaller hospitals with fewer available
      physicians.

      The current study will evaluate how consultation by an off-site intensive care physician via
      a telemedicine link influences local IHCA teams' quality of care, team function and provider
      experience during simulated cardiac arrest events (&quot;mock codes&quot;).
