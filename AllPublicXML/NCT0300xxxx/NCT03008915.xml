      The aim of this study is to test whether aspirin improves endothelial function in alpha-1
      antitrypsin deficiency-associated lung disease, measured by pulmonary microvascular blood
      flow on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and with apoptotic endothelial microparticles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emphysema is a common type of lung disease in patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
      (AATD). Emphysema refers to destruction of the fine network of air spaces and blood vessels
      in the lung, and results in what looks like &quot;holes&quot; in the lung. Emphysema is associated with
      an increased risk of death but currently no medications, except for replacement of alpha-1
      antitrypsin (AAT), have been shown to treat emphysema.

      The study plans to enroll subjects with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated lung
      disease (PiZZ phenotype) to perform a cross-over randomized controlled trial (RCT) of aspirin
      compared to placebo to test the hypotheses that aspirin is effective in improving blood flow
      in the lungs and reducing damage to the endothelial cells. Subjects will be randomized to
      receive aspirin or placebo for 2 weeks. There will be a 2-week washout period, then the
      participant will be crossed over to receive the other treatment (those who received aspirin
      first will receive the placebo and those who received the placebo first will receive
      aspirin).

      Participants who are on alpha-1 replacement therapy who have had fewer than 2 exacerbations
      in the last year will be asked whether they are interested in a withdrawal study. For this
      second part of the study, eligible and willing participants will be asked to stop their
      alpha-1 replacement therapy for 5 weeks and come in for a 4th study visit. This will allow
      AAT levels to drop briefly to those seen in the absence of AAT augmentation.

    <description>Endothelial apoptosis may contribute to the development of emphysema. Endothelial microparticles (EMPs) are vesicles shed from endothelial plasma membranes into the circulation in response to endothelial cell perturbation. EMPs expressing CD31 are phenotypic for endothelial cell apoptosis. Paired t-tests will be used to test whether CD31+ EMPs are lower on aspirin compared to placebo.</description>
