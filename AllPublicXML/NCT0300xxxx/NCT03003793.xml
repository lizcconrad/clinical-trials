  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of atopic dermatitis and type 2 diabetes, respectively, has increased over many
      years. Novel research shows an association between the two conditions. While this
      relationship at least in theory can be explained by lifestyle factors, there is reason to
      believe that other pathophysiological mechanisms are involved. Hence, our hypothesis is that
      patients with atopic dermatitis are insulin resistant due to their chronic inflammatory
      state. Insulin resistance might play an unknown part in the increased frequency of type 2
      diabetes among patients with atopic dermatitis. In the present project, the investigators aim
      to measure insulin sensitivity by means of the 'golden standard' hyperinsulinaemic
      euglycaemic clamp in patients suffering from atopic dermatitis compared to a healthy control
      group (matched case-control study). The project is a close collaboration between The
      Department of Dermatology and Allergy and Center for Diabetes Research at Gentofte Hospital.
