      This study evaluates the safety and clinical benefits of a therapeutics approach of
      conditioning regimen Cyclophosphamide (Cy) + Thymoglobulin r (ATG) + Granulocyte
      Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) followed by autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell
      Transplantaion (HSCT) rescue in therapy refractory Crohn's disease. It will be counted
      adverse events, clinical and endoscopic condition at various short and long-term time points.

    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, refractory inflammatory bowel disease that affects the
      entire digestive tract associated with intestinal and extra intestinal manifestations or
      other autoimmune diseases. Conventional therapy to Crohn's disease isolated or combination of
      anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressant and or biologic drugs/corticosteroids. This treatment
      beneffit the majority of patients. However, a proportion of patients fail to achieve complete
      and long term disease control and often require multiple intestinal surgeries with a risk of
      developing short bowel syndrome.

      Has been proposed Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) to proportionate a
      lymphoablation and reset of the immune system as an alternative strategy to induce long term
      disease control in this high risk population.

      In this study, it´s accepted Crohn's patients not responsive to conventional therapy.

      First of all, will be evaluated safety, and the clinical outcome. The selected patients will
      be admmited at Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) unit to mobilizing regimen were submitted to
      Cyclophosphamide (Cy) 60mg/kg and G-CSF 10mcg/kg day in the 5th day after Cy until harvest
      progenitor cells from peripheral blood by leukapheresis.

      After seven days of rest the conditioning regimen consists Cyclophosphamide 200mg/kg total
      dose for 4 days and globulin anti thymocyte rabbit 6,5mg/kg total dose for 4 days and
      methylprednisolone 500mg each day.

      The clinical course of patients with refractory Crohn´s disease will be evaluated to
      determine the efficacy of HSCT as a therapeutic tool, the adverse aspects of the procedure
      and clinical outcome and quality of life.

    <ipd_description>The main objective is observe the safety and clinical benefit of autologous HSCT therapy in refractory patients with Crohn's disease. Evaluation during transplant period and 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-transplant. Safety be evaluated by the amount of related adverse events. Record adverse events in a standardized way. Secondary outcome measures will be disease remission: 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-transplant both clinical and endoscopic remission. The percentage of patients in sustained disease remission at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post HSCT will be determined. Sustained disease remission is defined as a CDAI &lt; 150; HBI &lt;4, CCSI&lt; 16, without the use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressant or biologic agents. Mucosal healing will be assessed during ileocolonoscopy at 6, 12, and 24 months following HSCT using SES, CDEIS and Rutgeerts endoscopy index. Heath Quality life, Short Form 36 and IBDQ at 1 3 6 12 and 24 months post-Transplant.</ipd_description>
