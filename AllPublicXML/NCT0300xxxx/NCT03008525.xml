    <textblock>
      Vitamin D (VD) is a pleiotropic hormone, involved in many physiological processes including
      calcium and phosphorus absorption. The VD metabolism begin to be well-known and involves a
      hepatic hydroxylation (mediated by enzymes, which belong to the cytochrome P450 family)
      leading to the production of the 25(OH)D, which corresponds to the circulating form of the
      VD. After circulation in blood, the 25(OH)D is submitted to a second hydroxylation in the
      kidney resulting to the generation of 1,25(OH)2D, the active metabolite of VD. Numerous
      epidemiological studies reported an inverse relationship between obesity and circulation
      level of 25(OH)D. Several mechanisms could explain the low level of 25(OH)D observed in obese
      subjects, the more classical evoked being based on sequestration and/or dilution of VD in
      adipose tissue (AT), the main VD storage site. However, this mechanism has never been
      demonstrated. In order to confirm this hypothesis, the concentration of VD and its
      metabolites in adipose tissue need to be quantified.

      The objective of this study is to determine the concentration of VD and its metabolites in
      adipose tissue as well as adipose tissue mass quantification and distribution (visceral or
      subcutaneous) to highlight putative difference of VD and its metabolites quantities between
      obese and non-obese patients. A quantification of VD metabolism, inflammation and lipid
      metabolism gene expression will be realized on biopsies. Correlations between gene expression
      and quantity of VD in tissue will be carrying out.
