  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite many efforts to increase the size of the donor pool, there is a large and growing
      disparity between the number of donor kidneys available for transplantation and the number of
      patients on the transplant waiting list. Increasing the quality of currently available donor
      kidneys would potentially improve the longevity of deceased donor kidney transplants by
      years, thus increasing the rate of transplantation patients on the kidney transplant waiting
      list. In addition, recipients of higher quality kidneys have shorter hospital stays and lower
      total hospital charges. By innovating the organ donation process, such that deceased donor
      kidneys are removed prior to the cessation of cardiac activity, rather than after, it may be
      possible to improve the quality of the kidney before transplantation, resulting in improved
      function after transplantation and increased longevity of these transplanted kidneys.
      Further, this improved kidney quality is highly likely to translate to reduced need for renal
      dialysis and other high-cost interventions, yielding lower total hospital charges. In this
      study we will test the hypothesis that, through a cost-free technical innovation, the quality
      of deceased donor kidneys could be improved significantly, saving thousands more lives per
      year and reducing total health care expenditures on renal transplantation.

    <description>The investigators will perform a prospective investigation of organ recoveries during which the left kidney will be removed prior to cessation of cardiac activity. The second kidney will be removed in the standard fashion. To do this, investigators will adopt techniques used in living donor kidney transplantation. Specifically, a specialized vascular stapler will be used to divide the renal artery at the level of aorta, followed by the vein, at the level of the vena cava. As such, no &quot;cuff&quot; of abdominal aorta or vena cava will be present on the target kidneys. Once removed from the body, just as is done for living donor kidney transplantation, the kidneys will be immediately flushed. As this ex-vivo flush is already performed for cadaveric kidney transplantation, there should be no additional cost for performing this portion of the procedure. Approximately 15 minutes of additional surgical dissection (prior to stopping the heart) will be required under the proposed study.</description>
