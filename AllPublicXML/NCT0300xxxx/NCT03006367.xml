             (DSM-5) criteria for a primary diagnosis of ADHD based on a M.I.N.I. International
             Neuropsychiatric Interview.

          5. Subject is considered &quot;healthy&quot;. Healthy status is defined by absence of evidence of
             any active or chronic disease other than their ADHD following a detailed medical and
             surgical history, a complete physical examination.

          6. Subject has the ability to swallow a capsule of investigational product whole.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has a history of any hematological, hepatic, respiratory, cardiovascular,
             renal, neurological, or psychiatric disease, gall bladder removal, or current or
             recurrent disease other than their ADHD.

          2. Subject has a current or relevant history of physical or psychiatric illness, or any
             medical disorder that may require treatment.

          3. Subject has a current, controlled or uncontrolled, comorbid psychiatric diagnosis with
             significant symptoms.

          4. Subject is considered a suicide risk in the opinion of the investigator, has
             previously made a suicide attempt, or is currently demonstrating active suicidal
             ideation.

          5. Subject has used an investigational product, been enrolled in a clinical study
             including vaccines, or had any changes in eating habits, within 30 days prior to the
             first dose of investigational product.

          6. Subject has a positive screen for alcohol or drugs of abuse, or a positive hepatitis B
             surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or HIV antibody screen.

          7. Subject previously was an adolescent (12-17) who was either a screen failure, or
             enrolled or participated in this study or another NFC1 clinical study.

          8. Subject is currently taking any medication that might confound the results of safety
             assessments conducted in the study.

          9. Subject has a concurrent chronic or acute illness, disability, or other condition that
             might confound the results of safety assessments conducted in the study.

         10. Subject is unwilling to discontinue current ADHD medication to participate in the
             study.

         11. Subject has a clinical laboratory abnormality that indicates clinically significant
             hematologic, hepatobiliary, or renal disease.
