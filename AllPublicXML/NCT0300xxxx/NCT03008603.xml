  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-arm study is to evaluate the safety, effectiveness and
      usability of the XACT device. Subjects undergoing CT-guided, minimally invasive percutaneous
      procedures in the interventional radiology suite, e.g., core biopsy, will participate in the
      summary. Clinical accuracy will be the primary efficacy endpoint. Usability and safety will
      also be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-arm study is to evaluate the safety, effectiveness and
      usability of the XACT device. The study will be approved by the Institutional Review Board
      (IRB) at each of the participating centers prior to patient enrollment.

      Subjects undergoing CT-guided, minimally invasive percutaneous procedures in the
      interventional radiology suite, e.g., core biopsy, fine needle aspiration (FNA), tumor
      ablation, etc., and willing to sign an informed consent document will be screened for
      compliance with the study inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      A total of thirty (85) subjects will be enrolled in the study at 5 medical centers. The
      intention is to recruit subjects, which will cover a variety of CT-guided interventional
      procedures and a variety of different procedural tools that may be used with the device.
      Investigators will screen patients based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria described below
      and the subjects' demographic, general medical history, medical condition/indication,
      coagulation factors, concomitant medications and vital signs will be obtained.

      Clinical accuracy will be the primary efficacy endpoint and is defined as the ability to
      place the instrument or procedural tool at a location suitable for the planned intervention.
      The investigator will review the final instrument position on the post-placement CT images to
      determine if the pre-operative planned target was reached. This information will be used to
      calculate success rate.

      Additionally, the usability of the XACT device will be evaluated using a rating scale by
      assessing the ease of device setup, device operation, pre-operative planning, robot
      positioning, guiding and needle advancement. The total time of the procedure will be
      recorded, as will the number of CT scans performed and the radiation dose (DLP and CTDI). The
      distance from the tip of the needle/tool to the target, once the XACT robot reaches the
      pre-defined target will be measured in order to determine system accuracy in quantitative
      terms using the system tools.

    <description>The XACT device is a real-time, CT image guided, 3-dimensional robotic system. The XACT device is intended for use as an image guided positioning and steering system for insertion of clinical tools, such as biopsy needles, ablation needles, etc., during minimally invasive percutaneous procedures. The system is defined to guide (i.e., position and steer) the tool according to a predefined trajectory following a registration process between the device's coordinate system and real-time CT images.</description>
