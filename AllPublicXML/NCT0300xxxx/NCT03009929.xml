      Whereas there are several validated systems for reporting postoperative complications, there
      are only a few and not prospectively validated systems for reporting intraoperative
      complications. The investigators developed a definition and CLASSification for Intraoperative
      Complications CLASSIC within a Delphi study involving international interdisciplinary
      experts. As both surgery and anaesthesia may be involved in complications in the
      perioperative period, all patient-related intraoperative complications occurring between skin
      incision and closure are considered in this reporting system.

      The aim of this international multicentre observational cohort study is to assess the
      validity and practicability of this newly derived classification system CLASSIC in patient
      undergoing an in-hospital surgical procedure. Providing an easy applicable and
      internationally validated classification system is a contribution to improve quality of
      health care and patient safety.

      Background

      Quantifiable evidence-based methods of defining and reporting complications are needed to
      improve patient safety in surgery. Whereas there are several validated systems for reporting
      postoperative complications, there are only a few and not prospectively validated systems for
      reporting intraoperative complications. The investigators developed and published a
      definition and classification for intraoperative complications within a Delphi study
      involving international interdisciplinary experts.

      The aim of this research project is to assess the validity and practicability of this newly
      derived classification system.

      Methods

      In 6 centres in Switzerland and 13 centres abroad, 2500 consecutive patients undergoing any
      type of inpatient surgery will be included in this prospective international multicentre
      cohort study. The primary endpoint corresponds to the risk-adjusted association between the
      most severe intraoperative complication classified according to CLASSIC and the most severe
      postoperative complication classified according to the most commonly used classification of
      postoperative complications developed by Clavien and Dindo. All observed patient-related
      intraoperative complications between skin incision and closure are considered as
      intraoperative complications.

      Expected results

      The investigators expect a high correlation between the most severe intra- and postoperative
      complications, even after adjustment for relevant confounders such as duration and complexity
      of the surgical procedure.

      Relevance

      Confirming a high correlation between intra- and postoperative complications, more attentive
      care could be provided to patients who suffered from a severe intraoperative complication.
      Additionally, providing an easy applicable and internationally validated classification
      system is a contribution to improve quality of perioperative health care and patient safety.
