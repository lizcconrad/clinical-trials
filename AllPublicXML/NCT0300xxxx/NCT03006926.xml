  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 1b study designed to evaluate the tolerability and safety of
      lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC). The Expansion part of the study will evaluate objective response rate and duration of
      response by modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors for HCC (mRECIST) and
      RECIST 1.1 based on independent imaging review

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered an investigational product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>
