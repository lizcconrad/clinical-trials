      Investigation of the acute and chronic effects of Supradyn® Energy 3RDA on subjective ratings
      of 'fatigue/stress', substrate metabolism and blood biomarkers of recovery, as a consequence
      of exercise and metabolically demanding cognitive tasks.

    <textblock>
      Supplementation with vitamins and minerals has been shown to enhance energy production,
      metabolism, and mood state. It is thought that they may also aid recovery from challenging
      physical and psychological tasks following both acute and chronic supplementation. The
      present study will investigate the effects of a multivitamin/mineral supplement (Supradyn®
      Energy 3RDA) following a single intake and following daily intake for 4-weeks on subjective
      ratings of 'fatigue/stress', metabolism and blood biomarkers of cell damage following both
      exercise and demanding cognitive tasks, in healthy young male and female volunteers.
