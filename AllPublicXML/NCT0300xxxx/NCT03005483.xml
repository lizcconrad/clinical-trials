      This study is a clinical trial, prospective, randomized and double-blinded. Gabapentin oral
      10 mg/kg was administered to reduce the pain intensity as well as the opioid consumption in
      children from 3 months to 16 years submitted unilateral limb surgery.

      This study is a clinical trial, prospective, randomized and double-blinded. Gabapentin oral
      10 mg/kg was administered to reduce the pain intensity as well as the opioid consumption in
      children from 3 months to 16 years submitted unilateral limb surgery. The children were
      divided into 2 groups: the gabapentin group (GG) was administered gabapentin 1 to 2 hours
      before procedure (N-40) and the placebo group (GP) was administered placebo 1 to 2 hours
      before surgery (N-44). Both groups were subjected to the same general anesthesia protocol,
      opioid free, and femoral and sciatic block with bupivacaine 0.125%. All patients received
      dipyrone and rescue analgesic used was morphine into 2/2h. The variables studied were age,
      gender, weight, type of surgery, hemodynamics, postoperative pain and morphine consumption .
