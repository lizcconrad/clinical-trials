  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out the optimal dose for Remimazolam Tosilate as a
      procedural sedative during a diagnostic upper GI endoscopy and to assess its efficacy and
      safety profile comparing to propofol.

    <textblock>
      This is an multi-center,single-blinded,parallel-group,dose-finding study using Remimazolam or
      propofol for sedation in patients undergoing diagnostic upper GI endoscopy.Subjects are
      randomized to different treatment groups (including 4 for Remimazolam Tosilate and 1 for
      propofol).Lidocaine and fentanyl are permitted during a diagnostic upper GI
      endoscopy.Efficacy and safety profiles of Remimazolam Tosilate are to be evaluated.
