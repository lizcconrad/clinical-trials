  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common and incurable disease for the elderly in Taiwan, so it is an
      important mission to develop a new treatment for OA. Recently, cellular therapy is a new and
      popular medical treatment around the world, one of them is &quot;Mesenchymal Stromal Cells
      (MSCs)&quot;. MSCs are found in many tissues of human body and play an important role for
      repairing, regeneration, anti-inflammatory and chondrogenesis. So, MSC product, RegStem, for
      osteoarthritis treatment becomes a developing target for new generation drugs.

      This study is to isolate and expand MSCs(RegStem) from infrapatellar fat pad of subject. When
      the number of MSCs expands to 1×10^8, cell will be cryopreserved in the liquid nitrogen tank
      until all release tests passed. On the distribution day, cell will be thawed and injected
      into joint cavity of patient (5×10^7). Subjects will be monitored after MSC product infusion
      of seven days, one month, six months and one year. The monitoring items include the changes
      of knee (by appearance, X-ray and MRI of knee) and pain improvement (by questionnaire).
