  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-comparative open-label multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial combining
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and pembrolizumab with or without intratumoral
      SD-101 in patients with newly diagnosed hormone-naive oligometastatic prostate cancer.

    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well androgen deprivation therapy, pembrolizumab,
      and stereotactic body radiation therapy with or without TLR9 agonist SD-101 in treating
      patients with prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Androgen can cause
      the growth of tumor cells. Androgen deprivation therapy, such as leuprolide acetate,
      prednisone, and abiraterone acetate may lessen the amount of androgen made by the body.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy
      that sends x-rays directly to the tumor using smaller doses over several days and may cause
      less damage to normal tissue. Colony-stimulating factors, such as TLR9 agonist SD-101, may
      increase the production of blood cells. It is not yet known whether giving androgen
      deprivation therapy, pembrolizumab, and stereotactic body radiation therapy with or without
      TLR9 agonist SD-101 may work better in treating patients with prostate cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.

          -  Be &gt;=18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          -  Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

          -  Histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  Oligometastatic disease. In order to be eligible, the patient must have a total of &lt;4
             metastatic bone and/or metastatic lymph node sites based on bone and/or soft tissue
             lesions as defined by any of the following:

               1. Bone metastases will be defined by bone imaging. If the patient has technetium
                  bone scan, and/or NaF PET performed, either study may be used for documenting
                  metastases; both scans do not need to show the number of metastases required for
                  study entry. For patients undergoing PSMA PET, only PSMA avid lesions that are
                  consistent with metastasis will be counted as a site of metastasis.

               2. Distant metastatic lymph node disease. A lymph node ‚â•1 cm in shortest dimension
                  will be noted as involved with disease. Distant metastatic lymph nodes will be
                  determined as any lymph nodes outside the confines of the true pelvis. For
                  patients undergoing PSMA PET, only PSMA avid lesions that are consistent with
                  metastasis will be counted as a site of metastasis.

               3. Any other soft tissue lesion deemed by the physician to be consistent with
                  distant metastatic disease. For patients undergoing PSMA PET, only PSMA avid
                  lesions that have a CT or MRI correlate consistent with metastasis will be
                  counted as a site of metastasis.

             or at least 15 slides, with an associated pathology report. If archival prostate
             tissue are unavailable or cannot be obtained, a repeat TRUS prostate biopsy is not
             required for eligibility.

          -  Consent to undergo a mandatory baseline biopsy of a metastatic tumor, if clinically
             feasible and safe to perform. Acceptable samples include core needle biopsies of bone
             or lymph node. At least three cores should be obtained. A fine needle aspirate is not

             progression.

          -  Consent to undergo mandatory prostatic core biopsies at the time of fiducial marker
