      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ovarian reserve is related to recurrent
      pregnancy loss

      This study will be conducted at the gynecology and infertility department of Kanuni Sultan
      Süleyman Training and Research Hospital from 2016 to 2017. The approval of the local
      Institutional Review Board (KAEK/2016.22.31) was obtained in June 2016 and informed consents
      of all subjects have been prepared. RM is defined as three or more pregnancy losses at &lt;20
      weeks of gestation or fetal weight &lt;500 g. Women with history of RM for whom routine workup
      for RM (chromosomal analyses of both partners; levels of prolactin and TSH; anticardiolipin
      antibody, lupus anticoagulant, antinuclear antibody, and coagulation studies; and pelvic
      ultrasonography) is negative are assigned to the RM group. The control group consists of
      healthy women with no history of RM who are seeking contraception in the center's family
      planning unit. To keep the power of the study at 80% with an alpha-level of 0.05, a sample
      size of minumum 60 patients in each group was required.

      Demographic data (age,gravidity,parity,pregnancy loss,bmı) ovarian reserve
      parameters(AMH,FSH,LH,E2,AFC) will be recorded and then two groups will be compared.

      Data will be analyzed with the use of medcalc version 16.4.8 by Gökhan Yıldırım.
      Mean,median,SD,lowest and highest frequency ,and ratio values are used at statistical
      complementary of data .Quantitative data will be analyzed with the use of the Student t test
      and the Mann-Whitney U test. A chisquare test will be used for analyses of qualitative data

    <description>Venous blood samples will be taken from the antecubital regions of all patients between 8:00 a.m and 9:00 a.m during the early follicular phase (days 2-4) of the menstrual cycle .Serum samples will be stored at -80C and assayed for FSH,LH,E2 and AMH .FSH levels are analyzed by means of an electrochemiluminescence method .The normal range for FSH is 2.5-10 U/L at the early follicular phase. Serum AMH levels will be measured with the use of a human ELİSA kit . The normal range for this assay is 0.05-1.5 ng/ml.In the same morning that the blood tests are performed , the total number of antral follicles measuring 2-10 mm in diameter are evaluated by the operator.A 7.5 -MHz transvaginal probe is used in all examinations.Data will be analyzed with the use of medcalc.</description>

    <description>FSH,LH,E2,AMH assesment of at least 86 patients will be analyzed with the use of medcalc . Unıts of measure of FSH,LH,E2 levels are assesed by U/L. The normal range of AMH level is 0.05-1.5ng/ml. Mean ,median ,SD, lowest and highest frequency ,and ratio values are used at statistical complemantary data.Quantitative data are analyzed with the use of the student -t test and Mann-Whitney U test</description>
