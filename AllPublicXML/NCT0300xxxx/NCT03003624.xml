      The aim of the present study was to compare the outcomes of incisions made by Colorado®
      microdissection needle, electrosurgery tip and surgical blade during periodontal surgery.

      Commercially, many microdissection needle systems are available, such as Stryker Colorado®
      microdissection needle (CMN) (Stryker-Leibinger, Freiburg, Germany) and optimicro™
      microdissection needles. Colorado® microdissection needle (CMN) combine the advantages of
      scalpel and electrosurgery. CMN® was introduced into clinical practice in 1997, with a wide
      array of applications in the field of Ophthalmology, Neurosurgery, and others.

      The primary feature of the Colorado® microdissection needle is the ultra-sharp tungsten tip
      that delivers the wave-form from the electrosurgery generator to a very small spot. This
      allows the use of extremely low wattages, resulting in less tissue necrosis, precision
      cutting and cautery, and less post-operative pain. The instrument tip is a delicately
      machined, insulated tungsten diathermy needle that is compatible with any standard cautery
      hand piece. Tungsten, with its extremely high melting point (&gt;3400°C) provides a heat
      resistant tip that maintains sharpness compared to stainless steel tips that dull rapidly.

    <description>Postoperative pain was assessed by using visual analogue scale (VAS) which was recorded 1 day, 7 &amp; 15 days after surgery. The visual analogue scale (VAS) consists of a line, usually 10 cm long, whose ends are labelled as the extremes ('no pain' and 'severe pain'). The patients were asked to mark on the line which indicated their pain intensity.</description>

    <description>Studies have shown that, heat generated by electrosurgical devices are influenced by factors like duration of contact between tissue and electrode tip, current intensity, electro section waveform and the electrode tip size. A larger tip causes more tissue damage, increased operating power and more amount of lateral heat production. This led to the development of microdissection needle with fine electrode tip and efficient power usage. The use of microdissection needles does not have any significant difference in wound healing or pain when compared with scalpel.</description>
