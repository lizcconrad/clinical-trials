    <textblock>
      Despite exercise training decrease blood fasting glycemia in 'average' terms, there is a wide
      interindividual variability after exercise training explored mainly in adults but not in
      children. Thus, is yet unknown what baseline health status as well as the influence of what
      health variable may produce more/less non-responder (NR) prevalence (i.e., percentage of
      subjects who experienced a non-change/worsened response after training in some metabolic
      outcomes) after exercise training in school children.

    <description>To HIT program will be use cycle ergometers adapted for children (OXFORDTM, model BE2601, OXOFORD Inc, Santiago, Chile) were used. Each participant performed a range of 8 to 14 cycling intervals during the intervention period. The time of each work interval cycling will be increased progressively weekly, and ranged between 40-60 s (40 s weeks 1-2; 50 s weeks 3-5; 60 s week 6), with 120 s of passive rest (over the bicycle without movement) between each interval of work.
The RT will consist in voluntary concentric/eccentric exercise during 1 minute until to get a high subjective effort perception (i.e., between 8-10 points based on the modified and subjective Borg scale of 1 to 10 points. Subjects will perform 4 exercises (biceps curl, leg-extension, shoulders press, and upper row exercise) during 6-weeks.</description>
