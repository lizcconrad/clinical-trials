    <textblock>
      This is an open label, 16 week study of apremilast in combination with topical
      corticosteroids (TCS). Twenty qualified subjects will be enrolled. Visits will consist of
      Baseline, 8 week, 16 week and a 20 week safety follow up after 4 weeks off treatment.
      Subjects will dose with apremilast as per label. Topical corticosteroids (TCS) will be used
      for up to Week 4 as per label and then will be used on an as needed basis until Week 16.
      Assessments will include Static Physicians Global Assessment (sPGA), Psoriasis Area Severity
      Index (PASI), Psoriatic Body Surface Area (BSA), Dermatology Life Quality Index
      (DLQI),Assessment of Pruritus, Patient Satisfaction questionnaire. and Patient Global
      Assessment (PtGA)
