      The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the treatments in two cohort for
      COPD patients: one, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) cohort, which have been evaluated and
      have certain effect; the other, conventional medicine treatments cohort, based on 2015 Global
      Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD, with high prevalence, morbidity, mortality and economic burdens, affects millions
      worldwide. Although many therapies exist and are being developed to relieve symptoms and
      reduce mortality in COPD, most have only been studied in placebo-controlled efficacy studies
      in highly selected populations. There are few clinical trials to compare therapeutic
      alternatives in real world. Furthermore, some randomized controlled trials on comprehensive
      TCM interventions, especially based on the TCM patterns, have been the certain evidence for
      showing definite effect for COPD patients. In addition, studies in real world populations of
      COPD that received different therapies that do have efficacy evidence was found wide
      variations in care delivery. In short, there is a need for cohort study in COPD.

      This is a multi-center, prospective, cohort study to evaluate the effectiveness of TCM on
      COPD patients. The cohort study will enroll approximately 2540 patients that in two cohort,
      one, TCM cohort, which have been evaluated and have certain effect; the other, conventional
      medicine treatments cohort, based on 2015 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung
      Disease (GOLD).Subjects in two cohort will be followed-up 2 years.The primary outcome measure
      is the frequency of exacerbations. The secondary efficacy measures include mortality rate and
      all-cause mortality, FEV1, dyspnea (MMRC), exercise capacity( 6MWD), quality of life ( CAT,
      SF-36 and COPD-PRO), and effectiveness satisfaction with treatment(ESQ-COPD).
