  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver cirrhosis has traditionally been seen as a state of hypocoagulability and can be
      protected against thrombosis. However, recent studies have completely changed this paradigm.
      Patients with liver cirrhosis have an impaired hepatic synthesis of procoagulation factors
      but also anticoagulation factors, which is associated with an increase in other procoagulant
      factors such as factor VIII and von Willebrand factor which determines an elevated thrombin
      generation and, ultimately, a hypercoagulability state. Several consequences of
      hypercoagulability can be expected, such as portal vein thrombosis and venous
      thromboembolism. In addition to the potential direct deleterious consequences for the
      development of portal vein thrombosis, recent data have shown a close relationship between
      the activation of coagulation and faster progression of liver fibrosis.

      Bacterial translocation is a common problem and plays an important role in the pathogenesis
      and complications in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, including infections as well as
      hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. To date, several biomarkers of BT have been
      proposed, which include bacterial DNA, soluble CD14, lipopolysaccharides endotoxin,
      lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, calprotectin and procalcitonin. Besides, endotoxemia and
      activation of the TNFa-pathway may be also considered key components in the pathogenesis and
      aggravation of portal hypertension and its complications.

      Anticoagulation therapy has a beneficial effect on survival in patients with idiopathic
      pulmonary fibrosis. Besides, a pilot study showed that the use of anticoagulants warfarin for
      8 weeks improved the liver elasticity determined by Fibroscan® (Dhar A, et al. J Hepatology
      2012. Abstract). An ongoing study of warfarin for the prevention of fibrosis due to recurrent
      hepatitis C should also contribute to an understanding of the role of the haemostatic system
      and fibrosis (http: //www.controledtrials.com/IRSCTN12504151).

      On the other hand, a recent prospective study in a group of 70 patients with liver cirrhosis
      (Child B and C stages up to 10 points) who were randomized to receive enoxaparin for a year
      (n = 34) vs no intervention (n = 36) showed that anticoagulant treatment with enoxaparin is
      safe and effective, significantly reducing risk of PVT development and liver decompensation,
      markedly improving overall survival. This study provides exciting preliminary data regarding
      the potential use of prophylactic anticoagulation in improving clinical outcomes in
      cirrhosis, beyond the prevention of portal vein thrombosis. This study suggested that the
      effect was partly due to a direct effect of reducing BT and levels of proinflammatory
      cytokines. However, this study included few patients, was not double blind, and did not have
      a placebo group. Therefore, despite the spectacular results, the use of prophylactic
      anticoagulant therapy has not become routine practice in patients with cirrhosis and more
      studies are needed to assess the potential usefulness of anticoagulation in improving the
      prognosis of liver cirrhosis.

      Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) are now routinely used to treat the
      complications of portal hypertension, such as variceal bleeding and refractory ascites. TIPS
      is the most effective method to prevent rebleeding, however, it is burdened with increased
      risk of hepatic encephalopathy and deterioration of liver function in patients with advanced
      cirrhosis. Notably, TIPS can not only relieve portal pressure but also can redirect the
      portal blood flow through the shunt directly into the systemic circulation which can cause
      systemic hemodynamic changes.

      Given the preliminary data suggesting a beneficial effect of prophylactic anticoagulation
      with LMWH in cirrhotic patients, this multicenter randomized controlled study attempts to
      demonstrate the effect of long term LMWH therapy after TIPS on survival in cirrhotic patients
      with variceal bleeding.
