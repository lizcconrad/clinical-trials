      The objectives of this study are to replicate the safety and efficacy of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and
      as a diagnostic and decision making tool in the management prostate cancer patients.The
      primary endpoints of the study are the incidence of adverse events (AE) in the study
      population up to 7 days following the scan, and the sensitivity and specificity of 68Ga-PSMA
      PET/CT vs CT on a per-patient and per-lesion basis.

    <textblock>
      Positron emission tomography / computer tomography (PET/CT) is a nuclear medicine diagnostic
      imaging procedure based on the measurement of positron emission from radiolabeled tracer
      molecules in vivo. A radiotracer in use today is 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA (DKFZ-11) - hereinafter
      abbreviated 68Ga-PSMA - which is a radiolabeled urea-based ligand for prostate specific
      membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT. Imaging with 68Ga-PSMA PET is used to characterize and
      localize prostate cancer in humans in vivo. There is extensive data in the literature showing
      the value of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT imaging in accurately staging and restaging prostate cancer.
      The objectives of this study are to replicate the safety and efficacy of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and
      to establish our ability to reproduce results from the literature using 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT as a
      diagnostic and decision making tool in the management prostate cancer patients. During the
      study eligible prostate cancer patients will undergo one 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT. The primary
      endpoints of the study are the incidence of adverse events (AE) in the study population up to
      7 days following the scan, and the sensitivity and specificity of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT vs CT on a
      per-patient and per-lesion basis.
