  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 50% of obese patients are not interested in, or ready for, weight loss. Clinical
      practice guidelines clearly recommend that these patients avoid gaining weight. However,
      despite this clinical guideline, weight gain prevention interventions are not available in
      primary care practice. Balance is a pragmatic, randomized controlled effectiveness trial for
      weight gain prevention for patients within rural community health centers, using a digital
      health platform.

      Clinical practice guidelines emphasize recommend weight gain prevention, but evidence-based
      treatments are not available in primary care. Balance, a pragmatic effectiveness trial, will
      test a scalable treatment approach for medically-vulnerable adults, those who suffer
      disproportionately from obesity and its adverse health effects. Balance builds on the design
      and findings of the Shape study (NCT00938535) to test a pragmatic intervention within rural
      community health centers. Balance will randomize overweight adults and adults with obesity
      who are patients a local community health center network (Piedmont Health Services) to
      either: 1) a 12-month weight gain prevention intervention or 2) usual care. Intervention
      group components include tailored behavior change goals; mHealth self-monitoring and
      feedback; skills training videos; and stepped responsive coaching from clinic Registered
      Dietitians. The usual care group will receive standard primary care offered by their
      providers and automated text messages and health information about maintaining a healthy
      weight. All intervention components and materials will be provided in Spanish or English.

    <description>Balance is testing a pragmatic approach to promote weight maintenance among overweight patients and patients with obesity within local community health centers who experience barriers to losing weight. The intervention utilizes the interactive obesity treatment approach, which creates an energy deficit by having participants achieve simple, straightforward, and concrete behavior change goals (e.g., no fast food, no sugary drinks, walk 10,000 steps per day). The Balance intervention involves tailored behavior change goals; self-monitoring using connected scales and mobile technologies; responsive coaching, and tailored feedback and skills training.</description>
