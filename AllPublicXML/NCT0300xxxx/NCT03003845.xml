    <textblock>
      For each patient in the study, blood, and pain scores will be collected to look for markers
      for pain, at the start of treatment and 6 months after surgery of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is investigator-initiated, prospective, study. There will be no change in care.

      Patients who have had a diagnosis of IC made by cystoscopy and hydrodistension and still have
      pain will be recruited for this study.

      Patients will have blood samples taken at the visit they sign the consent form and 6 months
      later.

      The study staff will call and remind the patient of their 6 month visit.

      PERIPHERAL BLOOD LEUKOCYTE (PBLS) ANALYSIS (Research Related):

      Using immunoblotting, we will determine if the level of S1PR1 expression in peripheral blood
      leukocytes (PBLs) is increased in patients with IC pain. Patients will have blood samples
      taken, at the visit they sign the consent form 3 and 6 months later. A total of 4 teaspoons
      of blood will be taken for the study.
