      Any time the words &quot;you,&quot; &quot;your,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; or &quot;me&quot; appear, it is meant to apply to the potential
      participant.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to use 68GA-DOTATOC instead of the
      standard-of-care 111-In-pentetreotide as a tracer chemical during PET/CT scans for diagnosing
      neuroendocrine tumors. A tracer is injected into your bloodstream to help the study doctor
      see possible tumors.

      This is an investigational study. 68GA-DOTATOC is an investigational PET/CT tracer. It is not
      FDA approved as a PET/CT tracer.

      Up to 100 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Scans:

      If you are eligible to take part in this study, you will have a PET/CT scan.

      Before the PET/CT scan, you will receive 68GA-DOTATOC by injection. The scan will last up to
      an hour.

      If your regular doctor thinks more PET/CT scans are needed, you will also receive
      68GA-DOTATOC before each of these scans. Usually, these will be performed every 4-6 months.

      Length of Study:

      Your active participation on this study will be over after your last PET/CT scan.

      Follow-Up:

      Your contact information will be recorded and you will be contacted by the study staff within
      72 hours (3 days) after you received 68GA-DOTATOC and again 30 days (+/- 3 days) later. You
      will be asked how you are doing and if you are having any side effects. Your medical record
      may be reviewed after the scans for the purposes of the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ability of the subject, or the Legally Authorized Representative (LAR), if the patient
             is deemed by the treating physician to be cognitively impaired or questionably
             impaired in such a way that the ability of the patient to give informed consent is
             questionable, to understand, and the willingness to sign, a written informed consent

          2. All participants must meet one of the following: i) Patients diagnosed or suspected to
             have NET, who require 111In-pentetreotide imaging for clinical indications. ii)
             Subjects with a high risk of NET because of familial predisposition, and also have
             clinical findings which require radiolabeled somatostatin imaging. iii) Other
             somatostatin-positive tumors for which 111In -pentetreotide has been used
             successfully, such as adult meningiomas. iv) Patients with suspected neuroendocrine
             tumor, unknown primary NET, metastatic NET, or other tumors, such as meningiomas, in
             whom the primary physician considers somatostatin imaging to be clinically indicated.
             v) Other NET subjects, whether asymptomatic or symptomatic, sporadic or familial, such
             as VHL and MEN1, will also be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of 68Ga-DOTATOC in
             pregnancy are not known; exceptions may be granted only if the expected risk outweighs
             the benefit, in the clinical opinion of the attending physician. Pregnancy testing
             will follow MD Anderson procedure for diagnostic reagents. Self-reporting is used to
             assess pregnancy status. If the subject is unsure about her status, a urine or serum
             pregnancy test will be performed before inclusion

          2. Lactating women are excluded if patient is unwilling to suspend lactation for at least
             one day following the administration of 68Ga-DOTATOC to the mother, because of the
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             administration of the radionuclide to a lactating woman

          3. Subjects with known contraindications to the use of 111In -pentetreotide

          4. Known severe allergy or hypersensitivity to oral contrast precludes administration of
             oral contrast only.

          5. Patients with a body weight of 400 pounds or more, or a BMI which precludes their
             entry into the bore of the PET/CT scanner, because of the resulting probable
             compromise in image quality with CT, PET/CT and MRI.

          6. Any additional medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or other extenuating
             circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator may significantly interfere with
             study compliance.
