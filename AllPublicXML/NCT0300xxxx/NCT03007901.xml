      To work with community partners to pilot test a mindfulness-based behavioral program aimed
      at: (a) enhancement of health and well-being, and (b) reduction in carbon footprint; (2) to
      develop, implement, and refine methods for assessing carbon footprint at the individual
      level; and (3) to work with pilot participants and community partners to carry out a
      proof-of-concept research study to assess impact on health, well-being, and carbon footprint.

      This Pilot Study will be conducted to allow us to evaluate and test the various study
      processes, including: consent/enrollment, run-in-trial monitoring, measurement tools, outcome
      assessment, educational materials, and especially the mindfulness-based climate action
      trainings. The pilot study does not include a control group, and data will not be used for
      efficacy outcome analysis. The investigators anticipate doing two pilot cohorts of roughly 16
      persons/group. The pilot cohorts will not be simultaneous.

      Participants will meet for 2½ hour sessions, once per week for eight weeks. An additional
      6-hour retreat will be scheduled over a weekend towards the end of the program. Participants
      will receive about 26 hours of contact time. Their daily home practice will be guided by
      audio recordings (25 to 45 minutes) that lead them through their formal meditation practice
      of the body scan, sitting meditations, and gentle yoga. Participants will be asked to
      practice for 5 or 6 days per week at home, using these audio recordings or on their own. They
      will also be asked to select a daily practice time that works best for them, perhaps early
      morning, after work, or later in the evening. Participants will record what they practice and
      for how long either on paper log sheets or using a web-based data form.

      Climate change, energy, and carbon footprint knowledge will be assessed by a college
      intro-level test (pre- and post-training). Electrical and gas use will be assessed directly
      by inspecting Madison Gas and Electric (MG&amp;E) utility records. Miles driven in automobile
      will be assessed by self-report, verified with odometer readings of primary vehicle done by
      study staff. Active transportation and motor vehicle travel will be measured using a free,
      smart phone app called MOVES. In order to extract the activity data from the user's phone,
      each participant will download another free app called TRAQS CSV Exporter
      (https://labs.traqs.me/moves/) which will export data once monthly over the course of the
      year. Individual movement/transportation activity data obtained from this app will provide
      the study team with data allowing an in-depth and fine-grained understanding of
      transportation behaviors across the study time period.

      Dietary composition will be assessed by validated dietary recall, with proportion of dietary
      calories from animal versus plant sources as the primary assessment. Composite carbon
      footprints will be calculated. In addition to carbon footprint, the investigators will be
      assessing health co-benefits, including several domains of mental and physical health
      (validated self-report measures) and active transport assessed using Actigraph
      accelerometers.

      Participants will be asked to provide feedback through interviews regarding the curriculum.

    <description>Carbon footprint (CF) will be estimated. Individual-level carbon footprints (ICF) are assessed as ICF = ΣCiEi where each term is the product of the degree of consumption (C) and the CO2 equivalent radiative forcing emission (E) of that input (i). Greenhouse gas emission (E) weightings applied to individual consumption levels (C) will be expressed in metric tons CO2-equivalent/year (CO2e).</description>

    <description>Educational and Behavioral Training Curriculum: An article describing our proposed program was recently published in Sustainability (1) and is summarized here. Experienced instructors from the UW Integrative Medicine Mindfulness Program will teach the 8-week program. Classes will meet weekly for 2½ hours, with a 6 hour weekend retreat. Twenty to 45 minutes of daily home practice will be guided by audio recordings leading participants through body scan, sitting meditations, breath awareness, and mindful movement. Each of the 2½ hour weekly classes includes topics (~30 min) relating to climate change, energy use, and carbon footprint.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 30 to 65 years at enrollment will be assessed by self-report and date of birth.
             This relatively broad age range will facilitate enrollment and will enhance
             generalizability of results. This range will also tend to include people with moderate
             to large carbon footprints, possibly allowing room for measurable improvement with
             mindfulness training.

          -  Fluency in English (oral, reading, and writing) is necessary to complete all study
             parameters including: providing consent, completion of questionnaires and online
             surveys, and intervention objectives.

          -  Willingness and ability to carry out all study-specific tasks, including commitment to
             provide data, wear an ActiGraph for one week twice over the course of the study, and
             be monitored throughout the research study period.

          -  Participants must be owners (or co-owners) of single family dwelling, and must have
             been in the same location for the prior 12 months, with no expectation of moving
             during the study. Utility service to the single family dwelling must be provided by
             MG&amp;E (gas and electric) and Madison Water Utility. This is necessary to accurately
             assess and compare household energy and water use across participants and randomized
             groups.

          -  Participants must own (or co-own or lease) an automobile and drive it at least 5000
             miles per year (assessed by self-report). The choice of 5,000 miles as cutoff is
             arbitrary, but will exclude those who do not drive much, and would therefore have less
             capacity for measureable improvement. People who share the use of a car with no more
             than one other person but who drive the majority of miles will be included, as will
             people who own and drive two primary vehicles. People who own and regularly drive more
             than two vehicles will be excluded due to the added participant and staff burden
             involved with obtaining odometer readings.

          -  Ownership, use, and familiarity with a smart phone (either iPhone or Android type)
             will be required due to planned use of the MOVES app to obtain major outcome data.

          -  Only one member per household will be allowed to participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be excluded if they currently or recently participate in meditative
             practice or mindfulness or other meditation training in the past 3 years. Assessed by
             answering &quot;Yes&quot; to any of the following questions: Do you meditate on a regular basis?
             In the last year, have you meditated at least weekly for 2 or more months in a row?
             Have you received meditation training in the last 5 years? Have you taken part in a
             mindfulness class or mindfulness sessions during the past 5 years?

          -  People with self-described vegan or vegetarian diets (self-assessed average meat
             ingestion frequency less than once/week) will be excluded, as one goal of the
             trainings is to influence dietary habits away from meats (especially beef) and towards
             vegetables and other plant-based foods. Only those who answer &quot;Yes&quot; to &quot;Do you tend to
             eat at least one meal with some meat in it on most days of the week?&quot; will be eligible
             to participate.

          -  People with serious physical, medical, or mental condition precluding adherence to
             study protocol will be excluded. Questionable cases will be reviewed by the study
             physicians.

          -  Those that are unable/unwilling to successfully complete baseline assessment,
             including in-person meetings, data-collection, and other tasks will be excluded from
             the study. Inability to complete a sample of the study requirements will indicate an
             inability to complete full study requirements.
