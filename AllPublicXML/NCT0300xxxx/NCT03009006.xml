      The aim of this prospective in vivo randomized clinical trial to evaluate influence of
      combination of calcium Hydroxide (CALCIPAST Paste, Poland) and chlorhexidine Gel 2%
      (Gluco-Chex 2%, Cerkamed, Poland) in comparison to calcium hydroxide paste (CALCIPAST Paste,
      Poland) as Intracanal Medication on post operative pain (incidence, degree, duration) and
      reduction of bacterial endotoxins (quantitative) after endodontic treatment in single rooted
      necrotic teeth.

      According to the inclusion criteria the patients enrolled in the study and allocated randomly
      into three groups either combination of calcium hydroxide paste intracanal medication with 2%
      chlorhexidine gel. (group A) or calcium hydroxide paste intracanal medication only (group B)
      or mechanical preparation without intracanal medications (group C) the endodontic treatment
      is done at two visits.

      The samples of endotoxin divided into three groups: after access (S1), after mechanical
      instrumentations (S2), after removal intracanal medication (S3), all samples taken by a
      sterile paper points introduced in the root canal for the working length for 60 seconds.

      firstly the patient's medical and dental history is taken. the patients assign on informed
      consent. and then anaesthetized and access cavity performed and root canal preparation is
      done by Revo-s system then irrigation and intracanal medication placement inside to canal.
      the patient's record the post operative pain in sheet with NRS after 4, 24, 48 hours and 2
      weeks after first visit. the operator will recall the patient to check the records

      second visit After 2 weeks from application of ICM, rubber dam will be applied then removal
      of the temporary dressing, then a sterile paper point (S3) will be introduced into the canals
      after irrigation and removal of the remnants of the intracanal medicament with the saline
      solution.

        -  Removal of the paper sample to determine the endotoxin concentration.

        -  The canals will be obturated by single cone technique using gutta percha point tapered
           0.4% (Gutta percha point, Revo-S MicroMega CO., LTD, France) corresponding to the final
           apical size of the file and the root canal sealer will be resin sealer (Adseal, META
           BIOMED CO., LTD, Korea).

        -  Pain will be assessed by numerical pain rating scale (NRS) after 14 days from the first
           visit (at the day of the Obturation) before the beginning of Obturation.

      Medical and dental history: diagnostic charts will be collected in a case report from by the
      investigators and confirmed for eligibility with the assistant supervisor.

      Radiographic examination: preoperative radiographs will be taken to examine the tooth
      structure, caries detection, periapical status.

      Clinical examination: intraoral examination include visual examination for caries,
      restorations, swelling, fistula, mobility, percussion were done.

      Diagnostic criteria for necrotic tooth:

        1. The patient marks moderate to severe pain on the numerical rating scale (NRS)a
           horizontal line of 11 marks and 10 intervals each takes number form 0 - 10 0 reading
           represents &quot;no pain&quot;, 1- 3 readings represent &quot;mild pain&quot;, 4- 6 readings represent
           &quot;moderate pain&quot;, 7- 10 readings represent &quot;severe pain&quot;.

           (recording baseline degree of pain preoperatively before initiating the endodontic
           treatment ) All step will done by operator.

           The measurement time will be at 4 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours and after 14 days. (Day
           of Obturation)

        2. The patient not responding to electric pulp tester at higher level than the
           contralateral tooth or the adjacent tooth if the contralateral one is missing.

        3. Preoperative periapical x- ray film is done to detect any periapical changes.

      Intervention:

      Forty five patients will include were allocated by random or by chance to receive several
      clinical interventions and one of these interventions was control (Group A) where the
      patients did not receive any intracanal medication, (Group B) where the patients receive
      intracanal medication calcium hydroxide (CALCIPAST Paste, (Poland) and chlorhexidine 2 % gel.
      (Gluco-Chex 2%, Cerkamed, Poland), (Group C) calcium hydroxide paste only CALCIPAST Paste
      (Poland).

           presenting pain as preoperative pain

        -  Anesthesia will be done with Carpule 3M™ ESPE™ Ubistesin™ Articaine HCI 4% &amp; Adrenaline
           1:100,000 3M Australia the tooth with decayed using a standard dental aspirating
           syringe.

        -  After diagnosis disinfecting the tooth surface by 30% H2O2 (Perfect Medical, Egypt)
           followed by 2.5% NaOCl inactivated with sodium thiosulfate (El Nasr CO. for
           pharmaceuticals and chemicals).

        -  Access cavity will do under rubber dam isolation and with Sterile burs for access cavity
           preparation with distilled water as a coolant and flaring will done by endo-z bur.

        -  If successful anesthesia occurs, working length will be determined with an apex locator
           (Root ZX, J.Morita, Irvine, California, USA.) then confirmed with intraoral periapical
           radiograph (Kodac Dental film, speed D, size 2, Carestream Health, Rochester, NY, USA)
           to confirm the length to be 0.5-1 mm shorter than radiographic apex.

        -  The first sample of endotoxin (S1) is taken by a sterile paper points after access
           cavity preparation and introduced in the root canal for the working length for 60
           seconds.

           condensed with paper points.

        -  Temporary filling is done by glass ionmer filling to ensure proper sealing with no
           leakage of any oral fluids inside the root canal, which may disturb the action of the
           intracanal medication.

        -  Pain will be assessed by numerical pain rating scale (NRS) will be given to each patient
           to complete a t home at the specified times at 4, 24, 48 hours after the first visit.

      At the 2nd appointment:

        -  After 2 weeks from application of ICM, rubber dam will be applied then removal of the
           temporary dressing by following the previous infection control protocol, then a sterile
           paper point (S3) will be introduced into the canals after irrigation and removal of the
           remnants of the intracanal medicament with the saline solution.

        -  Removal of the paper sample to determine the endotoxin concentration.

        -  The canals will be obturated by single cone technique using gutta percha point tapered
           0.4% (Gutta percha point, Revo-S MicroMega CO., LTD, France) corresponding to the final
           apical size of the file and the root canal sealer will be resin sealer (Adseal, META
           BIOMED CO., LTD, Korea).

        -  Pain will be assessed by numerical pain rating scale (NRS) after 14 days from the first
