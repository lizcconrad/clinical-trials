  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of a 9-week, randomized trial of
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) compared to placebo in 14 children (age 5 to 12 years) with Autism
      Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and a moderate level of repetitive self-injurious behavior (SIB).
      Additional aims are to evaluate the positive predictive value of a screening method to
      classify children with automatically maintained self-injurious behavior; to evaluate the
      preliminary efficacy of NAC for reducing repetitive SIB in children with ASD; and to evaluate
      biomarkers and possible mechanisms of action of NAC in children with ASD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Self-injurious behavior (SIB) in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can cause
      physical harm to the child and interfere with the child's ability to make use of educational
      programs and helpful treatments such as speech therapy. The turmoil caused by self-injurious
      behaviors in children with ASD invariably interferes with daily routines because family life
      often stops during these episodes and family members worry about setting off SIB between
      episodes. This project will use the detailed assessment methods developed in the field of
      behavior therapy to evaluate the potential for N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to treat children with
      ASD and moderate repetitive SIB. NAC is an over-the-counter dietary supplement that may have
      beneficial effects on the brain through its well-documented antioxidant effects and/or
      reduced glutamate signaling. In the proposed study, 14 children with ASD and repetitive SIB
      between the ages of 5 and 12 will be randomly assigned to gradually increasing doses of NAC
      or placebo for 9 weeks. The research team, parents and children will be blind to the
      treatment with NAC or placebo. Participants will come to the research site periodically to
      complete measures and behavioral assessments.

      After the 9 weeks of treatment, children randomized to NAC who showed improvement will be
      encouraged to continue taking the supplement outside the study. Children who were randomly
      assigned to the placebo and showed no improvement will be offered open-label treatment with
      NAC. Children who did not improve while taking NAC or those who improved while on the placebo
      will be advised on next steps by the study team.

      The goal of this feasibility study is establish the acceptability viability of study
      procedures in this vulnerable population, to learn about the potential benefits and adverse
      effects of NAC. Demonstrating these feasibility aims and the preliminary efficacy and safety
      of NAC is a prerequisite for planning a larger, more definitive, study.

    <measure>Positive Predictive Value of screening method of classifying self-injurious behavior (SIB) by type.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months (duration of the study)</time_frame>
    <description>Goal: at least 75% positive predictive value of our screening method to classify children with automatically maintained self-injurious behavior using a semi-structured interview at screening compared to the findings of five- to six-hour functional analysis at baseline. Only children who appear to have automatically maintained SIB will be referred for the baseline evaluation.
Demonstrating a high positive predictive value for the screening method is a necessary prerequisite for launching a larger study. Using the formula: Positive Predictive Value (PPV) = screen positive and true cases รท all positive screens, a value of 75% or greater would indicate success of the screening method used.</description>

    <measure>Change in Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability Subscale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 9</time_frame>
    <description>The Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) is a commonly used 58-item parent-rated measure of overall behavioral problems. The Irritability subscale is comprised of 15 items reflecting tantrums, aggression and self injury. As a preliminary efficacy outcome, we will calculate the average percent change from baseline to Week 9 in the NAC group. We set a benchmark of 25% decline on average. We will also examine the within group improvement on the ABC-Irritability subscale from baseline to Week 9 within the NAC group (paired t-test) and across the groups (ANCOVA).</description>

    <description>Direct observation of the frequency and severity of SIB will be collected at baseline in a separate observational session after completing the functional analysis and again at Week 9. We set a benchmark of an average decline in the frequency of SIB of 50% within the NAC group. Change in counts and the average severity score within the NAC group will be examined by paired t test and across treatment groups with ANCOVA.</description>

    <description>The Improvement item of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI-I) scale is a 7-item scale from 1 (Very Much Improved) through 4 (No Change) to 7 (Very Much Worse). By convention, scores of 2 (Much Improved) or 1 (Very Much Improved) are used to define positive response. We set a benchmark for a CGI-I of 2 or 1 of 50% or more in the NAC group.</description>

    <description>We will investigate the antioxidant effects and changes amino acid levels before and after NAC treatment. Given the sample size, we do not expect differences between groups. Within the NAC group, we expect increased cysteine/cystine and glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) ratios (antioxidant effects), and decreased glutamate and glutamate/glutamine ratio (reduction in glutamate signaling) and increased GABA levels.</description>
