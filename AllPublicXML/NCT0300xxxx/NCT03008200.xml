    <textblock>
      115 patients were enrolled in this study.Population was recruited from singleton pregnancies
      beyond 27 weeks of gestation.All participants underwent a ultrasound examination to measure
      fetal pulmonary artery acceleration to ejection time ratio (PATET) by a single experienced
      clinician. After the delivery respiratory distress diagnosis made by a pediatrician who were
      blinded the doppler waveform measurements.Following the diagnosis, neonates divided into 2
      groups as RDS (+) and RDS (-). In addition of RDS diagnosis, neonatal features like 1st and
      5th minute APGAR scores, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission and duration in NICU
      were also recorded. Afterwards all parameters were statistically analyzed if there is any
      significant differences between those two groups.
