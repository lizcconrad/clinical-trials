  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dupuytren's disease is a non-curative, progressive disorder leading to function-impairing
      deformities of the hand. Although numerous treatments exist, the most common and widely
      accepted therapy is removal of diseased fascia. Surgery is limited by prolonged recovery
      time, and many patients require multiple surgeries throughout their life as the disease
      progresses, with repeat surgeries increasing the risk of complications.

      Long recovery times and need for repeat surgeries has renewed interest in minimally invasive
      treatments for Dupuytren's disease. Percutaneous needle aponeurotomy (PNA) allows for rapid
      improvement in finger extension with minimal recovery time. The FDA approved collagenase
      clostridium histolyticum injection for Dupuytren's disease in 2010, which also allows for
      rapid increase in finger extension, also with minimal recovery time. Currently there is only
      one small study comparing PNA and collagenase injection (CI) that suggests similar outcomes
      in both treatments. Both treatments are minimally invasive, requiring minimal time off work
      and post-procedure pain. The main barrier to widespread adoption of CI is cost, particularly
      in patients with multiple areas of disease requiring treatment. The project proposed will
      compare these two methods for treating Dupuytren's disease.

      Approximately 334 participants will be recruited from patients referred for treatment to hand
      surgeons trained in CI and PNA at two Calgary, AB hospitals. Need for treatment will be
      determined in the usual fashion, and the option for entry into the study will be proposed to
      patients meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria. Participants will be randomized into either
      the PNA or CI treatment group. The surgeon will not be blinded to the procedure group;
      however, the therapist measuring outcomes will be, and the study participants will need to
      not divulge to the therapists which group they are in.

      Both procedures are performed under local freezing, and range from 5-20minutes. PNA involves
      the surgeon freezing the skin over the Dupuytren's cord, then using a small gauge needle
      inserted under the skin to cut the cord. This is repeated up the length of the cord to weaken
      it, allowing the surgeon to extend the finger and rupture the cord. CI involves the injection
      of collagenase (XiaflexÂ®), directly into the Dupuytren's cord. The patient then returns to
      see the surgeon within one week, has freezing placed in the hand, and the affected digit is
      extended to rupture the already weakened cord.

      The patient will be required to present to the hand therapist team for measurements of joint
      angles before and after the assigned treatment is performed. In order to measure treatment
      efficacy, study participants will be required to return for measurements of treated joints
      every 6 months. Lastly, participants will need to inform the performing surgeon or therapist,
      at follow-up visits of any complications they experience.

This is repeated up the length of the cord to weaken it, allowing an extension force to be applied over the finger to rupture the cord.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients requiring treatment for functionally limiting Dupuytren's disease involving
             the MCP and PIP joints, defined as MCP joint contracture 20-100 degrees, PIP joint
             contracture 20-80 degrees and positive table top test. Patients must be over 18 years
             of age to enroll in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had previous interventions of contracture presenting for treatment,
             in an effort to compare similar disease state and risk with each procedure.

          -  Disease involving DIP joint or thumb, as collagenase has not been approved for use in
             the thumb or DIP joints.

          -  Pregnant or nursing, although there is data indicating no detection of collagenase in
             patient serum following injection for Dupuytren's contractures, there is no data
             exploring the effects of collagenase on a fetus or infant.

          -  Anticoagulation therapy other than ASA (held 7 days prior to procedure), which is a
             recommendation by the manufacture of collagenase used in this study.
