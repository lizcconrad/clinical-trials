             invasive candidiasis) or diagnosed latent infection

          -  Participant has or has had a serious infection (example, sepsis, pneumonia or
             pyelonephritis), or have been hospitalized or received intravenous (IV) antibiotics
             for a serious infection during the 2 months prior to screening

             infection (eg, cytomegalovirus, pneumocystosis, and aspergillosis) prior to screening

          -  Participant has a history of active granulomatous infection, including histoplasmosis
             or coccidioidomycosis prior to screening

          -  If participant has had a chest radiograph within 3 months before study drug
             administration radiograph that shows an abnormality suggestive of a malignancy or
             current active infection, including tuberculosis (TB)
