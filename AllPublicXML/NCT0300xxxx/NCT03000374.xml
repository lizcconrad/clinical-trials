    <textblock>
      Patients with rectal adenocarcinoma of intermediate risk (defined by magnetic resonance
      imaging [MRI]), without mutations in KRAS, BRAF, NRAS and PI3KCA, who are candidates for
      preoperative treatment, will receive a preoperative Induction therapy with 12 weeks of
      panitumumab with mFOLFOX-6 to evaluate the efficacy in terms of pathologic complete response
      (pCR)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase II, nonrandomized single-arm trial of preoperative treatment with mFOLFOX-6 and
      panitumumab in an enriched population of patients with rectal adenocarcinoma of intermediate
      risk, screened by MRI, without mutations in KRAS, BRAF, NRAS and PI3K. All patients enrolled
      in the study will receive 12 weeks of the investigational product (mFOLFOX-6 with
      panitumumab) every 14 days for six cycles, unless unacceptable toxicity occurs or progression
      is detected. After this treatment, response will be evaluated by diffusion-weighted MRI and
      endoscopy. In the absence of disease progression, patients eligible for R0 resection will
      undergo total mesorectal excision (TME). After surgery, patients will receive mFOLFOX6 x 6
      cycles. In the case of intolerance to FOLFOX-panitumumab, disease progression or
      ineligibility for R0 resection, patients will receive chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine 825
      mg/m2 every 12 hours concomitantly with radiotherapy (RT) with a total dose of 50.4 Gy. At
      the end of this treatment, patients will undergo TME between 6 and 8 weeks after the end of
      chemoradiotherapy. If a patient withdraws consent and refuses to continue treatment, the
      patient will be followed up for 24 months, from the enrollment of the last patient in the
      trial, or until progression occurs, in order to assess disease-free survival. If a patient
      withdraws consent and refuses to continue participating in the study, follow-up evaluations
      must be discontinued.
