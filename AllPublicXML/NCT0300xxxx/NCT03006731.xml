  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of an exercise training strategy called
      high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to moderate intensity continuous exercise (MICE), on
      walking function and cardiovascular fitness in stroke patients. Hypothesis: HIIT will result
      in significantly greater benefit to fitness and mobility than MICE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a randomized design, the study will evaluate the effects of 3 HIT sessions combined
      with 2 MICE sessions per week on cardiovascular fitness and mobility compared to MICE
      training 5 days/week. Participants post-stroke will be randomly assigned to either MICE (5
      days per week (d∙wk-1)) or combined HIIT (3 d∙wk-1) with MICE (2 d∙wk-1). Both groups will be
      exercising 5 times per week (walking on a treadmill with harness for fall protection); 3
      times at the centre and 2 times at home. Outcome measures will be conducted before and after
      24 weeks of training.

    <measure>Change in Six Minute Walk Test</measure>

    <description>This test measures the distance that an individual can quickly walk in a period of 6 minutes on a flat surface. Participants will complete one trial with the gait aide prescribed to them. The distance will be recorded. Participants can stop and rest or discontinue to the test at any time.</description>

    <measure>VO2 during HIT and MICE</measure>
    <time_frame>9 weeks and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the ability of patients to reach critical intensity thresholds during HIT training and MICE and to examine dose-response associations, the acute effects (time spent above the critical intensity levels) will be measured using an ambulatory oxygen monitor. Ventilatory values will be measured using the CORTEX Biophysik MetaMax®3X portable gas analyzer recorded every 10 seconds for calculation of the time spent above the critical levels.</description>

    <measure>Change in Dual task gait velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This assessment will include four 10 metre walking tasks at maximal comfortable speed. Three minutes after the first two 10 metre trials, participants will be asked to repeat the walk with simultaneous serial 3 subtractions and then naming as many words as possible that begin with a certain letter of the alphabet [FAS]. The number of errors and time to complete the tasks will be recorded.</description>

    <description>High Intensity Interval Training patients will attend the centre 3 times/week for 24 weeks. All subjects will participate in MICE aerobic training 5 days/week in the first four weeks of the study to provide a foundation of fitness and endurance for the safe prescription of HIIT. Subsequently, the HIIT group will replace 3 MICE training days with 3 HIIT. HIIT sessions will include two 20 minute protocols; 30:60 second work:active rest ratio, and 120:180 second work:active rest ratio on a treadmill with a harness for fall protection. In addition to supervised exercise training (3 times/week), MICE will be conducted 2 times/week in the home/community, which has been shown to be both safe and effective</description>

    <description>Moderate Intensity Continuous Exercise patients will attend the centre 3 times/week for 24 weeks. Participants will be progressed to 30 to 60 minutes of continuous exercise at the heart rate that occurred at the anaerobic threshold on the exercise test. Participants will exercise on a treadmill with a harness ofr fall protection. In addition to supervised exercise training (3 times/week), MICE will be conducted 2 times/week in the home/community by both cohorts.</description>

    <description>Supervised HIIT sessions will be conducted on a treadmill at Toronto Rehab's Cardiac Rehabilitation and Secondary Prevention Program. During each of the three supervised HIIT sessions each week, subjects will be prescribed 2 protocols with a combination of short to moderate duration exercise of near maximal intensity alternating longer periods of active recovery. The total duration for each HIT session will be approximately 20 minutes with an additional 5 minutes warm-up and cool down period.</description>
