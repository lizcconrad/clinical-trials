  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the relative effectiveness of a Hispanic-specific
      eHealth intervention, &quot;e-Health Familias Unidas,&quot; in preventing and reducing drug use, sexual
      risk behaviors, and STIs among Hispanic youth in primary care. Families will be recruited
      through four pediatric primary care settings. Pediatric staff and research team members,
      including nurse assistants and mental health professionals, will implement eHealth Familias
      Unidas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To test the effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care in preventing drug use,
      unprotected sexual behavior, and STIs in a universal sample of Hispanic youth, a randomized
      trial design will be used with two levels of intervention (eHealth Familias Unidas Primary
      Care and Treatment as Usual) as the between subjects factor with five repeated measures
      assessments at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months post baseline as the within subject factor.

      Participants will be recruited from four primary care clinics: two located within the
      University of Miami Health System, Jackson Memorial Medical Center (South Florida's only
      county health hospital), and a general community clinic in Miami (not affiliated with either
      the University of Miami Health System or Jackson Memorial Medical Center). The first site is
      an academic pediatric clinic within the University of Miami's Health District. This practice
      serves mostly insured individuals. The second pediatric site is a University of Miami mobile
      clinic that provides medical care at no charge to uninsured youth. The third pediatric clinic
      is a public health clinic located within Jackson Memorial Hospital, South Florida's only
      public health hospital. This clinic serves mostly underinsured or uninsured youth. The fourth
      site is a private pediatric care clinic. In total, these pediatric clinics jointly serve over
      3,400 Hispanic between the ages of 12 -16 per year.

      A total of 456 Hispanic adolescents (between 12 to 16 years old) and their primary caregivers
      (expected age range 35-55) will be recruited. All adolescent participants will be of Hispanic
      ancestry, with both males and females represented. Women are likely to be over-represented
      among primary caregivers.

      AIM 1: Evaluate the effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas delivered in a primary care
      setting (referred hereafter as eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care) in preventing/reducing
      drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs;
      specifically gonorrhea and chlamydia).

      H1a: eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care will be effective, relative to Treatment as Usual,
      in reducing the frequency of (past 90-day) drug use in Hispanic adolescents over time H1b:
      eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care will be effective, relative to Treatment as Usual, in
      reducing the frequency of (past 90-day) unprotected sex in Hispanic adolescents over time
      H1c: eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care will be effective, relative to Treatment as Usual,
      in reducing STI incidence (specifically, the incidence of gonorrhea and chlamydia).

      AIM 2: Determine whether intervention effects are mediated by: 1) family functioning for drug
      use and unprotected sexual behavior and 2) family functioning and unprotected sexual behavior
      for STI incidence.

      H2a: Intervention effects on frequency of drug use will be partially mediated by improvements
      in family functioning over time H2b: Intervention effects on unprotected sex will be
      partially mediated by improvements in family functioning over time H2c: Intervention effects
      on STI incidence will be partially mediated by improvements in family functioning and
      decreases in unprotected sexual behavior over time.

      AIM 3: Estimate the cost effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care over a three
      year follow up.

      H3: eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care will be more cost effective than Treatment as Usual
      in reducing drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and STI incidence.

      As an exploratory aim, investigators will collect data on clinic level leadership and climate
      from the primary care clinic physicians and staff attitudes towards eHealth Familias Unidas
      from Primary Care facilitators. Specifically, investigators will explore whether clinic level
      leadership and climate will predict staff attitudes towards eHealth Familias Unidas Primary
      Care which will predict changes in the proposed outcomes.

As with face-to-face Familias Unidas, eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care aims to prevent drug use, sexual risk behaviors, and STIs by improving family functioning. Similar to face-to-face Familias Unidas, eHealth Familias Unidas is a multi-level intervention that targets risk and protective factors at the multiple systems affecting the youth and youths' family.</description>
