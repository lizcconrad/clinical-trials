  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme
      (CYP3A4) induction by rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of eribulin mesylate following
      intravenous (IV) administration in participants with advanced solid tumors. The secondary
      objectives of this study were to assess the safety of eribulin mesylate when co-administered
      with rifampicin and assess the safety and activity of eribulin mesylate as a single agent.

      The study consisted of 3 phases: Pre-Treatment, Treatment, and Extension. Pre-Treatment Phase
      had 2 periods: Screening and Baseline. Treatment Phase consisted of intensive PK assessment
      with eribulin mesylate given IV alone on Day 1 followed by eribulin mesylate given IV on Day
      15 with rifampicin given orally from Days 9 to 20. Extension Phase allowed eribulin mesylate
      treatment to continue for participants without progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.

    <description>Treatment phase: During Cycle 1, eribulin mesylate was administered as a 2 to 5 minute (min) intravenous (IV) infusion at 1.4 mg/m2 on Day 1 and Day 15 of 21-day cycle. During subsequent cycles, eribulin mesylate administration as a 2 to 5 min IV infusion at 1.4 mg/m2 on Day 1 and Day 8 of a 21-day cycle.
Extension phase: Eribulin mesylate was administered continuously as a 2 to 5 min IV infusion at 1.4 mg/m2 on Day 1 and Day 8 of 21-day cycles, as long as the Investigator considered eribulin mesylate therapy to be clinically appropriate.</description>
