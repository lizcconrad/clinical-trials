      The main purpose of this study is to examine the effects of infliximab on measures related to
      depression symptoms. Infliximab is also known by its brand name Remicade. Infliximab, or
      Remicade, is given to by an intravenous (IV) needle and is currently used to treat rheumatoid
      arthritis and Crohn's disease. Infliximab is thought to help these conditions because it
      reduces inflammation in the body. Infliximab (Remicade) reduces inflammation by blocking a
      chemical in the body called tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. This chemical produces
      inflammation. Inflammatory chemicals in the body like TNF-alpha appear to be increased in
      some people with major depression. Researchers believe that a drug like infliximab, which
      blocks TNF-alpha, may be helpful in treating depression.

      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which participants will be randomized to
      receive one infusion of infliximab or placebo. The study will assess neuroimaging measures of
      corticostriatal circuitry before and after a placebo-controlled pharmacologic blockade of
      inflammation in 80 depressed patients.

      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which participants will be randomized to
      receive one infusion of infliximab or placebo. This study will assess neuroimaging measures
      of corticostriatal circuitry before and after a placebo-controlled pharmacologic blockade of
      inflammation in 80 depressed patients (n = 40 per group) recruited to ensure high levels of
      peripheral inflammation (CRP &gt; 3mg/L).

      Primary aims are to evaluate whether 1) corticostriatal function during reward motivation and
      anticipation are associated with change in peripheral inflammation following pharmacologic
      blockade relative to placebo 2) the temporal dynamics of change in inflammation, gene-
      expression, reward motivation and reinforcement learning behavior and motivational symptoms
      assessed at baseline, and 24 hours, 3 days, 1 week and two weeks post infliximab infusion,
      and 3) test an integrative multi- level path model to determine whether change in
      corticostriatal circuitry following inflammation blockade mediates the relationship between
      change in inflammation and change in motivational anhedonia symptoms.

      These data will provide further validation of inflammatory cytokines as therapeutic targets
      for motivational symptoms in depression and will define symptom targets and biomarkers of
      response for future studies.

    <measure>Change in the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>The Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) is a self-administered, paper-pencil questionnaire with 14 items assessing four domains of pleasure response/hedonic experience: interest/pastimes, social interaction, sensory experience, and food/drink. The SHAPS is scored as the sum of the 14 items so that total scores ranged from 0 to 14. A higher total SHAPS score indicated higher levels of anhedonia. A cut-off score of 2 provides the best discrimination between &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;abnormal&quot; level of hedonic tone.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects will be fully ambulatory and in good medical health. Note: By DSM-IV
             definition of depression, subjects will report impairment in ability to carry out
             daily activities as a result of their major depression.

          -  Subjects will be able to read and understand English.

          -  Women must be postmenopausal (no menstrual period for a minimum of 1 year) or
             surgically sterilized and/or have a negative serum pregnancy test within thirty days
             of infusion (may be repeated closer to infusion date if deemed necessary by the PI or
             PI's designee) and negative urine pregnancy tests throughout the study (performed at
             each visit after the serum pregnancy test is completed).

          -  Men and women of childbearing potential must use adequate birth control measures
             (e.g., abstinence, oral contraceptives, intrauterine device, barrier method with
             spermicide, implantable or injectable contraceptives or surgical sterilization) for
             the duration of the study and should continue such precautions for 6 months after
             receiving the last infusion.

        The following are considered eligible according to the following tuberculosis (TB)
        screening criteria:

          -  Have no history of latent or active TB prior to screening.

          -  Have no signs or symptoms suggestive of active TB upon medical history and/or physical
             examination.

          -  Have had no recent close contact with a person with active TB or, if there has been
             such contact, will be referred to a physician specializing in TB to undergo additional
             evaluation to rule out infection. The candidate will be excluded from study
             participation if the specialist diagnoses active TB and or determines TB treatment is
             warranted.

          -  Have a chest radiograph (both posterior-anterior and lateral views), taken within 3
             months prior to the first administration of study agent and read by a qualified
             radiologist, with no evidence of current active TB or old inactive TB.

          -  History of negative PPD test; or documentation of a negative blood test
             (Quantiferon-TB-Gold). Any candidate testing positive for tuberculosis in the medical
             screening evaluation, will be excluded from study participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be excluded for any prior use of a TNF-alpha antagonist (i.e.

             any type

        Subjects will have had no infectious illnesses for one month prior to infusion. Should a
        subject develop an infection (i.e. flu, upper respiratory viral infection) between
        screening and infusion, the infusion will be delayed until 4 weeks after resolution of
        symptoms. As noted above, patients with a chronic infectious condition or with a past
        history of serious infectious complications will be excluded.

        Subjects will be excluded for any evidence on laboratory testing (or by history) of

             or lack of easy access.

          -  Use of any investigational drug within 30 days prior to screening or within 5
             half-lives of the investigational agent, whichever is longer.
