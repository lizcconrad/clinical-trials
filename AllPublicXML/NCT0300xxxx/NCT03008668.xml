    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to undertake a rigorous multicentre randomised controlled trial,
      comparing acupuncture on sensitized acupoints versus non-sensitized acupoints, to test if
      acupuncture on sensitized acupoints may result in improved treatment outcomes in patients
      with Knee osteoarthritis (KOA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients in the intervention group will receive acupuncture treatment on the most
      sensitive acupoints and all patients of the control group will receive acupuncture treatment
      on the least sensitive acupoints. Common practices and treatment period are similar with the
      intervention group.
