      -  Exercise programs in children and teenagers with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
           strengthens their physical fitness.

        -  Exercising improves muscular and functional mobility fitness after finalizing
           chemotherapy in children and teenagers diagnosed with ALL.

        -  Assess cardiological changes

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children and adolescents survivors of ALL will be randomly assigned to the intervention group
      and to the control group. A home-exercise program will be designed for 16 weeks with 55
      sessions, combining aerobic, strength and flexibility exercises of light and moderate
      intensity. The following tests will be performed to evaluate the effects of the intervention
      program: Echocardiography, Tape treadmill test using a ramp protocol to assess
      cardiorespiratory fitness, hand grip test to assess muscular grip strength, Timed Up test And
      Go Test (TUG) and Timed Up and Down Stairs Test (TUDS) to assess functional mobility, the sit
      and reach test to assess flexibility and a questionnaire to assess levels of physical
      activity. The control group will perform their usual physical activity
