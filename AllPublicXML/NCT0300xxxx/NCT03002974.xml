  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how anakinra relieves pain for patients with acute
      gout that cannot take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine. The
      patients will be divided in different treatment groups to compare anakinra to the available
      drug triamcinolone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to treatment at their first gout flare in the study. The first
      treatment period will be followed by an extension period during which the patients will
      receive the same treatment for any subsequent flares within 52 weeks of randomization of last
      patient in the study. The extension period for the individual patient in the study will be
      maximum two years (104 weeks). Each new flare treated will initiate a new series of study
      visits and assessments according to specified schedule of events. Only if a patient
      experience a new flare after Day 15 of the latest flare they can start a new treatment
      period. The comparison of primary interest is between anakinra (100 mg and 200 mg combined)
      and 40 mg triamcinolone, and as a secondary objective the 2 different doses of anakinra will
      be evaluated as well as assessment for subsequent flares.
