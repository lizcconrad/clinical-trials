  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The problem of interest is that doctors are looking for new antibiotic treatments for bone
      and joint infections. Treatment for bone and joint infection is not standardized, which
      allows a wide range of antibiotic therapy to potentially be given. A type of bacteria called
      S. aureus is the most common cause of bone and joint infection. Methicillin resistant S.
      aureus (MRSA) is a type of bacteria that is not killed by some antibiotics, and it is
      increasingly common in U.S. and non-U.S. medical centers. This problem will be studied by
      investigating whether an antibiotic called tedizolid is tolerable, safe and effective to
      treat bone and joint infections.

      The problem of interest is that doctors are looking for new antibiotic treatments for bone
      and joint infections. Treatment for bone and joint infection is not standardized, which
      allows a wide range of antibiotic therapy to potentially be given. A type of bacteria called
      S. aureus is the most common cause of bone and joint infection. Methicillin resistant S.
      aureus (MRSA) is a type of bacteria that is not killed by some antibiotics, and it is
      increasingly common in U.S. and non-U.S. medical centers. Trauma-associated bone and joint
      infection is also a common problem. Victims of major trauma often suffer bone fractures,
      which require temporary or permanent use of metal or other synthetic devices such as
      external-fixation pins, plates, and screws. These synthetic devices can also get infected and
      cause bone and joint infections.

      This problem will be studied by investigating whether an antibiotic called tedizolid is
      tolerable, safe and effective to treat bone and joint infections. Tedizolid is a new
      FDA-approved antibiotic, and can be given through the bloodstream via an IV or orally in the
      form of a pill. Tedizolid has less side effects compared to linezolid and is effective
      against types of bacteria like S. aureus. Other research also suggests that the side effects
      associated with long-term therapy of older types of antibiotics may not be found with
      tedizolid.

      This study will advance scientific knowledge of antibiotic treatments for bone and joint
      infections. Given the large and increasing burden of disease of bone and joint infection and
      the increasing acceptability of oral antibiotics for its management, tedizolid holds promise
      as a good option for patients with bone and joint infection. Harbor-UCLA Medical Center is a
      large medical center in the County of Los Angeles, the most populous County in the United
      States. The Infectious Disease consult service sees many bone and joint infections. Use of
      prolonged antibiotics is common in this setting. The investigators believe tedizolid
      addresses the unmet need for an oral antibiotic that is well-tolerated and efficacious for
      use as a prolonged therapy for bone and joint infection.

    <description>Study Hypothesis: Tedizolid is effective for the treatment of bone and joint infection. Specifically, cure will be defined as no need for further antibiotics beyond the originally planned duration (i.e., 6 weeks for non-device associated bone and joint infection or until hardware removal for subjects with implants). Unplanned surgical procedures prompted by inadequate infection control will be categorized as treatment failure. We will also measure long-term efficacy by performing a phone survey 3 months after completion of antibiotics. Recurrence of signs or symptoms of bone and joint infection will be considered a long-term treatment failure.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment of bone and joint infection in which therapy for Gram positive organisms is
             documented or suspected, as determined by the treating physician and treatment of at
             least 4 weeks is planned. Bone and joint infection and trauma-associated bone and
             joint infection will defined clinically using radiologic (e.g., MRI) and/or surgical
             (e.g., intra-operative findings)

          -  Aged between 18 years and 85 years.

          -  Plans to treat bone and joint infection in outpatient setting.

          -  No limited planned course of antibiotics (i.e., no indefinite treatment plans for
             chronic suppression). Co-administration of other antibiotics that target other
             causative or potentially causative organisms (e.g., fluoroquinolones) is acceptable.

          -  Able to come to the research clinic for study follow-up visits for the study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Planned prolonged hospitalization (&gt; 1 week).

          -  Pregnancy (all female subjects of childbearing age will be given a pregnancy test
             prior to enrollment) or breast feeding. If a women is of childbearing potential, she
             must consistently use an acceptable method of contraception (IUD, injectable
             contraceptive, birth control patch, OCP, barrier method, abstinence) from baseline
             through the course of antibiotics (4-12 weeks). If a male patient's sexual partner is
             of childbearing potential, the male patient must acknowledge that they will
             consistently use an acceptable method of contraception as defined above from baseline
             through the course of antibiotics (4-12 weeks).

          -  Comorbidities that, in the opinion of the investigator, are uncontrolled (e.g.,
             diabetes, hypertension, psychiatric disease).

          -  Peripheral or optic neuropathy.

          -  Underlying hematologic cytopenias (e.g., baseline thrombocytopenia, or severe anemia,
             or leukopenia) as determined by the following limits from a baseline CBC/CMP obtained
             within the past 14 days. Note that if a CBC has not been performed within the past 14
             days, a CBC will be performed on the day of enrollment prior to any study drug being
             administered to ensure the patient does not meet exclusion criteria. Cytopenias are
             defined as:

               1. Hemoglobin (Hgb) &lt; 8.0g/dL

               2. WBC &lt; 4,000 k/cumm

               3. Platelets &lt; 150,000 k/cumm

          -  Severe hepatic dysfunction as defined by liver function tests (ALT, ALP, AST, total
             bilirubin) &gt; 3.0 times the upper limit of normal. as determined by the following
             limits from a baseline CMP obtained within the past 7 days. If a CMP has not been
             performed within the past 7 days, baseline levels may be used from a CMP performed
             within the past 2 months as long as another CMP is performed on the day of enrollment
             and the subject's levels are within the following limits.

          -  Hypersensitivity to tedizolid or other oxazolidinone-class antibiotics or similar
             compounds.

          -  Ongoing antibiotic-associated colitis.

          -  A diet high in tyramine-containing foods such as pickled or fermented meats and
             cheeses, wine, or avocados per investigator discretion.

          -  Concurrent use of sodium picosulfate (brand names: Sodipic Picofast, Laxoberal,
             Laxoberon, Purg-Odan, Picolax, Guttalax, Namilax, Pico-Salax and Prepopik).

          -  Previous participation in the study.

          -  Use of tedizolid for any condition in the past 3 months.

          -  Any other medical, psychological, or social condition that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would prevent the patient from fully participating in the study or would
             represent a concern for study compliance or constitute a safety concern to the
             patient.
