      This study will explore the long-term effects of exercise training on body composition,
      cardiorespiratory fitness, and energy metabolism in the community-dwelling elderly with sleep
      disturbances

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will be conducted in three years:

      In the first year,investigators will explore the correlation of sleep parameters, dietary
      behavior and body composition in community-dwelling elders. Two hundred elders will be
      recruited to receive the actigraph accelerometer recording, sleep quality questionnaire,
      bio-electrical impedance analysis, heart rate variability analysis, cognitive and depression
      evaluation.

      Secondly, the study will evaluate the efficacy and possible mechanisms of a 24-week exercise
      training for sleep disturbances patients. Sixty patients with sleep disturbances elders will
      be randomized to exercise group or control group. Participants in the exercise group will
      receive aerobic and resistance exercise 3 times per week for 24 weeks. The controls will
      receive sleep hygiene education and consultation. All measurements will be performed as
      described before.

      Finally, all the 260 elders participating in this study will receive 12-month follow-up
      assessments to explore the longitudinal impact of sleep disturbances on cardiorespiratory
      function, body composition and metabolic function, and long-term effect of exercise training
      on sleep disturbances patients. Investigators expect elders with poor sleep quality have
      lower level of health-related fitness and metabolic function; exercise training is effective
      to improve sleep quality, metabolic function and general health in the elders with sleep
      disturbances, and the effect can be sustained for a long period.

    <description>The conditioning period (24 weeks) of the exercise intervention was under the supervision of an exercise physiologist. The conditioning protocol included aerobic exercise sessions 3 times per week with 70-85% of maximal heart rate(max HR) for 30 mins and resistance sessions 3 times per week with an intensity of 80% of one-repetition maximum(1RM), 3 sets of 8 repetitions maximum. Each participant will measured the borg rating of perceived exertion scale and heart rate monitor during exercise. Exercise sessions were conducted in the afternoon (3-5 PM).</description>
