  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the communication and data sharing between the
      primary care physician and the nephrologist about patients with chronic kidney disease. Also
      therapeutic interventions that change behavior and telemonitoring of the blood pressure will
      be explored and compared to the usual care. The most important aim of this study is to
      improve the quality of care for the patient with chronic kidney disease in cooperation with
      the primary care physician and the nephrologist.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through questionnaires with primary care physicians, nephrologists from the University
      Hospitals of Leuven and patients with chronic kidney disease, the problems will be known.

      After the exploration there will be an intervention with patients who meet the in- and
      exclusion criteria. Around 150-200 patients will be included with a 1:2 randomisation in the
      control and intervention group. The relevant clinical data and the factors of lifestyle will
      be questioned at the baseline.

      The intervention group will receive individualized therapy by a nurse, for example to quit
      smoking, to eat healthier and to do more physical activities. This therapy is based on the
      most important risk factors and will be determined before the start of the therapy. Further
      on, these patients will also be motivated to take their blood pressure more frequently by
      using a telemonitoring system.
