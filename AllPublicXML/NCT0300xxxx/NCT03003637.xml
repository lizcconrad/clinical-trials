  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IB/II trial to examine feasibility and safety of checkpoint blockade (aPD1
      with or without aCTLA4) neoadjuvant to standard of care (SOC) in advanced stage head and neck
      squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a patient population in need for improved clinical outcome
      and in tumors likely to respond to neoadjuvant aPD1 and aCTLA4. In addition, with this
      research protocol the potential impact of intratumoral hypoxia on tumor infiltrating
      lymphocyte (TIL) abundance, differentiation and effector function will be assessed, and the
      potentially divergent effects of T cell checkpoint blockade in areas of hypoxia and normoxia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The phase Ib is designed as 3 + 3, with primary objective feasibility and toxicity.

      Of Note: endpoints must be reached in all 6 patients of cohort 1 and 2, before start of the
      next cohort.

      The phase II is designed as a single arm design with primary endpoint efficacy.

      In phase Ib, two cohorts will be used (cohort 1: nivolumab only and cohort 2: nivolumab and
      ipilimumab neoadjuvant to surgery) to define which neoadjuvant immunotherapy regimen will be
      taken towards the expansion cohort 3.

      Thirty-two patients will be treated with nivolumab (240 mg flat dose, week 1 and week 3,
      twice in total) as a single agent OR the combination of ipilimumab (1 mg/kg) + nivolumab
      (240mg flat dose) in week 1, and nivolumab 240mg flat dose in week 3, neoadjuvant to SOC
      (surgery with or without adjuvant (C)RT).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Distant metastasis

          -  Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects are permitted to enroll if
             they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to
             autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring
             systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external
             trigger.

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or
             topical corticosteroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone
             equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.

          -  Prior systemic treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4
             antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell costimulation or
             immune checkpoint pathways;

          -  Patients will be excluded if they are positive test for hepatitis B virus surface
             antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV antibody) indicating
             acute or chronic infection;

          -  Patients will be excluded if they have known history of testing positive for human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS);

          -  Allergies and Adverse Drug Reaction: history of allergy to study drug components,
             history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody.

          -  Underlying medical conditions that, in the Investigator's opinion, will make the
             administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the interpretation of toxicity
             determination or adverse events;

          -  Concurrent medical condition requiring the use of immunosuppressive medications, or
             immunosuppressive doses of systemic or absorbable topical corticosteroids;

             times before study inclusion;

          -  Pregnant or nursing.

          -  As there is potential for hepatic toxicity with nivolumab or nivolumab/ipilimumab
             combinations, drugs with a predisposition to hepatotoxicity should be used with
             caution in patients treated with nivolumab-containing regimen.

          -  In those patients who have a contraindication for cisplatin chemotherapy, Cetuximab
             might be used as a radiosensitizer for radiotherapy if adjuvant treatment is deemed
