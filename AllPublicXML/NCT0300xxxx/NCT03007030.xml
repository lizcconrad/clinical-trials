  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin) can
      help to control mesothelioma. The safety of this drug will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Brentuximab vedotin is FDA approved and commercially
      available for the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma. It is
      considered investigational to use brentuximab vedotin in patients with mesothelioma. The
      study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 50 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      There are 21 days (about 3 weeks) in each study cycle.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive brentuximab
      vedotin by vein over about 30 minutes on Day 1 of every cycle.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on this study will be over after you have completed follow-up (described
      below).

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of every cycle:

        -  You will have a physical exam

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests

      Every 6 weeks while you are on study, you will have a PET-CT scan to check the status of the
      disease.

      Follow-Up:

      The study doctor or study team will follow you up with you about 30 days after your last dose
      of brentuximab vedotin by either reviewing your medical record or calling you to learn if you
      have had any side effects.

      You will continue to have these follow-ups at 3 months, 6 months, and then every 6 months
      after that while you are on study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

          2. Female subject is either: a. post-menopausal for at least one year before the
