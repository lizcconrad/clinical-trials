  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is a major oral health problem which leads to the progressive destruction of
      periodontal ligament and alveolar bone with pocket formation, recession or both. The ultimate
      goal of periodontal therapy is to regenerate the lost periodontal tissue. The most common
      form of regenerative periodontal therapy is the use of bone grafts which stimulate bone
      formation by the processes of osteoinduction and osteoconduction.

      Statins are a group of lipid lowering drugs which inhibit bone resorption by inhibition of
      the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. They also stimulate new bone formation by local stimulation of
      BMP-2, a major bone growth regulatory factor. They also have anti-inflammatory and anti
      oxidant properties.

      Very few studies exist evaluating the beneficiary effects of grafts if combined with the
      statins which might enhance the regeneration by bone grafts.

      Hence, the present study was carried out in an attempt to comparatively evaluate clinically
      and radiologically, the efficacy of atorvastatin gel as an adjunct to allograft in the
      treatment of intrabony defects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 26 intrabony defects in patients with chronic periodontitis as diagnosed by
      radiographs, were selected for the study after taking an informed consent. The selected sites
      were randomized in 2 treatment groups.

      Group I - sites were treated with allograft (DFDBA) Group II - sites were treated with
      allograft (DFDBA) in combination with Atorvastatin gel.

      Clinical parameters like probing depth and clinical attachment level and radiological
      assessment of intrabony defect fill were done at baseline and 3 and 6 months postoperatively.
