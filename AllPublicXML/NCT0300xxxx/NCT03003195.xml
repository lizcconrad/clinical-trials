      The purpose of this research is to compare the effects of using a new experimental vaccine
      with standard treatment in treating metastatic cancer.

    <textblock>
      After signing Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved consent, subjects with metastatic
      cancer will be enrolled. The vaccine doses will be prepared and dispensed by the University
      of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Pharmacy following the manufacturer's instructions.
      Subjects will receive 1.0 mL subcutaneous injections of the vaccine on 4 separate occasions.
      The vaccine will be administered at rotating sites on the limbs or abdomen. The study will
      last approximately 12 months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects of all races with clinical Stage IV cancer of any type, staged according to
             American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC), sixth edition, receiving any line of
             standard treatment for the specific cancer and with stable disease or better for at
             least two months will be invited to participate.

          -  Subjects of all races with clinical Stage IV cancer of any type, staged according to
             American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC), sixth edition, who have no standard
             treatment options for the specific cancer (Patients whose standard of care consists of
             watchful waiting) and who fulfill the other eligibility criteria will be invited to
             participate.

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease.

          -  Patients with bone-only disease will be allowed to participate.

          -  Ages 18 years and older.

          -  ECOG Performance status 0, 1 or 2.

          -  White blood cells (WBC) count ≥ 3,000/mm3 within 3 weeks prior to registration

          -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 prior to registration

          -  Serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) ≤ 2 x institutional upper limit (IUL)
             of normal obtained within 3 weeks prior to registration or Aspartate aminotransferase
             test (AST) ≤ 2 x institutional upper limit (IUL) of normal obtained within 3 weeks
             prior to registration

          -  Bilirubin ≤ 2 x institutional upper limit (IUL) of normal obtained within 3 weeks
             prior to registration.

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.8 mg/dl obtained within 3 weeks prior to registration.

          -  Must sign an informed consent document approved by UAMS Institutional Review Board
             (IRB).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active infection requiring treatment with antibiotics.

          -  Existing diagnosis or history of organic brain syndrome that precludes participation
             in the full protocol.

          -  Existing diagnosis or history of significant impairment of basal cognitive function
             that might preclude participation in the full protocol.

          -  Other current malignancies. Subjects with prior history at any time of any in situ
             cancer, including lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast, cervical cancer in situ,
             atypical melanocytic hyperplasia or Clark I melanoma in situ, or basal or squamous
             skin cancer are eligible, provided they are disease-free of these other malignancies
             at the time of registration. Subjects with other malignancies - other than the one for
             which they are being treated - are eligible if they have been continuously disease
             free (from the old cancer) for ≥ 5 years prior to the time of registration.

          -  Existing diagnosis or history of autoimmune disorders or conditions of
             immunosuppression. This includes, but is not limited to, being treated with
             corticosteroids, including oral steroids (i.e. prednisone, dexamethasone [except when
             used as an antiemetic in standard therapy]), continuous use of topical steroid creams
             or ointments or any steroid-containing inhalers. Subjects who have been on systemic
             steroids will require a 6-week washout period. Subjects who discontinue the use of
             these classes of medication for at least 6 weeks prior to registration are eligible
             if, in the judgment of the treating physician, the subject is not likely to require
             these classes of drugs during the treatment period. Replacement doses of steroids for
             subjects with adrenal insufficiency are allowed.

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding, due to the unknown effects of peptide/mimotope vaccines
             on a fetus or infant. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine
             pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study drug, and
             must be counseled to use an accepted and effective method of contraception while on
             treatment and for a period of 18 months after completing or discontinuing treatment.
             Accepted methods include oral contraceptives, barrier method, IUDs, and abstinence.

          -  Any other significant medical or psychiatric conditions which, in the opinion of the
             enrolling investigator, may interfere with consent or compliance of the treatment.

          -  Patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors.
