    <textblock>
      Cesarean section is one of the most frequently performed major operations worldwide. It
      accounts for between 1% and 70% of deliveries depending on the facilities or country
      assessed. In Egypt, the cesarean section rate is 22%, with higher rates seen in private
      hospitals. In 2015 ,incidence of cesarean section rate in Woman Health Hospital in Assiut
      university is 51.3% of all deliveries.

      Different Operational techniques For cesarean section have been defined aimed at reducing
      surgical time, making the surgery easier and more efficient, lowering costs,decreasing the
      risk of adverse effects and postoperative morbidity, as well as length of hospital stay.

      Also, Intraoperative blood loss is one of important complications during cesarean section. A
      systematic review included twenty one studies, in 2011, revealed that increase incidence of
      intraoperative blood loss and blood transfusion with increase number of cesarean
      deliveries.also anemia in the pregnancy increase maternal morbidities included intraoperative
      blood loss. In Egypt, prevalence of Iron deficiency anemia among pregnant women about 51% of
      pregnant women.

      After baby born by cesarean section and the placenta has been extracted, uterine incision is
      sutured either by temporary removal of the uterus from the abdominal cavity (exteriorization
      of the uterus) to facilitate uterine incision repair or it is repaired within the abdominal
      cavity (in situ repair). There had been few randomized controlled trials comparing
      intraoperative and postoperative morbidity following exteriorization of the uterus with
      non-exteriorization. The conclusions drawn from these trials have been conflicting.
