      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a multi-professional
      theoretically based family centered intervention, The Traumatic Brain Injury Family System
      Intervention (TBIFSI), for the family members and TBI patients in improving family dynamics
      and functioning. The intervention will be provided in collaboration with the municipal
      rehabilitation service. The intervention group will be compared with a control group
      receiving treatment as usual, defined as an individually tailored multidisciplinary approach,
      and the family members will attend one ongoing psycho-educational group session of 2.5 hour
      provided by Oslo University Hospital (OUH).
