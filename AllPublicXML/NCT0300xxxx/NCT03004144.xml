  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a cross-sectional study investigating the impact of assistive forces applied by
      the body-weight support system &quot;the FLOAT&quot; on the study participants. The study is conducted
      at the University Hospital Balgrist in Zurich over a period of around 3 years. During this
      time measurements on approximately 120 able bodied subjects and 20 patients with an
      incomplete spinal cord injury will take place. The study participants are invited for a
      single visit of around 140 min duration to the University Hospital Balgrist. During this
      visit the study participants will repeatedly perform various activities of daily living (free
      walking, standing up and sitting down, stair climbing and balancing) with and without
      assistive forces from the body-weight support system. While performing the tasks, the study
      participants' motions and muscle activities will be measured to evaluate the naturalness of
      their movements. In addition, the collected data permits us to compare different movement
      patterns and make conclusions about effective and optimal movement support. Obtaining this
      knowledge will help us to shape the therapy of these activities to be tailored to the
      patients and to train these movements with the help of the FLOAT under optimal conditions.
