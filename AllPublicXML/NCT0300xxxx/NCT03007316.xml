  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An array of soft tissue augmentation techniques have been employed concomitant to implant
      placement, as free connective tissue grafts or pedicle grafts for keratinized tissue
      thickening in attempt not only to augment the soft tissue for better resistance to
      inflammation and improved esthetic stability, but to preserve buccal bone thickness as well.

      Results obtained from the literature were controversial regarding the need of soft tissue
      augmentation to curb buccal bone resorption and preserve pink esthetics. Scarce literature
      was found, that monitored the ridge alterations following implant placement.

      Our study will monitor the effect of soft tissue augmentation on soft tissue esthetics and
      buccal bone resorption during the process of remodeling in a measurable way.
