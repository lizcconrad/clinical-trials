    <textblock>
      In this prospective study the investigators seek to evaluate clinical outcomes after
      repairing the defect of intervertebral disc with autologous BMSC/gelatin sponge during
      microendoscopic discectomy for participants of lumbar disc herniation.

      The participants with lumbar disc herniation diseases are treated by Microendoscopic
      discectomy, and they are divided into four groups depend on whether the defect is repaired
      with Autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cell (BMSC)/gelatin sponge or not and whether the defect is
      sutured or not. In the first group,the defect of intervertebral disc is repaired with
      Autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cell (BMSC)/gelatin sponge and sutured. In the second group, the
      defect of intervertebral disc is repaired with autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cell
      (BMSC)/gelatin sponge but not sutured after discectomy. In the third group, the defect of
      intervertebral disc is sutured but not repaired with autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cell
      (BMSC)/gelatin sponge after discectomy. In the four group, the defect of intervertebral disc
      is neither sutured nor repaired with autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cell (BMSC)/gelatin sponge
      after discectomy.

    <measure>Changes from baseline in Oswestry Disability Index(ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-op 3 months, 6 months,12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The self-completed questionnaire contains ten topics concerning intensity of pain, lifting, ability to care for oneself, ability to walk, ability to sit, sexual function, ability to stand, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel.Each topic category is followed by 6 statements describing different potential scenarios in the patient's life relating to the topic. The patient then checks the statement which most closely resembles their situation. Each question is scored on a scale of 0-5 with the first statement being zero and indicating the least amount of disability and the last statement is scored 5 indicating most severe disability. The scores for all questions answered are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100). Zero is equated with no disability and 100 is the maximum disability possible.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, post-op 3 months, 6 months,12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self reported pain using a 10-point visual analogue scale (0=no pain;10=pain as bad as can be)</description>

    <measure>Changes from baseline in The Short Form (36) Health Survey(SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-op 3 months, 6 months,12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <description>The Pfirrmann grading system assesses degenerated intervertebral discs by MRI for the asymmetry in disc structure, distinction of the nucleus and the annulus, signal intensity of intervertebral discs and height of intervertebral discs and assigns grade I to V for disc degeneration。</description>
