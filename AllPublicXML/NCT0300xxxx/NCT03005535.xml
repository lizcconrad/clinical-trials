  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized clinical trial carried out on subjects with suboptimal control of
      cholesterolemia who will consume 30 g per day of a vitaminized corn oil (plus B6 and E
      vitamins), in order to evaluate the effects on lipid profile, endothelial function and PCSK9

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to assess the mid term effects of vitaminized corn oil on endothelial function and
      on early markers of functional damage of the arterial wall, moderately hypercholesterolemic
      subjects will be supplemented for 8 weeks with 30 g/day of both a vitaminized corn oil (plus
      B6 and E vitamins) or olive oil. The two intervention periods will be spaced by a 4 week
      washout period.
