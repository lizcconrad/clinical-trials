  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial attempts to investigate whether the dosage (frequency) has an effect on the
      treatment efficacy and cognitive outcomes of magnetic seizure therapy (MST) among
      schizophrenia patients. Half of the participants will be recruited to receive 25 Hz MST,
      while the other half will be recruited to 50 Hz MST.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is likely to be an alternative options to electroconvulsive
      therapy (ECT).Widespread stimulation of cortical and subcortical regions is inevitable for
      ECT since the substantial impedance of the scalp and skull shuts most of the electrical
      stimulus away from the brain. Nevertheless, magnetic pulses are capable to focus the stimulus
      to a specific area of the brain because they can pass the scalp and skull without resistance.
      In Addition, electric current will penetrate into deeper structures, while magnetic stimulus
      are only capable to reach a depth of a few centimeters. As a consequence, MST are able to
      generate focus stimuli on superficial regions of the cortex while ECT can't, which may give
      MST the capability to produce comparable therapeutic benefits with the absence of apparent
      cognitive side effects. Though high dose (frequency) MST is gaining popularity, there is no
      evidences supporting its superiority over low dose (frequency) MST either on efficacy,
      safety, or seizure quality.
