  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hematologic malignancy is a tumor of myeloid or lymphatic cells that affects lymph nodes with
      the involvement of blood, bone marrow or other organs.There are various treatment options for
      hematological malignancies ranging from follow-up to single or multiple agent chemotherapy,
      radiotherapy, immunotherapy and autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantations (HSCT). The general recommendation for patients is to relax and avoid
      intense exercise, regardless of the devastating consequences of neglecting physical exercise.
      Patients also go to relaxation by reducing their activity to avoid fatigue, which leads to
      loss of muscle strength and endurance. As a consequence of all, fatigue, vomiting, weight
      loss, anemia, depression, decreased aerobic capacity, muscle weakness, decreased physical
      function and poor quality of life are observed in HSCT recipients. It has been shown that
      physical exercises improve oxygen consumption, depression and fatigue, cardiorespiratory
      fitness, muscle strength and physical well-being in patients with hematologic malignancies
      who are at stages of various treatments. In literature, effects of upper extremity aerobic
      exercise training have been investigated in patients with spinal cord injury, neuromuscular
      diseases, claudication, hypertension, multiple sclerosis, heart failure, paraplegic patients
      and healthy individuals. Results of these studies has shown that upper extremity aerobic
      exercise training improves walking distance, increases oxygen pulse, muscle strength and
      endurance of upper extremity. No study was observed to investigate the effects of upper
      extremity aerobic exercise training on exercise capacity and quality of life in HSCT
      recipients, as we know. For this reason, our aim is to investigate the effects of upper
      extremity aerobic exercise training on exercise capacity and quality of life in HSCT
      recipients.

      Minimum 30 allogeneic and autologous HSCT recipients (˃100 days past post-transplant status)
      will be included. Before and after 6-week upper extremity aerobic exercise training, maximal
      and submaximal exercise capacity, respiratory and peripheral muscle strength, pulmonary
      functions, physical activity, dyspnea and fatigue perception, anxiety, depression and quality
      of life were evaluated. Primary outcome measurements were exercise capacity and quality of
      life , secondary outcomes were respiratory and peripheral muscle strength, pulmonary
      functions, physical activity, dyspnea and fatigue perception, anxiety and depression.
