      function and on symptoms benefits in comparison with placebo.

      The purpose of this study is to obtain information on the effects of two doses of CHF6001 on
      sputum and blood biomarkers of inflammation in subjects with symptomatic COPD with moderate,
      severe airflow limitation and with chronic bronchitis. The efficacy of the treatment will
      also be measured using forced oscillometry technique and spirometry. Safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics will be evaluated.
