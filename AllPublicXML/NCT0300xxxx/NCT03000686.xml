  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to examine how GSK2586881, a recombinant human ACE2 peptide,
      modulates the acute hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) response in healthy volunteers.
      The study will be single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled and double blind (sponsor
      open). Subjects will be randomized to receive a single intravenous (IV) dose of GSK2586881 or
      placebo (saline) in a crossover design. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the
      effect of a single IV dose of GSK2586881 on the HPV response in healthy volunteers during
      exercise under hypoxic conditions. Approximately 35 subjects will be enrolled for a maximum
      of 56 days.

          -  Between 18 and 40 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent.

          -  Healthy as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee based on a
             medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests
             and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory
             parameter(s) which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion
             criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included
             only if the investigator [in consultation with the Medical Monitor if required] agree
             and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and
             will not interfere with the study procedures. Note: Screened subjects with laboratory
             values outside of the normal range may be repeated once for inclusion into the study
             at the discretion of the Investigator.

          -  Screening echocardiogram of good quality, without clinically significant
             abnormalities, and with mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation sufficient for the
             reliable estimation of PASP, as determined by the echocardiography core laboratory or
             responsible cardiologist. Screening PASP within the normal range according to site
             standards.

          -  Subjects have not resided at an altitude &gt;1500 meter (m) for more than 7 days in the
             last 4 month

          -  Able to complete all study procedures.

          -  Any contraindication (orthopedic, cardiac etc.) to perform exercise on a bicycle
             ergometer.

          -  Body weight 50 to 100 kilogram (kg) (inclusive).

          -  Male or female (non Child Bearing Potential): Male subjects with female partners of
             child bearing potential must comply with the following contraception requirements from
             the time of first dose of study medication until at least five half-lives of study
             medication OR for a cycle of spermatogenesis following five terminal half-lives after
             the last dose of study medication. a. Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia. b.
             Male condom plus partner use of one of the contraceptive options (Contraceptive
             subdermal implant, Intrauterine device or intrauterine system, Oral Contraceptive-
             either combined or progestogen alone, Injectable progestogen, Contraceptive vaginal
             ring, Percutaneous contraceptive patches). This is an all-inclusive list of those
             methods that meet the following GSK definition of highly effective: having a failure
             rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly and, when
             applicable, in accordance with the product label. For non-product methods (e.g., male
             sterility), the investigator determines what is consistent and correct use. The GSK
             definition is based on the definition provided by the International Conference on
             Harmonization (ICH).The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects
             understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. A female subject is
             eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative urine human
             chorionic gonadotrophin [hCG] test), not lactating, and the following condition
             applies: Non-reproductive potential defined as, 1. Pre-menopausal females with one of
             the following (Documented tubal ligation, Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion
             procedure with follow-up confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion, Hysterectomy,
             Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy). 2. Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
             spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous
             follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels consistent with menopause
             (refer to laboratory reference ranges for confirmatory levels)]. Females on hormone
             replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to
             use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their
             HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment. The investigator is responsible for
             ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in study protocol which

             half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication and
             throughout the study, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and/or GSK Medical
             Monitor (if needed) the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or
             compromise subject safety.
