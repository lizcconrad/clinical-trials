      This is a multi-center, prospective, single-arm observational study to evaluate the
      real-world efficacy and safety of intra-arterial treatment for acute ischemic stroke patients
      using Revive SE device on the basis of standardised medical treatment.The device selection
      before treatment is based upon doctors who are blinded to the protocol. The primary outcomes
      are reperfusion rate immediately after intervention (mTICI score ≥II b ) and mRS Score at 90
      days after intervention.
