      This study forms an initial phase of work aimed at developing a learning health system (LHS),
      whereby data relating to asthma is extracted from patient electronic health records (EHRs)
      across Scotland, analysed to explore variations in clinical practice and then shared with
      general practices to highlight any improvements that can be made so that they can better
      support people with asthma.

      If successful, the investigators hope to progress to the main quality improvement phase
      involving an increased number of practices and then incrementally build this up to cover the
      whole of Scotland.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The UK has amongst the highest rates of asthma in the world as well as some of the poorest
      health outcomes from asthma.

      Investigations into asthma deaths in the UK have found that the way patients were managed in
      the time leading up to their death could be improved significantly and half of asthma deaths
      are potentially avoidable. For most people with asthma, symptoms can come and go and
      sometimes be erratic. To prevent these symptoms, there is a window of opportunity to
      intervene with the appropriate care. This window occurs between when someone experiences
      early symptoms like night cough or wheeze and when they experience a full-blown asthma
      attack.

      Most people with asthma receive care primarily in their general practice. General practices
      have a history of using health information technology to care for their patients. The use of
      this technology over time has resulted in the creation of rich electronic healthcare data.
      Through this rich data there are opportunities to create a system whereby clinical management
      can be benchmarked and improvements highlighted.

      This study forms an initial phase of work aimed at developing a learning health system (LHS),
      whereby data relating to asthma is extracted from patient electronic health records (EHRs)
      across Scotland, analysed to explore variations in clinical practice and then shared with
      general practices to highlight any improvements that can be made so that they can better
      support people with asthma.

      If successful, the investigators hope to progress to the main quality improvement phase
      involving an increased number of practices and then incrementally build this up to cover the
      whole of Scotland.
