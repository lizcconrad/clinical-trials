  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I study of the bioavailability and safety of BPM31510
      administered orally in healthy subjects dosed 3 times daily for 14 days. The last study dose
      is administered on Day 15 (one morning dose only). The study will consist of 25 subjects.

    <textblock>
      Study subjects will be admitted to the clinic on Day -1. All subjects will self-administer
      the Day 1 doses of study drug under supervision of the clinic staff. Doses of 3200 mg will be
      administered three times per day before meals.

      Dosing will continue for an additional 14 days on an outpatient basis with Day 5 morning dose
      and the last study dose on Day 15 to be administered at the clinic (one morning dose, is
      given on Day 15).

      On Days 1, 2, 5 and 15, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) sampling will be
      performed 30 minutes prior to the first dose, and 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours after the first dose
      at all visits with an additional PK draw on Day 1 at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 after the second dose.
      Urine for PK/PD will be collected pre-dose on Day 1, Day 2, Day 5 and Day 15. At all visits
      (on Days 1, 2, 5 and at the final dose on Day 15), samples will be collected for chemistry,
      Complete Blood Count (CBC), International normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PT),
      partial thromboplastin time (PTT), cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL), and high
      density lipoprotein (HDL), and vitamin K level. Blood samples for PK/PD will be collected 30
      minutes prior to the morning dose on Day 5 and Day 15 and also at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours
      after dosing. Lab samples (chemistry, etc.), will also be drawn at the time of the first
      PK/PD draw on Day 5 and Day 15.

      A phone interview will be conducted no fewer than 25 days and no more than 35 days after the
      last dose on Day 15 to collect information on concomitant medications and adverse events
      Graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0.
