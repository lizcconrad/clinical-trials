    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the CD16- monocyte/CD16+ monocyte ratio
      could help predict the prognosis of DLBCL and PTCL.

      The investigators plan to prospectively involve 100 non-hodgekin lymphoma patients, including
      50 diffuse large B cell lymphomas and 50 peripheral T cell lymphomas without previous
      treatment from Peking Union Medical College Hospital.

      The following parameters were collected: age, sex, subtype, Eastern Cooperative Oncology
      Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), Ann Arbor stage (I-IV), presence of B symptoms, number
      and type of involved sites, prognostic index including International Prognostic Index (IPI)
      for DLBCLand PIT for PTCL based on medical record review.

      All patients would have regular treatment and follow up in PUMCH. During the follow up,
      treatment response was evaluated by enhanced computed tomography or PET-CT.

      The peripheral blood would be collected. The Cytodiff flow cytometric technique would be used
      to test 16 leukocyte subpopulations from peripheral blood at the time of diagnosis, interim
      of treatment, end of treatment, 1 year follow-up, 1.5 year of follow-up, 2 year of follow up,
      3 year of follow-up and disease progression.

      Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) would be estimated using the
      Kaplan-Meier method and two-tailed log-rank test.The Cox proportional hazards model would
      evaluate prognostic factors for OS and PFS. Specificity, sensitivity and cut-off would be
      established using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Area
      under curve (AUC) values &gt;0.7 indicate that the parameter can be used for diagnosis, with
      values &gt;0.9 indicating high clinical accuracy.
