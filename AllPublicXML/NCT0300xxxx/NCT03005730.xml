    <textblock>
      Background: According to the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), the term
      temporomandibular disorder (TMD) regards a subgroup of orofacial pain, the symptoms of which
      include pain or discomfort in the temporomandibular joint, ears, masticatory muscles and neck
      on one or both sides as well as joint sounds, limited mandibular movements or mandibular
      deviation and difficulties chewing. Phototherapy, such as low level laser therapy (LLLT) and
      light-emitting diode (LED) therapy, is one of the resources used to treatment muscle pain.
      Thus, there is a need to investigate therapeutic resources that combine different wavelengths
      as well as different light sources (LLLT and LED) in the same apparatus.

      Question: The aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the effects of phototherapy on pain,
      activity of the masticatory muscles (masseter and anterior temporal bilaterally) and joint
      mobility in individuals with temporomandibular disorder (TMD). A further aim is to determine
      the cumulative effect 24 and 48 hours after a six session.

      Methods/Design: A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, clinical trial will be
      carried out involving 30 women between 18 and 40 years of age with a diagnosis of myogenous
      TMD. The participants will then be randomly allocated to two groups totaling 15 individuals
      per group. Group 1 submitted to a session of phototherapy with 39,27 Joules per point one
      group will receive placebo therapy (0 Joules). The following assessment tools will be
      administered on four separate occasions (baseline and immediately after, 24 h after and 48 h
      after phototherapy). Pain intensity will be assessed using the visual analog scale for pain,
      meter for range of movement, and electromyographic EMG analysis on the masseter and anterior
      temporal muscles.

      Discussion: The study will support the practice of evidence-based to the use of phototherapy
      in individuals with a myogenous TMD. Data will be published after the study is completed.

    <description>A Visual analog scale allows the quantification of pain intensity. This scale consists of a straight line measuring 10 cm in length, with &quot;absence of pain&quot; written at one end and &quot;worst pain ever felt&quot; written at the other end. The volunteer will be instructed to make a perpendicular line between the two extremes that represents the pain level he/she is feeling at the time</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All volunteers will have a diagnosis of myogenous TMD based on the RDC/TMD with
             moderate to severe pain in the masseter and temporal muscles rated by an expert
             dentist. To standardize the sample, the body mass index of all participants must be
             less than 25 kg/m2, as the amount of adipose tissue between the electrode and surface
             of the muscle can affect that reading of the electromyographic (EMG) signal. All
             volunteers must also have an initial pain score greater than 3 points on the VAS.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The exclusion criteria will be missing teeth, the use of dentures, systemic or
             neuromuscular diseases, a history of trauma to the face or temporomandibular joint,
             history of temporomandibular joint luxation, currently undergoing orthodontic
             treatment, or currently undergoing medicinal treatment that can affect the
             musculoskeletal system (analgesic, anti-inflammatory agent or muscle relaxant).
