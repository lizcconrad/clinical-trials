      EUS - guided choledocho-duodenostomy (ECDS) is an established option for bile duct drainage
      in unresectable malignant distal CBD strictures when endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) fails. However, how primary ECDS compares with ERCP with
      covered self-expanding metallic stents (CSEMS) in unresectable malignant distal CBD
      strictures is uncertain.

      The aim of the current study is to compare primary ECDS versus ERCP with CSEMS in
      unresectable malignant distal CBD strictures. We hypothesis that ECDS is associated with a
      higher 1-year stent patency rate.

      Malignant biliary obstruction is a common sequela of pancreatic cancers or distal bile duct
      cancers, and its development can hinder the use of chemotherapy, decrease patient quality of
      life and decrease survival. Malignant biliary obstruction is traditionally palliated with
      ERCP with metallic stent insertion. However, these stents are prone to obstruction due to
      tumour ingrowth. In addition, ERCP may not always be possible due to tumour obstruction and
      percutaneous biliary drainage may be required.

      Recently, ECDS has been described as an alternative to percutaneous biliary drainage in
      patients with failed ERCP. The procedure is also associated with potential advantages as
      compared to conventional ERCP. In particular, the risk of tumour ingrowth into the stent
      placed after ECDS is low and stent patency rates may be better than ERCP. Thus, the aim of
      the current study is to compare primary ECDS versus ERCP with CSEMS in unresectable malignant
      distal CBD strictures.

    <description>The CBD would be identified by a linear echoendoscope and a suitable puncture site in the bulb of the duodenum would be located. The common bile duct would be punctured with a 19-gauge needle and the position would be confirmed by aspiration of bile and contrast injection. A 0.025&quot; or 0.035&quot; guide wire would be passed through the needle in to the CBD. A fully covered metal stent would then be inserted after track dilation.</description>

    <description>After cannulation of the CBD, a cholangiography would be performed to assess the diameter of the CBD, the length and position of the biliary stricture. The endoscopist would decide on the appropriate size of SEMS to be placed. The stents should be visible from the duodenal lumen after deployment.</description>
