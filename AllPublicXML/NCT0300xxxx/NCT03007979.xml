  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a study to test an alternative dosing schedule of
      palbociclib. With the current three-week on and one week off schedule, a significant number
      of patients develop grade 3 or higher degree of neutropenia and require dose reduction and
      sometimes discontinuation. This potentially compromises the efficacy of the drug. In
      addition, as the half-life of palbociclib is 27 hours, 1 week break with the standard 3 weeks
      on and 1 week off dosing schedule could potentially lead to recovery of Rb phosphorylation
      during the off week. Hence, the investigators propose a 5 days on and 2 days off schedule
      each week without any weeks off drug. Although the cumulative doses each 28-day cycle is
      roughly the same with this schedule compared to conventional dosing, the bone marrow is not
      exposed to the drug continuously for 21 days and rather gets frequent breaks from therapy.
      The investigators hypothesize that the 5 days on and 2 days off schedule is more tolerable
      with less frequent high grade neutropenia and dose interruption/reduction. In addition, this
      schedule also provides for a more continuous drug delivery to the patient since there is not
      a week's break in therapy, which could ultimately prove to be more efficacious.

             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis which could affect the evaluation
             of all-cycle adverse events.

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to palbociclib or other agents used in the study.

             CYP3A isoenzymes within 7 days prior to registration.

          -  Clinically significant history of liver disease.

          -  A condition that would interfere with enteric absorption.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test within 7 days of study entry.

          -  Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential
             for pharmacokinetic interactions with palbociclib. In addition, these patients are at
             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.
             Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
