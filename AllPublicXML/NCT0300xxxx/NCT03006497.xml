  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficiency of an exercise program based on
      principles of motor learning in correction of Forward Head Position (FHP) in asymptomatic
      patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies have shown that bad posture and poor body control occurs at puberty,
      with forward head posture (FHP) and rounded shoulders being the most common biomechanical
      deviations in sagittal plane. The FHP is defined as an anterior displacement of the head with
      hyperextension of the cervical spine and this is associated with a reduction in the length of
      the upper portion of the trapezius, posterior portion of the cervical extensor muscles, the
      sternocleidomastoid and the levator scapulae. FHP can be evaluated by measuring
      craniovertebral angle (CVA) which is defined as the angle between a horizontal line passing
      through C7 and a line extending from the tragus of the ear to C7.

      CVA, smaller than 50 degrees, constitute a criterion of abnormal posture of cervical spine,
      suggesting FHP. People with FHP present incomplete balance control, thereby affecting the
      position of the center of gravity and motor control of the body. The establishment of altered
      motor control strategies could lead to balance disorders, neck muscle imbalances, chronic
      neck pain and even respiratory dysfunction.

      Despite the efforts of researchers to create effective treatment programs based on strength
      training and stretching exercises, positive long-term results have been a problem in FHP
      correction. For this reason, re-education of posture and body alignment, through exercise
      programs based on motor learning, with cognitive elements (attention, motivation, feedback,
      reasoning), could be proved a more effective therapeutic strategy.

    <measure>Change in Static Forward Head Posture (sFHP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline sFHP at 4 weeks and Change from Baseline sFHP at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The sFHP will be assessed by calculating the craniovertebral angle through lateral photographs in standing. The craniovertebral angle is the angle between the line extending from the tragus of the ear to the 7th cervical vertebra (C7) spinous process and the horizontal line through C7. The calculation of the angle on the photographs will be carried out using AutoCAD software. A performance curve will be developed using the measurements during the 4 weeks practice and 2 weeks after the end of protocol (retension test).</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline dFHP t at 4 weeks and Change from Baseline dFHP at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The dFHP will be assessed by calculating the craniovertebral angle through video motion during walking. The craniovertebral angle is the angle between the line extending from the tragus of the ear to the 7th cervical vertebra (C7) spinous process and the horizontal line through C7. The calculation of the angle The calculation of the angle will be carried out using Kinovea and AutoCAD softwares. dFHP will be regarded as a transfer test. Transfer tests are tests involving some novel situation, so that people must adapt the skill they have been practicing to the characteristics of this new situation.</description>

    <description>The first stage of the test allows for the quantification of the performance of craniocervical flexion action, while the second stage examines the isometric endurance of deep neck flexors, during which the participant adopts the crook lying position. The air chamber of a pressure biofeedback device is positioned under the cervical area and the participant is asked to perform a head nod action at five different pressure levels (22, 24, 26, 28 and 30 mmHg). The test is initially performed at a pressure level of 22 mmHg and proceeds to the next pressure level if the participant is able to maintain in the position for 10 seconds on three separate occasions. The Chattanooga stabilizer pressure biofeedback will be used.</description>
