        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed Informed Consent

          -  Target population: Healthy males with no clinically significant deviations from normal
             in medical history, physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs),

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any chronic or acute illness including active TB in the last 3 years,
             recent infection, gastrointestinal disease, smoking within less than 6 months prior to

             dose of study drug, during the course of the study

          -  Evidence of organ dysfunction or any clinically significant deviation from normal in
             physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiograms, or clinical laboratory
             determinations beyond what is consistent with the target population.

          -  Participant with greater than Grade 2 acne.

          -  Participated in a radiolabeled drug study within the previous 12 months; clinically
