      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of meropenem-vaborbactam compared to piperacillin/tazobactam for 7 to
      14 days in the treatment of hospitalized adults who meet clinical, radiographic, and
      microbiological criteria for hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) or
      ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP).

             approved by institutional-specific guidelines. Participants who are unconscious or
             considered by the investigator to be clinically unable to consent at Screening and who
             are entered into the study by the consent of a legally authorized representative,
             should provide their own written informed consent for continuing to participate in the
             study as soon as possible on recovery, as applicable in accordance with local
             regulations.

          2. Hospitalized male or female participants, â‰¥18 years of age.

               7. This deep respiratory secretion sample must meet adequacy criteria for testing,
                  and be sent to the local or regional laboratory for Gram stain and culture
                  (results of Gram stain and culture do not have to be available for enrollment).

        For VABP participants:

        To meet the study definition of VABP, participants must meet all of the following clinical,
        microbiological, and radiographic criteria:

                  increased need for respiratory secretion suctioning.

               2. Auscultatory findings on pulmonary examination consistent with bacterial
                  pneumonia or pulmonary consolidation (for example, rales, dullness on percussion,

                  of inspired oxygen [PaO2/FiO2] â‰¤240 or PaO2 â‰¤60 mmHg) leading to acute changes to
                  the ventilator support system (minimum daily FiO2 values increased by at least
                  0.20 over the daily minimum FiO2 in the preceding 48 hours, or minimum daily
                  positive end- expiratory pressure (PEEP) values increased by at least 3

             randomization and after development of clinical signs and symptoms of VABP (ideally
             prior to administration of systemic antimicrobial therapy). This can be obtained via
             BAL (including protected BAL or mini-BAL), PSB, or ETA, pleural fluid, or lung

          6. The above deep respiratory secretion sample must meet adequacy criteria for testing
             and be sent to the local or regional laboratory for Gram stain and culture (results of
             Gram stain and culture do not have to be available for enrollment).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants who meet any of the following exclusion criteria will not be enrolled in the
        study:

             cephalosporins, penicillins, or carbapenems).

          2. History of any severe allergic reaction that would preclude the use of either all
             aminoglycosides or adjunctive gram-positive antimicrobials (that is, allergy to both
             glycopeptides and oxazolidinones).

          3. Requirement or anticipated need for additional systemic antibiotic (other than study

         14. Any condition that would make the participant, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             unsuitable for the study (for example, would place a participant at risk or compromise
             the quality of the data), including participants with a high likelihood of death
             within 72 hours after randomization despite adequate antimicrobial therapy for HABP or
             VABP or participants with a &quot;do not resuscitate&quot; order.

         15. An employee of the Investigator or study center with direct involvement in the
             proposed study or other studies under the direction of that Investigator or study
