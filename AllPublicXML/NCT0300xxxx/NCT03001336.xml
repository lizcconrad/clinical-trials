      The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential association between thyroid
      function and diabetes complications in the elderly subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM).

      Aims: We investigated the potential association between thyroid parameters and
      microalbuminuria in the euthyroid elderly subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

      Subjects: Elderly inhospital patients with T2DM who visited in the Department of
      Endocrinology at the Nanjing First Hospital from January 2011 to December 2012.

      Methods: Clinical factors, serum levels of glucose, lipids, free triiodothyronine (FT3), free
      thyroxine (FT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid autoantibodies,24h urine
      albuminuria and fluorescence fundus angiography are conducted.

      The relationships levels of thyroid function and diabetic complications are analysed.
