  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine if spraying a local anesthetic to the cecum
      after a laparoscopic appendectomy decreases the amount of narcotics (pain medicine) needed
      after surgery and reduces the time to discharge from the hospital.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of using intraperitoneal
      anesthetic during appendectomy. Subjects will be randomized to receive either 20 mL 0.5%
      bupivicaine or 20 mL of normal saline (placebo) instilled in the right lower quadrant at the
      cecum after appendix has been removed. Narcotic consumption will be tracked postoperatively.
      Hypothesis is that instilling local anesthetic at the cecum during a laparoscopic
      appendectomy will decrease the amount of narcotic a patient uses postoperatively.
      Secondarily, this study will attempt to determine if there is a decrease in length of stay
      for the subjects randomized to the anesthetic infiltration.
