      This study will be conducted to determine the dose response of lemborexant on the change from
      baseline in actigraphy-derived Sleep Efficiency and Wake Efficiency during the last week of 4
      weeks of treatment in participants with Irregular Sleep-Wake Rhythm Disorder and Alzheimer's
