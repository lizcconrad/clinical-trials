  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess whether running deep wound stiches will be superior to
      deep interrupted stiches in body contouring surgeries in massive weight loss patients. This
      is a split-wound study, thereby providing an internal control within each wound. Each side of
      the wound will be randomized to receive one of the two suturing techniques. Patients and
      raters will be blinded to the suture technique used in both wound-halfs.
