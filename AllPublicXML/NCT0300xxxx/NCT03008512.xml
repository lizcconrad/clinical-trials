      This study evaluate activity and safety profile of weekly Genexol-PM in patients with
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma for whom sorafenib treatment failed. Patients will receive
      Genexol-PM on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks.

    <textblock>
      Hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) is a highly vascular neoplasm characterized by arterial
      enhancement on CT or MRI. Angiogenesis provides a target for novel prognostic and therapeutic
      approaches to HCC. Sorafenib is the standard 1st-line therapy shown to significantly improve
      overall survival in advanced HCC. However, sorafenib benefits are mostly transient and
      modest. In addition, sorafenib is associated with major toxicities, and about 30% of patients
      stop it because of intolerance. Effective therapies are needed for patients who experience
      progression during or after receiving sorafenib or who have sorafenib intolerance. Paclitaxel
      has an antiagiogenic activity and weekly administration of paclitaxel is considered to have
      enhanced efficacy over 3-weekly administration due to greater drug exposure or a direct
      antiangiogenic effect. A previous phase I study showed that weekly paclitaxel has activity in
      hepatocellular carcinoma and further investigation in phase II trials is warranted.
      Genexol-PM, a cremophor-free, polymeric micelle-formulated paclitaxel, is believed to be
      superior to conventional paclitaxel in terms of the obviation of premedication and the
      delivery of higher paclitaxel doses without additional toxicity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on either

               1. histopathologic or cytologic findings

               2. a diagnosis of cirrhosis and HCC with classical imaging characteristics (at least
                  a 3-phase liver protocol CT or MRI and a lesion that demonstrates arterial
