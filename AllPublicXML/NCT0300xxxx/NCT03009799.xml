  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical investigation aims at demonstrating that NCX-4240 is effective and safe in
      decreasing the number of days where adenoviral conjunctivis is detected in the eye and in
      reducing the duration and/or the severity of the signs and symptoms of adenoviral
      conjunctivis

      A multicenter, double masked, parallel, randomized 1:1 ratio clinical investigation comparing
      carrageenan eye drops (NCX 4240) versus placebo up to 21 days.

      Total expected number of patients: 148

      Randomization: patients will be randomized 1:1 between:

        -  Group A: eye drops containing iota-carrageenan (NCX 4240), 1 drop in each eye 8
           times/day for 7 days (mandatory) then at least 4 to 8 times/day for the next 14 days
           until Day 21 or

        -  Group B: ocular lubricant eye drop (carmellose 0.5% sterile solution) 1 drop in each eye
           8 times/day for 7 days (Mandatory), then 4 to 8 times/day for the next 14 days until Day
           21.
