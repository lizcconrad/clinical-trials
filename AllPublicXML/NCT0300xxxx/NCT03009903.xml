      This multi-center, outpatient study will extract and evaluate the presence of facial P. acnes
      bacteria and phage strains using pore strips on up to 400 human subjects. An additional P.
      acnes visual detection method (VISIOPOR ® PP34N) will be used in this study as per PI
      decision to explore whether there is a correlation between P. acnes bacterial presence and
      fluorescent signal.
