  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in Germany and is associated with an
      increased risk of thromboembolic stroke. The risk to suffer from AF increases with age. Early
      detection of AF and anticoagulation seem the most effective way of preventing ischaemic
      stroke in patients at risk. The guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology recommend
      opportunistic screening for AF by pulse check at each general practitioner visit for all
      patients aged 65 years or older.

      The objective of this study was to test whether an opportunistic AF screening with a
      hand-held diagnostic tool in a German pharmacy setting is useful in detecting unknown AF
      among people in the age of 65 and older. Besides a pulse palpation with a hand-held ECG-stick
      the screening in the pharmacies also includes a questionnaire related to demographics and
      medical history of the subject as well as several questions concerning the stroke risk
      stratification (CHA₂DS₂-VASc). Every subject with a positive test result (indication on AF)
      is insistently asked to make an appointment with his or her general practitioner. The subject
      receives an information letter for his or her general practitioner that adverts to the
      positive screening result and the necessity of further diagnostic Investigation.

      In order to assess the incidence of unknown AF as well as accomplish the secondary objectives
      of this study, two follow-ups by means of telephone interviews are performed. First, all
      subjects with a positive test result are called 8 weeks after the screening in the pharmacies
      was conducted. The subject is asked several questions concerning personal data/demographics,
      the stroke risk (CHA₂DS₂-VASc), the medical history regarding to dyspnea and stroke, the
      bleeding risk (HAS-Bled), the medication, the device, diagnostic, the therapy, the
      Intervention and the mace. 12 months after the screening in the pharmacies was performed, all
      participating subjects were called. The list of questions is similar to the one that is used
      during the first telephone interviews after eight weeks.
