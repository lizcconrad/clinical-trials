  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corneal abrasion (TCA) is the most common ophthalmic emergency disease, accounting for about
      10% of the American ophthalmic emergency, accounting for 22% of the ophthalmic emergency in
      Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center. Clinical emergency treatment of TCA is relatively simple and
      effective, corneal epithelial damage can be recovered within 48 hours. However, about 25% TCA
      would be developed to the recurrence of exfoliation. Once the recurrence of TCA, the
      treatment would be more difficult and even cause blindness. Therefore, it is of great
      practical significance to prevent the recurrence of TCA. However, there is no effective
      methods to prevent recurrence of TCA.

      0.3% sodium hyaluronate eye drops can effectively supplement the shortage of tear and promote
      repair of corneal epithelium. On this basis, the investigators hypotheses that 0.3% sodium
      hyaluronate eye drops can prevent the recurrence of TCA. So, investigators intend to test
      effectiveness of 0.3% sodium hyaluronate drops to prevent the recurrence of TCA by a
      prospective, single center, randomized, controlled pilot study. In this study, 60 patients
      with TCA were randomly divided into control group and sodium hyaluronate treatment group and
      observed one year.

Scoring criteria: 0 point: no staining; 1 point: punctate staining less than 30 dots; 2 points: punctate staining more than 30 dots, more than the point of the color but not scattered; 3 points: severe dispersion staining but no plaque staining; 4 points: plaque staining. Maximum score of 16 points per eye.</description>
