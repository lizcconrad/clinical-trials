  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the impact of a physical activity intervention on
      the self-management of fatigue in young adults receiving chemotherapy. Half of the
      participants will receive an intervention which includes education and resources to set
      physical activity goals and monitor progress toward goals.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interventions to increase physical activity have been shown to relieve fatigue in patients
      receiving chemotherapy, but no studies have tested a physical activity intervention to
      improve fatigue in young adults receiving chemotherapy. This study will determine the impact
      of a physical activity intervention on the self-management process variables of self-efficacy
      and self-regulation and their relationships to physical activity and fatigue severity in
      young adults receiving chemotherapy.

    <description>Intervention group participants will meet with a study facilitator during 5 regularly scheduled visits for chemotherapy. The facilitator will provide education about the benefits of physical activity and strategies to overcome barriers to physical activity, help the participants to set physical activity goals based on ability and preferences, and educate the participant on using a physical activity tracker.</description>
