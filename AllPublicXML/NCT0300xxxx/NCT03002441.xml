  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized trial is to compare same-day cervical preparation using
      Dilapan-S™ plus buccal misoprostol to overnight cervical preparation using Dilapan-S™ before
      D&amp;E at 16.0 to 20.0 weeks.

      Primary objective: To compare D&amp;E operative time. We hypothesize that same-day Dilapan-S™
      plus buccal misoprostol is non-inferior to overnight Dilapan-S™ with respect to operative
      time.

      Secondary objectives: To compare treatment groups for the following: Pre-operative cervical
      dilation; need for mechanical dilation and ease of dilation if required; ability to complete
      D&amp;E without further cervical preparation; ease of D&amp;E; complications; pain; side effects;
      patient and provider satisfaction.
