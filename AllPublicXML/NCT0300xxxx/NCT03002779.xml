      The purpose of the study is to determine the routes of excretion for JNJ-53718678 and its
      metabolites, to explore the metabolic pathways of JNJ-53718678, and to determine the chemical
      structure of predominant metabolites in healthy adult male participants after a single oral
      dose of 500 milligram (mg) 14C-JNJ-53718678.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A male participant: a) Must be sexually abstinent (defined as refraining from sexual
             intercourse from Day 1 (day of dosing) until 90 days after study drug administration),
             OR b) Who is sexually active (either heterosexual, including with a pregnant woman, or
             homosexual) must agree to use a barrier method of contraception (eg, condom) from Day
             1 (day of dosing) until 90 days after study drug administration, AND c) Who is
             sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential must agree to use a barrier
             method of contraception (eg, condom) from Day 1 (day of dosing) until 90 days after
             study drug administration, in conjunction with this female partner using a highly
             effective contraceptive (such as implantable progestogen-only hormone contraception
             associated with inhibition of ovulation; intrauterine device; intrauterine
             hormone-releasing system, combined [estrogen- and progestogen- containing] hormonal
             contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral, intravaginal, or
             transdermal; progestogen-only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of
             ovulation: oral or injectable) d) Must agree not to donate sperm from Day 1 (day of
             dosing) until 90 days after study drug administration

          -  Participant must have a body mass index (BMI; weight in kg divided by the square of
             height in meters) of 18.0 to 30.0 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2)

          -  Participant must have a blood pressure (after the participant is supine for 5 minutes)
             between 90 and 140 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and no higher
             than 90 mmHg diastolic

          -  Participant must have a normal 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (based on the mean
             value of triplicate ECG parameters), consistent with normal cardiac conduction and
             function at screening, including: a) normal sinus rhythm (heart rate between 45 and 90
             beats per minute (bpm), extremes included); b)mean QT interval corrected for heart
             rate according to Fridericia formula (QTcF) interval lesser than or equal to (&lt;=)450
             millisecond (ms); c) mean QRS interval of &lt;110 ms; d) mean PR interval &lt;200 ms; e)
             morphology consistent with healthy cardiac conduction and function

          -  Participants must be healthy on the basis of a medical evaluation that reveals the
             absence of any clinically relevant abnormality and includes a physical examination
             (including height and body weight measurement and skin examination), medical history,
             vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, orthostatic blood
             pressure changes, respiratory rate, and body temperature), creatinine clearance (below
             60 milliliter per minute (mL/min) at screening using Cockroft-Gault equation), and the
             results of blood biochemistry, blood coagulation, and hematology tests, and a
             urinalysis performed at screening, on Day -1, or predose on Day 1, whichever is
             applicable. If there are abnormalities, with the exception of those described in the
             in- and exclusion criteria, the participant may be included only if the investigator
             judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant.
             This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and
             initialed by the investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with a removed gallbladder, or with a history of upper gastrointestinal
             (stomach, duodenum) surgery, or with a recent (less than 3 months prior to screening)
             episode of gallbladder stones

          -  Participants with a history of heart arrhythmias (extrasystoles, tachycardia at rest)
             or history of risk factors for Torsade de Pointes syndrome (example, hypokalemia,
             family history of long QT syndrome)

          -  Participant has intolerance to xylocaine, lactose, or midazolam

          -  Participant has a history of hepatitis A antibody immunoglobulin M (IgM), hepatitis B
             virus surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) positive, or
             other clinically active liver disease, or tests positive for hepatitis A antibody IgM,
             HBsAg or anti HCV at screening

          -  Participant has a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive, or
             tests positive for HIV at screening
