      This study's purpose is to test the effects of an electronic health intervention platform
      developed by Epharmix, which features two-way SMS text messages and phone calls intended to
      improve clinical outcomes compared to the standard of care. The investigators hypothesize
      that this system can improve frequency and quality of data gathering across various
      specialties, leading to expedited provider intervention and improved health outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Telemedicine is a modern field of clinical medicine that strives to incorporate
      telecommunication and information technology for diagnosing and managing health care at a
      distance. Interventions range from telephone reminders to remote physician consultation by
      streamed by webcam. Simple technology such as telephone and SMS texting are becoming
      increasingly ubiquitous forms of communication and show potential for clinical benefit for
      improving patient adherence, as well as promoting education and engagement.

      Existing research of telephone reminders and family based contracts have been shown to be
      effective at increasing adherence to treatment sessions such as hemodialysis and improving
      overall appointment attendance in the outpatient clinical system. Unfortunately, the
      compliance rates were also found to decrease within a three month period after the
      intervention was discontinued. The biggest obstacle to a clinic to implementing and
      maintaining such a system is the costs associated with running the program, primarily the
      cost of employing staff to make phone calls and continuous follow-up. Electronic systems to
      provide reminders to patients at their preferred time, in their preferred format, such as a
      text message or a phone call. In a study of primary care outpatient appointment attendance,
      the no show rate was reduced by both electronic reminders by 10%. By cost-benefit analysis,
      it was determined to be financially beneficial to generate reminder messages for patients
      with a no-show probability of 5%.

      There is conflicting data of whether a personal call by a clinical staff member or an
      automatically generated call/text message have greater efficacy of reducing missed
      appointments, however, both types of reminders were well-received and did not cause any
      patient disturbance and automated calls are pose less burden on already-strained health
      resources. Although specialized electronic reminder applications via smartphone and tablet
      devices exist today, both the devices and the skills required to navigate them may be not
      consistent with the older, chronic disease populations, such as dialysis, congestive heart
      failure, or COPD. The investigators thereby hypothesize that the simpler Epharmix (EPX)
      system, which uses the more simple platforms of SMS and phone calls to do automated
      specialized reminders to be able to reach many of the same benefits of the above electronic
      systems, at only a fraction of the cost. Besides the purpose of providing timely reminders,
      the same platform is easily adapted for educational engagement and other clinical goals. In
      the outpatient epilepsy population, SMS-based interventions were shown to be feasible and
      effective at improving patient education and perceptions.

      Another application of high clinical value is to increase the frequency of physician-patient
      contact, via the electronic intervention, and reduce the delay to acquiring critical
      biometric or clinical data to patients over time. The motivation for this goal comes from
      several fields in which the shortage of physicians is limiting prompt diagnosis and care. In
      particular, average wait time for an appointment with a specialist physician, such as a
      neurologist, is approximately 30 days. In pediatric neurology, the situation is even worse,
      with an average wait time of 35 days and 39% of children's hospitals reporting a wait time of
      12 months or more for new patients to see a neurologist. Psychiatry experiences the same
      degree of delay. Psychiatric patients have an average wait of 25 days to first appointment.
      Finally, even generalist practices are overbooked, leading to lack of reporting of falls in
      geriatric patients until 2-3 months later [internal data] or congestive heart failure
      patients waiting 1-2 months before seeing a physician to report changes in weight or
      breathing difficulty [internal data].

      Given the standard that medication or treatment adjustments that depend on this information
      must wait for an office visit, the prolonged wait times create a major gap between
      recognition of symptoms or adverse events, and actual follow up or management. While it is
      theoretically possible to accelerate a patient's time to drug adjustment or adverse event
      reporting by calling the physician's office and scheduling an earlier appointment, no data,
      to these investigators' knowledge, exists on the utilization of such alternative options.
      Various paper home diaries, such as mood charts in psychiatry, are available to follow
      patient data; however, there is low compliance that the patient will fill out these charts or
      bring the diary in for the next visit. Online variants of such diaries have shown almost
      double the reporting rate.

      In comparison, more expensive and complicated devices have been developed to address this
      similar problem. Wearable and implantable EEG-based seizure monitoring systems are in
      development, but thus far have only been tested in a few subjects that have a history of
      refractory epilepsy. Home health weight monitors and other devices are available, but
      demonstrate high costs and limited broad application, as they are only provided in
      conjunction with home health care [internal data]. In addition, more complicated telehealth
      monitoring, asking over 10 questions per call, with multiple triggers actually induces
      negligible effect on treatment outcomes in patients such as congestive heart failure. In
      comparison, implantable sensors for CHF have demonstrated increase in patient survival.

      An electronic intervention platform has been developed by Epharmix, a Washington University
      in St. Louis (WUSTL) IDEA Labs (ideas.wustl.edu) team, which has the capacity to use SMS text
      messaging or pre-recorded phone messages for various adherence tracking and data collection
      applications, in order to supplement clinical care. Specific messages include proactively
      asking patients or a designated patient advocate if the patient has experienced a medical
      event recently; requesting specific care-related information, such as glucose values, current
      mood, or medication adherence; and providing health care education, i.e. what to do if a
      patient is experiencing physical symptoms. Patients receiving the messages are also provided
      with key contact information for their designated health care provider to promote patient
      engagement, as well as prompt and appropriate medical intervention. The service will maintain
      both a dedicated SMS and phone line for recording events or adverse reactions. Events
      designated as critical will prompt an immediate phone based follow-through to the appropriate
      nursing staff. All recorded events will be available for review by the patient's health care
      provider.

      The intervention is designed to reach out to patients, engage patients and providers in
      communication and allow physicians to respond to concerns more rapidly. This intervention may
      supplement to the patient-doctor relationship and potentially improve clinical outcomes,
      increase adherence, and reduce time to optimal health.

      Overall, this study aims to determine whether an electronic intervention system, which sends
      SMS text messages or phone calls proactively can improve medical care outcomes in a variety
      of healthcare settings. Specifically, the two aims are: 1) To test if Epharmix reminders will
      improve adherence to physician requested actions, such as appointments, medications, etc. 2)
      To test if the Epharmix platform can be used to collect clinical data (e.g. weight, blood
      sugar, disease specific events) over time for later physician analysis.

      Procedures: Patients at Washington University, Barnes Jewish Hospital and St. Louis
      Children's Hospital will be included in this study. Two cohorts will be prospectively
      identified, one group consisting of adult individuals age &gt; 18, and one group of pediatric
      patients age 5 &lt; 18. Patients from each cohort will be recruited and then randomized to
      either the experimental or the control group in disease matched control groups. The
      experimental group will receive the electronic intervention featuring automated SMS text
      message and/or phone call as described above; the control group will not receive any
      electronic intervention, or may receive a placebo version of the intervention. Pediatric or
      geriatric patients may have SMS or phone messages also sent to their designated caregiver.
      Subjects will have the ability to opt out of the study electronically via text and phone at
      any point during the study.
