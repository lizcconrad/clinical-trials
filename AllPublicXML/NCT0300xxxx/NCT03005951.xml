  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see what effect skipping breakfast versus consuming breakfast
      has on cognitive performance and the hormones responsible for glucose homeostasis in lean and
      obese adolescent males. The subjects will be tested on their ability to maintain attention
      when given several tasks called continuous temporal expectancy tasks (CTET) and
      electrophysiological signals using electroencephalogram (EEG) will be monitored. These two
      study groups will be randomized to one of two orders: (A,B) or (B,A) where A = breakfast
      intervention and B = no breakfast. There will be a washout period of 7 days in between study
      visits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eating unhealthy foods and not exercising regularly contributes to obesity in children. Other
      unhealthy behaviors, such as skipping meals can also lead to obesity. Breakfast is known to
      be the most important meal of the day, yet many people skip breakfast. Skipping breakfast can
      cause an imbalance in the hormones that control blood glucose.

      Skipping breakfast can affect how well insulin works at lowering blood glucose at later meal
      times. The impact of breakfast on glucose homeostasis is different from that of lunch and
      dinner. This became evident when a group of researchers studied the effect of skipping
      breakfast on hormone responses after subsequent isocaloric lunch and dinner in adults with
      Type 2 diabetes. The study showed that in Type 2 diabetics, skipping breakfast leads to
      increased post-prandial hyperglycemia and decreased glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) release,
      impairing the insulin response to hyperglycemia. Plasma free fatty acids (FFA) levels were
      found to be significantly higher after lunch and dinner when breakfast was omitted. It has
      been shown that acute elevation of FFA induces hepatic insulin resistance and increased
      hepatic glucose production in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and in non-diabetic
      controls. Impaired insulin secretion can predispose to conditions such as obesity, and other
      diseases.

      Skipping breakfast can also have a negative effect on children's ability to keep focus and
      attention. The CTET is a tool that can be used to directly measure attention using an EEG and
      is a highly sensitive measure of neural processing.
