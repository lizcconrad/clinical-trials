      Pilot study to assess the feasibility and initial efficacy of therapist-as-consultant,
      game-based CI therapy. Pre/post study design. Participant received a target of 30 hours
      game-based motor intervention, 100 hours constraint of the less affected upper extremity, and
      5 hours therapist consultation (including completion of a behavioral contract at the first
      study visit). Duration of intervention was 10 consecutive weekdays, with pre-treatment and
      post-treatment testing performed within 1 week prior to and 1 week post-intervention by an
      independent tester.

          -  Experienced mild to moderate hemiparesis at least six months prior

          -  Can independently operate the gaming system (those with severe cognitive impairments
             can usually achieve this)

          -  Corrected vision of at least 20/70 as assessed by their ability to identify game
             objects on the monitor from 5 feet away

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  concurrent participation in other experimental upper extremity trials

          -  concurrent participation in other outpatient rehabilitation for their upper extremity

          -  Botox within the last 3 months (confound)

          -  near-normal motor function (9-hole Peg Test score above the 10th percentile of a
             normative sample)

          -  minimal nonuse (Motor Activity Log at baseline &gt;2.5, Accelerometry &gt; 60%)

          -  major medical issues that would interfere with study treatments or make intensive
             rehabilitation difficult to tolerate
