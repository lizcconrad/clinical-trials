  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The uptake of vaccines for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) in the U.S. is far below recommended
      levels, particularly for adolescent boys and especially among minority families. Proposed
      here is a mobile web application (&quot;mobile web app&quot;) for personal computers, smart phones, and
      tablet computers that will accurately inform parents and adolescent boys about the HPV
      vaccination and address unique concerns about its safety and effectiveness for boys. The
      BoyVac mobile web app will be evaluated for its ability to improve vaccine outcomes in a
      randomized efficacy trial with parents and adolescent boys aged 11-13 years who obtain care
      in pediatric clinics in the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center's Envision
      network.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The President's Cancer Advisory Board and the Centers for Disease Control have called for
      renewed efforts in promoting vaccination for Human Papillomavirus (HPV), including
      vaccination for adolescent boys, because the uptake of this new vaccine remains alarmingly
      low. Currently, less than 15% of adolescent boys have received the HPV vaccine; thus, most of
      this population remains at risk for oropharyngeal, anal, and penile cancers. Many parents
      remain unconvinced of the safety and effectiveness of HPV vaccines, so effective and
      accessible messaging to improve decision-making on this vaccine is needed. Parents of
      adolescent boys also have different concerns about HPV vaccination than for adolescent girls,
      creating a need for unique health communication interventions to promote vaccine uptake among
      boys. Interventions also need to address the unique challenges of minority populations and
      populations for whom English is not the first language. A novel digital intervention will be
      produced and evaluated for its ability to improve HPV vaccine outcomes. Specifically, a
      mobile responsive web application (&quot;mobile web app&quot;) will be created that performs similar to
      a mobile app but runs on a variety of computing platforms from personal desktop and laptop
      computers to the latest smart phones and tablet computers. Mobile web app content will be
      targeted to parents and adolescent boys aged 11-13 years living in New Mexico, a
      majority-minority population with large proportions of Hispanics, Whites, and Native
      Americans. The specific aims are to: 1) carefully and systematically develop a mobile web app
      (BoyVac) for smart phones, tablet computers, and personal computers that will utilize
      Diffusion of Innovations principles to provide targeted information concerning HPV vaccine
      adoption to adolescent males and their parents, particularly minority adolescents and
      parents; 2) implement a comprehensive and rigorous test of the impact of the BoyVac mobile
      web app intervention on HPV vaccine adoption outcomes via a randomized efficacy trial (BoyVac
      v. usual and customary care); and 3) examine the dose-response relationships between mobile
      web app usage and vaccine outcomes within a components analysis. A group-randomized
      pretest-posttest controlled design will be implemented, recruiting 1800 pairs of parents and
      adolescent boys from 30 pediatric clinics (n=60 parents and boys per clinic) affiliated with
      the Envision New Mexico, a best practices program at the University of New Mexico Health
      Sciences Center's Department of Pediatrics. Parents will be surveyed at baseline, a 3-month
      follow-up, and a 9-month follow-up and records HPV vaccination adoption for the boys will be
      obtained from the clinics' medical records at the 9-month follow-up. Analyses will test the
      hypotheses that 1) more 11-13 year old boys in the intervention group (BoyVac mobile web app)
      will adopt the HPV vaccine than boys in the usual and customary care comparison group and 2)
      adoption of HPV vaccine will be mediated by improvements in theoretical mediators among
      parents in the intervention compared to the usual and customary care comparison group.

    <description>The BoyVac mobile web app will be evaluated in a pair-matched group-randomized pretest-posttest controlled design. In Year 2, 30 clinics in New Mexico will be pair-matched and one member of each pair will be randomized to the intervention (mobile web app) or a usual and customary (UC) HPV vaccine adoption procedures comparison group. Clinics will be paired based on similarities in patient demographic (ethnicity and % Medicaid patients) and location (urban and rural).</description>

    <description>Currently in pediatric clinics in New Mexico, the HPV vaccines are offered to parents and adolescents as part of annual well-child checkups. Typically for boys aged 11-13, parents initiate this checkup as part of a back-to-school activity. As part of the well-child checkup, clinic staff (physician, physician assistant and/or nurse) talk with parents and adolescents about the recommendation that their sons or daughters receive the HPV vaccination. Well-child pediatric visits to promote good health and development are recommended for all children from infancy through adolescence by the American Academy of Pediatrics.</description>
