  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pragmatic stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial to explore variation in
      doses used for diagnostic CT by pooling radiation dose data across diverse healthcare
      delivery systems.

      To compare different strategies for lowering and optimizing dose and identify the barriers
      and facilitators to implementing successful dose optimization strategies and standardizing
      practice.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are using a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial, collecting
      radiation dose information on CT from across all collaborating health care facilities, and
      leading several different interventions to optimize dose across facilities. In addition to
      collecting the CT radiation dose data, and using these results to provide feedback to the
      collaborating health care facilities, they will be conducting surveys of several individuals
      at each site, including key informants, such as lead radiologists, technologists, and medical
      physicist, and radiology administrators.

      They will compare and identify facilitators and barriers (assessed through surveys of
      participating facilities) associated with successful and failed implementation of dose
      optimization.
