      The HIFLO study evaluates the impact of HFNC oxygen therapy on duration of nCPAP therapy,
      oxygen therapy and hospitalization. The cost of use of CPAP and two HFNC devices are also
      evaluated.

      Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) is widely used in preterm infants as it is
      efficient, but it creates an unfavorable environment for preterm infants. Indeed is a primary
      source of continuous noise in neonatal units and causes discomfort, pain, skin lesions. High
      flow nasal cannula (HFNC) introduced more recently in neonatal care supplies high allowing
      for carbon dioxide nasopharyngeal wash-out, reduction of work of breathing and is well
      tolerated. HFNC could help to improve the environment of preterm infants by reducing
      deleterious stimuli (noise, pain, discomfort) and by facilitating the contact between parents
      and babies. Efficacy of HFNC seems to be similar to other non-invasive respiratory supports
      for preventing treatment failure, death and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The benefits of HFNC
      implementation was only slightly analyzed in extremely preterm infants. the place of HFNC is
      becoming increasingly important in neonatology and could help to improve the quality of care.
      Few HFNC devices are available but their cost of use has not been evaluated in Europe.

      HIFLO study aimed to assess the impact of HFNC therapy introduction, on exposure to nCPAP and
      on the duration of oxygen therapy and hospital stay in preterm infants and in a subgroup of
      extremely preterm infants. The investigators also aim to evaluate the cost of use of nCPAP
      and HFNC using two different devices.

    <description>The study aim to compare two periods, before and after HFNC implementation. During the first period, in 2011, nCPAP (Infant FlowSiPAP) was used as a first-line non-invasive respiratory support. During the second period, in 2014, the use of HFNC support was established as soon as it was possible instead of nCPAP for prevention of apnea, or after extubation, and sometimes in infants with moderate respiratory distress syndrome treated without surfactant. Demographic characteristics, antenatal data, birth characteristics and neonatal morbidities, non-invasive ventilation oxygen administration and HFNC, postnatal steroid therapy, total duration of hospital stay, will be collected from our electronic standardized patient record in which they are prospectively encoded. Simple and multiple linear regression analyses will be used to evaluate the difference of nCPAP therapy duration between Group 1 and Group 2 after adjustment on potential cofactors.</description>

    <description>Cost analysis will be carried out for the three devices: Infant Flow SiPAP, OptiFlow and Precision Flow, including all consumables. To evaluate the costs these devices will be used as recommended by the manufacturers.The calculated costs will be based on an example of three devices in constant use on a 7-day cycle change of the circuits for the Opti-Flow device, and 30-day cycle change for Precision Flow device. Actual costs will be expressed as price per patient per week.</description>
