    <description>One patch of SyB P-1501 contains 10.8 mg of fentanyl hydrochloride (fentanyl 9.7 mg) and produces an electric current to deliver the drug iontophoretically after the system is activated. 40 µg fentanyl per on-demand dose, each delivered over 10 minutes for a maximum of 6 doses/hr for 24 hours or maximum of 80 doses. Each system will inactivate at 80 doses or 24 hours, whichever occurs first.</description>

    <description>After extubation and adequate titration by Fentanyl intravenous injection, the investigational product is applied to outer upper arm or chest on patient who confirmed treatment eligibility. Fentanyl 40 μg per dose is delivered over a 10-minute period by pressing the dosing button by the subject as needed. The 10-minute dosing period is a system lock-out time, allowing for a maximum of 6 doses per hour. One system is operable for 24 hours or until 80 doses are delivered, whichever occurs first.
Duration of application of the investigational product is 24 hours. Duration of application may be extended for up to 72 hours or until the third system is used, whichever occurs first, if the patient requests it and the specified tests can be performed</description>
