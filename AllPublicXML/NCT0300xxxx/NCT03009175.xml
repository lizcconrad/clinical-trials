      The purpose of the study is:

        -  To evaluate the Heart Failure Risk Status (HFRS) feature performance.

        -  To establish the feasibility of remote follow-up in which patient risk triaging is
           performed by nurse-led review of HFRS feature as supplemental information.

        Study population will include patients of both sexes included in the Medtronic CareLink®
        Network and implanted with a Medtronic wireless implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) or
        cardiac resynchronization therapy device with defibrillation capabilities device (CRT-D) at
        Hospital Araba (former Hospital Txagorritxu). There are approximately 223 ICD and CRT-D
        patients included in the CareLink® Network at this site, and average number of
        transmissions per month is ~80, so it is expected that 480 transmissions are received
        during the study duration.

        From this population, less than 10% are implanted with a device without Optivol® feature.
        For these patients we will not have HFRS data.
