      Portal vein tumor invasion (PVT) is a common complication in HCC. the studyb Aimed to assess
      the outcomes after TACE in patients with branch PVT regarding Child classification,
      radiological response and 1 year survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty HCC patients (24 male, 6 females) Child A cirrhotics with branch PVT. Follow up was
      done at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after first TACE. All patients underwent laboratory
      investigations including liver function tests to assess deterioration in liver functions,
      triphasic spiral CT to assess radiological response according to mRECIST criteria. Survival
      analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimations.

    <intervention_name>transarterial chemoembolization versus the standard treatment with sorafinib</intervention_name>
    <description>TACE procedures were performed by the interventional radiologist through femoral artery approach in all patients. Super-selective cannulation of the main feeders was performed using a microcatheter whenever possible. The c-TACE protocol consisted of intra-arterial infusion of cisplatin 50-100 mg mixed with lipiodol ,Just prior to injection, emulsion is prepared by intensive mixing of equal volumes of cytotoxic drug solution and iodized oil using the pumping method with two syringes and a three way stop cock. Injection is guided by fluoroscopy and results in dense accumulation of the emulsion within the tumor vascular bed. Injection of poor iodized oil up to a maximum volume of 10-20 cc is an option and is followed by embolization of feeding arteries by Gelfoam cubes .Endpoints of conventional TACE are complete filling of the tumor vascular bed with iodized oil and stop-flow in subsegmental and segmental feeding arteries..</description>
