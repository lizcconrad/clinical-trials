  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate potential risk factors for developing postpartum
      depression or posttraumatic stress disorder during the first year postpartum in patients who
      have no preexisting history of PTSD or PPD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is theorized that poor pain control during labor and cesarean delivery, non-elective
      inductions, unplanned surgeries such as urgent/emergent cesarean delivery or operating room
      management of postpartum hemorrhage, and opioid abuse/addiction are risk factors for
      developing postpartum depression (PPD) or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after
      delivery. This study will, through questionnaires, interviews, and examination of the medical
      record, seek to identify whether and how strongly such correlations exist during the first
      year postpartum in patients who have no preexisting history of these conditions.

    <measure>Association of poor birth experiences with development of postpartum posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Enrollees will receive questionnaires for Perinatal Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PPQ) screenings 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postpartum. Positive screens are defined as PPQ&gt;19. PPQ&gt;13 will be considered as subsyndromal. At each screening, patients with positive scores will be interviewed to diagnose PTSD and to look for thematic similarities in birth experiences. Patients' medical charts will be reviewed for 4 clinical events: Pain scores &gt;5 with a labor epidural in place; Pain during cesarean delivery requiring general anesthesia, IV narcotics, ketamine, midazolam, nitrous oxide, or reassurance; Non-elective inductions of labor; and Unplanned surgery including urgent/emergent cesarean delivery and postpartum hemorrhage requiring operating room management. Statistical analysis of all 4 PPQ scores and evaluation of clinical birth events will be performed to determine the association of poor birth experiences with postpartum depression.</description>

    <description>Enrollees will receive questionnaires for Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) screenings at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postpartum. Positive screens are defined as EPDS score &gt;10 or a positive response for question 10 asking about suicidality. At each screening, patients with positive scores will be interviewed to diagnose depression and to look for thematic similarities in birth experiences. Patients' medical charts will be reviewed for 4 clinical events: Pain scores &gt;5 with a labor epidural in place; Pain during cesarean delivery requiring general anesthesia, IV narcotics, ketamine, midazolam, nitrous oxide, or reassurance; Non-elective inductions of labor; and Unplanned surgery including urgent/emergent cesarean delivery and postpartum hemorrhage requiring operating room management. Statistical analysis of all 4 EPDS scores and evaluation of clinical birth events will be performed to determine the association of poor birth experiences with postpartum depression.</description>
