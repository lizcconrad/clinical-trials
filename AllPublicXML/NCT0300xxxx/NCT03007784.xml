  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limited treatments are available to improve consciousness in severely brain injured patients.
      Transcranial Direct Current stimulation (tDCS) is one of the few therapeutics that showed
      evidence of efficacy to increase level of consciousness and functional communication in some
      minimally conscious state (MCS) patients, and in some vegetative state (VS) patients. However
      the optimal intensity of electrical current stimulation remains unknown.

      This study will test the effects of two intensities of tDCS stimulation (either 0.2mA or 2mA)
      applied on left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex on both behavior, - assessed by the Coma
      Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) scores -, as well as quantified EEG recorded during resting
      state (using algorithms previously designed and published by the investigators) and
      event-related potentials (using auditory paradigms we previously published) in severely brain
      damaged patients with disorders of consciousness (MCS, VS, and conscious but cognitively
      disabled patients) of various etiologies.

      This study will use a cross-over double-blind design with each patient receiving both current
      intensities in a randomized order during 4 weeks (2 weeks for each tDCS intensity, totalizing
      a number of 10X2 stimulation sessions of 20 minutes each).
