  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to investigate the impact of changing opioid analgesic
      prescribing defaults on the quantity of opioids prescribed for acute non-cancer pain in adult
      primary care and emergency department settings. We will change prescribing defaults for
      select short-acting opioid analgesics including immediate release oxycodone and hydrocodone
      as well as codeine and tramadol, including their co-formulations with acetaminophen. In a
      cluster-randomized trial of matched pairs of Montefiore Medical Center clinical sites,
      stratified by specialty and teaching status, we will evaluate the impact of this intervention
      on patient-level outcomes using 18 months of data (6 months pre-intervention and 12 months
      post-intervention).

    <description>The intervention condition consists of a change to the electronic health record so that new opioid analgesic prescriptions automatically default to 10 pills (i.e., the &quot;quantity dispensed&quot; field is pre-populated). This value is modifiable by providers who can tailor the prescription based on clinical factors.</description>

    <description>The control condition will be the usual electronic health record interface. The default number of pills varies by medication, most medications currently have either a blank default or a default of 30 pills.</description>
