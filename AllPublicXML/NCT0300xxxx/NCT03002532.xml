  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on evidence that radiation-induced damage to the hippocampus plays a considerable role
      in neurocognitive decline after cranial irradiation, hippocampal-sparing whole brain
      radiation therapy (HS-WBRT) has been proposed. This study will investigate the neurocognitive
      function and prognosis between HS-WBRT and conventional WBRT for the treatment of brain
      metastases from breast cancer.
