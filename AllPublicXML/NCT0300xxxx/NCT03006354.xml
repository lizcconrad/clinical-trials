  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, randomised clinical trial the investigators aim to assess if nasal high
      frequency oscillatory ventilation (nHFOV) could be used as the primary modality of
      respiratory support in late preterm and term infants with transient tachypnea of the newborn
      requiring non-invasive ventilation.

      BACKGROUND: Non-invasive High Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation (nHFOV), aims to combine the
      efficacy of high frequency ventilation with the gentleness of non-invasive support and
      current evidence suggests that nHFOV may be superior to other non-invasive modes in terms of
      supporting alveolar ventilation. There are now several published neonatal studies of nHFOV
      therapy as a rescue mode even in the premature infants; however to date no studies have been
      published on the efficacy of nHFOV as a primary mode of non-invasive support. The
      investigators aim to assess the efficacy of nHFOV in late-preterm and term infants with
      transient tachypnea of the newborn as the primary mode of non-invasive support.

      METHOD: The investigators propose to test the effectiveness of nHFOV in late-preterm and term
      neonates with transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) with a Silverman Score of 4 or above
      on admission who require non-invasive respiratory support. Nasal high frequency oscillatory
      ventilation may be effective in decreasing duration of non-invasive respiratory support and
      total oxygen therapy (H1 hypotheses).

      The current literature estimates the incidence of transient tachypnea of the newborn to be
      5.7 per 1000 births. Assuming that a 5% difference of the primary outcome between the groups
      is significant, when the alpha value is set at 0.05 and power of the study at 80%, 220
      infants must be recruited for each arm (nCPAP and nHFOV) under investigation.

      Chest X-ray, complete blood count, C-reactive protein and capillary blood gas analysis (as
      per unit protocol) will be obtained upon admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. A
      Silverman Score will be obtained for each participant upon admission and those with a score
      of 4 and above will be supported with one of the methods (with randomization).

      Initial nHFOV settings are: MAP: 8cmH2O, Frequency:10 MHz, Amplitude:35 cmH2O (will be
      adjusted to achieve adequate chest wall vibration), I:E=1:1 and FiO2: adjusted to keep
      preductal sPO2 between %90-95. Initial nCPAP settings are: PEEP:6 cmH2O and FiO2: adjusted to
      keep preductal sPO2 between %90-95. Failure of the primary mode is defined as FiO2
      requirement of &gt;%60, capillary blood gas obtained at the 4th hour of therapy showing pH&lt;7.20
      or pCO2&gt;65 cmH2O. When nCPAP or nHFOV failure occurs, nasal intermittent positive pressure
      ventilation (nIPPV) will be applied as a rescue therapy with the following settings:
      Frequency:30/min, PIP:18 cmH2O, PEEP:6 cmH2O, inspiration time:0.50 sec., inspiratory flow:10
      L/min, FiO2:adjusted to keep preductal sPO2 between %90-95. If the rescue mode fails, the
      infant will be intubated and conventional mechanical ventilation will be initiated.
