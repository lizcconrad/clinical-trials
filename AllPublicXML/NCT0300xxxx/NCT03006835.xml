  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, single-blind, investigator-initiated, pharmacological
      study with a parallel design. Patients with non-ACS undergoing primary percutaneous coronary
      intervention will be randomized after informed consent, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to the following
      treatment groups:

      Group Α: Domestic Clopidogrel 300mg as a loading dose before PCI, followed by 75mg per day.

      Group B: Domestic Clopidogrel 600mg as a loading dose before PCI, followed by 75mg per day.

      Group B: Imported Clopidogrel 300mg as a loading dose before PCI, followed by 75mg per day.

      Group D: Imported Clopidogrel 600mg as a loading dose before PCI, followed by 75mg per day.

      Platelet inhibition ratio assessment by thrombelastogram will be performed，2 hours after the
      loading dose(Day 0)， 6 hours after thrombelastogram (Day 0), 30 day after thrombelastogram.
      Documentation of major adverse cardiac events (death, myocardial infarction, stroke,
      revascularization procedure with PCI or CABG) and serious adverse events (bleeding, other
      adverse events)will be performed until Day 30.
