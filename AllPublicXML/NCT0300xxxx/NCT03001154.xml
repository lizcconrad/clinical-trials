    <textblock>
      Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) is an efficacious treatment of fear and anxiety, but
      because of the high financial costs and technical complexity of the past generation of VR
      hardware, there has been no large-scale implementation of this promising treatment. The
      present study will investigate whether off-the-shelf, commercial VR hardware and software can
      be used as stimuli material to conduct in-session exposure therapy for speech anxiety. The
      study will recruit n=25+25 participants from the general public suffering from substantial
      speech anxiety, who will be randomized to either a waiting-list, or one-session VRET with a
      therapist, followed by four weeks of a progressive maintenance program encouraging in-vivo
      exposure. The waiting-list group will then receive an Internet-delivered VRET treatment
      program.
