  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Altered interplay between gut mucosa and dysbiotic bacteria during HIV infection seems to
      contribute to chronic immune dysfunction. Manipulation of the intestinal microbiota with
      nutritional interventions exert limited immunologic effects, but a deep understanding of how
      these interventions could ameliorate gut dysbiosis and influence health among HIV-infected
      individuals remain unexplored. In this Phase I clinical trial, 30 HIV-infected subjects on
      effective ART with evidence of persistent immune dysfunction, indicated by a CD4/CD8 ratio&lt;1
      will be included and randomized to either repeated low-dose oral fecal microbiota
      transplantation or placebo during 8 weeks. The primary outcome will be safety. Secondary
      outcomes will include changes in CD4+ T cell counts, CD8+ T cell counts, CD4/CD8 ratio,
      inflammatory markers, T cell activation and markers of enterocyte barrier function through
      week 48. Engraftment on host microbiota will be examined using Illumina sequencing of the
      V3-V4 16S RNA, and changes in bacterial metabolism and in the plasma metabolite fingerprint
      will be studied by combination of untargeted mass spectrometry and two different and
      complementary separation techniques in bacterial and plasma samples.
