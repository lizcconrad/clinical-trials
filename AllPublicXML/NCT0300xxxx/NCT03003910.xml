  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to test the efficacy of a positive psychological intervention for
      promoting positive emotions and optimistic thinking in eating disordered patients.
      Participants are randomly assigned to receive the positive intervention or the control
      condition, which consists on thinking about daily activities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eating disorders (ED) are very difficult conditions to treat. Therefore, interventions in
      this field are shifting their main target towards the disorder's impact in quality of life,
      rather than ED symptomatology in itself. In this sense, a focus in the promotion of positive
      emotions and well-being is emerging in order to buffer from the harmful effects caused by ED.

      Positive psychological interventions have shown efficacy in the promotion of positive
      emotions and well-being. In this sense, one of these interventions is called Best Possible
      Self (BPS), since is aimed to enhance positive emotions and well-being. Specifically, BPS is
      a positive future thinking technique, which requires people to envision themselves in the
      future, after everything has gone as good as it possibly could. This exercise has shown
      efficacy improving optimism, future expectancies and positive affect compared to a control
      condition, in general population and depressive patients.

      Furthermore, the progress of Information and Communication Technologies, has allowed the
      development of technology applications and devices that could enhance the quality of
      experience and the well-being levels. This approach is called Positive Technology and it can
      be used as a complement to positive psychological interventions. Positive Technology can be
      defined as the scientific and applied approach to improve the quality of our personal
      experience trying to increase wellness and generate strengths.

      Taking into account the prior literature, the aim of the present study is to carry out a
      randomized controlled study with ED patients in order to explore if BPS is able to produce
      improvements in different well-being and clinical measures. The exercise will be applied
      through a Positive Technology system. The design employed in this study is similar to the
      used in other studies.

      Five assessment moments were used: Before the exercise (baseline), after the first session
      (day 1) and post-training (1 month). Moreover, two follow-ups were included: one month after
      finishing the training period (1st follow-up) and three months after finishing the training
      (2nd follow-up)

    <measure>Subjective Probability Task (SPT; MacLeod, 1996). Change assessment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, day 1, 1 month, 2 months, 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale measures positive and negative expectancies about future events. It consists of 20 statements referring to negative expectancies and 10 statements referring to positive expectancies. Participants answer on a 7-point scale (Not at all likely to occur - Extremely likely to occur). Some studies have found an appropriate levels of internal consistency for positive and negative expectancies (α=0.80-0.82 y 0.91, respectively).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS, Watson, Clark &amp; Tellegen, 1988; Sandín et al., 1999). Change assessment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, day 1, 1 month, 2 months, 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>To measure affect, the Spanish adaptation of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale was used (PANAS, Sandín et al., 1999; Watson, Clark &amp; Tellegen, 1988). This instrument is composed of 20 items: 10 items measuring positive affective states and 10 items measuring negative affect states. Participants rate on a five-point scale (from &quot;Not at all&quot; to &quot;Extremely&quot;) the degree to which they usually feel a specific affective state. PANAS is one of the most widely-used instruments to measure affect because it shows excellent psychometric properties (Cronbach Alpha's from 0.87-0.91).</description>

    <measure>Life Orientation Test (Lot-R; Otero, Luengo, Romero Gómez &amp; Castro, 1998; Scheier, Carver &amp; Bridges, 1994). Change assessment.</measure>

    <measure>General Self Efficacy Scale-12 (GSES-12; Bosscher et al., 1997; Herrero et al., 2014). Change assessment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 2 months, 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire evaluates a general dimension and three aspects of self-efficacy: initiative, persistence and effort. The internal consistency coefficients for the subscales varied from excellent to good (Initiative = 0.83; Effort =0.77; Persistence = 0.80; and Total = 0.86).</description>

    <measure>Dispositional Hope Scale (DHS; Snyder et al., 1991). Change assessment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 2 months, 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument evaluates dispositional hope. It is composed of 12 items (Agency: 4 items; Pathways= 4 items; Fillers= 4 items), with an 8-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (definitely false) to 8 (definitely true). Internal consistency coefficient (Cronbach's alpha) for the total scale was excellent (.89).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Concordant Motivation (SCM; Sheldon &amp; Elliot, 1999)</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument assesses participants' initial motivation to do the assigned exercise. It explores the different reasons for the participants to carry out the exercise. The scale is composed of 4 items whose goal is to find out whether the motivation is intrinsic or extrinsic. A total score is obtained by subtracting the two extrinsic motivation scores from the two intrinsic motivation scores.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This scale assesses the neuroticism level of the individual, showing if he is stable or neurotic. This subscale is composed by 12 items of dicotomic response (yes-not). Regarding psychometric properties, Eysenck and Eysenck (1997) got an alpha coefficient between 0-73 and 0.82.</description>

    <measure>Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26; Garner, Olmsted, Bohr &amp; Garfinkel, 1982)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire assesses a broad range of attitudes and behaviors related to anorexia nervosa. It is composed of 26 items rated on a 6-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 6 (always), based on the frequency with which the individual carries out the behavior or has the thought described by the item. The instrument has shown excellent psychometric properties (Toro, Castro, Garcia, Perez &amp; Cuesta, 1989; Rivas, Bersabé, Jiménez &amp; Berrocal, 2010).</description>

    <description>Participants are asked to write and imagine about a future in which they have reached all their goals and they have developed all their potentialities in four different domains: personal, professional, social and health domain.
They carry out the exercise in a Positive Technology System called the &quot;Book of Life&quot;, which has shown efficacy in the enhancement of positive mood (Baños, Etchemendy, Farfallini, García-Palacios, Quero &amp; Botella, 2014). This application looks like a personal diary, where participants can write all that they want and these essays are supported by multimedia content (pictures, songs and videos). Additionally, they can continue doing the exercise in a web platform in which they can visualize all the content they had developed previously.</description>
