  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be recruited from participating institutions prior to planned routine care EGD
      with WATS3D brush samples and forceps biopsies. Eligibility will be reviewed and patients who
      are potentially eligible for the study will be approached regarding the study. If interested,
      participants will be consented and proceed with routine care EGD. The study coordinator or
      other research personnel will document information from the routine care endoscopy as part of
      this research study. Follow-up information collected will include WATS3D cytology and forceps
      biopsy pathology results from any routine care endoscopy performed during the course of
      participation in the study, any surgeries received and related to their condition, and any
      other care received as part of their condition. WATS3D samples will be sent to CDx
      Diagnostics for analysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Both males and females at least 18 years of age undergoing EGD to evaluate signs or
             symptoms suggestive of upper gastrointestinal disease.

          2. Patients with known GERD undergoing a screening EGD with accompanying WATS3D biopsies
             and forceps biopsies.

          3. Patients with known BE undergoing a surveillance EGD with accompanying WATS3D biopsies
             and forceps biopsies.

          4. Patients with a known prior history (recent or remote) of dysplasia of either
             indefinite, low grade or high-grade, or intramucosal adenocarcinoma undergoing a
             surveillance EGD with accompanying WATS3D biopsies and forceps biopsies.

          5. Patients who have undergone radiofrequency ablation orcryoablation who are undergoing
             surveillance EGD with accompanying WATS3D biopsies and forceps biopsies will be
             included in the study. The results of this group of patients will be analyzed
             separately from patients undergoing screening and surveillance who have not been
             ablated.

          6. Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved consent must be signed by patients to
             participate in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who on their initial evaluation have a visible highly suspicious lesion, such
             as a nodule or ulcer, (noted while undergoing endoscopy) that requires targeted biopsy
             will be excluded from the study.

          2. Patients who do not undergo both Forceps Biopsy and WATS3D biopsy of the esophagus.
             Subsequent endoscopic evaluation may include forceps biopsies alone, WATS3D biopsies
             alone, both forceps and WATS3D biopsies, or no biopsies.

          3. Patients with visible lesions that are either submucosal or covered with intact
             epithelium.
