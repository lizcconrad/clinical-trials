      This is a prospective unblinded, randomized trial for the use of Fecal Microbiota

      This is a prospective open-label, randomized trial for the use of Fecal Microbiota
      Transplantation (FMT) for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis (UC), in combination with or
      without antibiotic pretreatment.

      This trial involves 11 study visits at UCSF in San Francisco, CA.

      The routes of administration will be via colonoscopy for all subjects with maintenance
      therapy administered orally (i.e. using encapsulated FMT) for half of the subjects and per
      rectum by enema in the other half of the subjects. Additionally, the utility of pretreatment
      antibiotics will be assessed.
