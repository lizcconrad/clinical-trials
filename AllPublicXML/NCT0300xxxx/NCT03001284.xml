    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS), debilitating disease involving primarily the central nervous system,
      may cause cardiovascular dysfunction, due to autonomous nervous system dysfunction, physical
      invalidity, increased oxidative stress, and systemic inflammatory status, but the detailed
      mechanisms are not elucidated. The investigators aimed to assess left and right ventricular
      (LV and RV) function, left atrial (LA) function, arterial function, and
      atrial-ventricular-arterial coupling in patients with MS, compared to control subjects. LV
      systolic and diastolic function and RV function were assessed by 2D- and 3D-
      echocardiography, tissue Doppler, and speckle tracking echocardiography. LA function was
      assessed by LA volume index and LA strain. Arterial remodeling and stiffness were assessed by
      intima media-thickness, pulse wave velocity, and parameters of wave intensity and endothelial
      function
