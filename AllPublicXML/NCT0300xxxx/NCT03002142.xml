  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer disease is a neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies suggest that subjects with
      hearing loss are more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease. Hearing loss can be consecutive
      to presbycusis and/or to central auditory dysfunction.

      Standard audiometric measures with pure tone and speech intelligibility allow the diagnosis
      of presbycusis. However, to demonstrate central auditory dysfunction, specific audiometric
      tests as noisy and/or dichotic tests, are needed.

      Actually, no consensus exists to investigate hearing loss in people with Alzheimer's disease;
      therefore hearing loss may be an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. Until now,
      investigations and clinical procedure related to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease ignored
      the hearing ability of the patient. However, the major part of care management and
      investigations implies the patient's communication ability with caregivers. Hearing loss may
      be one of the most unrecognized deficit in subjects with Alzheimer's disease. Auditory
      rehabilitation with hearing aids could benefit to the patient to decrease cognitive decline
      but this management must be investigate during longitudinal studies in order to demonstrate
      their efficiency and need to be compared with a placebo.
