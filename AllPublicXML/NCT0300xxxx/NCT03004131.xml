             To be eligible for Visit 3, a subject must additionally comply with the following
             criteria during Visit 2 EEC:

          6. Demonstrate adequate symptomology:

             - TNSS ≥ 6/12 on at least two ePDAT™ time point assessments during hours 0-2 in the

             Additionally, subjects will be required to meet a score of at least 2/3 for runny nose
             at least twice during hours 0-2 in the EEC, with at least one occurring during the
             last two time points.

             To be eligible for randomisation (Visit 3), a subject must additionally comply with
             the following criteria:

          7. Demonstrate adequate symptomology:

               -  TNSS ≥ 6/12 on at least two ePDAT™ time point assessments during hours 0-2 in the
                  EEC (Visit 3), with at least one occurring during the last two time points.
                  Additionally, subjects will be required to meet a score of at least 2/3 for runny
                  nose at least twice during hours 0-2 in the EEC, with at least one occurring
                  during the last two time points.

               -  No evidence of complete nasal blockage on either one or both sides on anterior
                  rhinoscopy within 30 minutes prior to dosing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Safety concerns:

          1. History of allergic reaction to fluticasone propionate, azelastine hydrochloride,
             loratadine, or one of the excipients of the study treatments (e.g. benzalkonium
             chloride, phenylethyl alcohol, microcrystalline cellulose) or a component of the
             container.

          2. History of anaphylaxis, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal,
             haematological, endocrine, metabolic, psychiatric, neurological, or other disease at
             screening that may affect subject safety during the study or evaluation of the study
             endpoints at the discretion of the Investigator and/or designee.

          3. Subjects with a current diagnosis of asthma or subjects with measured FEV1 &lt;75% of the
             predicted value.

          4. Pregnant, breast-feeding or planning a pregnancy during the study and women of

             those which result in a low failure rate (i.e. &lt;1% per year) when used consistently
             and correctly such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, hormonal
             IUDs, tubal ligation or vasectomised partner started at least 4 weeks prior to
             screening.

             Lack of suitability for the study:

          5. Previous and concomitant treatments: use of prohibited therapies (Antihistaminic

             ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, cimetidine, rifampicin, St.
             John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) etc.], Tricyclic antidepressants and MAO inhibitors
             ); and use of any medication considered to have an influence on the outcome of the
             study during the EEC session, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or designee.

             response to the causative allergen, at the discretion of the Investigator. Subjects
             with a positive SPT for cats and/or dogs are acceptable if the subject avoids cats
             and/or dogs for the duration of the study.

          7. Concomitant diseases: abnormalities during the screening visit that might interfere
             with study results as determined by the Investigator and/or designee.

             including acute conjunctivitis or any other ocular infection.

         10. History of increased ocular pressure, glaucoma and/or cataracts.

         11. Tuberculosis, untreated local or systemic fungal or bacterial infections, systemic
             viral or parasitic infections or ocular herpes simplex.

             Investigator.

         13. Exposure to chickenpox or measles within 4 weeks prior to the screening visit or
             during the study.

         14. History of chronic sinusitis or history of non-allergic rhinitis.

         15. Exposure to another investigational product within the last 30 days prior to
             screening.

         16. History of malignancy within the past five years, except for basal cell skin
             carcinomas that have been treated with no recurrence for at least 3 months.

         17. Neurological or psychiatric disease or drug or alcohol abuse which would interfere
             with the subject's proper completion of the protocol assignment. Subjects with a
             positive urine drug screen will be excluded.

         18. Subjects undergoing surgical procedures with general anaesthesia within 90 days prior
             to screening or who plan to undergo surgery/hospitalization during the study.

         19. Vulnerable subjects (such as persons kept in detention).
