      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized
      nanoparticle formulation (nab-paclitaxel)/rituximab-coated nanoparticle AR160 in treating
      patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back or is not responding to
      treatment. Nab-paclitaxel/rituximab-coated nanoparticle AR160 is a combination of paclitaxel
      albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and rituximab. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may interfere with
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving paclitaxel albumin-stabilized
      nanoparticle formulation and rituximab may work better in treating patients with B-cell
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of nab-paclitaxel/rituximab-coated
      nanoparticle AR160 (AR160) in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma
      (NHL). (Phase I)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the toxicity and safety of AR160. II. To assess complete response rate (CR)
      progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) of AR160 with relapsed/refractory
      B-cell NHL.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of AR160 in two formal PK studies, dose 1 of cycle 1 (48
      hours [h] PK analysis) and dose 1 of cycle 2 (24h PK analysis).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive nab-paclitaxel/rituximab-coated nanoparticle AR160 intravenously (IV) over
      30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5
      years.
