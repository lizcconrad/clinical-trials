  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early Aspiration Pneumonia is a frequent and dreadful complication in survivors of cardiac
      arrest. Therapeutic Hypothermia widely used in Intensive Care Unit for its benefice on post
      cardiac arrest syndrome may otherwise hide signs of early pneumonia that may occur without
      use of a reliable screening biological marker. The goal is to assess the diagnostic accuracy
      of bronchial alpha amylase measure to predict a risk of early aspiration pneumonia in
      patients successfully resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

      In this prospective non interventional study we included patients resuscitated after cardiac
      arrest and treated with Targeted Temperature Management (TTM). A distal bronchoalveolar
      lavage using specific display (Combi-Cath) was executed immediately after admission for each
      patient with both biochemic and bacteriological analysis including dosage of bronchial
      salivary alpha amylase. Urea was used as a marker of dilution in the measure of bronchial and
      plasmatic alpha amylase. Aspiration pneumonia diagnosis was established with clinical and
      biological criteria. On this basis we intended to determine a threshold measure of alpha
      amylase predicting occurrence of aspiration pneumonia and allowing a guidance in
      antibiotherapy prescription. Sensibility and Specificity of this technique were determined.
