  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a new form of bupivacaine, called Exparel, which can be injected into the eye socket
      during surgery and may provide pain relief for up to 72 hours. The purpose of the study is to
      compare the plain bupivacaine injection to Exparel, to see if one medication works better
      than the other.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During eye removal surgery, bupivacaine is injected, which is a numbing medicine that helps
      with pain, but it lasts for only 4 to 8 hours. After eye removal, some patients have pain in
      the eye socket that lasts for several days or up to a week. While this pain can be treated
      with broad based prescription pain medication, but this may cause side effects, therefore if
      Exparel reduces the need for additional pain medication, patients may experience better
      recovery.
