    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and
      pharmaco-dynamic effects of KA2507 and establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Patients
      with PD-L1 expressing solid tumors which have relapsed or are refractory to prior treatment
      will be eligible to participate in this study.

      Following completion of the multiple ascending dose study, the protocol may be amended to
      include expansion cohorts in patients with melanoma and/or other solid tumors.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and
      pharmaco-dynamic effects of KA2507 and establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Patients
      with PD-L1 expressing solid tumors which have relapsed or are refractory to prior treatment
      will be eligible to participate in this study.

      Following completion of the multiple ascending dose study, the protocol may be amended to
      include expansion cohorts in patients with melanoma and/or other solid tumors.

      This is a multiple ascending dosing (MAD) study of up to 5 treatment regimens cohorts based
      on using a 3+3 design (up to 30 patients overall). The principal objective is to establish
      the maximum tolerated dose, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in blood
      and urine of this HDAC6 inhibitor in patients with solid tumors and to explore effects on
      pharmacodynamic markers of target engagement and response to treatment.

      Daily/twice daily doses will be given as open label monotherapy. A review of safety and PK
      data will be conducted once the last patient in each cohort reaches day 28 of treatment. The
      review will confirm the dose to be used for the subsequent cohort. Dose escalation will be
      continued until the MTD is reached. Upon completion of the dose escalation phase of the
      study, dose expansion phases will be planned.

      Patients responding to treatment may elect to remain on therapy until disease progression,
      death or the investigator decides to stop treatment.

    <description>KA2507, an orally-active new chemical entity, is a potent and selective inhibitor of the HDAC6 enzyme, with potential clinical utility in the treatment of melanoma and other solid tumors. KA2507 has been shown to display potent in vitro activity in a range of cancer cell lines, including melanoma cell lines. KA2507 exerts potent in vivo efficacy in a syngeneic model of B16 melanoma. Here, the combination of the agent's direct tumor growth inhibition and metastasis suppression, coupled with its immunotherapeutic activity - demonstrated by decreased expression of STAT-3 and PD-L1 and increased expression of acetylated tubulin, gp100 and MHC Class I in tumors - have been observed.</description>
