    <textblock>
      This study is a controlled trial which compares the effect of zinc, beta-carotene, and
      Vitamin D3 supplementation in pregnant women which has preterm birth. The measured outcome is
      zinc, vitamin A, and 25(OH)D level in serum and placenta, MyD88, TRIF, NFκB, and IL-1β levels
      in placenta.

      The research will be held in Cipto Mangunkusumo General and Budi Kemuliaan Hospital.

      Each participant of each group will be given the medication of preterm birth hospital
      protocol, which includes nifedipine 4x10 mg as tocolytic agent, dexamethasone 2x6 mg
      intravenous for 2 days which aims to support lung maturation, and antibiotic. Then, the blood
      sample is obtained for zinc, vitamin A and 25(OH)D levels examination. Subjects will be
      divided into 2 groups which are group whose given the oral zinc 50 mg/day, oral beta-carotene
      25,000 IU and oral vitamin D3 50,000 IU/week supplementation, and group who is not given the
      intervention. Each participant will be observed until delivery. After delivery, level of
      zinc, vitamin A, and 25(OH)D in serum and placenta will be measured, as well as level of
      MyD88, TRIF, NFκB, and IL-1β in placenta.
