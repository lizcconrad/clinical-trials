  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study seeks to compare visual acuity, tomographic outcomes, biomechanical
      changes and inflammatory profile of normal eyes (matched for age, refraction and corneal
      thickness) undergoing iDesign and SMILE procedure. The hypothesis is that iDesign may deliver
      equivalent or better clinical outcomes than SMILE, by removing less tissue and correcting for
      higher order aberrations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      iDesign is a promising new technique to treat myopia with astigmatism using ocular
      aberrations measured with a high resolution wavefront sensor.[1,2] Early studies with iDesign
      platform has established its safety and efficacy in correction of myopia with fewer patients
      reporting night vision problems.[1,2] In keratoconus, iDesign has also provided excellent
      outcomes following collagen crosslinking.3 SMILE is a recent technique that eliminates
      creation of flap and appears to achieve similar refractive outcomes as conventional LASIK but
      with less dryness, less inflammation and faster wound healing.[4,5] SMILE corrects lower
      order aberrations only.[4,5] Thus, a comparative assessment of iDesign and SMILE is necessary
      since iDesign can potentially give better visual outcomes with lower volume of tissue
      removal. If lower volume of tissue is removed, it is also hypothesized that the corneal would
      be more stable biomechanically.[5] Further, SMILE does not provide any correction of higher
      order aberrations. With the inclusion of higher order aberrations in the iDesign treatment
      plan, it is hypothesized that both short and long term outcomes will be better with iDesign
      than with SMILE.
