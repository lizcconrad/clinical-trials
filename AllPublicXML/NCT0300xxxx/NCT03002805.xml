      This study evaluates the combination of CBT-1® and doxorubicin for the treatment of
      metastatic, unresectable sarcoma in patients who have progressed after treatment with
      150mg/m2 or less of doxorubicin. Participants will receive CBT-1® on days 1-7 of each 21-day
      cycle, as well as doxorubicin on days 5 and 6.
