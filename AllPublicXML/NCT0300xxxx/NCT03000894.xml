  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of transdiagnostic nurse-administered
      4-session group cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) plus standard care,
      compared to standard care alone, for improving sleep and daytime function, enhancing
      recovery, preventing relapses, and reducing medication burden in patients with the first
      episode of mood disorders.
