      The aim of the present study is to investigate and report on the psychometric properties of a
      Greek version of the Chronic Pain Grade Questionnaire (CPGQ).

    <textblock>
      The Chronic Pain Grade Questionnaire (CPGQ) is designed to evaluate overall severity of
      chronic pain based on two dimensions, pain intensity and pain-related disability. Currently,
      there is no reliable, valid and sensitive to change self-report instrument as brief and easy
      to understand and complete as the CPGQ available in Greek. A culturally adapted version of
      the CPGQ would facilitate the study of chronic pain and its implications in the Greek
      population and allow for cross-cultural comparisons. The aim of the present study is to
      examine the validity, reliability and responsiveness of a Greek version of the CPGQ in
      chronic hip pain sufferers.
