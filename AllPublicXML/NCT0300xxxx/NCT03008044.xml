  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center prospective study. The purpose of this study is to assess the
      performance of FiberSense system across the glucose measurement ranges (from hypoglycemia to
      hyperglycemia) as compared with a gold standard reference laboratory method (YSI glucose) in
      healthy volunteers.

      The FiberSense system is intended to be used by diabetic patients in a home use setting as a
      CGM system using the interstitial fluid (ISF) glucose as an indicator of blood glucose
      levels.The purpose of this study is to assess the performance of FiberSense system across the
      glucose measurement ranges (from hypoglycemia to hyperglycemia) as compared with a gold
      standard reference laboratory method (YSI glucose) in healthy volunteers.

    <intervention_model_description>For the first 10 subjects, all sensors will be removed after the end of the clamp measurement day.
The last 2 subjects will continue to wear the three sensors after the clamp study. The second clamp study will take place at Day 7±1. After the second clamp study, the commercial CGM sensor will be removed. The two FiberSense sensors will be worn for up to Day 14.</intervention_model_description>
