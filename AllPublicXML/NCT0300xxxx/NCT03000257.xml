  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I, dose-escalation study to determine the recommended Phase 2
      dose (RPTD), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK)
      profile of ABBV-181. This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of ABBV-181 in
      combination with Rovalpituzumab Tesirine. The study will consist of 2 parts: ABBV-181
      monotherapy dose escalation and expansion, and ABBV-181 in combination with Rovalpituzumab
      Tesirine.

    <description>In the Monotherapy Escalation portion of the study, ABBV-181 will be administered at escalating dose levels in 28-day dosing cycles (2 doses per cycle). Based on available safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic data from the dose-escalation part of the study, participants will be enrolled in tumor-specific dose-expansion cohorts to further evaluate ABBV-181 at a dose level which is at or below the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD). In the Monotherapy Expansion portion of the study, ABBV-181 will be administered in 28-day dosing cycles at either 1 dose per cycle or 2 doses per cycle.
In the Combination portion of the study, ABBV-181 will be administered in combination with Rovalpituzumab Tesirine in 21-day dosing cycles. Based on available safety, PK and PD data from the single agent dose-escalation part of the study, a dose for ABBV-181 will be selected to evaluate in combination with Rovalpituzumab Tesirine.</description>

             therapy except for alopecia.

             leukemia, solid organ transplantation, or previous clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis.
