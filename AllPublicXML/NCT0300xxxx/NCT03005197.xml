  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Teeth injuries are considered one of the most challenging events that occur in dentistry,
      especially in children. After an injury, there is a possibility that the blood supply to the
      tooth may become affected and compromised leading to nerve and blood vessels death with the
      tooth described as a non-vital tooth.

      The conventional diagnostic tools available to assess tooth nerve/blood supply are not always
      reliable. Child cooperation and understanding contribute greatly to this shortfall. Failure
      to assess the vitality of the tooth may result in pain, swelling or infection of the tooth or
      de-vitalising a normal tooth which may render the tooth weak for the future and possibly
      losing the tooth.

      The laser Doppler flowmetry is a non-invasive, non-painful technique and shown to be more
      reliable than the traditional techniques. We aim to assess if this device can predict and
      assess whether the tooth is alive or dead during the follow up visits of the injury along the
      other conventional tests.

      A clinical study will be carried out which consists of a one year follow up to monitoring
      traumatised front teeth in children attending the department of paediatric dentistry.

      The vitality/sensibility of traumatised teeth will be assessed using laser Doppler flowmetry,
      electrical pulp testing and ethyl chloride. Measurements will be performed by a single
      operator (chief investigator) and will be carried out at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months
      follow up period.

          -  Have at least one traumatised anterior tooth, regardless of the type of trauma, with
             uncertain pulpal vitality requiring monitoring for a minimum of 12 months and minimal
             coronal restoration (covering less than half the labial crown surface).

          -  Have at least one vital and non-traumatised anterior tooth to act as a control.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medically and mentally compromised children.

          -  Children with learning disabilities.

          -  Children with communication barrier including those unable to communicate using
             English language.

          -  Heavily restored teeth covering more than half the labial surface of teeth.
