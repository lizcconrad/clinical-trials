  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pilot multicenter randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the clinical
      effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and safety of Doin (conduction exercise) with acupuncture
      for chronic neck pain patients compared to acupuncture alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pilot multicenter randomized controlled, parallel, assessor-blinded trial will be conducted
      to evaluate the comparative clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Doin (conduction
      exercise) with acupuncture for chronic neck pain patients with acupuncture alone as assessed
      by pain and functional disability scales, monitor its safety, and assess the feasibility of
      and serve as the basis for a full-scale, multicenter trial.

             hemorrhagic diseases, blood clotting disorders, history of anti-coagulation medicine
             intake, severe diabetes with high risk of infection, severe cardiovascular diseases)

          -  Patients who were treated with invasive interventions such as acupuncture or
             injections, or with medicine that may potentially influence pain such as NSAIDs
             (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs) within the past week

          -  History of cervical surgery within the past 3 months

          -  Pregnancy or plans of pregnancy
