  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prospectively determine the most appropriate inseminated volume in donor IUI cycles. It is
      hypothesized that if the procedure is performed with 0.5 mL instead of 0.2, higher clinical
      pregnancy rates will be achieved by promoting higher sperm densities in the fallopian tubes
      at the time of ovulation by decreasing the amount of sperm cells lost during preparation and
      handling.

      A prospective RCT will be performed, including patients undergoing dIUI under ovulation
      induction. The trial is established to compare two inseminated volumes, 0.2 ml (control
      group) and 0.5 mL (study group), and will be conducted at the Reproductive Medicine Service
      of the Dexeus Women's Health Center. The Institutional Review Board has approved the research
      project and an informed consent will be obtained from all patients participating to the
      study.

      All patients will undergo a full infertility investigation including hormonal evaluation
      between day 2 and day 5 of the cycle and confirmation of patency of the Fallopian tubes.
      Patients eligible for the study are between 18 and 40 years old, with regular menstrual
      cycles (21 - 35 days). Indications for the use of donor sperm are male factor infertility due
      to azoospermia or severe oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (requiring donor sperm), the presence
      of a heritable genetic disorder in the male partner, a single-parent request or same-sex
      couples' partners undergoing IUI. Exclusion criteria are the presence of tubal factor
      infertility, ≥grade III endometriosis, more than 3 previous dIUI cycles, or patients in whom
      ≥3 follicles &gt;14mm are observed during the cycle. The randomization procedure will take place
      the day the donor IUI procedure. The randomization will be performed on the IUI cycle level.
      Randomization into one of the two groups will be performed using an open computer-generated
      list.

      IUI will be performed with a Wallace® catheter depositing 0.2 or 0.5 ml of the sperm sample
      at the uterine fundus. All IUIs will be performed between 12 p.m. and 4 pm. After the
      procedure, 10 min of bed rest will be prescribed. Inseminations will be performed every day
      of the week, including weekends.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients will undergo a full infertility investigation including hormonal
             evaluation between day 2 and day 5 of the cycle and confirmation of patency of the
             Fallopian tubes.

          -  Patients eligible for the study are between 18 and 40 years old and with regular
             menstrual cycles (21 - 35 days). Indications for the use of donor sperm are severe
             male factor infertility requiring donor sperm, the presence of a heritable genetic
             disorder in the male partner, a single-parent request or same-sex couples' partners
             undergoing IUI.

          -  Exclusion criteria are the presence of tubal factor infertility, grade III-IV
             endometriosis, more than 3 previous failed dIUI cycles, or patients in whom ≥3
             follicles &gt;14mm are observed during the IUI cycle. Patients will be included in the
             study only once. The randomization will be performed on the IUI cycle level. The group
             allocation will take place the day the dIUI and the biologist will randomized all
             included patients into one of the two groups using an open computer-generated list.
