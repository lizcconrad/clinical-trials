  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective and cross-sectional analysis of standard of care for facial paralysis
      involving the cross-face nerve graft in the past 20 years.

        -  Imagery analysis

        -  Questionnaires

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will retrospectively and cross sectionally analyze all patients treated
      with a cross-face nerve graft and another nerve transfer in our institution by image analysis
      and sending out quality of life questionnaires.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Symmetry of the mouth</measure>
    <time_frame>March 2016 - October 2016</time_frame>
    <description>Symmetry of the mouth expressed as the difference in millimeters between the position of the affected and the healthy corner of the mouth on a picture. An ideal symmetry would be 0 mm. Measured with the FACE-gram software.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Excursion of the mouth</measure>
    <time_frame>March 2016 - October 2016</time_frame>
    <description>Excursion of the mouth expressed as the difference in millimeters between the position of the affected corner of the mouth in repose and with smile on a picture. Measured with the FACE-gram software.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease-specific quality-of-life</measure>
    <time_frame>March 2016 - October 2016</time_frame>
    <description>A validated self-reported disease-specific quality-of-life questionnaire was used (Facial Clinimetric Evaluation scale). On which patients can score anything between 0 and 100 points (100 being healty).</description>
