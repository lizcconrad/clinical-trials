      Rationale: There is increasing evidence that obesity may be a risk factor for frailty in the
      elderly. Obesity favors a state of chronic inflammation and insulin resistance, involves a
      fatty infiltration of the muscle and an increased cardiovascular risk and, in addition, obese
      people usually perform less physical activity. All this favors the loss of mass and muscular
      function (sarcopenia), a key component of the fragility and the functional deterioration.

      Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal intervention to lose weight in the
      prevention of frailty in obese elderly people, as well as to know the main mechanisms
      involved in the frailty process.

      Methodology: Design: Controlled, randomized, open-label clinical trial with two parallel
      intervention arms and 2 years follow-up. Study population: People between 65 and 75 years of
      age, obese (BMI ≥30), without criteria of fragility and living in the community. Study
      intervention: multimodal and personalized intervention with the support of a &quot;personal
      trainer&quot; that has two main axes of action: a) diet: assessment of nutritional status and
      nutritional requirements and establishment of personalized nutritional plan with monthly
      dietetic controls and b) physical exercise: a multi-component physical exercise program that
      will include aerobic exercise and strengthening, balance and flexibility exercises as well as
      a weekly group session of health education, during six months. Main outcome measures (to be
      evaluated annually for 2 years): Fragility (according to the L Fried criteria) and Sarcopenia
      (according to the criteria of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People
      -EWGSOP). Sarcopenia is considered if there is a decrease in gait velocity or muscle grip
      strength (measured with a dynamometer) and a decrease in muscle mass assessed by bioimpedance
      (BIA). Intermediate outcome measures (at 6, 12 and 24 months): a) weight loss, b) changes in
      body composition and distribution of body fat, c) glycemic control (HbA1) and insulin
      resistance (by HOMA index (HOmeostasis Model Assessment)), d) cardiovascular risk according
      to the REGICOR algorithm, e) functional capacity (according to Barthel Index and 2 Minute
      Walking Test), f) inflammatory markers (IL-6, CRP(C reactive protein), TNF(Tumor Necrosis
      Factor)-alpha and leptin) and g) anabolic hormones (IGF-1, ghrelin and testosterone).
