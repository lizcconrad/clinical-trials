  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the metabolite concentrations within the
      anterior cingulate cortex and periaqueductal gray matter predict the intensity and
      interference of neuropathic pain after the development of chronic whiplash syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persistent chronic pain is a common symptom of whiplash leading to reduced quality of life.
      Little information is available regarding changes in brain processing areas and change in
      central sensitization to noxious input during the chronic phase of whiplash. Metabolite
      concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex and periaqueductal gray matter may be
      predictors of neuropathic pain and these changes may explain the development of central
      sensitization in people with chronic whiplash.

      Until now, there is not any study that show this approach.

    <arm_group_label>Whiplash-Pain</arm_group_label>
    <description>Subjects with chronic whiplash syndrome and pain. The inclusion criteria for pain include the presence of daily pain during the previous 8 weeks. Specifically, pain will be diagnosed based on the pain intensity measured on the 0 to 10 numerical rating scale. The minimum will be 2 points. Subjects will be recruited between the 4 months until 2 years after the whiplash.</description>

    <description>Subjects with chronic whiplash syndrome and pain. The inclusion criteria for pain include the ausence of daily pain during the previous 8 weeks. Specifically, pain will be diagnosed based on the pain intensity measured on the 0 to 10 numerical rating scale. The maximun will be 2 points. Subjects will be recruited between the 4 months until 2 years after the whiplash.</description>

    <intervention_name>Spectroscopy</intervention_name>
    <description>Spectroscopy is a noninvasive method to assess brain chemistry. The signal of the hydrogen atom attached to a certain molecule or metabolite has a particular frequency associated with a given metabolite. The utility of Spectroscopy is based on the fact thet the nuclei of atoms have magnetic properties that can be used to obtain chemical information regarding both the type of molecule and it is concentration.
The subjects will be scanned on a 3-T Siemens system and an 12-channel phased-array coil will be used to provide an optimum signal-to-noise ratio for spectroscopy data.</description>

    <description>Questionnaires are important to assess the chronic pain and their impact in the quality of life. For this reason, we will assess the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), it is used to evaluate the subject's perception of pain severity and its interference. Moreover, we will assess neuropathic pain symptoms with the NPSI to detect paresthesia/dysaesthesia, evoked pain and paroxysmal pain. The catastrophizing score will be measured with the Pain Catastrophizing Helplessness Subscale. Also,we will assess the disability after whiplash using the Neck Disability Index.</description>
