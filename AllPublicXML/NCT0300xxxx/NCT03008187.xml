      Phase I/II, open-label, multi-center, dose escalation study to estimate the MTD (or MAD) of
      SEL24 in patients with AML.

      At the end of Part 1 an RD of SEL24 will be selected for further evaluation in Part 2.

      In Part 2 the safety and anti-leukemic activity of SEL24 will be further assessed in patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II, open-label, multi-center, dose escalation study to estimate the MTD (or
      MAD) of SEL24 in patients with AML. At the end of Part 1 an RD of SEL24 will be selected for
      further evaluation in Part 2. In Part 2 the safety and anti-leukemic activity of SEL24 will
      be further assessed in patients who are unfit to receive intensive chemotherapy.

      Part 1 will commence with an accelerated dose escalation design for the first 4 cohorts. The
      study will then follow a 3+3 design from Cohort 5 onwards in order to provide adequate PK
      profile data. In Part 1 the MTD is defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 in up
      to 6 patients experience a DLT during Cycle 1. The dose escalation rules to be followed
      during Part 1 of the study are described in the study protocol.

      The highest SEL24 dose level considered to be well tolerated in 6 patients, and to have
      optimal PK and PD characteristics, will be called the RD and will be selected for further
      evaluation in Part 2.

      Part 2 will enroll patients at the RD identified in Part 1. The treatment groups in Part 2
      will be opened for recruitment based on recommendation by the Investigators, Medical Monitor
      and Sponsor.

    <description>SEL24 will be taken orally once daily for 14 consecutive days over a 21-day treatment cycle. The cohort dose may be escalated by an increase in the daily dose level during the study based on the dose escalation rules.
Continuation of the study treatment may be discussed between the investigator and the Sponsor on a case by case basis. The DMC may also advise on the suitability of an individual patient to continue to receive study treatment.
Patients who experience a DLT will be permitted to receive further treatment with SEL24 according to the dose modification rules described in the study protocol.</description>
