  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the nitric oxide and arginase levels in patients with dental implants.
      Peri-implant sulcular fluid and saliva samples were collected after loading of the implants
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nitric oxide (NO) metabolism is associated with the clinical inflammatory state of
      peri-implant tissues and also affected by the mechanic stimulus. Therefore, The NO content of
      PISF reflects two different measures and can serve as an indicator of peri-implant soft
      tissue inflammation and/or bone response to force application and loading Arginase may reduce
      NO production by depleting the common substrate. Thus, increased salivary arginase activities
      detected in periodontitis patients may cause decreased NO synthesis and lead to a decrease in
      the antibacterial property of saliva.
