  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The emergence and spread of multi-drug resistant and extensively-drug resistant strains of
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR/XDR-TB) have posed a great threat to global TB control and
      elimination, limiting treatment success rate at worrisome 50% for MDR-TB. Among various
      factors contributing to the development of drug resistance, low drug exposure is well
      recognized. To overcome this, either new drugs have to be developed or the dose of currently
      used therapy be optimized, or both. Fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) and
      aminoglycosides are important drugs in the MDR-TB treatment regimen. Development of acquired
      drug resistance to these drugs could complicate and narrow down the available options, and
      further exacerbate to pre-XDR and XDR-TB.

      Objective:

      The main objective of this prospective clinical study is to understand the pharmacokinetics
      of levofloxacin in MDR-TB patients, receiving standard dosage (750-1250mg) based on the body
      weight and correlate drug exposure, with treatment outcomes.

      Study design:

      A prospective pharmacokinetic study

      Study population: 20 MDR-TB patients

      Intervention: Patients receive once daily oral dosing of levofloxacin (750-1250mg) based on
      the body weight, under MDR-TB treatment regimen of Nepal.

      Main study parameters/end points:

      The pharmacokinetic parameters(Vd, CL, AUC etc.) of levofloxacin are the primary end points
      of the study. The Cmax/MIC and AUC0-24h/MIC ratios are the best predictive parameters for
      efficacy of levofloxacin treatment and will be estimated. Pharmacokinetics will be evaluated
      in plasma and in oral fluid
