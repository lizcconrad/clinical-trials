  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      dose-finding study with one group treated with placebo and three groups treated with
      tafoxiparin in three different infusion concentration levels, respectively. The intravenous
      infusion will be initiated by a pre-defined bolus dose infusion.

      Primary objective

      To assess the dose-response relationship of tafoxiparin on the labor time defined as the time
      from the start of continuous infusion of tafoxiparin/placebo as an Adjunct Treatment to
      Oxytocin, until partus in term-pregnant, nulliparous women requiring labor augmentation due
      to Primary Slow Progress of Labor including prolonged latent phase and Labor Arrest.

      Secondary objectives

      To assess the safety and efficacy of tafoxiparin based on the safety and secondary efficacy
      parameters evaluated in the protocol. PK (pharmacokinetic) response in pregnant women during
      labor.

      Methodology

      All term-pregnant, nulliparous women presenting to the delivery ward are potential study
      patients unless they have already been enrolled in another clinical study. Subjects may be
      pre-informed about the study through the use of advertisements or information at the
      physician/midwife visits during pregnancy and at hospital admission.

      The whole study includes the following steps:

        -  Screening and Baseline including informed consent and randomization

        -  Labor

        -  Discharge

        -  Follow-up at 8 (+/-1)weeks - End of study

        -  Safety follow up of infant at 6 months, +/-4 weeks, by telephone interview
