  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if using a tablet computer, which is a very small,
      easy-to-carry computer, to practice thinking exercises at home will help improve your
      attention, memory, and problem solving abilities. All the participants will receive training
      in the thinking skills for work program. But in order to determine the effect of tablet use
      for home practice, half of the participants will be given a tablet to practice the thinking
      exercises at home. All participants will be receiving vocational rehabilitation and have a
      goal of getting a job.

    <textblock>
      The Thinking Skills for Work (TSW) program has been shown to improve cognitive functioning
      and work in multiple studies in a variety of vocational programs. TSW includes agency-based,
      computer cognitive practice facilitated by a cognitive specialist, and teaching of
      compensatory strategies to manage cognitive challenges, which are integrated with vocational
      services. Supplementing agency-based practice with home practice on a tablet addresses the
      need and desire for more cognitive practice, which is expected to further improve cognitive
      and work outcomes.

      This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the impact of supplementing the traditional
      TSW cognitive practice with home based practice of cognitive exercises using a tablet.. Fifty
      clients enrolled in vocational services at Brooklyn Community Services will be recruited and
      randomized either to TSW-Home Practice (N=25) or traditional TSW (N=25).

      All the participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 months and 12 months on cognitive
      functioning and symptoms; work activity will be tracked for 12 months; program satisfaction
      will be assessed at 6 and 12 months. The study will establish the efficacy of using home
      practice on a tablet to increase the number of computer cognitive practice exercises
      completed by clients.

      Study hypotheses: 1) Individuals assigned to TSW HP will complete more cognitive practice
      sessions using COGPACK software than those assigned to traditional TSW; 2) Individuals who
      are exposed to TSW HP (i.e., complete 6 or more cognitive practice sessions) will complete
      more practice sessions than those who are exposed to traditional TSW; 3) Individuals assigned
      to TSW - HP will show greater improvements in cognitive functioning at post treatment and
      follow up than those assigned to traditional TSW; 4) Individuals assigned to TSW - HP will
      show greater improvements in work related outcomes (number of job interviews, % obtaining
      competitive work, weeks worked, wages earned) at post-treatment and follow up than those
      assigned to traditional TSW.
