      A prospective before-and-after study to evaluate the effect of implementing a Trauma Quality
      Improvement protocol on the process of Trauma Quality Improvement meetings and major trauma
      patient outcomes at four trauma centres in India.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will be conducted as a prospective before-and-after study at four major trauma
      centres in India, with the intervention occurring between pre- and post-intervention phases.
      Included in the study will be all patients presenting to any of the four trauma hospitals
      with a potentially life-threatening or limb-threatening injury. The intervention will be the
      introduction of a structured Trauma Quality Improvement Meeting (TQIM), using a checklist and
      training program. The primary outcome will be compliance with the TQIM checklist, measured as
      the proportion of discussed cases (trauma deaths) for which problems with care,
      preventability and corrective actions were discussed and / or agreed. The secondary outcomes
      will include in-hospital risk-adjusted mortality, hospital length of stay and time to
      emergency surgery. Data collection will occur at all meetings at the four trauma hospitals at
      which trauma deaths are discussed. Data will also be collected in a dedicated trauma
      registry.
