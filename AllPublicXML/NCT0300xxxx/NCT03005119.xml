  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral administration of PTL201 for relief of
      spasticity-related symptoms in 70 MS patients and to evaluate the efficacy of oral
      administration of PTL201 in relief of spasticity-related symptoms in MS patients. The
      pharmacokinetics of PTL201 in comparison to buccally administered Sativex will be evaluated
      in sub-study prior to the efficacy study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be comprised of the following parts:

        1. Pharmacokinetics (PK) sub-study:

           A 7-day baseline observation period. Randomized cross-over treatments (Sativex, PTL201),
           performed at minimum 7-day washout.

           Follow up - one week after the last dosing session.

        2. Efficacy study:

      A 7-day baseline observation period. Single-blind responder phase - 4 weeks. Randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment phase - 4 weeks Follow up - two weeks.

      Subjects participating in the pharmacokinetic sub-study will be allowed to participate in the
      efficacy study and will not be required to repeat the 7-day observation period of the
      efficacy study.

      Doses will be titrated over a one-week period until reaching maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for
      each participant The MTD will be self administered for three weeks thereafter. Participants
      demonstrating response to treatment will continue self administering daily PTL201 treatment
      or placebo, for an additional four weeks. Participants will keep a daily diary.
