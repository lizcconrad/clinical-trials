  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is designed as a phase II open-label, controlled, randomized, multicenter,
      dose-escalation study of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a single or multiple
      applications of StrataGraft skin tissue as an alternative to autografting in promoting the
      healing of excised full-thickness complex skin defects resulting from acute traumatic skin
      loss. The proposed study population will include patients with up to 49% Total Body Surface
      Area (TBSA) complex skin defects including a full-thickness component. The study has been
      designed to focus on the evaluation of safety and tolerability of prolonged exposure to
      increasing amounts of a single or multiple applications of StrataGraft skin tissue, while
      also assessing the potential for StrataGraft tissue to promote healing of the full-thickness
      component of these complex skin defects as an alternative to donor site harvesting and
      autografting. Targeted enrollment for this study is up to 20 subjects with complex skin
      defects due to acute traumatic skin loss which require surgical excision and autografting.
      Subjects will be sequentially enrolled in two cohorts of increasing treatment area receiving
      StrataGraft skin tissue.
