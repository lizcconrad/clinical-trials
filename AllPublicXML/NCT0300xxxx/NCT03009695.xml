  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a metabolic disease that has reached epidemic proportions. Insofar no long-term
      effective drug treatment was developed for obesity. Lyfe style modulation and bariatric
      surgery are the only interventions with a limited rate of success. Obesity is due to several
      factors, mainly linked to a neurophysiological mechanism of &quot;food addiction&quot;. The use of
      repetitive deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (dTMS) was proposed to reduce appetite and
      food craving in obese subjects, leading eventually to a weight reduction. dTMS was already
      tested successfully in other forms of addiction (smoking, alcohol, cocaine) and the
      usefulness of dTMS in the treatment of food addiction, and therefore in obesity, was
      hypothesized. End-points of this research will be: 1) effect on food craving; 2) acute and
      chronic effects on blood level of hormones acting on the appetite regulation; 3) chronic
      effects on body weight. The demonstration that a safe, non-invasive and repeatable
      methodology can treat obesity reducing food craving and modulating appetite/satiety hormones
      secretion will constitute a cornerstone in translational medicine of metabolic diseases.

    <measure>Changes in food craving levels induced by repetitive dTMS from baseline at 5 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and end of treatment (5 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Food craving will be evaluated by the Food Cravings Questionnaire-Trait (FCQ-T), a self-report multidimensional questionnaire composed of 39 items aimed to investigate food addiction and eating disorders. Total FCQ-T score will be used as a general measure of trait craving; individual FCQ-T scores related to the 9 measured craving dimensions could be useful in identifying and differentiating craving profiles between specific populations. Food craving will be also evaluated at follow-up visit 1 (1 month after the end of treatment), follow-up visit 2 (6 months after the end of treatment), and follow-up visit 3 (1 year after the end of treatment).</description>

    <intervention_name>High frequency repetitive dTMS</intervention_name>
    <description>Focal rTMS will be performed using a Magstim Rapid2 magnetic stimulator (The Magstim Co. Ltd., U.K.) equipped with an H-shaped coil. The used H-coil version is the H-addiction specifically designed to stimulate the insula and the Pre-Frontal Cortex (PFC). This novel H-coil allows direct stimulation of deeper brain regions, like insula (3 cm vs 1.5 cm from the skull). Before each stimulation the resting Motor Threshold (rMT) should be determined. The rMT will be determined over the left primary motor cortex, afterwards the coil will be moved forward 6 cm anterior the motor spot and aligned symmetrically over the PFC and insula. Repetitive dTMS induces long-lasting changes in neural excitability and dopamine release, specifically high-frequency rTMS (18 Hz) enhances cortical excitability.</description>
