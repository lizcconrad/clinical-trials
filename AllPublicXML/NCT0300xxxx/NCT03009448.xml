      Analysis of recent studies show that researchers find it hard to distinguish between Late
      Onset Depression, a first diagnosed major depressive episode which occurs at old age, and
      Early Onset Depression, a depressive episode at old age with a history of previous episodes.
      Since current data, about the phenomenology and etiology of Late Onset Depression, lake
      conicity it is unclear whether this phenomena should be considered as a distinct subtype of
      depression. Nevertheless, the wide spread assumption is that Late Onset Depression has a
      stronger correlation with brain damage and environmental risk factors such as the common
      losses at old age and weaker correlation with family history and genetics when compared to
      Early Onset. Although many researchers consider brain damage to have the main contribution to
      the emerge of Late Onset Depression, the fact that depression has a negative effect on one's
      health supports the claim that it might be the result and not the rick factor. Since Late
      Onset Depression correlates with the common losses at old age, the investigators propose that
      an existential approach that deals with one's meaning, freedom, responsibly and death, might
      be more appropriate. Thus, the investigators ask how do older adults experience depression
      which they face for the first time in old age? Current study will seek to understand older
      adults' experience of Late Onset depression through existential paradigm by using a semi
      constructed interview.
