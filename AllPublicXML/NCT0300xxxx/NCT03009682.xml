    <textblock>
      This study is a single arm, multi-center phase II study of olaparib monotherapy in patients
      with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) harboring HR pathway gene mutations not limited
      to BRCA 1/2 mutations, ATM deficiency or MRE11A mutations as second or third line
      chemotherapy.

      Target subject population:

      Patients with small cell lung cancer that have progressed following first-line platinum-based
      therapy. Patients must have imaging confirmed progression on 1st line chemotherapy for SCLC
      treatment, which must have contained platinum-based regimen, with at least one measurable
      lesion per RECIST 1.1.

             of first-line chemotherapy

          -  If the patient correspond to sensitive relapse (relapse more than 6 months since the
             last dose of first-line chemotherapy), she/he should get second- line treatment.

             4. Patients (male/female) must be &gt; 20 years of age.

             5. Patients must have normal organ and bone marrow function measured within 28 days
