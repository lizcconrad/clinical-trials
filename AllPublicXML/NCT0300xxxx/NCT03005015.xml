  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this multicenter, randomized phase II trial is to assess the
      efficacy, as measured by progression-free survival (PFS), of lenvatinib compared to
      doxorubicin in advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer.

      The main secondary objective is to evaluate the predictive value of Ang-2 on lenvatinib
      activity and establishing a cutoff value as potential selection criteria for phase III.

      Other secondary objectives are to assess the tolerability and safety of lenvatinib in this
      setting and overall survival, response and disease control.

             endometrial carcinoma for which no surgical or radiotherapy treatment options exist.

          -  Patients with disease progression following platinum-based chemotherapy administered
             as either adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment are also eligible.

          -  Patients may have received prior radiotherapy and / or adjuvant chemotherapy for early

             recovered adequately from any toxicity and/or complications from radiotherapy and
             major surgery prior to starting therapy.

          -  Systemic anti-tumor therapy or any investigational agent: wash-out period of 21 days
             (or 5 x half-life)
