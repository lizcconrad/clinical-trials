    <textblock>
      This study aims to show whether the hyperglycaemic phases following a treatment with
      glucocorticoids, as well as blood measurements correlated to high blood glucose levels and
      insulin resistance, vary significantly between patients with and without gestational diabetes
      mellitus.

      BACKGROUND:

      The therapy with glucocorticoids for fetal lung maturation in the case of threatening preterm
      birth is an long existing part of the obstetric routine procedures. Under this therapy it
      should not be forgotten, that glucocorticoids can lead to a decrease of the maternal insulin
      sensitivity as well as they can cause an impaired maternal glucose tolerance.

      Therefore a threatening preterm birth as well as the including medical therapy do challenge
      the glucose metabolism of mother and child.

      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common complications during pregnancy,
      and the numbers are on the rise. GDM is characterized through an insulin resistance during
      the pregnancy.

      High blood glucose level during pregnancy or labour can cause complications like a fetal
      hypoglycaemia right after birth.

      METHODS:

      This study includes pregnant women with and without gestational diabetes who are medicated
      with betamethasone due to threatening preterm birth.

      In this study the blood glucose measurements of one week, as well as the measurements of
      HbA1C, Insulin and Blood Glucose from a blood draw one week after the lung maturation therapy
      will be considered.
