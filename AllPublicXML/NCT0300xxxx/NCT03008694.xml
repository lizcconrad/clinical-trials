    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of FDG-PET/CT for Simulation and Radiation Treatment Planning
      in oral Cancer patients. Progress-free survival (PFS) will be compared with historical
      control as defined in the protocol

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy improves local control and overall survival for oral cavity cancer patients
      after surgery. However, limited locoregional control remains a key issue in the management of
      oral cavity carcinomas. Appropriate target selection is a key issue in the radiotherapy of
      oral cavity cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine the locoregional control in
      PET/CT based radiotherapy treatment planning in the treatment of oral cancer
