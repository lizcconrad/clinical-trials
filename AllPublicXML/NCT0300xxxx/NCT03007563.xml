  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal jaundice is a common and most often harmless condition. However, when unrecognized
      it can be fatal or cause serious brain injury. Three quarters of these deaths are estimated
      to occur in the poorest regions of the world. The treatment of jaundice, phototherapy, is in
      most cases easy, low-cost and harmless. The crucial point in reducing the burden of disease
      is therefore to identify then children at risk. This results in the need for low-cost,
      reliable and easy-to-use diagnostic tools that can identify newborns with jaundice.

      Based on previous research on the bio-optics of jaundiced newborn skin, a prototype of a
      smartphone application has been developed. This prototype will be evaluated in a clinical
      trial in two hospitals in Norway. A smartphone will be used to take picture of the skin of
      the newborn, and by using an algorithm an estimate of the bilirubin concentration is made.
      The results from these estimates will be compared to the bilirubin levels measured in
      standard blood samples, as well as the results from ordinary transcutaneous measurement
      devices.
