  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with visible conditions often report experiencing lowered social confidence and
      encountering intrusive reactions from others, yet relatively few targeted psychosocial self
      help interventions are available.

      The investigators will conduct a randomised controlled trial to compare the efficacy of an
      adapted form of an existing self-help intervention with an enhanced version of the same
      intervention that incorporates if-then planning instructions (or 'implementation intentions')
      and a control condition that will receive support as usual. Participants who self-identify as
      having a visible condition affecting the skin or hair, or scarring to the skin that
      negatively affects their social confidence will be allocated to one of three conditions:
      augmented self-help, standard self help or control. The interventions will be delivered
      online and participants will complete psychometric outcome measures at two time points, four
      weeks apart.

      It is hypothesised that participants who receive the augmented self help intervention will
      have a statistically significant decrease in fear of negative evaluation in comparison to
      both the standard self-help and support as usual control groups.

      The proposed research will take the form of a randomised controlled trial conducted in
      accordance with CONSORT guidelines (http://www.consort-statement.org). Data will be collected
      online using Qualtrics. Participants will be required to answer all fields on Qualtrics, as a
      way of managing potential missing data.

      Participants will be randomly allocated to one of three groups: (i) psychological self-help
      augmented with implementation intentions, (ii) standard psychological self-help or (iii) a no
      intervention waiting list control. Qualtrics will be used to randomly allocate participants
      to one of the three groups.

      A sample size analysis has been conducted and calculated assuming two measures, three groups,
      an alpha of 0.05, a power of 0.8, and an effect size of 0.25; a total sample size of 120
      participants would be needed (i.e. 40 per group). Allowing for an attrition rate of 20%, 144
      participants would need to be recruited (i.e. 48 per group). Although participants will be
      randomised to condition, it is best practice for any differences at baseline to be controlled
      for in analyses and thus a between factors repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) will
      be conducted.
