  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will compare the operated patients for a beginning breast cancer in the
      Hypnose arm and the patient in the classical general anesthesia arm. It is a Observational
      study as we cannot randomized patient, (they need to be compliant with Hypnose).

      Patient will be informed that some parameters, about his recovery, will be collected from
      their medical file. They will not have another particular treatment because they are in the
      study. It is just a prospective data collection.

      The patient will be compared on several items after the surgery ( as pain and pain killer
      intake, the heal process of the scar, etc...) Also the investigators will compare the impact
      of hypnose on the other treatments the patient received.

      The investigators need approximately 150 patients (Half in each arm).

    <measure>How is the recovering of the patient according his pain and anxiety, one day after the surgery? Is he anxious; does algique, both or none of the two? Each patient will be categorized according the score they obtain in the different scales.</measure>
    <time_frame>One day after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>We'll collect the following information in the standard medical file :
The collected measures who will analyzed are anxiety, pain and consumption of analgesic.
Items :
Anxiety (will be mesured by the anxiety visual scale)
Pain (mesured by analogic visual pain scale)
consumption of analgesic (Yes / No - in case o YES : Type, duration, quantity per day) All the responses to the item will be reported and a conclusion between the part of anxiety and the part of the pain will be combine (ex : patient is anxious and have no pain, patient have pain and anxiety, patient have pain and no anxiety, patient have no pain and no anxiety).</description>

    <measure>Is the quality of the process of cure of the scar normal seven days after the surgery (according that the normal healing process is without infection and hypertrophie)?</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>We'll collect the following information in the standard medical file :
Redness of the skin : yes /no
Delay in the scar process : yes/ no
Infection: yes/ no
Hypertrophie of the scar : yes/no
Pain : Yes/No After analysis of the parameters, we will determine a good scar healing process, or not.</description>
