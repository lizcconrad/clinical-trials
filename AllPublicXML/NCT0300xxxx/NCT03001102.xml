      Clinical trial for prevention, randomized, controlled, blinded, parallel, with three arms
      which purpose is verify the effects of nursing intervention preoperative bathing with 4%
      chlorhexidine gluconate, 10% Povidone iodine (PVPI) and soap without antiseptic, for the
      prevention of surgical site infection (SSI) in patients undergoing hip arthroplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the recommendation in several guidelines of preoperative bathing with 4%
      chlorhexidine gluconate as a measure for the prevention of SSI, there is no evidence in the
      literature that support this practice. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect
      of nursing intervention: preoperative bath using 4% chlorhexidine gluconate solutions, 10%
      povidone iodine degermante or soap without antiseptic for the prevention of SSI in patients
      undergoing elective hip arthroplasty surgery. The specific objectives are to compare the
      incidence of SSI in the three interventions, to assess the most effective intervention for
      the prevention of surgical infection and to estimate the frequency of allergic reactions
      caused by the use of the solutions. Two intervention groups (4% Chlorhexidine gluconate and
      PVPI10%) and a control group (without antiseptic soap) composed of 52 patients undergoing hip
      arthroplasty in each group will be randomized to perform the baths in the period from may
      2015 to june 2017. Before the intervention, nasal swabs will be collected of patients to
      investigate colonization by Staphylococcus aureus.

      The expected result is lower ISC rate with the proposed measures.
