      This is a two part Phase I/Ib, open-label, non-randomized and multi-center, dose escalation
      study with a 3+3 design (Part 1) and an expansion cohort at the Maximum Tolerated Dose
      (MTD)/Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) (Part 2). If MTD is not reached in Part 1, RP2D will be
      determined after completion of Part 1 considering safety and tolerability, also beyond the
      dose limiting toxicity (DLT) period, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) results.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed and documented, advanced or metastatic, accessible malignant
             solid tumour of epithelial origin and for which no standard therapy exists or standard
             therapy has failed.

          2. Presence of a measurable tumour according to RECIST 1.1. criteria

          3. At least 4 weeks from the completion of any previous cytotoxic chemotherapy, 6 weeks
             from biological therapy (monoclonal antibodies) or cancer immunotherapy (immune
             checkpoint modulators) or 2 weeks from targeted therapy (receptor tyrosine kinase
             inhibitors) at time of administration of AMC303.

          4. Male or female patients, at least 18 years of age

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 - 2

          6. Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks.

          7. Adequate haematological function defined as

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1,500 / µL

               -  Platelets &gt; 100,000 / µL

               -  Haemoglobin &gt; 9 g /dL.

          8. Adequate renal function defined as

               -  Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 50 ml/min according to local laboratory
                  standard or

               -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg / dL.

          9. Adequate hepatic function defined as

               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  AST, ALT ≤ 3x institutional ULN or &lt; 5x institutional ULN if known hepatic
                  metastases

             the need for steroid therapy and radiographic confirmation of stable disease.
             Radiographic confirmation of stable disease 4 weeks after completion of radiation
             therapy is not required unless indicated by neurological examination.

             able to use two forms of highly effective contraception methods (e.g. oral
             contraceptive and condom, intra-uterine device and condom) while on study and for 30
             days after the last study treatment. For male participants or male partners of
             childbearing potential, willingness and able to use two forms of highly effective

          2. Enrolment in another clinical study with an investigational drug

          3. Presence of residual toxicities of CTCAE Grade &gt; 1 after prior anti-tumour therapy

             and infusion site reactions

          4. Severe concurrent illness or psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit
             compliance with study requirements

          7. Untreated acute infectious disease

          8. Patient is known to be suffering from Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or is

             biological composition to AMC303.

         11. Evidence of any other medical conditions that in the opinion of the investigator may
             interfere with the planned treatment, affect patient compliance or place the patient
             at high risk from treatment-related complications

         12. Previous malignant disease other than the target malignancy to be investigated within
             the last 5 years with the exception of basal or squamous carcinoma of the skin or
