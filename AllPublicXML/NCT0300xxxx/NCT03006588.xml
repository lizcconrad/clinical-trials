  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel minimally invasive sampling technique -- fine
      needle aspiration (FNA) guided by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), which aims to sample tissues
      from retropharyngeal lymph nodes (RPLN) for the diagnosis of patients with suspected
      recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).

    <description>An EUS probe was introduced to nasopharynx and the retropharyngeal space (RPS) were scanned. The suspicious recurrent RPLN, which was characterized as (1) roughly round and homogeneously hypo-echoic lesion in RPS; (2) located anterior to the carotid sheath which contained the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the internal jugular vein (IJV). Subsequently, guiding by EUS, a dedicated 22G needle was used to puncture into the enlarged RPLN, then the aspiration was conducted The entire EUS-FNA procedure was repeated at least three times till the satisfied strip tissue was obtained. The obtained tissue samples were sent for pathologic detection and the supernatant fluid was for thinprep cytologic test (TCT).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. had undifferentiated, non-keratinizing carcinoma at the initial diagnosis (WHO, 1991
             criteria) and no evidence of distant metastasis obtained before radiotherapy;

          2. received regular chemotherapy with cytotoxic agents such as cisplatin, carboplatin,
             5-fluorouracil, paclitaxel, etc, and coordinated with radiotherapy with standard doses
             (approximate 50-70 Gy) in nasopharynx and neck respectively. Within 3 months after
             radiotherapy, no local and distant lesions were found;

          3. during regular follow-up , the enlarged RPLN was detected by MRI more than 6 months
             later since radiotherapy accomplished;

          4. didn't receive chemotherapy radiotherapy, immunotherapy or salvage surgery from
             completion of radiotherapy to suspicious recurrent lesion in RPLN detected;

          5. no recurrent lesion in nasopharynx was found by white light endoscopy as well as
             cancer cell negative in pathology by bite biopsy;

          6. single lesion in RPLN, and no other recurrent or metastatic lesion was found in local
             region or distant organ.

          7. the minimum axial diameter of RPLN was more than 5mm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  (1) patients with nasal stenosis; (2) patients with coagulation dysfunction; (3)
             patients with distant metastasis
