      A study of the safety and efficacy of Infliximab (Remicade) versus placebo in subjects with
      Ankylosing Spondylitis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical research study that will determine if there is a reduction in the signs
      and symptoms (such as back pain and stiffness) of patients with ankylosing spondylitis with
      infliximab therapy. This study will also study the safety of infliximab in patients with
      ankylosing spondylitis. The effect of infliximab on physical function, damage to joints and
      the quality of life in patients with ankylosing spondylitis will also be studied. Subjects
      received infusions of either placebo at weeks 0, 2, 6, 12, 18 and 5 mg/kg infliximab at weeks
      24, 26, 30 and every 6 weeks through week 96, or 5 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 1, 2, 6, 12, 18
      and every 6 weeks through week 96
