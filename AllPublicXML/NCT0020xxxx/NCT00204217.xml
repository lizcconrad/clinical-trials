  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Airway control and ventilation is vital during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in cardiac
      arrest. Endotracheal intubation is the gold standard for airway control, but several studies
      have shown high rates of unrecognized placements of the tube in the esophagus instead of in
      the airway out-of-hospital. This is lethal. There are no failproof technique for recognising
      such mistakes clinically in the cardiac arrest situation. Changes on the air volume in the
      lungs with ventilation changes the impedance (resistance to alternating current) through the
      thorax. This impedance is already measured routinely by the defibrillators used during CPR.
      We propose that we can measure ventilation volumes and also discover failed intubations by
      monitoring this impedance during CPR with the possibility of giving feedback on both to the
      rescuers.

      On the anesthesiologist manned ambulance in Oslo ventilation volumes during CPR will be
      controlled with a ventilator, the tidal volume varied in random order between 500, 700 and
      100 ml, and the volumes be measured continuously as will the impedance between the
      defibrillator electrodes. In case of failed CPR, the patient will be declared dead.
      Thereafter the lungs will be ventilated with 700 ml followed by removal of the endotracheal
      tube, placement of an endotracheal tube in the esophagus and ventilation of this tube, again
      with monitoring of the impedance.
