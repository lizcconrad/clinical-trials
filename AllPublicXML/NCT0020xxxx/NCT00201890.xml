  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and impact on quality of life
      of decongestive lymphatic therapy (DLT) in women who have completed treatment for breast
      cancer and present with lymphedema.

      This is a multicentre trial enrolling 100 patients randomized to receive conservative care
      for arm lymphedema (Canadian Guidelines) with or without decongestive lymphatic therapy
      performed by a professional who has received training and certification in the technique of
      lymphatic draining massage.

      Duration: One year after the last patient is randomized.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized patients receive either standard of care or standard of care plus DLT (five
      massage sessions per week for 4 consecutive weeks). Primary evaluation of all patients is
      recorded six weeks after randomization by measuring the affected limb and comparing with the
      unaffected one. There is an extended follow-up of one year.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with a histological diagnosis of breast cancer experiencing edema in the
             ipsilateral arm such that there is a minimum 15% increase in arm volume over the
             opposite arm.

          -  Patients must have completed all primary and adjuvant treatments (surgery,
             chemotherapy, radiotherapy) prior to randomization. This is to ensure that scheduling
             difficulties with daily treatments do not arise. Patients may be currently taking
             tamoxifen or similar hormonal treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical or radiological evidence of active disease, either local or metastatic.

          -  History of contralateral cancer, axillary surgery, radiation or bilateral arm edema.
             (Edema volume will be taken as the increase in volume compared to the unaffected arm;
             previous therapy in the opposite arm will reduce the accuracy of measuring excess
             volume related to lymphedema.)

          -  Previous surgery involving nodal dissection or radiotherapy to other major
             node-bearing areas in the body such as the mediastinum or pelvis. Disruption of
             lymphatic flow in these potentially alternate routes may be compromised by such
             interventions. Patients are eligible after a simple hysterectomy (+/- oophorectomy).

          -  Previously undergone massage therapy for arm edema, or has used compression sleeve
             within the last month.

          -  Serious non-malignant disease, such as renal or cardiac failure, which would preclude
             daily treatment and follow up.

          -  Patients for whom massage is contraindicated, such as those with untreated infections
             or thromboses in the affected arm.

          -  Unable to commence therapy within 7 days of randomization.

          -  Psychiatric or addictive disorders which preclude obtaining informed consent or
             adherence to the protocol.
