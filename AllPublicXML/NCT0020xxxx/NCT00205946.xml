      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of a single-dose of Wellbutrin XL
      (bupropion hydrochloride) on reward processing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cardinal feature of Major Depressive Disorder is anhedonia, which is a lack of pleasure in
      normally enjoyable activities. In order to understand reward processing in depressed
      individuals it is also necessary to study reward processing in people who are not depressed.
      Bupropion, the active drug in the anti-depressant Wellbutrin XL, has been shown to increase
      brain reward functioning in animals. The goal of the present study is to investigate the
      effects of Wellbutrin XL administered to psychiatrically healthy individuals as they perform
      a computer task known to assess reward processing.
