    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of an SSRI, sertraline for the use
      of post-concussive symptoms following a traumatic brain injury. the study also seeks to
      investigate the relationship between irritability and aggression and anosmia in individuals
      who have suffered a traumatic brian injury.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this protocol are the following:

        1. To investigate the efficacy of sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
           (SSRI), in treating neurobehavioral sequelae of irritability, depression, frustration,
           anxiety and other post-concussive symptoms following traumatic brain injury (TBI).

        2. To explore possible relationships between anosmia (deficits in smell) and irritability/
           aggression.

      This study will test the hypotheses:

      Sertraline is effective in treating Post TBI neurobehavioral symptoms of irritability,
      depression, frustration, anxiety, and other elements of the postconcussive syndrome.

      Patients who receive sertraline will have significantly less post-concussive symptoms at 12
      weeks than patients who received placebo. Post-concussive symptoms will be measured by the
      Gouvier Post-Concussive Syndrome Scale (PCSC) and the Affective Cluster score of the Cicerone
      Post Concussive Scale.

      Patients with anosmia will have greater irritability and aggressive symptoms than those
      without anosmia.

      . Subjects: One hundred people will take part in this study: approximately 50 subjects will
      take sertraline and 50 will take placebo. These patients will be selected from referrals to
      the Defense and Veterans Head Injury Program at WRAMC. Patients will be active duty or other
      military beneficiaries, between 18 and 65 years of age. Males and non-pregnant females may
      participate.

      b. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Inclusion:

             1. Traumatic brain injury patients within 6 months of injury.

             2. Traumatic brain injury with:

                Minimum severity - TBI with post traumatic amnesia. Maximum severity - recovery to
                a Rancho los Amigos (see Appendix II) level 7 or 8 by six months after injury.

             3. The C Criterion of DSM IV diagnosis of Post Concussive Disorder (PCD- Research
                Criteria), with symptoms persisting for a minimum of 4 weeks.

             4. Military beneficiary.

        2. Exclusion criteria:

             1. Severe prior neurologic or psychiatric illness, such as stroke or psychosis.
                (Previous nonpsychotic depression is not an exclusion criterion)

             2. Contraindication to the use of sertraline.

             3. Previous severe traumatic brain injury (defined as TBI with period of
                unconsciousness greater than 1 week prior. This exclusion refers only to TBI's
                prior to the current injury, which is within the past 6 months).

             4. Pregnancy

             5. Current active suicidal ideation

           c. Study Design: This study will be a prospective, double-blind, randomized 1:1 control
           trial study with two groups: active drug and placebo. Block randomization will be used
           so neither the patient nor the study physician will be able to guess the study drug
           assignment.

           d. Methodology: Patients will receive a multidisciplinary evaluation consisting of
           neurology exam, neuropsychology, psychiatry, speech and language, psychosocial,
           rehabilitation medicine (FIM/FAM), EEG, MRI, phlebotomy, and family interview. Blood
           samples will be kept at the DVHIP labeled with the patient's study number for possible
           future use in studies to better understand recovery from head injury. No studies would
           be performed on the blood samples until the patients have signed an additional informed
           consent with additional details on the blood studies planned. After signing the
           volunteer informed consent for the current sertraline protocol, evoked potentials and
           the smell test ( see Appendix III) will be administered and patients will be randomized
           into an active drug or placebo group. Patients will receive an increasing dose of
           sertraline or placebo up to a dose of 200 mg of sertraline. See Table I, Appendix I, for
           dosing schedule. All patients will receive a two part counseling session regarding brain
           injury and recovery from brain injury. The first session will cover the types of
           symptoms that may be experienced after brain injury, the expected course of recovery,
           and recommendations for symptom management. The second will begin with a brief
           assessment of material retained from the first counseling session, and continue with
           specific recommendations that match general principles to the patient's specific life
           situation. A brief pre-test and post-test (see Appendix IV) on general TBI information
           will be given with the first counseling session; a pre-test will be administered prior
           to the second session. These tests will permit better understanding of how much
           information patients have regarding TBI and how much is retained after a first
           counseling session.

           The medication phase will last 12 weeks. Patients will receive standard TBI care during
           this period. Current standard of care for patients with moderate-severe TBI following a
           full evaluation with medical/surgical treatment of any acute medical/surgical conditions
           is approximately 8 weeks of Convalescent Leave Home (CVL) followed by a gradual return
           to duty. Mild TBI patients typically receive 1-4 weeks of CVL followed by a gradual
           return to duty. Civilians would have similar schedules for resumption of activities.
           From current referral patterns, we expect most patients to have moderate traumatic brain
           injuries. The DVHIP experience suggests that patients are virtually never referred to
           DVHIP severely depressed and already on therapeutic levels of antidepressants. More
           commonly, patients are referred with mild-moderate symptoms of sleep difficulties,
           headache, irritability and/or depression. Because no randomized, controlled trials exist
           to suggest that current medical treatment is effective in these patients, and because a
           substantial placebo effect is a known reality, the design of this study (randomization
           to sertraline or placebo) is appropriate. Also, we have cared for a few patients who,
           although clinically depressed, refused medications. We worked with them in a supportive
           educational framework, and in some cases, their depressions remitted. Thus, the best
           treatment for these patients is far from established. It is likely that future research
           will help clarify which treatments are best for which patients. For this study, patients
           who may have been started on a tricyclic antidepressant (e.g., for headache) or an SSRI
           will be withdrawn from these medications for 10 days prior to the start of the study
           medication. Patients will be informed of concomitant medication options if the test
           article (sertraline or placebo) is not sufficient for treating their symptoms, or if
           they feel they need medication prior to the start of the test article. All patients will
           be contacted weekly during the medication phase to assess general condition, current
           symptoms, and assessment of compliance. Patients will be rated for improvement at weeks
           3, 6, and 9 for possible medication adjustment. The determination of medication
           adjustment will be made by study personnel at Walter Reed only. If patients require a
           clinical medical appointment during the 12 weeks, patients will be seen at WRAMC if
           possible. If not possible, study personnel will be available to speak with the patient's
           clinician at a local medical facility. Patients will return to WRAMC at 12 weeks for a
           follow-up evaluation of their symptoms, or they will be contacted by phone if unable to
           return to WRAMC for their 12 week evaluation. After the 12 week evaluation, patients
           will be tapered off sertraline or placebo over 2 weeks. Tapering and discontinuation of
           the study medication or placebo will be done on a gradual basis over the 2 weeks (e.g.,
           If the patient is on 150 mg, s/he could take 100 mg for 1 week, 50 mg for one week, then
           D/C). If, following the 12 week evaluation, subjects have recurrent symptoms which are
           distressing to them, or believe they need medication to keep their symptoms from
           recurring, pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments will be discussed with them.
           Patients will be offered appropriate treatment, including sertraline, if medically
           indicated. The blind will not yet be broken, that is, patients will not be able to learn
           if they were being treated with placebo or sertraline. Subjects will then be contacted
           by phone or seen at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months following their 12 week follow-up evaluation
           for an assessment of their symptoms and general level of functioning. If patients are in
           the area, these follow-up evaluation may be done in person.

           Concomitant medications:

           Patients with difficulty sleeping will be instructed in sleep hygiene, interviewed for
           possible deterrents to sleep induction, and encouraged to permit the test medication
           time to begin if depression is felt to contribute to the sleep disturbance. If
           difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep persist, Ambien 5-10 mg po qd (a
           non-serotoninergic hypnotic) will be offered. Benadryl 25-50 mg may also be considered
           for sleep induction. If clinically indicated, other medication may be prescribed.

           Patients with headaches will be counseled about precipitants in an attempt to maximize
           non-pharmacologic management of headache. If pain persists, enteric-coated ASA will be
           prescribed. For patients non-responsive to ASA (headache or other pain syndromes),
           non-steroidal antiinflammatory medications will be permitted. For vascular headaches,
           Midrin or sumatriptin may be used. If clinically indicated, other medication may be
           prescribed.

           If a patient has severe depression not responding to test article/placebo, and the
           treating physician deems antidepressant medication necessary, a non-SSRI medication,
           nortriptyline, will be used as the first line medication. Nortriptyline has been shown
           effective in post stroke depression (18), and may be monitored by plasma levels, thus
           being a good medication to combine with either placebo or sertraline. If nortriptyline
           is not effective (or if nortriptyline is not appropriate for that particular patient),
           the treating physician will chose whatever antidepressant is clinically indicated.
           Appropriate clinical care of the patient is the first priority.

           Pregnant women may not participate in this study. Women of childbearing age will take a
           urine or blood pregnancy test before starting this study to confirm they are not
           pregnant. As part of the informed consent, women are advised to avoid pregnancy for at
           least 6 weeks after receiving the drug treatment and will be advised about reliable
           methods of birth control. Breast-feeding women will also be excluded.
