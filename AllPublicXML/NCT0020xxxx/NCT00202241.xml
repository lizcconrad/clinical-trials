      The main aim of the study is to investigate the combined effects of using anabolic steroids
      and protease inhibitors on fat metabolism and body composition of People Living with
      HIV/AIDS.

      We are seeking to answer the following questions:

      1) Are there any significant differences in serum blood lipids, lipodystrophy, in persons
      with HIV taking antiretroviral therapies and anabolic steroids versus antiretroviral
      therapies alone?

      Changes in body composition and wasting have been a constant concern for people living with
      HIV/AIDS. Testosterone and its derivatives, anabolic steroids (AS) are being used by persons
      with HIV/AIDS (PHA's) to treat AIDs related wasting syndrome and also for bodybuilding
      purposes. some studies have shown that AS had a positive impact on the weight and well-being
      of HIV seropositive individuals.

      It has been shown that protease inhibitors (PI's) in combination with other antiretroviral
      HIV therapies are associated with a symmetrical loss of subcutaneous fat from the body
      surface (lipodystrophy)in some PHAs.

      The mechanism for lipodystrophy is not well understood. However, it is associated with
      hyperlipidemia that contributes to central fat deposition, insulin resistance, and in some,
      type 2 diabetes. As well, increased visceral abdominal fat and loss of fat inthe arms, legs
      and face, and increased levels of serum lipids have been reported.The health effects of
      anabolic steroid therapy coupled with PIs has not been examined before.

      This study is an observational study investigating the phenomenon of lipodystrophy in an HIV
      population already exposed to AS and PIs. A prospective observational design will be
      employed, with two groups recruited. One group will be taking AS and PI's, the other will be
      taking PIs only.

      The groups will be asked to completed Quality of Life nutrition and physical activity
      questionnaires. Serum blood lipid characteristics will be compared, and body composition will
      be determined using MRIs, BIA's and skinfold measurements.
