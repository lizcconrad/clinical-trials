        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's Disease and classified as stage II-IV
             of the Hoehn and Yahr scale for staging the severity of Parkinson's Disease

          -  Patients must have been on an optimally maximized oral therapy regimen including
             levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitors in either immediate or delayed release forms, plus
             at least one direct acting oral dopamine agonist for at least 30 days prior to
             randomization

          -  Patients must have been receiving apomorphine subcutaneous injections for rescue
             therapy for &quot;Off&quot; events for at least three months with an average dosing requirement
             of at least 2 doses per day over the week prior to enrollment with a dose of less than
             11 mg

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients under medical therapy for clinically significant psychoses or dementia not
             related to ingestion of antiparkinson medications. (Patients with hallucinations or
             other central adverse reactions associated solely with antiparkinson medications were
             not excluded.)

          -  Patients with a history of drug or alcohol dependency within one year prior to study
             enrollment

          -  Patients with unstable and clinically significant disease of cardiovascular (including
             orthostatic hypotension), hematologic (including Coombs' positive hemolytic anemia),
             hepatic, renal, metabolic, respiratory, gastrointestinal or endocrinological systems
             or neoplasm within the threemonths before the start of the study.

          -  Patients with a history of allergy or intolerance to morphine or its derivatives,
             sulfur, sulfur containing medication, sulfites, domperidone, trimethobenzamide or
             other anticholinergics.

          -  Patients treated with experimental agents (other than apomorphine intermittent
             subcutaneous injections) within 3 months before study entry, experimental agents were
             defined on the basis of the regulatory status in the country of patient observation,
             or with other disallowed medications

          -  Patients whose apomorphine regimen was characterized by continuous infusion or by
             administration methods other than intermittent subcutaneous injection.

          -  Patients who could not or would not sign an informed consent form.
