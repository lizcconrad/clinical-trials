  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if the commercially available device called the
      DOVERâ„¢ Silver Foley catheter prevents infections of the urinary tract.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 1 million catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) occur annually in U.S.
      healthcare facilities and account for approximately 40% of the nosocomial infections. This
      investigation is a multi-center, blinded, prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel
      comparison of the intervention catheter (Tyco Healthcare DOVER Silver Foley catheter) to a
      usual care catheter and another commercially available silver-coated catheter. 1000 subjects
      total will be randomized at the multiple study centers.
