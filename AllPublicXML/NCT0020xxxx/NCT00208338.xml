      Primary Endpoints:

      Comparative evaluation of any differences between the two groups in change from baseline to
      the 3-month time point in terms of:

        -  Functional recovery (patient-based) - using the Oxford Shoulder Score.

        -  Functional recovery and early return of strength (pain, activities of daily living
           [ADL], range of motion [ROM], and power) - evaluated using the Constant Shoulder
           Assessment.

        -  Functional recovery (pain and function - patient-based), evaluated using the American
           Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Shoulder Assessment - patient self-report section.

        -  Region-specific Quality of Life - using the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) Index.

        -  Range of motion - assessed by goniometer recorded as part of the Constant Score.

        -  Pain (taken from Pain visual analog scale [VAS] of the ASES Shoulder Assessment); and

        -  Record of escape pain medication usage (recorded in a daily patient diary).

      Secondary Endpoints:

      Comparative evaluation of any difference between the two groups in change from baseline to
      the 6-week time point, in terms of:

        -  Pain (taken from Pain VAS of the ASES Shoulder Assessment) and record of escape pain
           medication usage (recorded in a daily patient diary).

      Comparative evaluation of any differences between the two groups in change from baseline to
      the 6-month time point, in terms of:

        -  Functional recovery (patient-based) - using the Oxford Shoulder Score.

        -  Functional recovery and early return of strength (pain, ADL, ROM, and power) - evaluated
           using the Constant Shoulder Assessment.

        -  Functional recovery (pain and function - patient-based), evaluated using the ASES
           Shoulder Assessment - patient self-report section.

        -  Region-specific Quality of Life - using the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index.

        -  Range of motion - assessed by goniometer recorded as part of the Constant Score.

        -  Pain (taken from Pain VAS of the ASES Shoulder Assessment) and record of escape pain
           medication usage (recorded in a patient diary).

      Comparative evaluation of any difference between the two groups in change from baseline to
      the 6-week, 3, 6 and 12 month time points, in terms of health status - assessed by the EQ-5D
      instrument.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects, aged 40 and above.

          -  Subjects who are able to give voluntary, written informed consent to participate in
             this investigation and from whom consent has been obtained.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are able to understand this
             investigation, co-operate with the investigational procedures, and are willing to
             return to the hospital for all the required post-operative follow-ups.

          -  Subjects whose clinical symptoms and diagnosis suggest that they have a full-thickness
             rotator cuff tear (which includes but is not limited to the supraspinatus), which is
             degenerate in nature.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have an existing condition that
             would prevent them from fulfilling the requirements of the Clinical Investigation
             Plan. (This should be detailed in the Screening Log.)

          -  Women who are pregnant.

          -  Subjects who are known drug or alcohol abusers or with psychological disorders that
             could affect follow-up care or treatment outcomes.

          -  Subjects who have participated in a clinical study with an investigational product in
             the last 6 months.

          -  Subjects who are currently known to be involved in any injury litigation claims
             relating to the shoulder being treated as part of the study.

          -  Subjects with a known allergy to porcine material or who, for religious or other
             reasons, are unwilling to accept a porcine-derived implant.

          -  Subjects who have undergone previous shoulder surgery (excluding purely-diagnostic
             arthroscopy).

          -  Subjects with significant paralysis of the shoulder.

          -  Subjects with inflammatory arthropathies.

          -  Subjects with active joint or systemic infection.
