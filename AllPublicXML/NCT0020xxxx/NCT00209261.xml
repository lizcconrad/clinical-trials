      To evaluate the preference of subjects for Minirin® oral lyophilisate treatment compared with
      Minirin® tablet treatment after 6 weeks.

      To compare efficacy of the 2 formulations at the end of the 6-week treatment period using
      diary card data.

      To compare ease of use of both formulations at 3 and 6 weeks using a VAS-scale. To validate a
      PNE Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaire. To evaluate safety. To compare compliance with the 2
      formulations

    <measure>The primary endpoint will be the difference in the proportion of subjects who preferred each formulation at the end of the 6-week treatment period.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks (melt) and 6 weeks (tablet). Total 12 weeks.</time_frame>

    <measure>Efficacy will be measured as the difference in the incidence of bedwetting episodes during each 3-week treatment period, compared between formulations.</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The subjects will be asked to rate the ease of use of each formulation using a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), with 0 = I find it very easy to use this medicine and 100 = I find it very difficult to use this medicine.</measure>
