  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare, in the single center setting, the
      safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the two standard immunosuppressive regimens based
      on tacrolimus and cyclosporine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite several multicenter studies, there is no hard evidence on the superiority of a
      cyclosporine or tacrolimus based immunosuppressive regimen following kidney transplantation,
      in a single-center setting. Existing studies concentrated on benefits in safety and efficacy,
      but seldomly evaluated the cost-effectiveness of one treatment.

      The study has been designed in a fashion as close to the daily clinical practice as possible.
      Patients are randomized in pairs, receiving kidneys from the same donor, thus avoiding
      donor-related bias. Those having specific indications or contraindications for one of the
      study medications were not entered into the study. All other study-related decisions are made
      only on a clinical basis and according to the standard practice of the center. Patients are
      followed on the intention-to-treat rule. Cost-effectiveness will be calculated on 12-month
      treatment for each patient entered into the study.
