    <textblock>
      America is facing an epidemic of obesity among its youth. In the last seven years, there has
      been a 50% increase in the prevalence of obesity as defined by a Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 30
      kg/m². For the morbidly obese adult, which is defined as having a BMI &gt; 35 kg/m², mortality
      is increased by 152 to 279%. In a Veterans Administration study of obese 25-34 year old
      males, there was a 13-fold excess mortality rate over 7½ years.

      As in adults, risks associated with childhood and adolescent obesity include elevated blood
      pressure and cholesterol levels, predisposing these individuals to cardiovascular disease. In
      addition, a significant number of obese youth have abnormally high concentrations of insulin,
      with an attendant increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Currently, limited options are available to help such individuals. While attempts at
      lifestyle change (e.g., altering diet and activity level) may have some success in the short
      term, attempts at maintaining weight loss over the long term often fail. Furthermore, there
      are no current medications that will safely induce significant weight loss over time.

      Metformin is an oral antihyperglycemic, insulin-sensitizing agent that has been used in many
      countries for treatment of type 2 diabetes for more than 40 years. In March 1995, it was
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adult type 2 diabetes.
      Metformin improves insulin sensitivity and reduces insulin resistance by hepatic and
      peripheral actions. It does not increase insulin secretion.

      Further, metformin decreases hepatic glucose production and results in weight loss. Compared
      to available drugs that act similarly, only metformin has weight-lowering activity, perhaps
      by increasing nitric oxide production and improving insulin sensitivity. It is also possible
      that the mild gastrointestinal side effects of metformin induce weight loss. Metformin is
      therefore often the agent of choice in obese, type 2 diabetics. In a study of non-diabetic
      obese adults, treatment with metformin resulted in decreased food intake, and decreased body
      weight and fat.

      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multi-center clinical trial. The
      primary outcome measure that will be used to test the study hypothesis is change in BMI from
      week 0 to week 52, as well as change in BMI from week 0 to week 100. Approximately 135
      potential subjects will be screened at the participating institutions, and an expected 76
      subjects will be randomized into the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be between the ages of 13.00 and 17.99 at week 0 (Baseline).

          -  Subjects must have a BMI ≥ 95th percentile for age and gender using the CDC data (see
             Appendix), but must weigh less than 300 pounds (&lt;136 kilograms) when measured during
             the initial physical exam at week 0 (Baseline). BMI will be calculated as follows;
             weight in kilograms  [height in meters]2. This cutoff has been established due to the
             weight-bearing limits of the table used in performing the DXA scan. Once enrolled, if
             a subject’s weight progresses above 300 pounds, s/he may continue in the study whether
             it is possible to perform DXA or not.

          -  Completion of informed consent/assent process

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known diabetes as defined by the American Diabetes Association criteria

          -  Prior drug therapy to treat diabetes or insulin insensitivity, including any form of
             insulin or insulin analogs; or any oral antidiabetic medication; acarbose,
             acetohexamide, chlorpropamide, glimepiride, glipizide, glyburide, metformin,
             pioglitazone, repaglinide, rosiglitazone, tolazamide, tolbutamide or troglitazone.

          -  Prior use of drugs to aid in weight loss, including but not limited to: Benzphetamine
             Hcl, Diethylpropion Hcl, Fenfluramine Hcl, Phendimetrazine Tartrate, Phentermine Hcl,
             Orlistat, Sibutramine Hcl Monohydrate, Didrex, Tenuate, Pondimin, Bontril-SR,
             Adipex-P, Fastin, Ionamin, Phentrol, Xenical, Meridia.

          -  Subject is currently taking the following medications at the time of the Screening
             visit: Cimetidine, amiloride, digoxin, furosemide, morphine, nifedipine, procainamide,
             ranitidine, triamterene, trimethoprim, vancomycin and quinidine, as these medications
             may increase metformin levels.

          -  Subjects will be excluded from the study if they have taken prescription-strength
             glucocorticoids (by any route) within three months of the screening visit. Topical

          -  Subject to be excluded if s/he has attended a formal weight loss program within 6
             months prior to the Screening visit.

          -  In the 6 months prior to Screening, subject has consumed alcohol more frequently than
             twice per week and/or subject has had more than three alcohol-containing beverages in

          -  Other serious medical condition that the Principal Investigator or Lead Site
             Investigator determines may put the patient at undue risk if enrolled in the study

          -  Unable to comply with the protocol in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or the
             Lead Site Investigator

          -  Subjects with child-bearing potential who are unwilling to remain abstinent or use an
             effective method of birth control
