    <textblock>
      Prior to the first infusion, patients will be randomized into one of two groups (placebo or
      infliximab). All patients will continue to receive the same does of methotrexate (MTX) during
      the study as received prior to the study. The objective of the study is to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety result of infliximab with Korean patients in reducing clinical signs and
      symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at 30 weeks following the onset of treatment and to
      review whether the result is comparable to the result of the ATTRACT trial.

             disease, or a rheumatic disease other than RA.

          -  Use of DMARDs other than MTX within 4 weeks prior to screening. (If a patient had

             infections, including but not limited to evidence of active cytomegalovirus, active
             Pneumocystis carinii, aspergillosis, or atypical mycobacterial infection, etc, within
             the previous 6 months.

          -  History of lymphoproliferative disease including lymphoma or signs suggestive of
             possible lymphoproliferative disease, such as lymphadenopathy of unusual size or
             location (such as nodes in the posterior triangle of the neck, infraclavicular,
             epitrochlear, or periaortic areas), or splenomegaly.

          -  Any current known malignancy or history of malignancy within the previous 5 years,
             except for squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin that have been treated with no
