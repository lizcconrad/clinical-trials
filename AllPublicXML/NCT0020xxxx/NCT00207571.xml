  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To help public health professionals (DIS) in interviews of patients infected with STD for the
      names of their sex partners, this project used a computer-based partner elicitation program
      before the actual DIS interview. The main outcome was the mean number of partners named by
      those who had the intervention versus those those who did not.

    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this project is to develop and evaluate an intervention that will
      increase the number of people who, having been exposed to a sexual partner with chlamydia,
      gonorrhea or syphilis, (a) are notified and (b) receive evaluation and treatment. The
      intervention program will be presented entirely by an automated multimedia computer system
      with touch screen interface. The intervention will be tailored to user, based on demographic
      and recent sexual history factors. The intervention is designed to (a) motivate and prompt
      STD clinic clients to recall and identify sexual partners, (b) teach clinic clients a set of
      social skills for minimizing negative reactions while informing partners that they may be
      infected with an STD; (c) increase client's self-efficacy relative to disclosing partners
      names and informing them of their STD exposure, and (d) provide clients with tools for
      motivating their partners to seek treatment.
