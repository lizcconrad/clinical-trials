      The study is designed to determine the diagnostic efficacy of the visual assessment of SPECT
      scans in differentiating between probable dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and non-DLB
      dementia subjects determined by the clinical diagnosis of an independent expert consensus
      panel used as the standard of truth.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be adults between 55 to 90 years of age with an established diagnosis
             for dementia in accordance with DSM-IV criteria and have to fulfil at least one of the
             following: The ICC criteria for probable and possible DLB, the National Institute of
             Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and Alzheimer Disease and Related
             Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), or the National
             Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Association Internationale
             Pour la Recherche et l’Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINCS-AIREN) for Vascular
             Dementia (VaD).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects are not eligible if they have a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of
             &lt;10 and use medication known or suspected to interact with the striatal uptake DaTSCAN
             to the dopamine transporter.

          -  Furthermore subjects are not eligible if they were diagnosed with idiopathic
             Parkinson’s Disease (PD), with persistent severe depression, normal pressure
             hydrocephalus, multiple system atrophy, cortico-basal degeneration or Huntington’s
             Chorea Disease.
