      Cachectic patients often lose their appetite, lose weight, and are prone to weakness and even
      death in advanced illness. Nutrition therapy is important and of concern to the investigators
      in cancer patients. More than 80% of terminal cancer or advanced illness patients get
      cachexia. Cachexia is a complex, multifactorial syndrome that results from a reduction in
      food intake, a variety of metabolic abnormalities (including hypermetabolism) or more often a
      combination of the two. Cachexia will progress with disease progression. Cachexia or weight
      loss is often the major cause of death or poor quality of life.

      The change of resting energy expenditure (REE) is different in various tumor types. Most
      experts agree that the REE will increase in cancer cachexia syndrome. The more weight loss,
      the more cachexia will occur.

      Overnutrition is not beneficial in terminal patients according to the Chiu and Easson
      studies. As the investigators know, few studies focus on REE in terminal patients. In this
      study, samples are from a hospice palliative ward or from hospice home care patients in a
      medical center in mid-Taiwan. About 100 patients will be recruited. The investigators will
      analyze the relationship between REE and its related factors. After finishing the study, they
      will provide more evidence for treating cachexia in terminal patients.

      According to data from the Taiwanese government, cancer mortality has been the leading cause
      of death in Taiwan since 1982. The trend is increasing day by day. As the people are aging in
      Taiwan, the incidence of cancer will increase and it will be more important than before.
