      To assess the usefulness of irinotecan plus S-1 therapy based on the antitumor effect and
      survival period. by performing a phase II study of this combination in patients with
      inoperable or with postoperative gastric cancer

    <textblock>
      A multicenter Open-label, single-arm, phase II clinical trial is conducted on patients with
      histological stage IV gastric cancer given irinotecan plus S-1. The usefulness of this
      regimens as 1st line therapy for gastric cancer was evaluated by the disease-free survival
      rate (DFR), overall survival rate (OS), incidence and severity of adverse event.
