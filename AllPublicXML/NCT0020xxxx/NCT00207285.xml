      The purpose of the study is to test the effect of a sleep disorders detection and treatment
      program for police officers on their safety, quality of life, and job performance. The
      program is called Operation Healthy Sleep. We will develop and test a sleep health detection
      and treatment program that we aim to apply nationwide to reduce police officer fatigue and
      stress; enhance the ability of officers and their families to cope with police work; improve
      the health, safety and performance of law enforcement officers; and thereby improve public
      safety. Part of this program will include a questionnaire asking about about work hours and
      health related issues. We will then look at how these survey data relate with data on police
      officer safety and job performance that we are collecting through police department's
      databases.

      Sleep disorders are common and treatable, but often remain undiagnosed and untreated. Police
      officers work some of the most demanding schedules known, which increases their risk of sleep
      disorders. The public expects officers to perform flawlessly, but unrecognized sleep
      disorders lead to severe disruption of sleep, which significantly reduces an individual's
      ability to think clearly and perform well. In addition, sleep loss and sleep disruption
      affect personal health, increasing the risk of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular. We also
      know that sleep loss increases the risk of injury due to motor vehicle crashes.

      The goals of Operation Healthy Sleep are to improve officers' health, safety, and performance
      by reducing the impact of fatigue.

      The study will take place over two years. In the first year, half of the police officers will
      take part in Operation Healthy Sleep, and in the second year, the second half will
      participate. We will carefully select the year 1 and year 2 groups so that the data collected
      across the two years can be validly compared.

      Information Session and Surveys We will visit police stations and present an information
      session about Operation Healthy Sleep. The session will take place during work time. During
      this session, we will also provide a short education session aimed to help officers to
      improve their sleep habits and alertness. During the session, we will invite officers to take
      part in Operation Healthy Sleep.

      If the officer agrees to take part, he/she will be asked to provide informed consent, and
      then complete a survey. The survey is comprehensive and includes questions regarding work
      schedules, past medical history, health habits, accidents, quality of life, and mood. The
      survey will also include a screening test to see if they might have a sleeping disorder. The
      total time commitment involved in attending the information/education session and completing
      the survey will be about 1 to 2 hours.

      Officers will be asked to provide email address and other contact information. Officers will
      then receive information on how to link to our monthly web-based nationwide survey. The brief
      monthly surveys include questions regarding work schedules, accidents and injuries, health,
      quality of life, and mood. The survey should take about 10-15 minutes to complete each month.

      Finally, a version of the survey will be completed at the end of each year until the study is
      completed (i.e. at most, two years). These yearly surveys will be completed during regular
      work time.

      During the study, we will be tracking work hours, accidents, and job performance of all
      officers using the police department's computerized and paper records. Data collected through
      this system may be compared with other data we collect from officers directly. Protection of
      officers' confidentiality will be our highest priority.

      Assessment and Treatment of Sleep Disorders After the initial information/education session
      is completed, we will review responses to the survey to check whether officers are at risk of
      having a sleep disorder. If officers are found to be at risk, we will contact them and
      recommend that they undergo assessment and, if necessary, treatment by a physician or sleep
      specialist. We will provide the officer with referrals to local sleep disorders testing and
      treatment centers and physicians. Officers are free to choose another sleep disorders
      specialist or another physician if they prefer.

    <description>All individuals who screen positive in the questionnaires on the baseline survey will be referred to one of the physicians at Sleep HealthCenters® or other sleep clinics in Massachusetts. Individuals will be paid $40 for attending an initial consultation visit with a sleep clinician and $400 if they are then asked to undergo an overnight sleep study and they complete the sleep study. Individuals will also be asked to wear an ApneaLink device for 2 nights at home and for 1 night during the overnight visit at Sleep HealthCenters®. Subjects may be asked to wear the ApneaLink device for more than 2 nights if there are not 4 hours of usable data each night. If the data is inadequate, subjects will be asked to wear the device until 4 hours of usable data on 2 nights is achieved. The ApneaLink device is an FDA approved sleep-screening tool that is used to identify individuals that are at risk for Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome.</description>
