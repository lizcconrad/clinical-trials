  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this database is to collect information for clinical purposes on all children
      being treated for seizure disorders.

      At some point this information may be used to retrospectively review trends in seizure types,
      diagnostic evaluation and treatment (medical or surgical). The potential data recorded will
      be that of standard of care provided to these patients, including age, gender, seizure
      type/classification, diagnostic procedures (eg. EEG, MRI Magnetoencephalography {MEG}, Single
      Photon Emission Computed Tomography {SPECT}, Positron Emission Tomography {PET}, invasive
      electrocorticography) and various treatments (medications, diet, or neurosurgical
      interventions for the treatment of epilepsy). Records in the database will have identifiable
      information (name, date of birth, date of procedure, medical record number), but these
      identifying data will be removed, and only nonidentifying data will be used in the event of
      research completed using information from this clinical database.
