    <measure>Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>WHQ is a measure of mid-aged women's emotional and physical health. Consists of 36-item assessing nine domains of physical and emotional health: Depressed mood; Somatic symptoms; Anxiety/fears; Vasomotor symptoms; Sleep problems; Sexual behavior; Menstrual symptoms; Memory/concentration; and Attractiveness. Each item scored on a 4 point scale (yes definitely, yes sometimes, not much, no not at all) reduced to binary option as 0 (no) and 1 (yes). Domain subscale score was calculated as sum of domain items score divided by number of domain items. Total score was calculated as the sum of individual domain subscale score divided by number of domains. Total score range from 0 (absent) to 1 (present), with higher scores indicating more pronounced distress and dysfunction. Baseline values at different time points were considered only for the participants who were evaluable at those time points.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) at Months 48, 60</title>
        <description>BMD of lumbar spine (Lu Sp) and hip (total hip [Tl Hp], femoral neck [Fe Ne] and femur trochanter [Fe Tr]) was evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The left hip was evaluated unless prevented by pathology, in which case the right hip was evaluated throughout the study. Results were scored as T score, defined as BMD at the site when compared to the young normal reference mean. Normal BMD is a T-score of -1.0 or higher.</description>

        <description>BMD of lumbar spine (Lu Sp) and hip (total hip [Tl Hp], femoral neck [Fe Ne] and femur trochanter [Fe Tr]) was evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The left hip was evaluated unless prevented by pathology, in which case the right hip was evaluated throughout the study. Results were scored as T score, defined as BMD at the site when compared to the young normal reference mean. Normal BMD is a T-score of -1.0 or higher.</description>

        <description>Bone histomorphometry verified rate of bone remodeling. Anterior iliac crest bone biopsy done to exclude presence of osteomalacia or more subtle defects in mineralization; investigated qualitative aspects of bone. Also assessed decrease in rate of bone turnover, investigated mechanism for observed increase in BMD. Percentage of following indices (volume,surface,porosity) was calculated:Bone Volume(BV), Osteoid Volume(OV), Osteoid Surface(OS), Osteoclast Surface(OcS), Osteoblast Surface(ObS), Mineralizing surface(MS), Eroded Surface(ES), Osteoid Mineralizing surface(OMS), Cortical porosity(CP).</description>

        <description>Bone histomorphometry verified rate of bone remodeling. Anterior iliac crest bone biopsy done to exclude presence of osteomalacia or more subtle defects in mineralization; investigated qualitative aspects of bone. Also assessed decrease in rate of bone turnover, investigated mechanism for observed increase in BMD. Calculated indices included: Wall Thickness (WTh), Osteoid Thickness (OTh), Trabecular Thickness (TbTh), Trabecular Separation (TbSp) and Cortical thickness (CTh). Trabecular separation defined as the thickness of the spaces as defined by binarization within the volume of interest.</description>

        <description>Bone histomorphometry verified rate of bone remodeling. Anterior iliac crest bone biopsy done to exclude presence of osteomalacia or more subtle defects in mineralization; investigated qualitative aspects of bone. Also assessed decrease in rate of bone turnover, investigated mechanism for observed increase in BMD. Calculated indices included: WTh, OTh, TbTh, TbSp and CTh. Trabecular separation defined as the thickness of the spaces as defined by binarization within the volume of interest.</description>
        <time_frame>Month 60</time_frame>
        <population>ITT population included all randomized participants who took at least 1 dose of test article; had baseline data and at least one valid bone histomorphometry while on therapy. 'N' (number of participants analyzed)=participants evaluable for this measure. 'n'=participants evaluable for this measure at the specified time point for each arm group.</population>

        <title>Bone Histomorphometric Indices at Month 36: Total Surface (Goldner Slide) [TSG]</title>
        <description>Bone histomorphometry verified rate of bone remodeling. Anterior iliac crest bone biopsy done to exclude presence of osteomalacia or more subtle defects in mineralization; investigated qualitative aspects of bone. Also assessed decrease in rate of bone turnover, investigated mechanism for observed increase in BMD. Calculated indices included: Total Surface (Goldner Slide) [TSG]. All specimens were demineralized and subjected to staining procedures (Goldner`s staining). Slides were analyzed using light microscopy for total surface area, the surface area that consisted of bone and the surface area that consisted of graft material (all in mm^2 and expressed as percent (%) of the total surface.</description>

        <title>Bone Histomorphometric Indices at Month 36: ACF</title>
        <description>Bone histomorphometry verified rate of bone remodeling. Anterior iliac crest bone biopsy done to exclude presence of osteomalacia or more subtle defects in mineralization; investigated qualitative aspects of bone. Also assessed decrease in rate of bone turnover, investigated mechanism for observed increase in BMD Calculated indices included: Activation Frequency (ACF). The total period (TP) is the duration between the beginning of one formation period (FP) and the beginning of the next FP. The number of times per year that this spot begins the FP is the activation frequency (ACF).</description>

        <title>Women’s Health Questionnaire (WHQ)</title>
        <description>WHQ is a measure of mid-aged women's emotional and physical health. Consists of 36-item assessing nine domains of physical and emotional health: Depressed mood; Somatic symptoms; Anxiety/fears; Vasomotor symptoms; Sleep problems; Sexual behavior; Menstrual symptoms; Memory/concentration; and Attractiveness. Each item scored on a 4 point scale (yes definitely, yes sometimes, not much, no not at all) reduced to binary option as 0 (no) and 1 (yes). Domain subscale score was calculated as sum of domain items score divided by number of domain items. Total score was calculated as the sum of individual domain subscale score divided by number of domains. Total score range from 0 (absent) to 1 (present), with higher scores indicating more pronounced distress and dysfunction. Baseline values at different time points were considered only for the participants who were evaluable at those time points.</description>

        <title>European Foundation for Osteoporosis Quality of Life Questionnaire (QUALEFFO)</title>
        <description>QUALEFFO is an osteoporosis-specific health instrument developed specifically for participants with vertebral deformities used to evaluate the effect of back pain and treatment on quality of life. The QUALEFFO questionnaire includes 41 items in 5 domains: pain, physical function, social function, general health perception, and mental function. The total score is calculated according to the scoring algorithm developed by the International Osteoporosis Foundation. Total scores are reported from 0 to 100, with lower scores corresponding to better quality of life. Baseline values at different time points were considered only for the participants who were evaluable at those time points.</description>

        <population>ITT population included all randomized participants who took at least 1 dose of test article;had baseline data and at least one valid assessment while on therapy. 'N' (number of participants analyzed)=participants evaluable for this measure. ‘n’=participants who were evaluable for this measure at the specified time point for each arm group.</population>

        <title>Euro Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)- Health State Profile Utility Score</title>
        <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (&quot;confined to bed&quot;). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state. Baseline values at different time points were considered only for the participants who were evaluable at those time points.</description>

Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (&quot;confined to bed&quot;). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state. Baseline values at different time points were considered only for the participants who were evaluable at those time points.</description>
          <population>ITT population included all randomized participants who took at least 1 dose of test article;had baseline data and at least one valid assessment while on therapy. 'N' (number of participants analyzed)=participants evaluable for this measure. ‘n’=participants who were evaluable for this measure at the specified time point for each arm group.</population>
