      To investigate the prevalence of H. pylori infection in patients with early stage of primary
      low-grade B cell lymphoma of MALT of the stomach in Taiwan.

      -To evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of H. pylori eradication in stage IE &amp; IIE-1
      primary low-grade B cell lymphoma of MALT of the stomach.

      To evaluate the efficacy of Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy with respect to objective
      regression rate and time to disease progression of primary low-grade gastric MALToma.

      To estimate any differences in therapeutic efficacy related to different stage of disease,eg.
      stage IE v.s. stage IIE-1.

      To identify the causes of treatment failure, such as the stage of tumor, the presence of
      large cell component, and/or persistent, reactivation or reinfection of H. pylori etc.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patients must have histologically confirmed primary low-grade B-cell lymphoma of
             MALT of the stomach which including the following types : diffuse small lymphocytic,
             diffuse small cleaved, and some diffuse mixed small and large cell types by Working
             Formulation (Harris NL et al. 1994)(20).

          -  The diagnosis of primary gastric lymphoma must fulfill the criteria of Dawson :

               1. No enlargement of peripheral or mediastinal lymph node;

               2. Peripheral blood smear revealing no leukemic or lymphomatous abnormalities;

               3. Predominant of alimentary tract lesions with any adenopathy corresponding to
                  accepted lymphatic drainage route; and

               4. No involvement of liver or spleen except by extension of contiguous disease .

          -  The monoclonality of B-cell must be confirmed by either immunohisto- chemistry
             (light-chain restriction) or molecular technique (IgH rearrangement).

          -  The patient must have no prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy for his/her gastric
             MALToma.

          -  Patients must have evaluable disease by endoscopy and the nodal status by computed
             tomography. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)* is optional and for reference only.

          -  H. pylori infection will be evaluated by the following tests: histology, rapid urease
             test (CLO-test), and serology C13-urea breath test (UBT) and bacterial culture* are
             optional and for reference only.

          -  The following will be considered to have H. pylori infection : at least two of the
             following 3 tests show positive results, rapid urease test (CLO-test), histology and
             serology.

          -  For C13-urea breath test, rapid urease test and histology to examine H. pylori, the
             examination must be performed at least 4 weeks apart from the latest antibiotics or
             non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug ingestion.

          -  Patients must have either stage IE or IIE-1 disease, according to an adaptation of the
             Ann Abor staging system modified by Musshoff for primary extranodal lymphoma.

          -  Stage IE : lymphoma confined to the gastric wall without lymph node involvement.

          -  Stage IIE : localized involvement of one or more GI site(s) on one side of the
             diaphragm with lymph node infiltration, any depth of lymphoma infiltration into the
             gut wall.

          -  Stage IIE-1 : infiltration of adjacent lymph node.

          -  Patient must have signed the informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have extensive gastrointestinal tract involvement are not eligible.

          -  Patients who have had previous history of extranodal lymphoma are not eligible.

          -  Patients who have disease beyond stage IIE-2: infiltration of regional lymph node,
             e.g. paraaortic, renal hilar, retroperitoneal, mesenteric, or lymph node of
             gastrosplenic ligment and of hepatoduodenal ligment are not eligible.

          -  Patients who had a history of allergic reaction to Amoxicillin and Erythromycin
             /Clarithromycin are not eligible.

          -  Patients whose cardiopulmonary status not allow him/her to have repeat endoscopy are
             not eligible.

          -  Patients who had prior surgery, chemo- or radiotherapy for their primary gastric
             lymphoma are not eligible.

          -  Patients who had previous anti-H. pylori therapy are not eligible.
