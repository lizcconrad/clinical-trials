      The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between depressive symptoms and
      markers of inflammation, two predictors of heart disease.

    <textblock>
      Depressive symptoms and inflammatory markers have both been proposed as measures that
      indicate/precede coronary artery disease (CAD). However, no controlled research study has
      tested the impact of these two candidate CAD risk factors within the same design to see the
      directionality of their influence. This study will explore if simvastatin reduces depressive
      symptoms and if sertraline reduces C-Reactive protein (CRP). Additionally, the recruitment
      process will help determine the feasibility of a larger trial, powered for significance
      testing. Three hundred and seventy-five participants will be consented and screened for this
      study. We expect forty-two otherwise healthy outpatients to have both elevated symptoms and
      high CRP levels, and be willing to be randomly assigned to sertraline, an antidepressant,
      simvastatin, a drug with anti-inflammatory properties, or a placebo for 8 weeks. Depressive
      symptoms and inflammatory indicators will be assessed before treatment (screening and
      baseline), mid-treatment (after 4 weeks), post-treatment (after 8 weeks), and a follow-up
      visit (after 12 weeks), using blood tests and depression interviews. We expect that both
      inflammation and depressive symptoms may be reduced by both medications, but the number of
      subjects needed to test this hypothesis is not yet known. Hence, this pilot study will be
      conducted. Knowledge about the inter-dependency of these two CAD risk factors allows the most
      promising future observational/intervention studies to be designed and conducted.

    <description>Patients randomized to sertraline will receive 50 mg/d for the first 6 weeks. Based on clinical response and tolerability, the dosage will be increased to 2 tablets (100 mg/d) at the end of week 6 until the end of the study (8 weeks). If AEs occur, the dosage will be reduced by 50 mg (1 tablet) at a time, as long as a minimum daily dose of 50 mg is maintained. The psychiatry fellow will be responsible for drug administration and will see all patients weekly. All randomized patients will also be seen at the mid-treatment, post-treatment, and follow-up visits by the study psychiatrist to determine depression symptom severity (HAM-D), assess medical tolerance to the study medications, and ensure patient psychiatric safety. The study psychiatrist will be blinded to treatment allocation.</description>
