      This study will test the hypothesis that increases in ventricular-vascular stiffness can be
      demonstrated by arterial tonometry and echocardiography in subjects with heart failure with
      preserved ejection fraction (HF-nlEF)(i.e. normal left ventricular function.) We will also
      track changes in pulsatile hemodynamics over time in subjects hospitalized with HF-nlEF.

    <textblock>
      The pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the development of heart failure in people
      with preserved ejection fraction (i.e. normal left ventricular function) remain poorly
      understood. One possible mechanism may be the contribution of increased arterial stiffness to
      changes in pulsatile hemodynamic load during ventricular systole, implicating abnormal
      ventricular-vascular interactions throughout the cardiac cycle in the pathogenesis of heart
      failure with normal ejection fraction.

      To investigate changes in ventricular-vascular stiffness in subjects with heart failure and
      normal left ventricular function, comparisons will be made between 3 distinct
      sub-populations:

        -  subjects with heart failure and normal ejection fraction

        -  non-diabetic hypertensive controls

        -  normotensive controls
