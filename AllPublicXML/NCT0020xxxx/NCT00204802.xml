  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on theories regarding decision-making and patient education the investigators have
      developed Patient-Centered Advance Care Planning (PC-ACP). This intervention is designed to
      improve patient and surrogate knowledge of ACP, increase the congruence between patient and
      surrogate in treatment decisions, decrease the patient's and surrogate's conflict in making
      such decisions, and increase the consistency between patient preferences and the actual care
      they receive. The ACP intervention is conducted with the patient in the presence of the
      surrogate.
