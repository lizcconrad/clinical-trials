  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The conceptual framework underlying the TEACH Research Program is based on a specific
      theoretical approach designed to influence adolescent career choice, in this case towards a
      career in clinical research. The factors responsible for influencing career choice that form
      the foundation for our investigation are: 1) the importance of role models in career choice;
      2) acquisition of knowledge in order to align ambitions; and 3) the participation of students
      in activities that actively challenge and engage them. These three factors are addressed by
      the following three components of the TEACH Research Intervention: 1) participation in a
      research team consisting of a multi-tiered structure of mentors; 2) classroom instruction of
      clinical research knowledge and career strategies; and 3) a hands-on clinical research
      experience through an internship on the Hospitalist Project.

      The evaluation of TEACH Research (Teaching Early Achievers for Careers in Health) aims to
      rigorously evaluate a precollege enrichment program in clinical research targeting high
      school students particularly underrepresented minorities, in order to increase the entry and
      success of these students into careers in clinical research. Through these measures, the
      TEACH Research Program will educate high achieving minority students and in turn hopefully
      encourage and promote these students to think about a career in clinical research.

      This projects aims to rigorously evaluate a precollege enrichment program in clinical
      research targeting high school students, and particularly underrepresented minorities, in
      order to increase the entry and success of these students into careers in clinical research.

      Through the components listed in the brief summary, we hope to promote a career in clinical
      research among high achieving minority students. To determine whether TEACH research
      generates these benefits, we will recruit a larger number of candidates interested in the
      TEACH research than we have spots, then randomly assign students to TEACH Research or the
      standard more didactic enrichment programs already included in the Collegiate Scholars
      Program. In addition to determine the overall efficacy of the program, we will study how
      aspects of the program, including the didactic components, mentored research experience, and
      work experience, and characteristics of the student affect the development of the knowledge,
      attitudes, and behaviors needed for a career in clinical research.

    <description>We will use instruments designed to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of the high school students. Written surveys will be administered test the acquisition of knowledge of clinical research and career strategies. In addition, a video assessment will be designed to elicit their attitudes towards activities designed to promote a career in clinical research, we will use peer evaluations and research team member evaluations to evaluate ability to work in teams, a key part of any research project.</description>

    <description>We will survey students as they participate in various aspects of the program using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM). These methods will be used to survey student interest and engagement during participation in various components of the program. Also, to assess the formation of role models, we will use video-based assessments and serial evaluations of students using a tool based on the concept of a microsystem.</description>
