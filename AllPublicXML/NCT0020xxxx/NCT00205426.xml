    <textblock>
      This study seeks to demonstrate that Natrecor速 (nesiritide) is safe and effective and has a
      favorable hemodynamic profile in lung transplant recipients that will allow for the avoidance
      of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) use. It is estimated that the use of nesiritide will decrease
      the otherwise historically mandated use of iNO by 50%, as compared to the necessity of iNO
      use by matched historical controls.

    <textblock>
      A condition called ischemic reperfusion injury (IRI) occurs in all lung transplants. The
      amount of reperfusion injury varies from person to person. IRI occurs when the blood supply
      to tissue (in this case, transplanted lung(s)) is decreased and then is restored. IRI can
      cause a decrease in function in a newly transplanted lung. When this occurs, or when people
      have pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in your lungs), doctors use Nitric Oxide to
      improve the pressure and blood supply to the transplanted lung. Nitric Oxide (NO) is given by
      inhalation while patients are on a ventilator (breathing machine). Because NO must be given
      by a ventilator and because patients on ventilators must be in an intensive care unit, the
      cost of treating people with NO is very high. NO can also cause rebound pulmonary
      hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs that reoccurs) when it is stopped. Because of
      these reasons, doctors are looking for other treatments for IRI and pulmonary hypertension. A
      drug called Natrecor has been shown to reduce pulmonary pressures in heart transplant
      patients. Doctors believe it may be helpful to lung transplant patients as well.

    <description>Natrecor will be initiated as a bolus dose of 2 mcg/kg followed by a continuous infusion via infusion pump after induction of anesthesia but prior to incision. Natrecor infusion will be started at the recommended rate of 0.01mcg/kg/min. This dose may be adjusted by the investigator(s) only based on hemodynamic monitoring and pulmonary parameters. Study drug will be infused for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 96 hours.</description>
