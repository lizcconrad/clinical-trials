    <textblock>
      To investigate whether cyclosporine, added to methotrexate and steroid, increases the
      possibility of inflammatory management early in the disease; furthermore to investigate the
      possible steroid-sparing effect of cyclosporine in patients with recently diagnosed
      rheumatoid arthritis.
