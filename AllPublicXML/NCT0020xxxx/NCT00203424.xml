          <description>27 participants were screened for the study. 4 did not meet eligibility criteria,23 were registered to treatment period. 1 withdrew consent a day after registration and did not initiate study treatment.22 participants entered treatment period. Participants received Erlotinib every day for 24 weeks and Bevacizumab every 3 weeks for a total of 8 doses. The protocol instructed that pts be treated for 6 cycles. Of the 22 pts that started treatment, 11 completed the 6 cycles and the other 11 had to stop treatment prior to administration of 6th cycle. Of the 11 pts that did not complete all 6 cycles, 5 stopped treatment due to adverse event and were entered into the follow-up period. The 6 that stopped treatment due to withdrawal of consent and progressive disease did not enter the follow-up period. So 11 pts that completed 6 cycles of treatment plus 5 pts that did not complete 6 cycles of treatment due to an adverse event gives a total of 16 patients who entered follow-up period.</description>
