  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The benefit of small doses of ketamine has been demonstrated for postoperative analgesia in
      adults but remains unproved in children. The investigators' purpose is to evaluate the
      effects of continuous intravenous small doses of ketamine versus placebo to improve the
      quality of postoperative analgesia in children (6 months to 6 years of age). Caudal
      anesthesia is performed for intraoperative analgesia and all children receive paracetamol, a
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and continuous intravenous nalbuphine.
