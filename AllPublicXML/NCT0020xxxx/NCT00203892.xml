  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the experimental vaccine &quot;modified CEA
      peptide CAP 1 -6D&quot; (mCEA) can produce an immune response in patients with pancreatic cancer
      who have received chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PC has a dismal prognosis. Despite surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, most patients with
      PC will die of distant metastatic disease. Peptide vaccine approaches offer an attractive
      potential treatment option.

      Since CEA is expressed in &gt;90% of PC, it would make an attractive target for a vaccination
      approach. Several different vaccination approaches have been tested using CEA as a TAA.
      Although some investigators suggest that DC-based approaches are the most active, they are
      limited by the need to obtain patient-specific DCs. One attractive approach would be to add
      GM-CSF to the peptide to recruit endogenous DC to the site of vaccination.

      There are data on the use of tumor vaccines in advanced PC. Gjerertsen et al. used a K Ras
      peptide and GM-CSF in 48 patients with advanced PC. 50% of patients showed a peptide specific
      CTL response (Gjertsen, Buanes et al. 2001). Those that had an immune response had an
      increased overall survival, The data from phase I and II clinical trials was based on heavily
      pretreated patients with metastatic disease. The majority of clinical responses have been
      disease stabilization. The data in B cell lymphoma vaccines suggests that immune responses
      are more likely to be generated in minimum disease states (Bendandi, Gocke et al. 1999).

      For patients that have had a complete resection and treatment with adjuvant chemoradiation,
      and for patients with locally advanced nonresectable disease treated with standard
      chemoradiation, there is presently no therapy available to decrease the chance of disease
      reoccurrence. Our hypothesis is that immunization with a modified CEA peptide in
      Montanide/GM-CSF can lead to expansion of CEA-reactive CTL and result in control of CEA
      expressing pancreatic carcinomas.

    <description>T cell frequency (spots per 10^4 CD8+ cells) was measured by ELISPOT (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot) assay. Blood was collected for this assay at baseline and every 4 weeks for the first 8 cycles. After the eighth cycle, a blood sample was collected at the time of disease progression. The maximum T cell response was calculated as: peak value on treatment - baseline value.
A positive value indicates an increase from baseline.</description>

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, biologic therapy, radiotherapy, or an experimental
             (investigational) agent within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior
             to starting treatment or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to
             agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Patients may not have received a previous CEA vaccine.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to CEA, Montanide ISA-51, or GM-CSF.

          -  Patients must not have known autoimmune disorders (SLE, Rheumatoid Arthritis),
             conditions of immunosuppression (such as HIV), or treatment with immunosuppressive
             drugs (including oral steroids, continuous use of topical steroids, steroid inhalers).
             Replacement doses of steroids for patients with adrenal insufficiency are allowed.

             or carcinoma in situ of the cervix are not to be registered. Patients are not
             considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot; malignancy if they have completed therapy and
             have no evidence of recurrence for at least 5 years

        <description>T cell frequency (spots per 10^4 CD8+ cells) was measured by ELISPOT (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot) assay. Blood was collected for this assay at baseline and every 4 weeks for the first 8 cycles. After the eighth cycle, a blood sample was collected at the time of disease progression. The maximum T cell response was calculated as: peak value on treatment - baseline value.
A positive value indicates an increase from baseline.</description>
