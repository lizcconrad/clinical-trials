      The number of overweight and obese Americans has increased significantly in recent years.
      There are now many different diet plans being promoted by doctors and the media. The Atkins
      diet, a low carbohydrate nutritional plan, is especially popular; its advocates claim that
      following the diet will result in long-term weight loss with no negative effects. Another
      diet, called the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, is a high carbohydrate
      diet designed to help treat and prevent high blood pressure. However, more thorough
      investigation of these claims is needed. This study will compare the short- and long-term
      effects of the Atkins diet to the (DASH) diet. This trial will enroll overweight and obese
      participants.

      This study will last 30 months and will comprise two phases. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to either the Atkins or DASH diet for 30 months. During Phase 1, all participants
      will undergo 6 months of weekly group therapy to encourage weight loss. Phase 2 is a weight
      loss maintenance phase. During Phase 2, participants will have monthly meetings with a
      therapist for weight loss support. Study visits will occur at study entry and at Months 3 and
      30. At each study visit, weight measurements, blood and urine collection, and x-rays will
      occur to determine participants' weight loss, cardiovascular health, kidney function, and
      bone density.
