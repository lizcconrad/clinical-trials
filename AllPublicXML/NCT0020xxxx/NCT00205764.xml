    <textblock>
      This is an international,multicenter, prospective, open, double randomised and controlled
      phase III study to compare the therapeutic efficacy of tandem high dose Melphalan versus
      triple intermediate dose Melpahaln in newly-diagnosed myeloma patients

    <textblock>
      Patients will be enrolled into this protocol before start of Induction therapy which consists
      of 3 cycles or VAD with a 4 week interval followed by 1 cycle of IEV after which stem cell
      harvesting is performed. After stem cell harvesting is completed Patients will be randomised
      to one of the high dose therapy arms after response evaluation (Complete remission, Partial
      remission or stable disease). One group is receiving 2 Cycles of Melphalan 200mg/m² each
      followed by stem cell transplantation, the other group is receiving 3 Cycles of Melphalan
      100mg/m² also followed by stem cell transplantation each time.

      After completing high dose therapy patients will be randomised into Maintenance responding
      with CR, PR or SD. The maintenance therapy will be continued until relapse or progression of
      disease as defined by the response criteria.

          -  Patients with second primary malignancies (with the exception of cervical carcinoma in
             situ and non-melanoma skin malignancies) are not eligible unless the patient has been
             disease-free for at least five years
