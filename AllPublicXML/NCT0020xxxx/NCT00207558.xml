  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine whether the same total daily dosage of folic acid, when
      taken as a single daily dose or as multiple divided doses throughout the day, results in
      different blood folate and homocysteine levels at the conclusion of the study. Further, a
      comparison of blood folate and homocysteine levels among women taking daily low-dosage
      (100mcg) and standard- dosage (400mcg) folic acid with those of women taking daily or weekly
      high-dosage (4000mcg) folic acid will be conducted.
