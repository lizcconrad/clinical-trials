      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a implantable device,
      called the bion(R), in the treatment of chronic headache. The bion microstimulator is placed
      underneath the skin next to the greater occipital nerve. The bion microstimulator then
      stimulates the nerve by generating small amounts of electrical current.

      Chronic migraine and chronic cluster headaches are among the most disabling medical
      illnesses, inflicting severe functional impairment. These headache subtypes are particularly
      resistant to current treatment modalities, with the majority of chronic migraine patients
      continuing to experience frequent or near-daily headaches despite aggressive,
      multidisciplinary, and multimodal therapy. The refractory nature of these illnesses and the
      level of devastation they inflict on the lives of their victims has motivated the pursuit of
      novel treatment approaches.

      Direct stimulation of the greater occipital nerve has been shown to alleviate the symptoms of
      chronic migraine and chronic cluster headaches in a small number of patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be diagnosed with chronic migraine, probable chronic migraine, and/or chronic cluster
             headache according to the 2004 IHS Classification Criteria (2nd ed.) or be diagnosed
             with migraine with or without aura

          2. Be 18 years of age or older

          3. Be willing and able to follow all study-related procedures during the course of the
             study;

          4. Have exhibited refractoriness to two acute medication regimens and two prophylactic
             medications from two separate preventative classes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have received a botulinum toxin (botox) injection for treatment of headache within the
             last 90 days;

          2. Have previously undergone destructive ganglionectomy affecting C2/C3 occipital and/or
             trigeminal distribution or have an occipital blockade currently in effect;

          3. Have had a previous surgery in the intended implant area;

          4. Have Arnold-Chiari malformation;

          5. Have participated within the last 30 days or plan to participate within the next 4
             months in a device or drug trial;

          6. Be pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant during the study period;

          7. Have an implanted electrical device (e.g., pacemaker, spinal cord stimulator) that may
             interfere with this therapy; and

          8. Currently require, or be likely to require, MRI or diathermy.
