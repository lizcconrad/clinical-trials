  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Long-lasting pain and disability, known as chronic whiplash-associated disorder
      (WAD), may develop after forced flexion-extension trauma to the cervical spine. Mechanisms
      behind WAD are virtually unknown, as are the possible effects of early intervention. This
      trial was undertaken to compare the effect of three early intervention strategies for the
      prevention of developing chronic WAD following acute whiplash injury.

      Methods: 458 participants were randomised to one of 1) stiff neck collar, 2) advice to
      act-as-usual, or 3) an active mobilisation regime. Participants were followed for one year
      and treatment effects were compared in terms of lasting neck pain, headache, disability and
      sick-leave.
