  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether transdermally administered 17-beta
      estradiol sequentially could reduce the number of, and severity of, menstrual migraine
      attacks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the fertile ages, migraine is more common in women than in men (3:1). Hormonal factors
      has been proposed to affect this difference and it has been shown that a rapid decrease in
      serum concentrations of estrogens might trigger an attack.About 15 percent of all women with
      migraine suffer from menstrual migraine which means that the attacks only come during the
      menstrual period and start +/- 24 hours of the bleeding start, i.e when there is a rapid
      decrease in serum concentrations of sex hormones.

      Stabilizing the serum concentrations of estrogens seems to be crucial in the prophylactic
      treatment of menstrual migraine. A number of studies have focused on treatment with estradiol
      during the menstrual cycle but results are conflicting and doses and control groups have
      varied a lot. other studies have tried to reduce the exposition of estrogens by treatment
      with, for example, GnRH analogues. This treatment stabilizes the woman's serum concentrations
      of sex hormones on a very low level, like during the menopause, and it seems to be effective
      but there are a number of side-effects and the treatment is expensive.

      Comparison: In a double-blind, randomized cross-over trial women with strictly defined
      menstrual migraine will receive treatment with 100 microg 17-beta estradiol/placebo
      transdermally one week before the estimated start of the menstrual bleeding and twoo weeks
      on. After three cycles and a wash-out period the treatment will be repeated but now with the
      tratment the woman did not have during the first treatment period. The women serve as their
      own controls.
