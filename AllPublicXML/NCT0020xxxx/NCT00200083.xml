  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of the IGS system in a
      population of patients with a BMI between 35 and 55 kg/m2.

      SHAPE was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center pivotal study in which
      all subjects were implanted with the IGS system.
