      The purpose of this study is to monitor the performance and determine the metal ion release
      of the Pinnacle™ Cup with a metal-on-metal bearing combination in the treatment of patients
      with hip joint disease requiring a total hip replacement. Patients who enter the study will
      be evaluated at regular intervals following hip surgery using patient, clinical and x-ray
      assessments. A subset of patients will also have blood samples taken at regular intervals to
      allow the metal ion levels to be determined.

        iii) Women who are pregnant.

        iv) Subjects who are known drug or alcohol abusers or with psychological disorders that
        could affect follow-up care or treatment outcomes.

        v) Subjects who have participated in a clinical study with an investigational product in
        the last 12 months.

        vi) Subjects who are currently involved in any injury litigation claims.

        Additional Exclusion Criteria for Subjects Having Blood Analysis:

          1. Subjects who currently have other metallic foreign bodies including trauma products
             and joint arthroplasties unless known to be pure titanium or titanium alloy.
