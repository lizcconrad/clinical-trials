    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the effects on kidney function of
      two contrast media, the iso-osmolar iodixanol and the low-osmolar iopamidol in patients at
      risk of kidney damage associated with the injection of contrast media. A standard hydration
      procedure, based on available guidelines will be given to all patients to prevent negative
      effects on the kidneys. Serum creatinine (SCr ) concentrations will be measured before and up
      to 7 days after contrast media administration to evaluate the effects on renal function.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a combination of diabetes mellitus (type I or II) and renal impairment,
             defined as serum creatinine (SCr ) ≥150 µmol/L (1.7 mg/dL) for men and ≥133 µmol/L
             (1.5 mg/dL) for women or creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≤ 50 mL/min calculated according
             to Cockroft-Gault formula, referred for coronary angiography with or without PCI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent administration of potentially nephroprotective or nephrotoxic drugs is not
             allowed. Subjects undergoing dialysis or kidney transplant will not be included.
