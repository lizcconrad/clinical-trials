    <textblock>
      Emphysema is a progressive, debilitating disease that affects nearly 3 million people in the
      United States or roughly one percent of the US population. The disease is characterized by
      destruction of lung tissue as a result of inflammation caused by exposure to noxious inhaled
      agents for extended periods. The most common cause of this condition is cigarette smoking,
      although genetic and occupational causes account for up to 10% of cases. Despite aggressive
      public health initiatives aimed at discouraging the use of cigarettes, smoking-related lung
      diseases remain a significant cause of disability and death in the United States. Currently
      there are 46 million smokers in the US. Due to the number of current and new smokers,
      emphysema is expected to remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United
      States for years to come.

      Aeris has developed a novel bronchoscopic system for achieving the benefits of lung volume
      reduction without surgery. The Bronchoscopic Lung Volume Reduction (BLVR) Hydrogel System, a
      new investigational therapy for emphysema, is intended to reduce lung volume over a period of
      weeks by collapsing and promoting the remodeling of diseased areas of the lung. The resulting
      reduction in lung volume is intended to restore a more normal physiological relationship
      between lung and chest wall, improve breathing and exercise capacity and alleviate symptoms
      of chronic dyspnea. The current study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of this procedure
      in patients with advanced emphysema.
