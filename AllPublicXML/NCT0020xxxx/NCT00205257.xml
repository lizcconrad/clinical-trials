  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute rejection is still a major risk factor affecting the prognosis of kidney transplant
      patients. Alloreactive cells of the recipient infiltrate the kidney graft and cause
      inflammatory reaction which damages the graft structure and function. Conventional diagnosis
      of acute rejection is based on clinical symptoms and kidney biopsy examination. The clinical
      symptoms are a result of the kidney damage, which occurs days after the initiation of the
      rejection reaction. Kidney biopsy is an invasive and expensive procedure. It has been wished
      to have new parameters that can replace/supplement the conventional procedures. Chemokines
      are small molecules that attract inflammatory cells. Changes of chemokine levels in the urine
      may correlate with the immune status in the kidney. A systematic study to evaluate the
      chemokine levels in urine and correlation with the kidney biopsy pathology will answer the
      question whether monitoring of urinary chemokines would be useful in predicting graft
      rejection/damage.
