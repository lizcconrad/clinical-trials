  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This post-market clinical follow-up study was designed to compare hip replacement outcomes of
      the European Hip against 3 controls (Omniflex, Zweymuller, and Spotorno), however Omniflex
      did not end up being used. The first patient had surgery on February 18, 2000 and the final
      patient had surgery on September 2, 2005. There were 317 subjects consented but only 301 had
      hip replacement surgery (subjects received: 220 European hips, 33 Zweymuller, and 48
      Spotorno). The study took place at three sites. Each site used their standard device as the
      control. The Austrian site enrolled 69 European hips and 33 Zweymuller hips. 92 European hips
      and 48 Spotorno hips were enrolled in Germany. Finally, the site in Italy enrolled 59
      European hips. Although the study protocol intended collecting DEXA and RSA outcomes, the
      data collected by the sites did not include these outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        i) Administrative - The subject is able to understand the study, is willing to give

        geographically able to comply with the post-operative follow-up regime.

        ii) Age - The subject's age is between 18 and 75 years inclusive.

        iii) Sex - Male or female subjects may be recruited to the study.

        iv) Diagnosis -Subjects must be undergoing primary THR surgery for non-inflammatory
        degenerative joint disease including osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis, post-traumatic
        arthritis, fractured neck of femur and non-union of fractured neck of femur, SUFE or
        Perthes disease.

        v) Suitability - Subjects who in the opinion of the Investigator are considered to be
        suitable for treatment with the devices involved in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        years (excluding basal cell carcinoma or cervical carcinoma).

        v) Subjects with any condition which may, in the opinion of the Investigator, interfere
        with the total hip replacement's survival or outcome, e.g. Paget's disease, Charcot's
        disease.

        vi) Subjects with psycho-social disorders which, in the opinion of the Investigator would
        limit rehabilitation.

        vii) Subject's whose weight is &gt; 100kg.

        viii) Subjects with femoral head necrosis on the non-operated side (RSA and DEXA subjects
