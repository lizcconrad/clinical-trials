      A multicenter Open-label, single-arm feasibility study is conducted on patients with
      histological stage IV colorectal cancer given oxaliplatin, leucovorin plus fluorouracil. The
      usefulness of this regimens as therapy for colorectal cancer was evaluated by the
      disease-free survival rate (DFR), overall survival rate (OS), incidence and severity of
      adverse event.
