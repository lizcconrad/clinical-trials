    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide a mechanism for the emergency use of tigecycline in
      the appropriate clinical situations.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tigecycline in the
      treatment of patients with selected serious infections where other treatment has not been
      successful.
