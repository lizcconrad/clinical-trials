      Specific Aims: Environmental factors contributing to overconsumption, such as larger food
      portion sizes, may be contributing to the obesity epidemic. The objective of the proposed
      study is to examine the independent and combined effects of portion size and quantity of food
      on intake in normal weight males and females. Participants will be randomly assigned to one
      of four conditions varying in the portion size and quantity of junk food provided: small
      quantity of food packaged in small portions (SSP), small quantity of food packaged in large
      portions (SLP), large quantity of food packaged in small portions (LSP), and large quantity
      of food packaged in large portions (LLP). A box containing four different junk foods,
      packaged according to one of the four conditions, will be given to participants to take home
      for three days. The total amount of food consumed from the box over the three days will be
      measured. It is anticipated that portion size and quantity of food, both independently and
      combined, will influence intake, such that larger portion sizes and quantity of food provided
      to participants will produce greater intake.Subject Population: We propose to recruit 60
      healthy men and women, aged 18-50 years, with a body mass index (BMI) of less than or equal
      to 28. Participants will be non-smokers, unrestrained eaters, and have no known food
      allergies to the foods used in the investigation.Methods/Design: Participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of four conditions, varying in portion size (small versus large) and
      quantity of food provided (small versus large). A box containing four junk foods, packaged
      according to one of the conditions, will be provided to participants. They will be encouraged
      to eat as much or as little of the food as they want, but to at least taste each of the four
      foods over the three-day period. During this time, they will be instructed to not eat any
      other junk foods. At the end of the three-day period, participants will return the box with
      any remaining uneaten junk food.Data Analyses: The dependent variables, the amount of grams
      and kcals consumed from the provided junk foods, will be examined between the four different
      conditions.Significance: If portion size and quantity are related to intake, subsequent
      studies will develop clinical interventions related to reducing portion size and/or quantity
      of food available in the household.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Healthy, non-smoking, normal- and over-weight (body mass index [BMI] &lt; 30) unrestrained,
        males and females, who regularly eat junk foods (consume junk foods &gt; 3 times per week).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants will be excluded if they are not between the ages of 18 and 50, smoke,
        following a weight loss diet, an athlete in training, pregnant or breastfeeding, or have a
        health condition or use medication that affects eating or requires specialized diet therapy
        (e.g., diabetes). Additionally, if participants rarely consume junk foods (&lt; 2 times per
        week) or have allergies or unfavorable preferences towards foods used in the investigation
        they will be excluded from the study. Participants will also be excluded if they are a
        restrained eater (scoring &gt; 12 on the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire [TFEQ] [Stunkard &amp;
        Messick, 1985]) or report being a binge eater.-
