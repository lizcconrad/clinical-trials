  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will specify and delineate the separate components of cognitive deficits
      and examine the effects of adjunctive cholinergic augmentation on these cognitive deficits as
      well as psychopathology in schizophrenic patients treated with an antipsychotic compound with
      no aberrant binding affinity for the cholinergic receptor system. The hypothesis is that
      cholinergic augmentation using donepezil will improve cognitive deficits, sensory gating
      deficits, and psychopathology in schizophrenic patients treated with an atypical
      antipsychotic (ziprasidone).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of cholinergic augmentation of atypical
      antipsychotic medication on:

        -  Cognitive deficits

        -  Sensorimotor gating

        -  Psychopathology

      The primary objective was to examine:

      â€¢ The effects of donepezil, compared to the effects of placebo, on cognitive function,
      sensorimotor gating and psychopathology in patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic
      (ziprasidone).

      Secondary objectives are to examine:

        -  The effect of donepezil, compared to the effects of placebo, on cognitive function,
           sensorimotor gating and psychopathology in patients treated with ziprasidone.

        -  Which specific areas of cognitive deficits benefit from cholinergic augmentation of
           atypical antipsychotic treatment.

        -  The interactions between cognitive deficits and psychopathology: To what extent the
           effects of cholinergic augmentation on psychopathology, sensorimotor gating, and
           cognition are independent or correlated.

        -  Which specific brain areas are activated during cholinergic augmentation of treatment
           with an atypical antipsychotic drug (ziprasidone).

      Participants: Schizophrenic men and women between the ages 18 to 55 who meet the ICD-10
      criteria for schizophrenia living in the catchment area of the psychiatric departments of
      Bispebjerg University Hospital,Rigshospitalet, or Psychiatric Center, Glostrup. Patients can
      be either unmedicated, or need to be switched from other antipsychotic medications due to
      side-effects, or lack of effect on negative symptoms, positive symptoms, or cognitive
      function. Patients can be enrolled in the study as inpatients or outpatients, and changes in
      hospitalization status during the trial are allowed. Patients were stabilized on
      antipsychotic medication (ziprasidone) before they were randomized to treatment with either
      donepezil or placebo.

          -  Patients: Men and women between the ages 18 to 55 who meet the ICD-10 criteria for
             schizophrenia living in the catchment area of the psychiatric departments of
             Bispebjerg University Hospital, Psychiatric Center, Glostrup and Rigshospitalet.
             Patients can be either unmedicated, or need to be switched from other antipsychotic
             medications due to side-effects, or lack of effect on negative symptoms, positive
             symptoms, or cognitive function.

          -  Controls: Healthy men and women matched according to gender, age, and socio-economic
             status (determined by the level of education and income of parents).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients: Patients hospitalized against their will. Patients with a serious medical
             illness or with laboratory abnormalities, where pharmacotherapy poses a substantial
             clinical risk; pregnant or lactating patients; patients with organic psychosis, a
             history of severe head trauma or convulsive disorders, or patients with mental
             retardation. Patients with significant alcohol- or drug dependence are excluded.

          -  Controls: Pregnant or lactating women; a history of severe head trauma; mental
             retardation; learning difficulties; a history of psychiatric illness or a familial
             predisposition to psychiatric illness (in first-degree relatives); significant
             alcohol- or drug dependence; episodic incidents of excessive alcohol consumption or
             drug abuse are not reasons for exclusion. Abuse is monitored by interviewing patients
             and by measuring the urine content for amphetamine, cannabinoles, opiates, and
             benzodiazepines. Concomitant use of benzodiazepines for agitation or insomnia
             (oxazepam up to 45 mg daily) is allowed when needed and when used conservatively
             during the trial. Use of anticholinergic compounds is not allowed.
