  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We want to compare Taxol given weekly with Taxotere given every 3 week both in comination
      with Xeloda. We are going to compare time to treatment failure and quality of life.

      Open labeled randomized multicentre phase II/III trial. It is intended to include patients
      who are not usually included into clinical trials because they are not having disease with
      measurable lesions. In breast cancer the bulk of patients with metastatic disease is
      presenting with bone metastases which is difficult to evaluate with respect to response. In
      this study it is one of the main objectives to include this kind of everyday patients that we
      see in the clinic.

      Because of this we will be using TTF as the primary endpoint. Skeletal events requiring
      radiotherapy or major changes in pain medications are defined as treatment failures causing
      stop in treatment even in the absence of radiological findings.

      A: weekly Taxol® plus Xeloda® on days 1-14 q 3w B: Taxotere® q 3w plus Xeloda® on days 1-14 q
      3w

      Patients are randomized equally between the two arms.

      Concomitant therapy: Simultaneous use of bisphosphonates is allowed, if this treatment has
      been initiated at least four weeks before study entry.

        Inclusion Criteria: Morphologically proven breast carcinoma

        Written informed patient consent Measurable and/or evaluable disease Measurable disease is
        defined as least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension as
        ≥20 mm by conventional techniques, or as ≥10 mm by spiral CT scan) as defined in section 8.

        Evaluable metastases. Lytic bone metastases as only site of recurrence are allowed and can
        be evaluated for response according to the WHO-criteria for reporting on response in bone
        metastases.

        Age 18 years or older ECOG Performance Status 0-2 Life expectancy of at least three months
        Adequate cardiac functions

        Adequate hematological, renal and hepatic functions, defined as:

        White blood cell count &gt; 3.9 x 109/L Trombocytes &gt; 100 x 109/L Serum creatinine &lt; 1.25 x
        ULN* Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 ULN If alkaline phosphatases (ALP) is normal ALAT &lt; 3.5 ULN ASAT &lt; 3.5
        ULN If alkaline phosphatases (ALP) is &gt; 2.5 ULN ALAT &lt; 1.5 ULN ASAT &lt; 1.5 ULN

        Exclusion Criteria: Recurrence-free interval less than one year, if previous adjuvant or
        neoadjuvant regimen contained a taxane

        Neoplasm other than breast carcinoma, except for non-melanoma skin cancer or curatively
        treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, diagnosed during the past five years

        Pregnancy or lactation

        Known brain metastases

        Preexisting motor or sensory neuropathy ≥ grade 2 according to NCI CTC 2.0 criteria (severe
        paresthesia and/or mild weakness, or worse)

        Severe hepatic or renal impairment (for capecitabine: calculated creatinine clearance below
        30 ml/min; for calculation, see p. 5.1.4) not allowing for adequate use of the proposed
        regimens

        History of known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency (severe reaction on
        previous treatment with fluorouracil)

        Active infection or other serious underlying medical condition which would impair the
        ability of the patient to receive protocol treatment, including prior allergic reactions to
        drugs containing cremophor, such as teniposide, cyclosporine or vitamin K

        Dementia or significantly altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding and
        giving of informed consent.
