      The information gathered from normal pediatric patients seen at the Pediatric Neurology
      Clinic in the DCAM and LaRabida Children's Hospital will be used to standardize and validate
      the information gathered from pediatric patients with sleep disorders. This will serve as the
      information source for a pediatric sleep database.

      A sleep questionnaire will be administered to patients who present to the Pediatric Neurology
      Clinic and LaRabida Children's Hospital. The questions asked are those routinely obtained in
      the clinical practice of sleep medicine. Medical students, residents and faculty as part of
      their normal clinical responsibilities will administer the questionnaire. The database will
      be maintained in Filemaker Pro program for future research purposes. Collection of the data
      will require approximately 15 minutes. A database file number not related to the patient
      medical record number will be assigned to each patient. The investigator will keep a separate
      log linking patient database number and patient medical record number. The logbook will be
      kept under lock and key by the investigator.
