      This is a study of infliximab (Remicade) in subjects with Crohn's disease

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease is a disease characterized by inflammation (the changes that happen when
      tissues in the body are injured) and ulceration (formation of pus) of the bowel. The purpose
      of this study is to investigate the safety and therapeutic effect of two different doses of
      an anti-TNFÎ± (tumor necrosis factor) antibody (a protein) given multiple times compared to a
      single dose followed by placebo (inactive substance). The name of the antibody is infliximab
      (Remicade) The goal of the study is to evaluate whether patients respond longer to a single
      dose of infliximab or to repeated doses of infliximab.

      Subjects will receive an infusion of infliximab at week 0 followed by infusions of infliximab
      or placebo at weeks 2, 6, 14 and every 8 weeks until week 54. Patients who lose response are
      eligible for additional infliximab treatment.
