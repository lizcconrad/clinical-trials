  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We, the investigators at the University of Wisconsin, hypothesized that ingesting calcium
      tablets prior to a spine bone density scan will not affect the bone mineral density as
      measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

      We hypothesized that ingesting calcium tablets prior to a spine bone density scan will not
      affect the bone mineral density as measured by DXA. To test this, 36 subjects ingested
      various calcium supplements after a spine DXA scan and were then scanned again 15, 30 and 45
      minutes after ingestion. Subsequently a subset of 15 subjects had three spine scans performed
      for instrument precision and subsequently ingested a calcium tablet with scans 15 and 30
      minute intervals after ingestion.
