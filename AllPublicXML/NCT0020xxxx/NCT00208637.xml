  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High protein diets are popular among Maori, especially on the East Coast of the North Island.
      The purpose of this study was to compare the metabolic effects of a moderate carbohydrate,
      high protein diet (MCHP) with a high carbohydrate-high fibre (HCHF) diet on insulin
      sensitivity in Maori at increased risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

      This was a 6-month pilot intervention study of self-identifying Maori participants in a
      randomised control trial conducted in Dunedin and Invercargill. The study consisted of three,
      two month phases and was conducted over a period of six months. Participants meeting all the
      inclusion criteria were randomised into three groups: moderate carbohydrate-high protein
      (MCHP), high carbohydrate-high fibre (HCHF) or a control group. Those randomised to the
      experimental diets were recommended an energy intake based on their current BMI levels. The
      aim of phase one was to achieve weight loss with weekly advice and support from the research
      team. The aim of phase two was for weight maintenance with continued weekly advice and
      support. Phase three consisted of a weight maintenance phase without support. Those in the
      control group were instructed to follow their own self selected diet plan.

      Outcome was determined by examining surrogate clinical endpoints. The clinical endpoints
      included the following recorded measurements of anthropometric measurements, bioelectrical
      impedance measurements, profile of mood state questionnaires, activity questionnaires, and
      three day diet records were collected at 0, 2, 4 and 6 month periods. Biochemical measures of
      lipid profile, fasting insulin and glucose, liver functions and uric acid levels were also
      conducted.
