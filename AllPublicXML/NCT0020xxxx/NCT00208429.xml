    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to monitor the performance of the Pinnacle™ Cup with a
      polyethylene-on-metal bearing combination in the treatment of patients with hip joint disease
      requiring a total hip replacement. Patients who enter the study will be evaluated at regular
      intervals following hip surgery using patient, clinical and x-ray assessments.
