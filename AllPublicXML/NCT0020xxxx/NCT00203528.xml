      (ER) compared to risperidone in the treatment of bipolar disorder with comorbid substance use
      disorder

      Patients will be screened up to seven days at which time the following assessments will be
      completed: the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), general medical history,
      psychiatric history, physical examination, physicians assessment, and laboratory tests.
      Patients who are on mood stabilizers and oral neuroleptics prior to study enrollment and are
      not responding fully to these medications will be tapered off of the medication for a washout
      period of 48 hours. After the completion of screening, only patients who are determined to be
      eligible for the study will be randomized to study medication (divalproex or risperidone) in
      a 1:1 double-blind fashion. Scheduled study visits will occur every two weeks for a total of
      12 weeks. Assessments for each visit, from the baseline visit to the week 12 visit are as
      follows: the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF),
      Alcohol and Drug Use Inventory, clinician alcohol and drug use scales, self report scales,
      adverse events, vital signs and weight, concomitant medications, urine drug screen, and study
      medication accountability. Designated research staff will complete assessments weekly.
      Investigators will be blinded to laboratory tests completed at week 2, 4, and 12 visits.
      Patients randomized to Depakote ER will begin 500mg BID on day of randomization and remain on
      this dose for 5 days, then on day 6 increase to 20mg/kg to achieve valproic acid levels of
      80-100 (blinded laboratory reporting). Patients randomized to risperidone, initially start
      with 2mg QD with an increase to 4mg at day 5 and increase (as tolerated or required) up to
      6mg/d.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed written informed consent for trial participation.

          -  Male or female patients, ages 19-65.

          -  Patients must meet DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I or bipolar II disorder (any phase of
             illness) and concurrent substance use disorder (alcohol or illicit drug abuse or
             dependence).

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must be using a reliable method of
             contraception. Reliable methods of contraception include hormonal contraceptives (oral
             contraceptive or long-term injectable or implantable hormonal contraceptive), barrier
             methods (e.g., condom and diaphragm, condom and foam, condom and sponge), intrauterine
             devices, and tubal ligation.

          -  Female patients of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test
             at screening.

          -  Patients must not have other serious unstable illnesses and must be otherwise
             physically stable on the basis of a physical exam, medical history, and the results of
             blood biochemistry, hematology tests, and a urinalysis.

          -  Patients must complete at least a 48-hour wash screening/washout period for mood
             stabilizers and oral neuroleptics.The wash screening/washout period may be completed
             as an inpatient. If so patient may remain an inpatient as long as necessary. Should
             the patient become discharged he or she must be able to continue in the study as an
             outpatient.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a current DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

          -  Patients who are legally incompetent

             excluding trazodone for insomnia.

          -  Patients with Axis I or Axis II diagnosis that in the investigatorâ€™s opinion, would
             interfere with compliance or confound interpretation of the results.

          -  Patients with CNS neoplasm, uncontrolled metabolic, endocrine, demyelinating or
             progressive neurological disorder, pancreatitis, or urea cycle disorder.

             three times the upper limit of normal prior to randomization.

          -  Patients with a history of a chronic or acute medical disorder that, in the opinion of
             the investigator, would confound interpretation of the study results.

          -  Patients with a medical condition that requires the continuous use of medication that
             would interfere with the evaluation of safety or efficacy of divalproex ER or
             risperidone. Patients receiving beta-blockers are excluded unless the dose has been
             stable for greater than 6 months.

          -  Patients who have received depot neuroleptic medication within one inter-injection
             interval of randomization. Patients on depot medications may be included if they are
