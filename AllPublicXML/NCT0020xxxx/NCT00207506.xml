    <textblock>
      Non-professional community leaders may be at a great advantage in reaching otherwise hard to
      reach populations for the purpose of advising on sexually transmitted disease (STD)
      prevention (lay health advisors), health care access, and model health behavior. Latino
      migrant farm workers are at increased risk for STD and might benefit from such lay health
      advisors. The study will examine whether this strategy is a useful one for STD prevention in
      Latino migrant farm workers in rural and small town areas of North Carolina.

      This is a demonstration project which includes the development, implementation, and
      evaluation of HoMBReS: Hombres Manteniendo Bienestar y Relaciones Saludables (Men Maintaining
      Wellness and Healthy Relationships). Applying a community-based participatory research (CBPR)
      approach, this 3-year study uses a quasi-experimental delayed-intervention comparison group
      design to assess the feasibility of implementing and the potential efficacy of an adult
      soccer league-based lay health advisor intervention. The intervention is designed to: reduce
      sexual risk behaviors among Latino seasonal farmworkers; enhance access to sexually
      transmitted disease/HIV healthcare services; and develop effective data collection methods
      among Latino men.
