  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is of great clinical relevance to know if selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors affect
      information processing. Our hypothesis was that aspects of information processing would be
      disturbed whereas others would improve.

    <textblock>
      Numerous studies point to an increased serotoninergic activity in schizophrenia.
      Additionally, patients with schizophrenia often show reduced filtering of sensory
      information, which is reflected in reduced P50 suppression and reduced prepulse inhibition of
      the startle refex (PPI). Currently, the reports in literature on the effects of serotonergic
      agonists on sensory gating in humans are inconclusive. In an initial study performed in our
      laboratory, however, we found reduced P50 suppression following administration of imipramine
      (a combined serotonin- and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor) to healthy volunteers. This
      result provides evidence for the involvement of either serotonergic, noradrenergic, or a
      combination of both pathways in sensory gating. In numerous animal studies however, sensory
      gating is reduced by agonists of 5-HT, which suggests a serotonergic, rather than a
      noradrenergic, involvement in sensory gating. Therefore, in a follow-up study, the effects of
      a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (escitalopram) will be investigated on sensory
      gating parameters of healthy volunteers. To further extend the data of our initial study, the
      subjects will additionally be tested for two more psychophysiological parameters of attention
      that are usually found to be disturbed in patients with schizophrenia, i.e. mismatch
      negativity and selective attention. The design will be a double blind, placebo controlled
      experiment, in which a single dose of escitalopram or placebo will be given to healthy,
      non-smoking male volunteers on two occasions, separated by at least a week, after which the
      subjects will be tested in the psychophysiological test battery.
