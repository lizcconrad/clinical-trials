      The purpose of this study is to ascertain whether Depakote ER (Divalproex ER) has efficacy in
      the treatment of patients with bipolar disorder in the manic phase, who also have comorbid
      substance abuse diagnoses. It is proposed that Depakote ER will decrease scores on the Young
      Mania Rating Scale and the Substance Abuse Time Line Follow Back.
