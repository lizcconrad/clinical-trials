  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study using cerebral oximetry to evaluate the safety of traditionally adopted
      hypotensive anesthesia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The values of cerebral oximetry were analyzed between different stages of anesthetic
      management. The critical part of anesthetic management is to use the technique of controlled
      hypotension. The blood pressure was lowered to the level of MABP 50 or 60 mmHg depending on
      which group patients were assigned to.

      The values of cerebral oximetry and side effects between 2 groups will be compared at the
      completion of data collection.
