  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Topiramate is a medication that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      for the treatment of patients with seizures. The trade name for this drug is TopamaxÂ®.
      Topiramate has not been approved by the FDA for the treatment of cluster headache and is
      experimental for the purposes of this research study. If a subject participates in this
      study, he/she will increase his/her dose of topiramate rapidly in the first few weeks to try
      to stop the cluster attacks and then will continue on a maintenance dose of topiramate in
      order to determine if it can prevent attacks from occurring during that cluster period. We
      believe that this will lead not only to a faster but a more complete remission of the cluster
      period.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects between the ages of 18 and 65 with a diagnosis of cluster headache (episodic
             or chronic) as defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders (2nd
             edition)

          -  Subjects must have a lifetime prevalence of at least 2 prior cluster cycles.

          -  Subjects must experience one or more attacks/ day during baseline period

          -  Subjects must have a typical cluster period lasting at least 8 weeks. Subjects must
             present in active cluster period and the expected remaining duration of the cluster
             cycle must be at least 8 weeks from Baseline visit.

          -  Subjects with other headache types are eligible provided the subject is able to
             differentiate these headaches from cluster headaches.

          -  Subject is using or agrees to use for the duration of participation a medically
             acceptable form of contraception (as determined by investigator), if female of
             child-bearing potential

          -  Subject has negative urine pregnancy test prior to study entry, if female of
             child-bearing potential

          -  Subject is able to understand and comply with all study requirements

          -  Subject provides written informed consent prior to any screening procedures being
             conducted

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Subjects who, in the investigators opinion, have a history or have evidence of a
             medical or psychiatric condition that would expose them to an increased risk of a
             significant adverse event or would interfere with the assessments of efficacy and
             tolerability during this trial

          -  Subjects who require a change in medication or existing regimen of medication for the
             prophylaxis of cluster in the 4 weeks prior to Baseline visit and for the duration of
             the trial

          -  Subjects who have cluster headaches that typically exceed 4 hours

          -  Subjects who have used the following medications/ treatments from four weeks prior to
             Baseline visit: corticosteroids and nerve blocks.

          -  Subjects using any drug which might interact adversely with, or interfere with the
             action of, the study medication (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors)

          -  Subjects who have failed an adequate trial of topiramate for cluster headaches due to
             lack of efficacy or adverse events, as determined by the investigator

          -  Subjects with a history of nephrolithiasis.

          -  Subjects who are allergic to or have shown hypersensitivity topiramate or agents
             similar to topiramate

          -  Subjects who abuse opioids as determined by investigator

          -  Subjects with a history of significant drug or alcohol abuse within the past year

          -  Subjects who have participated in an investigational drug trial in the 30 days prior
             to the screening visit
