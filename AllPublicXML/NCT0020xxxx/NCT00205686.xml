  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DHEA or dehydroepiandrosterone is a naturally occurring hormone secreted by tghe adrenal
      galnds. The secretion of HDEA declines with aging. DHEA is considered a food supplement and
      it is not regulated by the FDA. The purpose of this research is to evaluate ceratin of the
      biological effects of a reaplcement dose of DHEA. As you get older, DHEA levels are lower
      than you were younger. The replamcent dose is the dose of DHEA that will raise DHEA levesl to
      the levels found in young people. Anotehr purpose is to determine whether DHEA enhances the
      adaptations to an exercise training program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DHEA declines dramatically with age. Low DHEA levels have been found to correlate with
      sarcopenia and osteopenia. It is, therefore, postulated that many physiologic changes of
      aging are secondary to the decline in DHEA. Thus, the objective of the proposed research is
      to evaluate the effect of DHEA replacement on age-related changes in body composition, muscle
      function and metabolism, and bone mass in healthy older adults. The specific aims are to
      evaluate the effects of DHEA replacement (50 mg/d) alone, or in combination with resistance
      exercise training on: a) lean body mass, intraabdominal fat and thigh muscle volume, and
      muscle protein synthesis rate b) bone mineral density (BMD) of the total body, lumbar spine,
      and hip and biochemical markers of bone turnover and c) insulin sensitivity. It is
      hypothesized that DHEA administration will have additive or synergistic effects with
      exercise. Healthy but sedentary subjects , aged 65-78 years old, will be randomized to
      receive either DHEA, 50 mg/d, or placebo and to participate in either supervised or home
      exercise training programs. The supervised exercise program will consist of resistance
      training designed to increase muscle mass, strength, and bone mass, and decrease fat mass.
      The goal of this research is to provide information on the potential role of DHEA replacement
      therapy in maintaining the physical health and functional capacity of older people
