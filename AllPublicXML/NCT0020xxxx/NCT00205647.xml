  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randonmized, masked, placebo-controlled parallel group, clinical trial to evaluate
      the effects of three different doses of N-acetyl L-cysteine (NAC) and placebo on patient
      safety and on physical and transport properties of expectorated sputum. Patient sumptoms,
      quality of life and exacerbation will also be followed as well as pulmonary function testing
      and functional exercise capacity. We hypothesized that a prolongeed course of oral NAC
      favorably affects the morbidity of chronic bronchitis, particularly the incidence of acute
      exacerbations.
