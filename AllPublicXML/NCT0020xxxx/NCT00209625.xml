  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We performed a phase I/II study of CPT-11/5FU/l-LV in advanced colorectal cancer, to
      determine the optimal dose of CPT-11 and to estimate the safety and efficacy of this regimen

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multicenter Open-label, single-arm, phase I/II clinical trial is conducted on patients with
      histological stage IV colorectal cancer given irinotecan, leucovorin plus fluorouracil. The
      usefulness of this regimens as 1st line therapy for colorectal cancer was evaluated by the
      disease-free survival rate (DFR), median survival time (MST), incidence and severity of
      adverse event.
