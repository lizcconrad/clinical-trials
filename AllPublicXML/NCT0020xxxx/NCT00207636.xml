      The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a computer-based decision aid (DA) for
      use by men considering PSA screening for prostate cancer. Major medical organizations
      recommend that men discuss the risks and benefits of this test with their physician before
      making the decision. This educational, interactive DA will help them prepare for that
      discussion.

    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (CaP) is a formidable public health problem in the US and in industrialized
      countries worldwide. Methods for primary prevention of CaP are unknown. As a result, early
      detection has become a mainstay of cancer control efforts. However, there is considerable
      controversy regarding the efficacy of screening in reducing disease-specific mortality. In
      light of this uncertainty, major medical organizations, including the National Cancer
      Institute, currently recommend that men discuss the pros and cons of CaP screening and make
      individualized screening decisions with their health care providers. However, because of
      constraints on time during medical encounters, it is not always feasible for providers to
      engage in in-depth discussions regarding the complexities of this issue. Therefore,
      interventions to promote informed decision-making (IDM) outside of clinical settings are
      needed.

      In this study, we propose to: (1) develop an interactive computer-based decision aid (DA) to
      promote IDM for CaP screening; and (2) conduct a randomized controlled worksite trial to
      evaluate the impact the DA intervention on employed menâ€™s ability to make informed decisions
      regarding CaP. This work is designed to be responsive to recent calls for IDM interventions
      in community settings among diverse populations. If successful, our findings could validate
      the effectiveness of DAs to promote IDM for CaP and serve as a model for widespread
      dissemination, thus improving quality of care.
