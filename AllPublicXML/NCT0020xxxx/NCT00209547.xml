  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The anticipation of pain and discomfort, a diagnosis, and other intrinsic unknowns make
      patients anxious both prior to and during a procedure. Therefore, the main goal of sedation
      with analgesia used during various diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical procedures is to
      relieve this anxiety, discomfort, and pain, which are all interrelated. The optimal level of
      sedation for any given patient is one that allows the patient to tolerate the procedure and
      provides an appropriate safety margin. This was a study designed to examine the safety and
      efficacy of AQUAVAN® Injection versus a commonly used approved sedative drug, midazolam HCl
      following pretreatment with fentanyl citrate injection (for pain relief) in producing
      sedation in patients undergoing single cardiac catheterization procedures.

      This was a randomized, open-label study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of
      AQUAVAN® Injection (hereafter referred to as AQUAVAN) versus the reference drug, midazolam
      HCl (hereafter referred to as midazolam) following pretreatment with fentanyl citrate
      injection (hereafter referred to as fentanyl) in producing sedation in male and female
      patients undergoing single PC procedures.

      Screening assessments were done within 2 weeks of scheduled procedures. After completion of
      preprocedural sedation assessments, patients were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment
      groups at a 3:1 (AQUAVAN: midazolam) allocation ratio on the day of the scheduled procedure
      (Day 0) via an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). Randomization was stratified by
      site.

      All patients, regardless of treatment group assignment, received fentanyl as an analgesic
      pretreatment. Supplemental doses of fentanyl could be administered if the patient reported
      pain or if analgesia was inadequate, as demonstrated by increased heart rate and/or blood
      pressure in the presence of adequate sedation. At no time was fentanyl to be administered to
      increase sedation levels.

      AQUAVAN or midazolam was administered by intravenous (i.v.) bolus to induce a state of
      minimal-to-moderate (procedural) s sedation, defined as a score of ≤4 on the Modified
      Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale. Supplemental doses were
      administered, if necessary, to increase the depth or duration of sedation. Supplemental doses
      were not administered if the Modified OAA/S score was ≤2 or if there was no purposeful
      response to stimulation. Patient and Investigator assessments were used to confirm that the
      depth of sedation met the goals of sedation, reduced anxiety, and awareness.

      Follow-up patient assessments were conducted in a telephone interview 24 hours following
      treatment and during a clinic visit 2 to 5 days following treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient provided signed/dated Informed Consent and HIPAA authorization after receiving
             a full explanation of the extent and nature of the study.

          2. Patient was at least 18 years of age at the time of screening (Prior to Amendment 2
             [dated 04 February 2005], the patient was required to be between 18 and 65 years of
             age, inclusive. Three subjects were randomized under this earlier inclusion criteria).

          3. If female, patient was surgically sterile, postmenopausal or not pregnant or lactating
             and had been using an acceptable method of birth control for at least 1 month prior to
             dosing, with a negative urine pregnancy test result at Screening and Predosing
             Periods.

          4. Patient met American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)13, 14 Physical Status
             Classification System level I to III; and

          5. Patient was an inpatient or outpatient scheduled to undergo a single PC procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient had history of allergic reaction or hypersensitivity to any anesthetic agent,
             narcotic, or benzodiazepine.

          2. Patient did not meet nils per os (NPO) status per ASA Guideline or institution's
             guideline.

          3. Patient had a condition(s) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could interfere
             with appropriate airway management.

          4. Patient had participated in an investigational drug study within 1 month prior to
             study start.

          5. Patient had history of mental or visual impairment that would not permit successful
             measurement of cognitive evaluations.

          6. Patient was unwilling to adhere to pre- and postprocedural instructions; or
