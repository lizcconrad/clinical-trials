  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MAIN AIMS: to analyze the efficacy of nasal CPAP treatment in patients with ischemic
      first-ever stroke and Sleep Apnea Syndrome (SAS) in terms of: early neurological outcome,
      functional recovery, quality of life influence, stroke recurrence and survival.

      SECONDARY AIMS: to evaluate the feasibility of the treatment in this type of patients at
      short and long time.

      DESIGN: clinical randomized case-control study.

      PATIENTS: younger than 75 years with a First-Ever stroke with at least one of the following
      criteria: snoring, observed apnea, Hypertension or Ischemic Cardiopathy.

      MEASUREMENTS: protocol to define subtype stroke and parenchymatous and vascular location;
      sleep questionnaire (including Epworth Sleepiness Scale); Respiratory Polysomnography (RPSG).
      If RPSG shows an AHI &gt; 20, with predominant obstructive events, patients will be randomized
      in a CONTROL GROUP (conventional treatment) and a TREATMENT GROUP (with Nasal CPAP). Follow
      up for both groups at 1, 3, 12 and 24 months will include: early neurological outcome, body
      mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), functional recovery (Barthel Index/Canadian Scale),
      quality of life (SF36), recurrences, vital status. Nasal CPAP titration will be performed by
      means of an automatic system (Autoset Portable ST). Compliance will be recorded. If a
      negative RPSG is obtained (AHI &lt; 10) (NO SAS GROUP) or with AHI &lt; 20 (mild SAS) the usual
      treatment and the same follow up protocol will be established.

      STATISTICS: the sample size is initially calculated in 10 patients for each group,
      considering this is part of a multicenter study including 8 centers. If no differences are
      found, depending on the statistical power the investigators will consider including more
      patients. The different groups will be compared for the analyzed variables with the
      corresponding tests.
