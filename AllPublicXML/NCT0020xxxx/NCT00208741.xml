      This study is being conducted at two sites in the United States. Approximately 50 patients,
      who are between the ages of 18 and 65 years old will be enrolled at Emory. This study
      consists of two parts. The first part consists of 12 weeks of open-label treatment with
      Gabitril. If the study doctor determines that the patients condition has improved and they
      have completed the initial 12 weeks of treatment they may be eligible for the second part of
      the study. This part is a 24-week double-blind treatment period with either Gabitril or
      placebo (inactive medication). There will also be a follow-up visit about 1 to 3 weeks after
      they have completed taking the study medication. Altogether study participation is expected
      to last approximately 37 weeks.
