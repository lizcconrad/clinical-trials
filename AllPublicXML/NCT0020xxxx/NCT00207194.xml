  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of Telephone-Linked_Care for Hypertension
      Regimen Adherence in an African American population (TLC-HTN-AA). TLC-HTN-AA is a
      computer-based telecommunication system that will monitor, educate and counsel African
      American adults with hypertension on adherence to medication, diet, and exercise. The primary
      hypotheses are:

        1. TLC-HTN-AA use will improve medication regiment adherence

        2. TLC-HTN-AA will improve adherence to 3 healthy diet recommendations

        3. TLC-HTN-AA will improve levels of regular exercise

        4. Patients receiving TLC-HTN-AA will be more likely to become adherent to all 3 target
           regiments than patients in the control group

    <description>The intervention was a totally automated, computer-based, interactive telephone counseling system called Telephone- Linked-Care, designed to monitor, educate, and counsel African-American adults with hypertension and to provide summary data regularly to the patient's primary care provider.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Health Behavior Education</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Placebo Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The comparator group received health education relating to the management of hypertension. Members of this group also received standard primary medical care.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Automated Telephone Program</intervention_name>
    <description>The intervention incorporated principles of social cognitive theory, the transtheoretical model of behavioral change, and motivational interviewing, and was tailored to the user's values. Content was also adapted to cultural characteristics of culturally African-American adults (i.e., not Caribbean-American, Black-Hispanic, etc.). These participants also received the same health behavior education those in the control condition received.</description>

    <description>Participants received a 75-page resource manual that described hypertension, listed dietary recommendations, heart healthy food recipes, and local resources for exercise, and provided information to support antihypertensive medication adherence. They received a 20-min education session based on the content of this manual, and were given a pedometer and a digital weight scale (Healthometer, model # HDR900KD01).</description>
