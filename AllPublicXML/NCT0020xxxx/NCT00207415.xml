  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The arthritis-specific Arthritis Self Help Course (ASHC) and the more generic Chronic Disease
      Self Management Program (CDSMP) teach generalizable skills for managing arthritis and other
      chronic diseases. In some locations it may be more feasible to combine efforts and offer the
      generic course rather than the arthritis-specific program. However anecdotal evidence has
      questioned whether people with arthritis obtain as much benefit from the more generic course
      as they do the arthritis-specific course. The primary purpose of this research study is to
      compare health outcomes among people with arthritis who participate in either ASHC or the
      CDSMP. The University of Illinois Project is emphasizing recruiting a balance of uran and
      rural participants. The results of this research will be used to guide Arthritis program
      recommendations on the use of ASHC and CDSMP to improve the quality of life for people with
      arthritis.
