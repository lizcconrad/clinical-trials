  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate if intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi) consisting of SP
      [Fansidar] given through the EPI scheme alongside routine immunisations at 3, 4 and 9 months
      of age reduces de incidence of clinical malaria up to 12 months of age

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of the antimalarial drug
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine administered intermittently at 3, 4 and 9 months of age through
      the EPI scheme at the time of routine immunisations.

      Children will be randomized into placebo and SP treatment groups by block randomization, and
      it is expected a similar age distribution and a similar number of children in each group.

      Doses of sulphadoxine (25 mg/kg)-pyrimethamine (1.25 mg/kg) (SP) or placebo will be given by
      a health assistant according to bodyweight (a quarter of a tablet for those &lt;5kg, a half for
      those 5-10 kg, and a whole tablet for children &gt;10 kg). The tablets will be crashed and
      diluted with water for their administration.
