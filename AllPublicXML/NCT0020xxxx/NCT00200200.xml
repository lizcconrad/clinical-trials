  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the addition of bevacizumab, to hepatic
      arterial therapy with floxuridine (FUDR) and dexamethasone (Dex) (regional chemotherapy), and
      either oxaliplatin or CPT-11, plus 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (systemic chemotherapy) will
      increase disease free survival in patients who have undergone liver resection. The patient
      will be randomized (a computer generated decision as in the flip of a coin) to receive, or
      not to receive bevacizumab in addition to regional and systemic chemotherapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma metastatic to the liver
             with no clinical or radiographic evidence of extrahepatic disease. Confirmation of
             diagnosis must be performed at MSKCC.

          -  Potentially completely resectable hepatic metastases without current evidence of other
             metastatic disease.

          -  Abdominal and pelvic CT scans and chest CT or x-ray within 6 weeks prior to
             registration. (MRI of abdomen may be substituted for CT of abdomen.)

          -  Lab values within 14 days prior to registration:

               -  WBC ≥ 3.0 K/uL

               -  ANC &gt; 1.5 K/uL

               -  Platelets ≥ 75 K/uL

               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL

             this study. [Note: no chemotherapy to be given after resection of liver lesions prior
             to treatment on this study.]

          -  KPS ≥ 70%

          -  Signed informed consent

          -  Patient age must be &gt;18

          -  Prior treatment with HAI FUDR.

          -  Female patients who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Subjects discovered to have ≥1+ proteinuria at baseline will undergo a 24-hour urine
             collection, which must be an adequate collection and must demonstrate &lt;1 g of

          -  Presence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.

          -  History of serious systemic disease, including myocardial infarction within the last
             12 months, uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure of &gt; 160/110 mmHg on medication),

             or greater congestive heart failure (see Appendix C), unstable symptomatic arrhythmia

             fibrillation or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia are eligible), or peripheral
             vascular disease (Grade II or greater).

          -  Patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack.
