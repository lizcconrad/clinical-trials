  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Certain methods of sedation increase the duration of respiratory failure. Two strategies, a
      nursing- implemented sedation algorithm and daily interruption of sedatives, decrease length
      of mechanical ventilation compared to &quot;conventional care&quot; but have not been compared to each
      other. The reason certain methods of sedation lead to prolonged respiratory failure is
      unknown but may be related to altered pharmacokinetics and dynamics that are unique to
      critically ill patients. Critically ill patients receive substantial doses of sedatives over
      prolonged periods. The impact of these management strategies on short- and long-term
      psychiatric complications are unknown. The study seeks to test the central hypothesis that
      sedation practices impact strongly on outcome of respiratory failure and psychiatric
      complications. The three specific aims are (1) to compare two sedation strategies (protocol
      directed sedation and daily interruption of sedatives), (2) to examine the prevalence of
      psychiatric complications, and (3) to compute the pharmacokinetics of commonly used sedatives
      and narcotics.

      These aims will be achieved by enrolling critically ill patients in a prospective randomized
      trial comparing the above mentioned sedation strategies, and assessing sedation level as well
      as delirium throughout the duration of respiratory failure. Sedative plasma levels will be
      measured, and pharmacokinetics computed. Psychiatric morbidity will be assessed by
      administration of validated questionnaires.
