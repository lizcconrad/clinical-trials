  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to determine the prevalence of tracheobronchial carcinomas
      in patients with a history of squamous cell cancer of the aerodigestive tract who have been
      treated with a curative intent and remain disease free. Detection of pre-invasive and
      invasive lesions (moderate to severe dysplasia, CIS) with fluorescence bronchoscopic
      surveillance may help to define the natural history of these lesions and allow earlier
      intervention should they progress to invasive lesions.
