      Hypothesis: Does the time spent within the target INR range differ when patients are managed
      by AMD or IT models of anticoagulation care?

      Experimental Design: The 36-month trial enrolled 192 eligible patients currently receiving
      chronic warfarin therapy at the William S. Middleton Memorial VA Hospital. Consenting
      patients are enrolled and randomized to 1 of 2 groups: usual clinic care with face-to-face
      visits every 4 weeks (AMS model) or clinic visits every 3 months with interim laboratory
      visits and telephone follow-up every 4 weeks (IT model). At study conclusion, the amount of
      time the INR is within target range will be compared between the two groups. Thromboembolic
      and bleeding event rates, patient knowledge, quality of life and healthcare utilization will
      also be analyzed.
