      To learn more about behavior and everyday functioning after brain injury, and to learn if
      behavior and functioning gets better with more education about changes after brain injury.

      To evaluate the efficacy of the First Steps intervention for improving neurobehavioral
      functioning, functional status, and life satisfaction, and for increasing knowledge about TBI
      and compensatory strategies. The First Steps program was developed to address the
      neurobehavioral and emotional concerns of survivors of TBI during the course of inpatient
      rehabilitation. Program format and content reflects clinical experience and extensive
      research review. Input from survivors, family members, and rehabilitation staff trained in
      working with the TBI population has also helped shape the implementation protocol. The
      foundation of the protocol is a curriculum [Niemeier, J., Kreutzer, J., &amp; Taylor, L. (2005).
      Acute cognitive and neurobehavioral intervention for individuals with acquired brain injury:
      Preliminary outcome data. Neuropsychological Rehabilitation, 15(2), 129-146.] The First Steps
      curriculum consists of ten lessons and was developed to address the common needs, issues, and
      concerns of TBI survivors admitted acutely for inpatient rehabilitation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  adults (18 years or older) who have experienced a TBI (damage to brain tissue caused
             by an external mechanical force as evidenced by: loss of consciousness due to brain
             trauma, or post traumatic amnesia, or skull fracture, or objective neurological
             findings that can be reasonably attributed to TBI on physical examination or mental
             status examination).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  imminent risk of psychiatric hospitalization, or in imminent danger of hurting
             themselves or others.

          -  unable to tolerate treatment sessions due to physical, cognitive, behavioral, or other
