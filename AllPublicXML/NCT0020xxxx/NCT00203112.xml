    <textblock>
      This study investigates the add-on effect of oral minocycline in subjects treated with daily
      injection of Copaxone. Copaxone and minocycline are thought to have differential modes of
      actions that may complement each other in treating MS symptoms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically definite MS as defined by Poser et al. (Ann. Neurol. 1983) with disease
             duration (from onset) of at least 6 months.

          2. Subjects must have a relapsing-remitting disease course.

          3. Subjects must have had at least 1 documented relapse within the last year prior to
             study entry.

          4. Subjects must have at least 1 and not more than 15 gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions
             on the screening MRI scan.

          5. Subjects must be relapse-free and not have taken corticosteroids (IV, IM and/or PO)
             within the 30 days prior to the screening visit.

          6. Subjects may be male or female. Women of child- bearing potential must use a
             contraceptive method deemed reliable by the investigator.

          7. Subjects must be between the ages of 18 and 50 years inclusive.

          8. Subjects must be ambulatory, with a Kurtzke EDSS score of between 0 and 5.0 inclusive.

          9. Subjects must be willing and able to give written informed consent prior to entering
             the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous use of injectable glatiramer acetate.

          2. Previous use of cladribine.

          3. Previous use of immunosuppressive agents in the last 6 months.

          4. Use of experimental or investigational drugs, including I.V. immunoglobulin and
             statins, within 6 months prior to study entry.

          5. Use of interferon agents or minocycline within 4 months prior to the screening visit.

          6. Chronic corticosteroid (IV, IM and/or PO) treatment (more than 30 consecutive days) in
             the 6 months prior to study entry.

          7. Previous total body irradiation or total lymphoid irradiation (TLI).

          8. Pregnancy or breast feeding.

          9. Subjects who experience a relapse between the screening (month -1) and baseline (month
             0) visits.

         10. Significant medical or psychiatric condition that affects the subject's ability to
             give informed consent, or to complete the study, or any condition which the
             investigator feels may interfere with participation in the study (e.g. alcohol or drug
             abuse).

         11. A known history of sensitivity to mannitol.

         12. Contraindication to or known history of sensitivity to tetracyclines.

         13. A known history of sensitivity to gadolinium.

         14. Inability to successfully undergo MRI scanning.
