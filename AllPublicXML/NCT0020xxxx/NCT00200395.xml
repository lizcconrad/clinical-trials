  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if OSI-774 (Tarceva) is effective in the
      treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and to further study its side effects. We would also
      like to estimate disease-related symptom improvement rates using a questionnaire.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, it has been shown that the degree of improvement achievable with
      chemotherapy has plateaued with the use of chemotherapy doublets. The presence of co-morbid
      conditions and poor performance status may preclude the use of chemotherapy in many elderly
      patients, which even in the medically fit, has modest benefits. The advent of targeted cancer
      therapy with the discovery of tyrosine kinases as mediators of tumor growth, with its limited
      toxicity profile, offers a promising approach to the treatment of NSCLC, in particular to the
      elderly subset of patients. The encouraging results from the other trials provide a strong
      rationale to evaluate an oral EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor OSI-774 in patients with
      advanced and inoperable NSCLC over the age of 70. In vitro and clinical data suggest a dose-
      dependent response with Tarceva (Genentech, data on file).
