    <textblock>
      It is thought that treating multiple sclerosis with Novantrone for a short period of time
      prior to treatment with Copaxone may enhance the onset effect of Copaxone.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Definite MS as determined by the McDonald criteria (Ann Neurol, July 2001) with a
             relapsing disease course.

          2. 2.EDSS 0.0 - 6.5 inclusive

          3. 18 to 55 years of age

          4. 1 or more T1 Gadolinium-enhancing lesions but no more than 15 lesions

          5. Able and willing to sign and date an informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients ever treated with Glatiramer Acetate or Mitoxantrone.

          2. Patients treated with interferons or IV immunoglobulins (IV Ig) in the previous 4
             weeks prior to screening visits.

          3. Patients treated with methotrexate or azathioprine in the previous 6 months prior to
             screening visits.

          4. Patients ever treated with cyclophosphamide or Total Lymphoid Irradiation (TLI), or
             cladribine for injection or anthracenediones or anthracyclines, or prior mediastinal
             radiotherapy.

          5. Patients treated with intravenous or oral steroids within 28 days prior to initial
             MRI.

          6. Female patients must be non-pregnant, non-lactating, have a negative screening
             pregnancy test, and must use contraceptive methods deemed reliable by the
             investigator.

          7. Male patients and their partners must use contraceptive methods deemed reliable by the
             investigator

          8. LVEF &lt; 50%

          9. Patients using catheters or Foley catheters

         10. Patients who have any other known significant systemic medical disease which may
             confound the evaluation of the study results such as: ALS, cervical spondylitic
             myelopathy, syphilis, arteritis, cerebellar syndrome (i.e., due to
             heredodegeneration), B12/folate deficiency, lyme disease, HTLV 1-myelopathy

         11. Patients with immune deficiency or other medical condition that would preclude
             treatment with Mitoxantrone or Glatiramer Acetate

         12. Abnormal screening blood tests exceeding any of the limits defined below:

             Alanine transaminase (ALT) - twice the upper limit of normal Aspartate transaminase
             (AST) - twice the upper limit of normal Total white blood cell count &lt; 2.3 x 103/uL
             Baseline neutrophil counts of &lt; 1.5 x103/uL Platelet count &lt; 80 x 103/uL Creatinine
             &gt;1.5 mg/dL Prothrombin time greater than 150% upper limit of normal

         13. Patients with any medical or psychiatric conditions that would make the patient
             unsuitable for this research, as determined by the investigator.
