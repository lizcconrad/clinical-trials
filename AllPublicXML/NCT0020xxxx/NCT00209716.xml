  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase I/II study is conducted to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT), and efficacy of a combination chemotherapy using docetaxel, cisplatin and
      5-fluorouracil (TPF) in Pre-treated patients with metastatic esophageal cancer. The
      usefulness of the this regimen is evaluated by response rate, median survival time, and
      progression free survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pre-treated measurable metastatic esophageal cancer were included in this
      trial. Patients received this combination chemotherapy repeated every 28 days until
      progression disease. Starting dose (dose level 1) were docetaxel 30 mg/m2 on day 1, fixed
      dose intravenously cisplatin (15 mg/m2/day) and continuous infusion 5-FU (800 mg/m2/day) on
      day 1-4. DLT was defined as follows (according to NCI-CTC version 2.0); Grade 4 neutropenia
      lasting for more than 4days, Grade 4 anemia and thrombocytopenia, Grade 3 neutropenia
      accompanied fever (&gt;38℃) , and Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity (except for nausea,
      appetite loss , general fatigue). Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD) is determined when the
      incidence of critical toxicity exceeds 50% at a certain dose level. Response rate will be
      calculated according to RECIST criteria.
