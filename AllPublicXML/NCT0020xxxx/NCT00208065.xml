  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate histamine, CGRP and VIP levels in saliva
      as biological markers for activation of trigeminal and parasympathetic nerve fibers in
      various clinical presentations of primary headaches compared to allergic rhinosinusitis and
      control populations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been suggested that many people with self-diagnosed or physician diagnosed &quot;sinus&quot;
      headache experience symptoms that fulfill diagnostic criteria for migraine or migrainous
      headache. The shared symptomatology does not differentiate these disorders.&quot;Sinus&quot; symptoms
      as an early manifestation of migraine may be associated with elevated levels of CGRP
      suggesting peripheral trigeminal activation whereas &quot;sinus&quot; symptoms late in migraine may
      have associated elevations of VIP suggesting parasymptathetic activation. Subjects without
      autonomic or &quot;sinus&quot; symptoms will not have changes in salivatory histamine, CGRP or VIP and
      will have values similar to controls. Subjects with rhinosinusitis will have levels or
      patterns of salivatory histamine, CGRP and VIP unique from migraine subjects. If &quot;sinus
      symptoms&quot; are associated with parasympathetic activation, then there should be detectable
      increases in VIP early in the course of nasal symptom development and, conversely, if these
      symptoms associate with trigeminal activation, then increases in CGRP should be detected.
      Five groups of 10 subjects each will be recruited. Group A without migraine, with
      self-described &quot;sinus&quot; headache or symptoms of rhinosinusitis. Group B with chronic
      rhinosinusitis and no history of migraine or &quot;sinus&quot; headache. Group C with &quot;sinus&quot; headache
      with symptoms meeting IHS criteria for migraine and symptoms of rhinosinusitis preceding the
      onset of headache symptoms meeting migraine criteria. Group D with symptoms of rhinosinusitis
      that develop late in the course of migraine after criteria for IHS migraine are met. Group E
      with IHS migraine, without sinus symptoms associated with migraine.
