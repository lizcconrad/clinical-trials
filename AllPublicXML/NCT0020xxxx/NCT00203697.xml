  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary fibrosis is essentially scarring in the lungs. Some types (DIP, NSIP) most often
      respond to therapy. Others like UIP (usual interstitial pneumonitis) rarely respond. UIP
      frequently progresses and has a poor prognosis with a survival of three to five years. In
      UIP, most often the cause cannot be determined and is therefore called Idiopathic Pulmonary
      Fibrosis (IPF). A prevalence rate of 27–29 cases/100,000 has been reported that may even be
      as high as 250 cases/100,000 in individuals 75 years of age.

      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and fatal pulmonary disorder. Conventional
      treatment with immunosuppressive therapy has been disappointing, with a median survival of
      &lt;40% at five years after diagnosis. Moreover, this therapy may lead to premature deaths that
      are a result of immunosuppression and susceptibility to infectious disease. Another problem
      related to IPF, is that we have an incomplete picture of the natural history of the
      pathogenesis of this disorder. Clearly, new strategies for therapy are necessary.

      Published evidence suggests that less than 20% of patients with IPF respond to
      corticosteroids (prednisone). In patients that fail steroids, immunosuppressant drugs such as
      azathioprine or cyclophosphamide are used. An international consensus statement recommends
      both steroids and azathioprine or cyclophosphamide from the onset of treatment. Unfortunately
      a large number of trials have shown little or no effect of these drugs on the progression of
      disease. There are currently no FDA approved drugs for the treatment of IPF.

      Laboratory findings establish that human specimens of Interstitial Lung Diseases including
      IPF demonstrate an impalance in expression of proteins (Th2 Cytokines, CC Chemokines, and CXC
      Chemokines). When these protein levels are in excess or low, they alter the normal lung
      mechanism, causing angiogenesis (abnormal blood vessel formation), inflammation, scar tissue
      formation and impaired immunity of the patient. We hope to establish that the efficacy of
      anti-angiogenetic agent as an add on therapy for IPF patients, will prove to bring
      stabilization or improvement.

      Minocycline has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis (new abnormal blood vessel formation) and
      thus affect the fibrotic process (prevent scar tissue formation). Laboratory and animal
      studies support a potential therapeutic role for Minocycline in IPF.

      Minocycline is a semi synthetic derivative of tetracycline. It was first marketed as an
      antibiotic in 1972. Clinical trials of minocycline have mainly been performed in sexually
      transmissible diseases and in acne. Minocycline is also used to treat several other diseases
      such as nocardiasis, mycobacteriosis, leprosy, lyme disease, pyoderma gangrenosum, autoimmune
      bullous dermatitis, carteaud disease, and prurigo. The usual side effects of minocycline are:
      lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo and pigmentation.

      We will investigate genetic, molecular, cellular, whole animal models, and human specimens
      from patients with fibrotic lung disease to test our prediction: The pathogenesis of
      pulmonary fibrosis (lung scarring) is due to “multiple hits” that causes an inbalance of
      certain mediators (proteins) that are responsible for abnormal blood vessel formation, scar
      tissue formation (with and without inflammation inside the lungs) and impaired immunity of
      the patient. Each of the 3 projects in this proposal have a direct link to other projects and
      clinical core. The SCOR clinical core will identify and enroll patients with Interstitial
      Lung diseases (ILD), including IPF. The clinical core will collect clinical data, as well as
      obtain fluids from lung washings and human lung tissue specimens. Each project will use human
      specimens as indicated in each of their specific aims to correlate their findings with
      response to therapy.

             duration (insidious onset of otherwise unexplained dyspnea on exertion and bibasilar
             inspiratory crackles)

          2. Age 20 through 79, inclusive. Patients ages 20-34 must have diagnosis by either open
             or video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) lung biopsy to be eligible.

             IPF AND within 30 months prior to screening either of the following):

               -  Open or VATS lung biopsy showing definite or probable usual interstitial
                  pneumonia (UIP), required for subjects ages 20-34 due to the rarity of IPF in
                  this age group OR

               -  Non-diagnostic transbronchial biopsy to exclude other conditions (including
