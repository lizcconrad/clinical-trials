  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term out-of-hospital treatment of patients
      with proximal venous thrombosis through the administration of subcutaneous
      low-molecular-weight heparin (tinzaparin sodium) versus low-molecular-weight heparin followed
      by warfarin sodium.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two studies demonstrated that out-of-hospital low-molecular-weight heparin given by twice
      daily subcutaneous injection without laboratory monitoring was as effective and as safe as
      continuous intravenous heparin given in-hospital. Innohep (tinzaparin) has been shown to be
      safe and effective for both the initial and long-term treatment of DVT. The Home LITE study
      compares long-term Innohep treatment to treatment with a combination of initial
      low-molecular-weight heparin followed by standard long-term warfarin therapy.

             contraindicating anticoagulant therapy

          -  Receiving therapeutic heparin for more than 48 hours or have already been on warfarin
             for more than 2 days for the treatment of proximal deep vein thrombosis
