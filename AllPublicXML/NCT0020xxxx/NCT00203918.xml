    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help doctors and patients make better decisions about
      prostate cancer treatment. This research is being done because we do not know how patient
      preferences for health states related to prostate cancer affect the final treatment decision.

      The goal of this project is to incorporate patients' preferences into a previously developed
      prostate cancer treatment decision-model and to understand the implications for doing so for
      cost-effectiveness analysis. To do this, it is first necessary to obtain patient utility
      scores (i.e., patient preference weights). To do this we will perform a survey of patients
      visiting the urology clinic to undergo prostate biopsies to validate a method of utility
      assessment, and understand the patients' individual evaluations of treatment-related health
      studies. We will also ask patients questions relating to their anxiety levels concerning the
      possible diagnosis of prostate cancer.

    <description>Patient utility scores (i.e. patient preference weights) are calculated using survery data will determine which prostate cancer treatment would be most cost-effective for each subject. Patients will be contacted by phone and patient records will be reviewed 90 days after the survey has been completed to determine whether this data reflects actual treatment decisions.</description>
