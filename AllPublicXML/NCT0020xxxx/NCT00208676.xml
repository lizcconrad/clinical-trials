  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are many children that have heart dysfunction because they are either born with
      Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) or developed poor heart function because their hearts are ill.
      The invention of medical technology helps in the treatment of these children. New heart
      echocardiogram (echo) techniques including Tissue Doppler (TDI), Tissue Synchronization
      Imaging (TSI) and 3 dimensional echocardiography (3D) are imaging technologies that we hope
      will help in the diagnosis and treatment of these children.

      Tissue Doppler Imaging is a noninvasive technique that measures the speed of heart muscle
      movement. Tissue Synchronization Imaging measures how well the lower pumping chambers of the
      heart are working together. A 3D echo is a 3 dimensional picture of a beating heart that
      allows your doctor to see the heart from any angle. These techniques are noninvasive, meaning
      on the outside of your body. The size and function of the ventricles (the lower part of the
      heart) can change under different conditions. Using these techniques we will attempt to
      better determine how well the ventricles function during illness and health.

    <textblock>
      All subjects who are treated at Sibley Heart Center at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta with
      the diagnosis of a congenital heart defect or an acquired heart condition (i.e. heart
      failure) may be approached for possible participation into the study. These patients will
      include newly diagnosed patients as well as patients who were diagnosed in previous years and
      have received medical treatment for their defect or condition. The following describe study
      procedures:

      Echocardiographic assessment Standard 2-dimensional, M-mode, and Doppler or 3-dimensional
      echocardiography evaluation will be performed. We will assess cardiac function using left
      ventricular shortening (SF) and ejection fractions (EF). The EF will be calculated using both
      M-Mode and by Simpson's rule. We will also perform tissue synchronization imaging (TSI) and
      tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) using the GE Vivid 7 echocardiographic system. Both TSI and TDI
      will assist investigators in assessing mechanical synchrony. The research echocardiograms
      will occur at the time of routine assessments.

      Clinical assessment/data collection Clinical information from the chart will be collected for
      this study. The information will include the doctor's evaluation of general health, including
      diagnosis and the names of any medications the participant may be taking. If the child has
      undergone a routine MRI for the purpose of clinical care, the MRI measures will be collected
      in order to compare MRI images and measures to the new 3D echo technique. Finally, EKG data
      will be collected at each visit. EKGs are performed routinely for these patients however, if
      one is not performed, the study staff will perform an EKG assessment in order to have
      electromechanical information (i.e. arrhythmias) on all children participating.
