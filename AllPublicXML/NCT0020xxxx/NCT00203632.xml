      The purpose of the study is to determine if the addition of rosiglitazone to subjects with
      fair glucose control on other oral agents improves endothelial function, a surrogate marker
      of vascular health.

      It is hypothesized that improving whole body insulin sensitivity with combination therapy
      including rosiglitazone will restore the vascular actions of insulin and improve
      endothelium-dependent vasomotion more effectively than placebo in patients with diabetes
      mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vascular endothelium has emerged as a critical determinant of cardiovascular health and
      disease, and improving endothelial function is an important target for therapy. Accumulating
      evidence suggest that insulin resistance in patients with diabetes and the metabolic syndrome
      may impair endothelial function, uncovering a proinflammatory, and proatherosclerotic
      vascular phenotype. The GATE study (Glitazones And The Endothelium) is a randomized, double
      blind study to evaluate the effects of rosiglitazone vs. placebo on endothelial function when
      employed as an add-on therapy in diabetic patients currently treated with oral therapy. We
      hypothesize that the PPAR-gamma agonist rosiglitazone, will improve endothelium-dependent
      vasodilatation, and that this effect will be related to improvements in insulin sensitivity,
      with concomitant reductions in whole body insulin resistance. Furthermore, the beneficial
      effects of rosiglitazone will be additive to existing oral therapies that may modulate
      endothelial function, such as metformin. Since endothelial dysfunction plays a pivotal role
      in the development and progression of atherosclerosis, these studies may provide the
      rationale and impetus for aggressive treatment of insulin resistant patients with glitazone
      therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients (both men and women) considered for participation in GATE study have to
             be non-insulin dependent diabetics (according to Canadian Diabetes Association
             criteria, namely a fasting serum glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L on two occasions, a casual
             glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/l with symptoms, or a 2-h post-oral glucose tolerance test glucose
             of ≥ 11.1 mmol/l) with unsatisfactory glycemic control on oral therapy (HbA1c 6-10%).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria includes, congestive heart failure (NYHA class III &amp; IV or ejection
             fraction less than 35%), poorly controlled hypertension (blood pressure &gt; 160/90),
             hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol &gt; 6.2 mmol/l), hypertriglyceridemia
             (triglycerides &gt; 4.0 mmol/l), poor or excellent control of DM (HgA1c &lt;6 % or HbA1c &gt;
             10% respectively), known diabetic retinopathy, age at diagnosis of diabetes less than
             25 years, current participation in another clinical trial and contraindications to
             glitazones therapy, including renal (creatinine &gt; 200 micromol/ L) or hepatic (ALT &gt;
             2.5 times the upper limit of normal) impairment and/ or known intolerance to
             glitazones. Patients must be stable on medications that affect endothelial function
             for more than one month. This includes ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers,
             statins, calcium channel blockers, hormone replacement therapy and anti-oxidant
             vitamins, including folates. Patients on insulin will be excluded. Patients in whom it
             is felt that attainment of better glucose control is required within 3 months will
             also be excluded. Patients with stable coronary disease will be eligible for the study
             as long as they are &gt; one month post myocardial infarction, percutaneous intervention
             or bypass surgery.
