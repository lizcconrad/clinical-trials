  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine and the skin sensitivity that accompanies it can go away in minutes after a nerve
      block, which is a procedure involving an injection of a small amount of a local anesthetic
      next to a nerve to the skin, causing an area of skin to become numb. We have also noticed
      that light sensitivity goes away quickly after a nerve block. We would like to see how
      quickly this happens and how long the benefit of nerve block lasts. We are interested to see
      if these effects are due to the injection itself or due to the lidocaine.

      A subject may be asked to participate in this study if a subjects physician has planned for a
      subject to receive an injection of BOTOXÂ® in the area of the Greater Occipital Nerve (a
      spinal nerve located at the back of the head) as part of a subjects routine preventive
      treatment for migraine today.
