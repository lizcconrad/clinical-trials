  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly all patients with Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) have scoliosis. Posterior
      instrumented spinal fusion, which is a surgery to correct scoliosis, has been shown to
      improve quality of life and satisfaction of both parents and families. The progressive
      muscular weakness leads to the development of scoliosis soon after the child has become
      unable to walk. The muscular weakness and scoliosis also affect the pulmonary function of
      these children. Pulmonary Function Tests (PFT) have been used to determine &quot;pulmonary
      fitness&quot; prior to surgery as a way to determine how well or if the child will tolerate
      surgery. Children with poor results on the PFT are determined to be too fragile to tolerate
      such a large operation. The physicians conducting this study feel that the PFT may be
      inaccurate and that this may not be the best single test to determine &quot;pulmonary fitness&quot;.
      The physicians conducting the study think things like the time of day the study is done, how
      tired you are when you complete the test, and how well you understand the test may affect the
      results of the test.

      All patients with DMD have routine PFT's every six months as standard of care. You will be
      randomized in to one of two groups. The group assignment will be chosen by chance, similar to
      flipping a coin. If you are assigned to group one you will first have your regularly
      scheduled PFT in the morning. You will be asked to complete a second PFT that afternoon as
      least 4 hours after the first PFT. You will then be asked to come back to the clinic in two
      weeks and repeat these PFT's, once in the morning and once in the afternoon at least 4 hours
      apart. Each PFT will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes. If you are assigned to group two,
      you will have your regularly scheduled PFT in the morning and then a second test in the
      afternoon at least four hours after the first test. After the second PFT you will receive
      training from a Respiratory Therapist. You will receive teaching handouts to take home and an
      incentive spirometer and peak flow meter to practice with. You will be asked to practice
      these tests 2 times a day and record your results. You will then be asked to come back to the
      clinic in two weeks to repeat 2 PFT's, once in the morning and again at least 4 hours later.
      All participants will be asked how they feel at the time of testing.
