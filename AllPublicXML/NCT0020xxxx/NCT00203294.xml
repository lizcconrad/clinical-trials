  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects are scheduled to undergo a Greater Occipital Nerve Block (GONB) as treatment for
      your chronic daily headache (CDH). GONB has been used for many years in the treatment of
      headaches. The nerve block is done by injecting a liquid drug through the skin of the back of
      the head to the area of the greater occipital nerve. The nerve runs superficially in this
      area, therefore the drugs are injected just under the skin. The injected drugs block
      electrical transmission through the nerve, resulting in reduced head pain. There are
      treatment options for patients receiving a GONB, however, some clinicians use local
      anesthetics (lidocaine and /or bupivicaine) alone, and some use local anesthetics with local
      steroid injection. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether or not there is an
      observed difference between these two treatment approaches for GONB. We expect to enroll 60
      patients into this research study at Thomas Jefferson University only.
