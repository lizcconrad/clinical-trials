      We know that changing lifestyle can prevent type 2 diabetes. The challenge is how to help
      people changing their lifestyle. We have people in 2 groups: half of them is meeting in grops
      of 10 persons (interventiongroup), the other ones are just visiting their doctor
      (controlgroup).

      The intervention group are meeting different healt proffesionals (nurse, doctor, eksperts on
      nutrition,experts on activity and experts on how to change. They have 7 meetings in groups of
      10 persons over 3 months. The controlgroup are just meeting their own doctor or the doctor in
      the hospital 2 times a year.

      We tell all that small changes are making big differenses (in weight and the chanse of
      getting ill). Everyone is told that lack of aktivity is the main reason to obesity. Lack of
      activity also influense in whar you eat. herefore is activity in the &quot;center&quot;.
