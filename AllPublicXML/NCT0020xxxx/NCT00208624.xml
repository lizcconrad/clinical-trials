  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We would like to conduct a retrospective chart review examining the incidence of surgical
      heart block in children treated in the Cardiac Service Line at Children's Healthcare of
      Atlanta. We would like to look at the last 30 surgical heart block cases seen at Children's
      Healthcare of Atlanta. We will collect the following information on each patient:

      Patient Date of Birth Date of the surgical procedure

      Weight of the patient at the time of surgery Concomitant Diagnoses Need for permanent
      pacemaker Outcome of pacing (i.e. pacing successful)

      We hope to look at each data element in order to determine potential risks factors for
      surgical heart block. By identifying the risk factors, the investigator hopes to establish a
      training program regarding surgical avoidance of certain areas of the heart (if possible) and
      education regarding pacemaker follow-up.

      Each patient will be given a unique study number. The patient's name, social security number,
      medical record number or initials will not be used in our research database.
