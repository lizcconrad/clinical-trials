  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D inadequacy continues to be neglected in nursing home residents. We hypothesized
      that part of this neglect is due to absence of data documenting safe and effective ways to
      replete this inadequacy.

      Vitamin D inadequacy continues to be neglected in nursing home residents. We hypothesized
      that part of this neglect is due to absence of data documenting safe and effective ways to
      replete this inadequacy. Subjects with low vitamin D concentrations are dosed with 50.000 IU
      three times a week for 25 hydroxy vitamin D, parathyroid hormone and bone turnover status. .
