  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fecal incontinence (FI) is a difficulty in storing gas, liquid stool or solid stool (bowel
      movement) in order to expel it at a proper time and place. Patients who suffer from FI may
      experience passive FI (difficulty in sensing stool in the rectum) or urgency (able to sense a
      bowel movement but cannot hold the stool until an acceptable time and place). FI is not a
      life-threatening disease, but it is often profoundly distressing and socially incapacitating.

      If a patient is suffering with symptoms of chronic FI despite trying oral medications,
      biofeedback and/or other more conservative treatments, a patient may be eligible to
      participate in a clinical research study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of sacral
      nerve stimulation for the treatment of chronic fecal incontinence. One hundred-twenty (120)
      patients will be implanted with medical devices and followed closely for twelve months, and
      then once a year after that until the study closes. There are up to 20 centers in the United
      States.

    <description>The primary efficacy objective was to demonstrate that at least 50% of subjects will achieve at least 50% reduction in the number of fecal incontinent episodes per week at 12 months post-implant compared to baseline. Subjects who achieve at least 50% reduction in the number of fecal incontinent episodes per week at 12 months post-implant compared to baseline are considered &quot;successes.&quot;
The observed therapeutic success rate is calculated as the proportion of implanted subjects who achieve at least 50% reduction in the number of incontinent episodes per week from baseline to twelve months.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>All patients who signed an informed consent were considered enrolled in the study. Of the 285 subjects who enrolled in the study, 132 subjects underwent acute test stimulation with 129 proceeding to the sub-chronic test stimulation phase. Of these, 120 subjects qualified for permanent implant. All 120 patients were successfully implanted.</pre_assignment_details>
