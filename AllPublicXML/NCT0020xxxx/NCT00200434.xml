    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to contrast the efficacy and safety of 3 dose levels of
      nebivolol vs. placebo, when added to a patient's existing antihypertensive medication(s) for
      3 months, in patients with mild to moderate hypertension

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following a washout of any previous beta-blocker medication, if applicable, supine, sitting,
      and standing cuff blood pressure and pulse rate, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
      (ABPM), ECG, laboratory assessments and genomics testing were performed before randomization.
      Patients were randomized to receive placebo or nebivolol once daily in the morning together
      with their curently prescribed antihypertensive therapy. Patients had four scheduled clinical
      visits during the study, following the screening visit.
