  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we plan to examine the difference in effect on blood glucose control in
      patients who will be on either conventional insulin therapy (i.e. using NPH and Humalog twice
      daily, injected separately) or on intensive insulin management (IIM-several shots of short
      acting and Glargine insulin). Those on IIM will be mixing the insulin Glargine with the
      short-acting insulin analog prior to injecting. The Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) results will be
      used to monitor blood glucose control over a 6 month period. Twice during the course of the
      study, a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS-a device the size of a pager that records
      blood sugar readings every 5 minutes) will be used to record all the changes in the blood
      glucose levels occurring over a 72-hour period.

      The landmark report of the diabetes control and complications trial (DCCT) trial has shown
      that intensive management delays and/or prevents complications in small vessels associated
      with Type 1 diabetes (T1DM). To achieve the goals of the DCCT, a number of new insulin
      analogs( man-made insulins ) are now being incorporated into the management of patients with
      T1DM.

      These insulin analogs are gaining importance with their ability to overcome the major
      obstacle to intensive insulin therapy, namely low blood glucose. In particular, insulin
      Glargine, considered a basal insulin, is being extensively used for management as an
      alternative to continuous insulin therapy injected into the tissue just below the skin. The
      major drawback to using insulin Glargine is that it has to be given as a separate injection
      and cannot be mixed with other insulins. This results in the undesirable administration of
      multiple insulin injections to a child with diabetes making the therapeutic plan more complex
      and adhering to the treatment plan more difficult.

      In a previous study, (now accepted for publication in a leading diabetes journal, Diabetes
      Care), we have demonstrated, using continuous glucose monitoring system, that there is no
      significant difference in glucose concentrations (ie. high and low blood glucose episodes)
      when insulin Glargine is administered either mixed with a short-acting insulin analog or when
      giving it as a separate injection.
