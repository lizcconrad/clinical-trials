  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease. Previous research shows a correlation between a
      specific oncogene change (ras-mutation) and enhanced sensitivity to two chemotherapy drugs
      combined: gemcitabine and etoposide. This Phase II trial will evaluate this drug combination
      for locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II single-armed study evaluating potential benefits of the gemcitabine and
      etoposide combination in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      pancreatic cancer. The study will involve approximately 30-40 adult patients with pancreatic
      cancer. Response rate, duration of response, overall survival, quality of life and toxicity
      associated with the combination therapy will be evaluated.

      Primary Objective To evaluate the response rate of patients with histologically or
      cytologically confirmed pancreatic cancer, previously untreated with chemotherapy with the
      exception of 5FU given as part of an adjuvant regimen, who receive the gemcitabine-etoposide
      combination therapy.

      Secondary Objectives 1. To evaluate the duration of response in the defined study population.
      2. To evaluate the overall survival. 3. To evaluate the quality of life associated with this
      treatment combination.4.To describe the toxicity profile. 5.To collect clinical specimens
      from the defined study population for the evaluation of potential molecular correlates of
      diagnosis, disease progression, treatment outcomes, survival, and/or treatment-associated
      toxicity by proteomics and microarray technologies.
