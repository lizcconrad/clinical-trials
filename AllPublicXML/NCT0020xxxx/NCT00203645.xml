  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine whether problem gamblers who receive therapy calls in
      addition to a self-help manual will be more likely to quit or cut back on their gambling when
      compared with problem gamblers who receive just the manual.

      With gambling becoming more accessible, the occurrence of problems related to gambling are on
      the rise. The costs of problem gambling are enormous.There are social and economic costs, the
      gambler can sometimes lose a significant relationship, job, or commit an illegal activity.
      Pathological gamblers are also at risk for developing a general medical condition related to
      stress. There is a high risk of suicide and problem gamblers also have increased rates of
      mental health disorders. Relatively few people choose to attend formal treatment programs so
      it's important to provide a range of options to make treatment more accessible. The present
      study examines the effectiveness of minimal and brief interventions delivered by the
      telephone.

      Comparison(s): The &quot;Workbook Only Control&quot; condition involves receiving the self-help booklet
      through the mail after a brief telephone assessment. The &quot;Minimal Treatment&quot; condition
      involves receiving the same workbook but also having a motivational enhancement intervention
      by telephone. The &quot;Brief Treatment&quot; condition provides the workbook, motivational
      enhancement, and follow-up support on six occasions spread over 36 weeks. The &quot;Wait List
      Control&quot; condition involves participants being assigned to a six week waiting list.
      Participants are assessed and after a six week waiting period they will have a reassessment
      at which time they will be sent the gambling self-help workbook.
