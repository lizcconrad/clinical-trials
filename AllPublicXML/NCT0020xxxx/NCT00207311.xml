  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in subjects with
      histological evidence of &gt; 33% hepatic steatosis or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and
      chronic hepatitis C. Patients who have not been previously treated for hepatitis C (treatment
      naive) will be enrolled.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence suggests that patients with concomitant chronic HCV infection and NASH or
      significant hepatic steatosis (&gt;33%) respond less well to standard antiviral therapy. As
      previously noted, up to 10% of patients with chronic HCV infection will have concomitant NASH
      and an even greater percentage will have associated hepatic steatosis. No prospective studies
      to date have evaluated the sustained viral response rates to standard antiviral therapy in
      this group of patients who were previously treated with a medication to eliminate or improve
      the underlying NASH and/or hepatic steatosis.

      Primary Outcome: To determine if decreasing the amount of NASH or hepatic steatosis in
      overweight (BMI &gt;27 kg/m2) HCV patients results in improved overall SVR to PEGASYS and
      Copegus.

      Secondary Outcome: 1.To determine the amount of steatosis, necroinflammatory activity, and
      fibrosis change in a group of participants with chronic hepatitis C and NASH or significant
      steatosis treated with Xenical vs. placebo for 36 weeks. 2. To assess for a difference in
      insulin resistance, as measured by the QUICKI score, before and after treatment with Xenical
      or Xenical placebo and diet and exercise.
