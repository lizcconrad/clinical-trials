  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine on its own
      and compare this with efficacy of a new combination antimalarial therapy, either
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine plus artesunate or artemether-lumefantrine.

    <textblock>
      The resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to anti-malarial drugs is a serious impediment to the
      control of malaria. In the South East African Combination Anti-malarial Therapy (SEACAT)
      evaluation, there will be a comprehensive evaluation of phased introduction of combination
      anti-malarials (CAT) in Mozambique, Swaziland and South Africa. In order to facilitate
      formulation of an effective regional drug policy and provide a database for decision-making
      on the implementation of combination therapy, it is essential that the in vivo response to
      CAT in all three countries be investigated. An SP therapeutic efficacy study will be
      conducted according to this modified WHO protocol to guide the selection of CAT. After CAT is
      introduced an in vivo CAT efficacy study will then be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of
      artesunate plus SP (or artemether-lumefantrine in KwaZulu Natal and Limpopo). In areas of low
      intensity malaria transmission the CAT in vivo study results will be compared across sites
      and with those found at baseline with monotherapy, for each site.
