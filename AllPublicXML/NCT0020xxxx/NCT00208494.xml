    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of artificial hips with metal heads
      and metal sockets to artificial hips with ceramic heads articulating with metal socket
      components. The success of the total hip arthroplasty (THA) will be based upon all of the
      following clinical and radiographic criteria being met at the two-year evaluation: (1) the
      patient's clinical results as measured using modified Harris Hip evaluation rating system,
      and the absence of a complication that requires the surgical removal or replacement of a
      component; and (2) radiographic findings at study endpoint (i.e., two years follow-up).
      Clinical and radiographic success at two (2) years postoperative is required for the study
      hip to be deemed successful.

      This study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, single blind, controlled clinical
      investigation comparing the safety and efficacy of the cementless Ceramic on Metal total hip
      prostheses versus the cementless Metal on Metal total hip prostheses.

    <description>The composite success/failure of the implant was made up of radiographic, clinical and revision data. Radiographic success was determined by femoral subsidence =/&lt; 2mm, acetabular migration =/&lt; 2mm, cup inclination =/&lt; 4°, no acetabular or femoral osteolysis, and acetabular and femoral lucencies less than 50% of visible porous coating. Clinical success was determined by a Harris Hip score equal to or greater than 80. A hip (patient) was considered to be a composite success at study endpoint if it was a radiographic and clinical success and no revision of any component had taken place.</description>

        <title>Composite Success/Failure</title>
        <description>The composite success/failure of the implant was made up of radiographic, clinical and revision data. Radiographic success was determined by femoral subsidence =/&lt; 2mm, acetabular migration =/&lt; 2mm, cup inclination =/&lt; 4°, no acetabular or femoral osteolysis, and acetabular and femoral lucencies less than 50% of visible porous coating. Clinical success was determined by a Harris Hip score equal to or greater than 80. A hip (patient) was considered to be a composite success at study endpoint if it was a radiographic and clinical success and no revision of any component had taken place.</description>
