  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to demonstrate that AQUAVAN® is effective in providing adequate
      sedation in patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy as well as to assess the safety profile
      of AQUAVAN versus that of midazolam. Prior to the procedure, patients receive fentanyl
      citrate for pain management followed five minutes later by either AQUAVAN® Injection or
      midazolam HCl for sedation. During the procedure, study personnel assess the patient's vital
      signs and depth of sedation. After the procedure, the patient, physician, and an evaluator
      are asked to complete satisfaction surveys.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of AQUAVAN®
      Injection versus midazolam HCl following pretreatment with an analgesic, fentanyl citrate
      injection, in producing sedation in patients undergoing a flexible bronchoscopy procedure.
      Randomization will be stratified by site. Following completion of pre-procedure sedation
      assessments, patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 i.v. treatment groups at a 3:1
      (AQUAVAN® Injection: midazolam HCl) allocation ratio.

      All study patients, irrespective of treatment group assignment, will receive fentanyl citrate
      injection as an analgesic pretreatment. Supplemental doses of fentanyl citrate injection may
      be administered if the patient reports pain or if inadequate analgesia is present as
      demonstrated by increased heart rate and/or blood pressure in the presence of adequate
      sedation. At no time should fentanyl citrate injection be administered to increase sedation
      levels. AQUAVAN® Injection and midazolam HCl will be administered to induce a state of
      adequate sedation, defined as a Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness / Sedation
      (OAA/S) score of 4 or less. Supplemental doses will be administered to increase depth or
      duration of sedation. Supplemental doses will not be administered if the Modified OAA/S score
      is 2 or less or if there is no purposeful response to stimulation. The depth of sedation will
      be measured by the Modified OAA/S scale, a validated measure. Patient and Investigator
      assessments will be used to confirm that the depth of sedation provided met the goals of
      sedation, reduction of anxiety and reduced awareness.
