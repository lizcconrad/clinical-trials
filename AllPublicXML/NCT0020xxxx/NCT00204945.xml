      1. Research question: What is the response of the heart's pumping function to changes in
           heart chamber pressures?

        2. Experimental design: Patients undergoing routine cardiac catheterization will be
           studied. A thermodilution pulmonary artery catheter will be inserted through a venous
           sheath and threaded into the pulmonary artery. After several minutes of quiet rest,
           baseline hemodynamics will be obtained, including a determination of cardiac output
           using thermodilution techniques and 30 seconds of pressure recordings from the left
           ventricle and proximal aorta. In addition, a brief echocardiogram will be performed, to
           determine ejection fraction and indices of diastolic filling. Finally, arterial
           tonometry will be obtained in quick succession from the brachial, radial, femoral, and
           carotid arteries. Following the collection of baseline data, a bolus and infusion of
           nesiritide will be started. After 10 minutes of nesiritide infusion, with the drug still
           infusing, a full set of invasive hemodynamics will again be obtained, as well as brief
           echocardiographic and arterial tonometry examinations.
