  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study proposed that both clinical and subclinical HSV reactivation is associated with
      increased HIV shedding from mucosal surfaces, which may increase the infectiousness of
      HIV-1/HSV-2 coinfected persons. To test this hypothesis, we will control HSV reactivation
      with acyclovir, a safe medication that is proven to reduce HSV shedding, and measure HIV
      levels in blood, genital, and pharyngeal secretions. The study hypothesizes that acyclovir
      will reduce HIV shedding from mucosal surfaces of HIV-1/HSV-2 coinfected individuals.

      The main objective is to assess the reduction in genital HIV-1 shedding associated with daily
      acyclovir for suppression of HSV-2 reactivation.

      All patients will be treated with the usual antibiotic treatment for any sexually transmitted
      infections that are diagnosed during the study. In addition, half will receive acyclovir for
      8 weeks , whilst the other half will receive a placebo for 8 weeks. The study medication will
      reverse in the second 8 weeks of the study. The patients will attend the clinic 3 times per
      week during the first and the last 8 weeks of the study and once every week during the
      washout period in the middle of the study - for a total of 18 weeks per participant. At each
      visit genital and oral samples will be collected. A blood sample will also be collected. For
      women participants, pregnancy test will be performed. The clinic will provide both pre- and
      post-HIV test counseling.
