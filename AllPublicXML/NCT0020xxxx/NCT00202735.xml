  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dislocation of the glenohumeral joint is the most common traumatic joint dislocation. The
      usual treatment of first time traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder is reduction
      followed by immobilization in a sling for a period of one to three weeks. The incidence of
      recurrence is high and age at the time of primary dislocation is the chief prognostic factor
      in determining the risk of recurrence. There is no agreement according to the effect of
      immobilization,neither to the length of immobilization time. The Bankart lesion with avulsion
      of the inferior-anterior capsulolabral complex is almost invariably present in patients with
      anterior shoulder dislocation. Recent and ongoing studies by Eijii Itoi et al,Akita
      university Japan, gives evidence of the immobilization with the arm held in external rotation
      may reduce the risk of subsequent instability by approximating the Bankart lesion to the neck
      of the glenoid giving a more anatomical healing. We have started a prospective randomized
      study. The patients are assigned to two groups with informed consent. One group are
      immobilized in internal rotation for 3 weeks and the second group are immobilized in external
      rotation for 3 weeks. We will compare the rate of relaxation between the groups. Because age
      is the main prognostic factor we use stratified randomization with two age groups: One group
      of patients aged between 16 and 24 years and one group aged between 25 and 40 years.The time
      of observation after initial treatment will be 2 years with follow up after 4 and 10 years.
      Eleven hospitals and two primary trauma care centers in Norway participate in the study. A
      subgroup of 50 patients are also planned to be examined with CT and MRI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The patient has a first time traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder. The
        dislocation is verified by x-ray examination. The patient is aged between 16 and 40 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        An osseous defect of the anterior glenoid rim in which the length is at least 20% and the
        width at least 1/3 of the the length of the anterior bony glenoid rim.

        A fracture of tuberculum majus which do not fall into place after manually reduction of the
        dislocated shoulder.(That means more than 1 cm diastase)

        Damage of the axillary nerve or plexus

        The patient is not able to or willing to participate in the study. -
