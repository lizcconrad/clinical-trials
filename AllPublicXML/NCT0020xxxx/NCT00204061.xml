      The study will provide an empirical basis for a pharmacological treatment option. An
      open-label, randomized, multi-centre parallel group design is used. An intensified clinical
      management (CM), which allows needs-based psychological crisis intervention, is compared to a
      combination of such a CM and the atypical neuroleptic amisulpride. The central hypothesis is
      that the combination of a clinical management with an atypical neuroleptic is the superior
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first diagnosis of schizophrenia is preceded by a long lasting period comprising an
      untreated psychotic and a prodromal state. The duration of untreated psychosis correlates
      with a significant worsening of several outcome variables and persons fulfilling criteria of
      a prodromal state are already suffering from prodromal symptoms and from a significant
      deterioration of social and vocational functioning. However, a sufficient strategy for early
      intervention is still lacking. The study will provide an empirical basis for a
      pharmacological treatment option. An open-label, randomized, multi-centre parallel group
      design is used. An intensified clinical management (CM), which allows needs-based
      psychological crisis intervention, is compared to a combination of such a CM and the atypical
      neuroleptic amisulpride. For analysis 130 patients will be recruited within three years, the
      treatment period is two years.

    <description>Daily doses could range from 50 to 800 mg, with increments of 50 mg at first step and 100 mg at further steps. As a guideline, it was suggested that the dosage be increased as long as attenuated or brief limited intermittent positive symptoms were present. The interval between such steps should be at least 14 days if brief limited symptoms were absent and the APS score had improved.</description>
