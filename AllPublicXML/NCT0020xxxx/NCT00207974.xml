      Hyperuricemia is often associated with metabolic syndrome, which is a known precursor of
      atherosclerosis. The Yaizu Suisankagaku Industry Company have developed industrial
      production, named Marine Active. Human clinical trials showed reduction of creatine
      phosphokinase activity and sero-uric acid. Randomize, double blind clinical trial is entrust
      to our hospital. This study design is blood sampling from the health men who take 1 gm of
      marine active to analyse the pharmacokinetics of anserine.

    <textblock>
      Hyperuricemia is a common metabolic disorder. It can result from a decreased renal uric acid
      excretion, increased urate production, or both. The classical association with clinical gout
      is well-known. The principal indications for uric acidâ€“lowering therapy, including
      allopurinol, probenecid and sulfinpyrazone, are the patients with gout history, macroscopic
      subcutaneous tophi, frequent attacks of gouty arthritis, or a documented state of uric acid
      overproduction. Hyperuricemia is often associated with metabolic syndrome,which is known a
      percursor of atherosclerosis. For the gout attack only 5% per year of the hyperuricemic
      population, medical management is not indicated for patients without gouty arthritis. Diet
      control is the leading way to control serum uric acid level, but usually it is not enough. So
      how to management hyperuricemia is important and is a potential
      management.Histidine-containing dipeptides such as Anserine and Carnosine have been studied
      extensively in recent years. These dipeptides were shown to be effective in acting as
      buffering agents against protons developed during anaerobic exercise. Anserine and Carnosine
      also have strong anti-oxidant activity, anti-cancer activity, immuno-response modulation, fat
      reduction and enhanced wound healing functions. The Yaizu Suisankagaku Industry Company have
      developed industrial production process to extract and purify the dipeptides from Bonito and
      Tuna. The extract, named Marine Active, was able to offer anti-fatigue activity by animal
      trial data. Human clinical trials showed reduction of creatine phosphokinase activity and
      sero-uric acid. Randomize, double blind clinical trial is entrust to our hospital. This study
      design is blood sampling from the health men who take 1 gm of marine active to analyse the
      pharmacokinetics of anserine.
