      This study was a multi-center, multi-national, randomized, double-blind, parallel group,
      placebo-controlled study of nebivolol over a range of doses in patients with mild to moderate
      hypertension. The study consisted of 2 phases: screening/washout/single-blind placebo run-in
      and 2) randomization/double-blind treatment. Patients had 7 scheduled clinic visits during
