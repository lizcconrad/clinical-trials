  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-centre, randomised Phase III study, looking at a series of 480
      patients up to the age of 65 with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) not previously
      treated. They will receive VAD or Velcade®/dexamethasone combination as induction treatment
      plus/minus (±) dexamethasone/cyclophosphamide/etoposide/cisplatin (DCEP) followed by
      autograft as first-line therapy, as the investigators try to compare the complete remission
      (CR) rate (with negative or positive immunofixation) at the end of their induction treatment.

      After their written informed consent has been obtained and their eligibility verified,
      patients are randomised between 4 treatment arms: A1 VAD (4 cycles); A2 VAD (4 cycles)
      followed by DCEP (2 cycles); B1 Velcade® + dexamethasone (4 cycles); B2 Velcade® +
      dexamethasone (4 cycles) followed by DCEP (2 cycles) A1, A2, B1, B2 + autograft.
      Randomisation will be stratified on the basis of the initial b2 microglobulin level (&gt; or &lt; 3
      mg/l) and the presence of chromosome 13 abnormalities identified by FISH analysis. VAD:
      Vincristine/Adriamycin/Dexamethasone; DCEP: Dexamethasone/Cyclophosphamide/
      Etoposide/Cisplatin.
