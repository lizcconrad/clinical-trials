  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of 4 designs of the DePuy Ultima LX
      hip stem in the treatment of patients with hip joint disease requiring a total hip
      replacement. Patients who enter the study will be randomly allocated to one of the 4 designs
      of the DePuy Ultima LX hip stem and will be evaluated at regular intervals following hip
      surgery using patient, clinical and x-ray assessments.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stem movement measured radiographically at 2 years</measure>
    <time_frame>2yrs post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Stem movement was measured radiographically by comparing baseline stem position with the stem position 2 years after surgery. If migration was observed to be 5 or more mm, it was considered clinically significant migration.</description>

    <time_frame>5yrs post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The following outcome measures were used; VAS Pain score, SF36 Patient reported outcome, Satisfaction, Limb Length physical examination, and stem movement measured radiographically.</description>
