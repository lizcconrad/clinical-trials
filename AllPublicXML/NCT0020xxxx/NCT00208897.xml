  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this project is to determine whether treatment with the SSRI,
      fluoxetine versus placebo reverses alterations in the central CRF system induced by early
      life stress experiences (i.e. childhood sexual and/or physical abuse) in cases with and
      without major depression. We also evaluate whether neuroendocrine changes after SSRI
      treatment correlate with clinical improvement.

      We compare indices of central CRF activity (i.e. ACTH and cortisol response to CRF
      stimulation test) before and after 8 weeks of treatment with either fluoxetine or placebo
      between women with a history of childhood abuse (early life stress, ELS) and current major
      depression (ELS/MDD), women with a history of childhood abuse without major depression
      (ELS/non-MDD), and women without a history of childhood abuse and major depression
      (non-ELS/MDD). Changes in neuroendocrine responses to CRF are correlated with psychological
      outcome measures. We hypothesize that treatment with fluoxetine will normalize altered
      neuroendocrine responsiveness in cases with ELS and that this normalization will be
      correlated with improvement of symptoms of depression and anxiety.
