      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of zonisamide (Zonegran; 100mg
      - 400mg/day) and placebo as an adjunctive agent on lowering weight in subjects who have a
      body mass index (BMI) of &gt;25 and are on a psychotropic medication with a known side effect of
      weight gain.

      After the screening period, patients fulfilling entrance criteria will be randomized to 100mg
      of zonisamide or placebo in a 2:1 ratio respectively. Patients will be assessed at baseline
      and on Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16-post randomization for weight, side effects, and symptoms.
      Symptoms will be assessed by the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Brief Psychiatric Rating
      Scale (BPRS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety
      (HARS), and Self-report measures of general health and mental status at baseline, weeks 2, 4,
      8, 12,and 16. At the conclusion of the study, patients will be tapered from the study
      medication and will return to their primary provider for continued treatment of their
      psychiatric condition.
