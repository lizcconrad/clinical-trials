  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Olanzapine (o-lan-zah-peen) is a medication that has been approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia and/ or bipolar
      disorder. The trade name for this drug is ZyprexaÂ®. Olanzapine has not been approved by the
      FDA for the prevention of migraine and is experimental for the purposes of this research
      study.

      The Jefferson Headache Center at Thomas Jefferson University has developed this clinical
      study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Olanzapine in preventing migraine
      headaches.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are male or female between the ages of 18 and 65, inclusive

          -  Subjects who have a history of migraine with or without aura as defined by IHS
             criteria, for at least one year prior to screening

          -  Subjects who experience between 3 and 10 migraine attacks per month, for the three
             months preceding screening

          -  Subjects who have no more than 15 headache days per month

          -  Subjects who have been on a stable dose (no clinically significant changes) of all
             daily medications, for any indication, from 28 days prior to screening through the
             duration of the trial.

          -  Women who are using, or agree to use for the duration of the study, a medically
             acceptable form of contraception (as determined by the investigator), if female of
             childbearing potential.

          -  Subjects who are able to understand and comply with all study requirements

          -  Subjects who provide written informed consent prior to any study procedures being
             performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Subjects with an abnormal ECG that, in the investigators opinion, would expose them to
             increased risk of adverse events or interfere with study drug and/or analysis of
             efficacy/tolerability (subjects with QTC interval greater than 450ms will be excluded)

          -  Subjects currently taking, or have taken within the thirty days prior to screening,
             any neuroleptics &gt; 1 day per week (such as Geodon, Zyprexa, Compazine, Phenergan,
             Seroquel and other drugs in the same class)

          -  Subjects currently taking or have taken within 4-weeks prior to screening any
             medication for the prevention of migraine

          -  Subjects who have failed more than two adequate trials of migraine prophylaxis, as
             determined by investigator

          -  Subjects who experience significant orthostatic hypotension, as determined by the
             investigator

          -  Subjects who, in the investigators opinion, have a history or have evidence of a
             medical condition that would expose them to an increased risk of a significant adverse
             event or would interfere with the assessments of efficacy and tolerability during this
             trial

          -  Subjects who, in the investigators opinion, have a history or have evidence of a
             psychiatric condition that would expose them to an increased risk of a significant
             adverse event or would interfere with the assessments of efficacy and tolerability
             during this trial.

          -  Subjects who have participated in an investigational drug trial in the 30 days prior
             to the screening visit
