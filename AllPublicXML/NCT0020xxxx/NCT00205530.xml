  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To learn more about how a family treatment program helps people after brain injury.
      Specifically, do families feel better and function better after going through the program,
      and do patients feel better and function better after going through the program.

      To evaluate the efficacy of a structured outpatient family intervention program (BIFI) on
      family members' emotional well being, life satisfaction, needs, and family functioning; and
      to evaluate the impact of the BIFI on the emotional well being, life satisfaction, functional
      independence, vocational status, and neurobehavioral functioning of persons with acquired
      brain injury (ABI).

    <description>The Family Needs Questionnaire (FNQ) is a widely used 40-item self-report questionnaire developed to measure family members' perceived needs after a family member sustains a brain injury. The items were designed to address diverse psychosocial and educational needs apparent in the acute and post-acute phases after injury. Family members rate the degree to which they perceive that each need has been met (not met, partly met, or met). A factor analytic investigation revealed six independent factors comprising six scales: Health Information, Emotional Support, Instrumental Support, Professional Support, Community Support Network, and Involvement with Care. The proportion of needs described as met (converted to a 10 point scale) was the primary family outcome measure.</description>

    <description>The Brain Injury Family Intervention (BIFI) was developed over the last decade based upon considerable clinical experience and research review. The BIFI is a structured approach to helping families address their most common and salient issues, concerns, and challenges. The BIFI is implemented in five 90-minute sessions.</description>

        Family members/caregiver friends and persons with ABI who are at least three months
        postinjury will be eligible to participate in the present investigation. ABI is defined as
        damage to brain tissue caused by stroke, aneurysm, anoxia, non-progressive brain tumor,
        infection, or an external mechanical force as evidenced by: loss of consciousness, post
        traumatic amnesia (PTA), objective neurological findings, or skull fracture. Penetrating
        wounds fitting the definition listed above will be included. Lacerations and/or bruises of
        the scalp or forehead without other criteria listed above will be excluded. All
        participants must be at least 18 years of age or older and able to understand and provide
        consent.
