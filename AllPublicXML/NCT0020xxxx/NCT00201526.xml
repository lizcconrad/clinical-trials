  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To describe the broad spectrum of Bipolar Disorder patients admitted to out-patient and
      in-patient psychiatric departments in Norway. Include all admitted Bipolar patients both with
      and without co-morbid disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Norway is both social, genetically and culturally a homogeneous society. The health service
      is public and has a nearly total responsibility for psychiatric care in given catchment
      areas. This provides excellent opportunities to describe the frequencies and patterns of the
      broad spectrum of bipolar illness, including co-morbid substance use disorders, to follow the
      patients for several years and to do molecular genetic mapping.

      Methods: Participating centers consist of outpatient clinics and hospital departments from
      different parts of Norway and one third-line clinic with referrals from all over Norway.
      Specifically trained clinicians in each center include bipolar patients systematically and
      perform the patient evaluation as part of their clinical duties. In addition, CT or MRI scans
      and EEG are performed and blood samples are collected for clinical chemistry screening and
      for DNA sampling.
