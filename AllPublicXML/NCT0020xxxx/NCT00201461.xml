    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether the STARFlex速 septal closure
      system will safely and effectively prevent a recurrent embolic stroke/transient ischemic
      attack (TIA) and mortality in patients with a PFO and to demonstrate superiority of the
      STARFlex速 device compared to best medical therapy.
