      BACKGROUND:

      Proposed is a non-randomized, controlled, prospective trial to test the efficacy of a
      bilingual intervention to improve asthma care for low-income inner-city children enrolled in
      subsidized preschool childcare programs. Because of high rates of asthma prevalence,
      subsidized preschool childcare programs offer ideal settings to test innovative strategies to
      improve asthma care within communities at highest risk of morbidity.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study will comprise three arms. Arm 1 is surveillance, in which children with asthma are
      identified. In Arm 2, children with asthma are identified and given written Asthma Action
      Plans (monitoring). Arm 3 consists of surveillance, monitoring, and education.

        We formed collaborative agreements with subsidized day care providers in three New York
        City communities with high asthma prevalence. These three communities - Harlem, the South
        Bronx and the Lower East Side - are economically disadvantaged communities of color.
        Participants were parents or guardians of children with asthma enrolled in subsidized day
        care center. 95% of participants were female, 64% were Hispanic, 25% were Black, 1% were
        White and 10% were Other. 70% were born in the continental USA, 70% spoke English as their
        primary language. 30% had earned less than a HS degree, 32% had received a HS diploma or a
        GED, 37% had attended som college, and 1% had completed college. 33% of participants had
        family incomes of less than $1,000 per month, 35% had incomes of $1,000 to $1,999 and 32%
        had incomes over $2,000.
