  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5-10% of women in the United States. Its onset is
      usually at the time of puberty with manifestations of menstrual irregularity, hirsutism, and
      obesity. Women with PCOS suffer at an early stage of adulthood from all of the components of
      the metabolic syndrome, a syndrome that typically has its peak in mid-life in other subject
      populations. Women with PCOS are more insulin resistant than weight-matched control women and
      have exceptionally high rates of early-onset impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes,
      as well as a substantially elevated risk for hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary, and other
      vascular diseases. While recent evidence indicates that the prevalence of sleep-disordered
      breathing (SDB) is 30-40 fold higher in PCOS than in weight-matched control women, the
      possible role of SDB in causing the increased metabolic and cardiovascular risks of PCOS has
      not been evaluated. The overall objective of the proposed study is to analyze the direction
      of causality between sleep disturbances and markers of the metabolic syndrome in PCOS.

    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5-10% of women and may be viewed as the combination
      of hyperandrogenism with the classical features of the metabolic syndrome in young women.
      PCOS presents a unique opportunity to dissect the relationship between metabolic and
      cardiovascular risk and sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in a population where intrinsic
      effects of aging have not yet developed. Because a relationship between obstructive sleep
      apnea, insulin resistance and elevated testosterone levels has also been observed in men and
      in women without PCOS, insights gained from studies in PCOS will have broad implications.

      The Specific Aims of the present application are:

      Specific Aim 1: to test the hypothesis that sleep disturbances are caused by
      hyperandrogenemia and hyperinsulinemia that characterize PCOS. Following a detailed baseline
      evaluation of sleep, hormonal, metabolic and cardiovascular parameters, women with PCOS will
      be randomized to an 8-week treatment phase with pioglitazone or depot leuprolide plus
      estrogen/progestin replacement or placebo. Pioglitazone will reduce insulin levels, and
      consequently androgen levels, in PCOS. We will compare the effects of androgen reduction
      alone (depot leuprolide plus estrogen/progestin) to those of insulin plus androgen reduction
      achieved with pioglitazone. Primary comparisons will be the change in sleep parameters from
      baseline between: placebo &amp; pioglitazone; placebo &amp; leuprolide/estrogen/progestin;
      pioglitazone &amp; leuprolide/estrogen/progestin.

      Specific Aim 2: to test the hypothesis that sleep disturbances cause the hormonal, metabolic
      and cardiovascular alterations seen in women with PCOS. PCOS women with SDB and matched
      control women with SDB will be evaluated at baseline and following 8 weeks of CPAP treatment.
      The primary comparison will be between baseline and post-treatment parameters in PCOS women.
      The secondary comparison will be the post-treatment change from baseline between PCOS and
      control women to test the hypothesis that for the same degree in improvement in SDB, the
      magnitude of change in metabolic and cardiovascular measures will be greater in PCOS than in
      controls.

      Specific Aim 3: to test the hypothesis that in normal young women, experimental manipulation
      of sleep that recapitulates the sleep disturbances characteristic of women with PCOS will
      result in metabolic, hormonal, and cardiovascular alterations that are typical of the
      metabolic syndrome. A group of healthy young women will be studied twice using a randomized
      cross-over design. In one study, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep will be fragmented by
      experimentally induced microarousals for 3 consecutive nights and non-REM sleep will be left
      undisturbed. In the other, slow wave activity will be suppressed without awakening the
      subject and REM sleep will be left undisturbed. Each study will be preceded by 2 nights of
      baseline sleep. Results were not reported for Aim 3 since no devices or drugs were tested in
      this aim.

As a consequence, the sample size of control subjects was insufficient to allow for any meaningful conclusions to be drawn.

    <description>Depot leuprolide is a long-acting, modified version of the natural brain hormone, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). This study drug will temporarily reduce the pituitary hormones that stimulate the ovaries to make both female (estrogen) and male (testosterone) hormones. The effect of this study drug will last approximately 12 weeks. During this time, your female hormone levels will be brought to normal by the use of a patch that contains estrogen and progesterone. This patch is placed on the skin and is changed twice a week. The subject will continue to wear this patch for 4 weeks after the end of the study, until the effects of the Lupron injection wear off.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  PCOS subjects will be recruited from the Endocrinology Clinics of the University of
             Chicago. All will be at least 2 years post-menarche and less than 40 years of age. A
             diagnosis of PCOS will require:

               -  the presence of oligo/amenorrhea;

               -  hyperandrogenemia, defined by a supranormal plasma free testosterone level (&gt; 10
                  pg/ml);

               -  hyperandrogenism, as evidenced by infertility, hirsutism, acne, or androgenetic
                  alopecia; and

               -  exclusion of nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency congenital adrenal hyperplasia,
                  Cushing's syndrome, hypothyroidism, or significant elevations in serum prolactin.
                  Thus, all subjects will meet the National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus
                  criteria for PCOS.

          -  Control subjects will be matched, as closely as possible, for age, ethnicity, body
             mass index (BMI), and body fat distribution [as assessed by single cut abdominal
             computed tomography (CT) scan and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan].

          -  Normal lean (BMI &lt;25 kg/m2) women will be between 18 and 40 years of age, in good
             health, with normal menstrual cycles, no sleep complaints, no history of endocrine
             disorder. All studies will be initiated in the early follicular phase (days 2-4).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For at least 2 months before the study, all subjects (PCOS and control) must not take
             steroid preparations (including oral contraceptives), medications known to alter
             insulin secretion and/or action, or medications known to influence sleep.

REM fragmentation: Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep will be fragmented by experimentally induced microarousals for 3 consecutive nights and non-REM sleep will be left undisturbed.
SWS suppression: Slow wave activity will be suppressed without awakening the subject and REM sleep will be left undisturbed.
Baseline: &quot;Baseline&quot; sleep (i.e., with no experimental intervention) assessment is recorded. This assessment may have been recorded as the first, second, or third intervention.</description>
