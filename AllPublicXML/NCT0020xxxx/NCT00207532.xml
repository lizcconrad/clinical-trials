  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CDC staff at the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities have been
      working closely with a Honduras-based organization, Project Healthy Children (PNS) and the
      Ministry of Health, on a folic acid supplementation study among female maquila workers.
      Participants are divided into two groups. One group receives a 1.0 milligram pill daily while
      the other group receives a 5.0 milligram pill weekly. The aim of this study is to assess
      serum blood folate levels measured at baseline, midpoint, and endpoint of the study.
      Hypothesis: Folic acid (5mg)given once weekly is as effective as folic acid (1mg)given daily
      in raising blood folate levels.
