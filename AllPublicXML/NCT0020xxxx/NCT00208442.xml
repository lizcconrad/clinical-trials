      The purpose of this study is to compare the performance and compare the wear characteristics
      of two polyethylene cup liners, Marathon™ and Enduron™, in the treatment of patients with hip
      joint disease requiring a total hip replacement. Patients who enter the study will be
      randomly allocated to one of the polyethylene cup liners, Marathon™ or Enduron™ and will be
      evaluated at regular intervals using clinical and x-ray assessments.

      The original protocol intended to perform clinical assessment using the Harris Hip Score,
      Merle D'Aubigne score and UCLA Activity Level Rating at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4
      years, 5 years and 10 years post-operative. Merle D'Aubigne score evaluation was removed per
      Amendment 2.

      However, protocol-specified data collected included only the linear and volumetric wear and
      incidence and pattern of radiological signs at 10 years post surgery. Data collected outside
      of the protocol included Oxford Hip Score and SF-12 for mental and physical well-being at 10
      years post surgery and revision for any reason.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        i) Male or female subjects, aged between 45 and 75 years inclusive.

        ii) Subjects who are able to give voluntary, written informed consent to participate in
        this investigation and from whom consent has been obtained.

        iii) Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are able to understand this
        investigation, co-operate with the investigational procedures and are willing to return to
        the hospital for all the required post-operative follow-ups.

        iv) Subjects with non-inflammatory arthritis of the hip who require a primary hip
        arthroplasty and are considered by the Clinical Investigator to be suitable for a cemented
        femoral component and an uncemented acetabular component.

        v) Subjects who have a Charnley C classification

        vi) Subjects who have undergone a contralateral hip replacement within past 6 months

        vii) Subjects with a poorly functioning contralateral hip replacement or one which has been
        identified as requiring revision

        viii) The first hip replacement scheduled for subjects identified as requiring primary
        bi-lateral hip replacements which will not be conducted simultaneously (i.e. on the same
        day).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        i) Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have an existing condition that would
        compromise their participation and follow-up in this study.

        ii) Women who are pregnant.

        iii) Subjects who are known drug or alcohol abusers or with psychological disorders that
        could effect follow-up care or treatment outcomes.

        iv) Subjects who have participated in a clinical study with an investigational product in
        the last month.
