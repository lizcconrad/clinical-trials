      This study design is subject to relevant SFDA regulations about clinical trials. Patients
      will be screened for inclusion into the study at the initial visit(240 patients to be
      recruited) and then undergo a minimum of 3-7 day’s placebo washout period(placebo wash out is
      to eliminate the effect of prior antipsychotic medication with tablets without any active
      ingredients)(patients without prior antipsychotic medication are exempt from the washout
      phase). After screening and washout period, eligible patients will be randomly assigned to
      the two treatment group, Aripiprazole or Risperidone, for 6 week’s treatment. Patients will
      be hospitalized for the entire duration of the study. Patients’ condition will be assessed
      weekly.
