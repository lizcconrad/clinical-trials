      BACKGROUND:

      Failure of older adults to take medications properly is estimated to be a factor in more than
      a quarter of emergency room visits and 10 percent of nursing home admissions, with a total
      cost of over $25 billion annually. It has been estimated that 10 percent of adverse drug
      events may be attributed to communication failure between the provider and patient. Lack of
      adherence to prescription medication protocols and adverse self-medication practices can
      result in drug interactions that can be fatal. In a health environment that promotes
      polypharmacy for older adults, a group that is less well able to see, hear, and understand
      medical information than the general population, a need exists to educate both older adults
      and their providers about the dangers of adverse drug interactions arising from
      self-medication.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The goal is to reduce adverse self-medication practices in older adults with hypertension. A
      computer program developed for older adults (Personal Education Program or PEP) will be
      modified as the next generation PEP, (PEP-NG), to include an interface to allow clients to
      enter self-medication behavior data independently on a wireless, touch screen tablet
      computer. Data entered on the PEP-NG will be analyzed via a secure server (ProHealth) and
      program content tailored to the specific adverse self-medication behaviors will be delivered.
      Summaries of the reported behaviors with corrective strategies will be printed for both
      patient and provider so the advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) has a good idea of the
      client's self-medication practices before beginning the face-to-face interview. Thus, the
      PEP-NG will make optimal use of the client's waiting time and the APRN's clinical time.

      Specific aims are at three levels. 1) To design an interface for the PEP-NG with: a)
      desirable characteristics for both older adults and primary care providers; and b) minimal
      user burden. 2) To show that APRNs will increase: a) knowledge concerning potential drug
      interactions arising from older adults' self-medication practices; b) self-efficacy for
      teaching older adults about potential drug interactions; c) self-efficacy for communicating
      with older adults about self-medication; and to d) demonstrate satisfaction using the PEP-NG
      with clients. 3) To show that older adults using the PEP-NG will: a) increase knowledge
      concerning potential drug interactions arising from self-medication practices; b) increase
      self-efficacy as to how to avoid potential drug interactions arising from self-medication
      practice; c) reduce self-reported adverse behaviors associated with potential drug
      interactions; 4) improve prescription medication adherence; d) achieve target blood pressure
      readings; and demonstrate e) satisfaction with the PEP-NG and f) the APRN provider
      relationship. User-sensitive inclusive design methods will be used to develop and test the
      patient data interface. After beta-testing the PEP-NG in the primary care laboratory, the
      PEP-NG will be piloted by 10 APRNs affiliated with ProHealth primary care practices. Repeated
      Measures Analysis of Variance (RM ANOVA) with one within subjects factor (TIME) will be
      performed on APRNs' outcome measures at time 0, immediate post-instruction, and 3 and 6
      months later. APRNs will each recruit 24 clients (240 total) meeting study criteria. The
      PEP-NG software will randomly assign each APRN's clients to either control (data collection
      only) and experimental (data collection plus educational intervention with targeted
      messages). Client outcome will be assessed at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 52 weeks and analyzed as a
      mixed ANOVA with NURSE and GROUP as between-subjects factors and TIME as a repeated-measures
      factor. Healthcare utilization will be compared between the 2 groups after 52 weeks and a
      cost-benefit analysis conducted.

    <measure>Behaviors Risk Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks on visit 1, 2, 3 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>Using a five-point scale from 1, &quot;very unlikely&quot; to 5, &quot;very likely,&quot; a five-member expert panel rated a list of adverse self-medication behaviors. The weight of each behavior was the mean of the expert ratings. Adverse self-medication behaviors were identified from questions that address use of medications (in the past month) to treat high blood pressure as well as use of OTC agents and alcohol for common problems that were self-treated with non-prescription agents. Participants were also asked if they drank alcoholic beverages, smoked or used nicotine, or took any vitamin or mineral supplements (including what, when and how frequently each was taken). The Adverse Self-Medication Behavior Risk Score is the sum (range 3 - 60) of the scores for the adverse behaviors identified. The higher the score, the higher the risk is for adverse self-medication behaviors.</description>

    <measure>Blood Pressure (BP) Readings: Systolic Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12 on visit 1, 2, 3 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>BP measurements were taken by the APRN at each of 4 visits - at the beginning of PEP-NG use on visit 1, and post-PEP-NG use on subsequent visits.</description>

    <measure>Self-efficacy for Avoiding Adverse Self-medication Behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks on visit 1, 2, 3 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-efficacy scale is a 12-item instrument with statements reflecting patient confidence in selecting appropriate OTC agents and supplements, aside from avoiding adverse effects arising from self-medication behaviors. This scale has 5-point self-report response categories (ranging from 1, &quot;Not Sure&quot; to 5, &quot;Totally Sure&quot;). Responses were summed and divided by the number of items answered, so that the overall score would not be affected by omitted items and was reported based on the original 5-point metric. The higher the score on the instrument, the higher the degree of self-efficacy for avoiding adverse self-medication behaviors.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prescription/Over the Counter (Rx-OTC) Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at 0, 4, 8, 12 weeks on visits 1, 2, 3 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>The OTC-Rx Knowledge scale has 14 multiple-choice items and the score is the percent of the items with correct response (range: 0-100%; these items test both knowledge and application concerning potential adverse effects of self-medication with OTC agents, supplements, or alcohol in persons with hypertension. The higher the score, the higher the knowledge of the potential adverse effects from self-medication.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction With the PEP-NG</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PEP-NG user Satisfaction scale is a 14-item instrument - with eight items addressing the ease of program use, program content, and suitability of program content - and another six items addressing the intent to change behavior following program use. Ratings reflected by the 5-point Likert-type scale (ranging from 1, &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to 5, &quot;strongly agree&quot;) were summed and divided by the number of items answered to ensure that the overall Satisfaction scale was not affected by omitted items and was cast in the original 5-point metric. The higher the score on the instrument, the higher the degree of satisfaction with the PEP-NG.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction With the APRN Provider Relationship</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at 0, 12 weeks on visit 1 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Healthcare Relationships Scale assesses the perceived communication relationship with a provider. The 5-item instrument, based on two qualitative studies addresses patient-provider communication (2 questions), trust, decision-making related to care, and satisfaction with care. The scale was modified for use with older adults by changing the visual analog 10 cm response format to 5-point Likert-type responses with two extremes (e.g., 1:&quot;not at all easy&quot; to 5: &quot;very easy&quot;).</description>

        <title>Behaviors Risk Score</title>
        <description>Using a five-point scale from 1, &quot;very unlikely&quot; to 5, &quot;very likely,&quot; a five-member expert panel rated a list of adverse self-medication behaviors. The weight of each behavior was the mean of the expert ratings. Adverse self-medication behaviors were identified from questions that address use of medications (in the past month) to treat high blood pressure as well as use of OTC agents and alcohol for common problems that were self-treated with non-prescription agents. Participants were also asked if they drank alcoholic beverages, smoked or used nicotine, or took any vitamin or mineral supplements (including what, when and how frequently each was taken). The Adverse Self-Medication Behavior Risk Score is the sum (range 3 - 60) of the scores for the adverse behaviors identified. The higher the score, the higher the risk is for adverse self-medication behaviors.</description>

        <title>Self-efficacy for Avoiding Adverse Self-medication Behaviors</title>
        <description>The Self-efficacy scale is a 12-item instrument with statements reflecting patient confidence in selecting appropriate OTC agents and supplements, aside from avoiding adverse effects arising from self-medication behaviors. This scale has 5-point self-report response categories (ranging from 1, &quot;Not Sure&quot; to 5, &quot;Totally Sure&quot;). Responses were summed and divided by the number of items answered, so that the overall score would not be affected by omitted items and was reported based on the original 5-point metric. The higher the score on the instrument, the higher the degree of self-efficacy for avoiding adverse self-medication behaviors.</description>

Both groups entered medication taking behaviors on the PEP-NG and answered questions related to knowledge and self-efficacy regarding adverse self-medication behaviors. The education (intervention) group received a tailored education program generated by the PEP-NG software and reinforced by the APRN.</description>

          <title>Self-efficacy for Avoiding Adverse Self-medication Behaviors</title>
          <description>The Self-efficacy scale is a 12-item instrument with statements reflecting patient confidence in selecting appropriate OTC agents and supplements, aside from avoiding adverse effects arising from self-medication behaviors. This scale has 5-point self-report response categories (ranging from 1, &quot;Not Sure&quot; to 5, &quot;Totally Sure&quot;). Responses were summed and divided by the number of items answered, so that the overall score would not be affected by omitted items and was reported based on the original 5-point metric. The higher the score on the instrument, the higher the degree of self-efficacy for avoiding adverse self-medication behaviors.</description>
