  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is widely believed that inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of AD. TNF has been
      implicated in both AD and neurological inflammation. Anti-TNF therapy is therefore surmised
      to be of potential benefit for treating AD.

      Etanercept, a biologic anti-TNF fusion protein, will be administered weekly or biweekly by
      perispinal injection to a maximum of 15 study subjects for a period of one month, followed by
      a 5 month and a 6 month possible study extension, with serial testing of cognition and
      function monthly.
