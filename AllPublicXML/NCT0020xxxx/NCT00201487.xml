  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Choline has been found in increased concentration in breast cancer patients. Hypothesis: The
      choline signal as observed by MRS is sensitive to treatment, and a positive response to
      treatment will give a reduction in choline concentration.

      The purpose of this study is to establish methods for quantification of choline in breast
      cancer by MRS

      1. Establishment of new MRS sequence for choline quantification of choline. This sequence
           is choline-selective, and signals from water and lipids are suppressed simultaneously.

        2. Compare to different methods for choline quantification. The first method is
           quantification through an external phantom standard, containing a known concentration of
           choline. The other method is based on the utilisation of internal water signal as a
           reference.

      Both calculations can be performed from the same MR exam. Ten patients will be included in
      the study.
