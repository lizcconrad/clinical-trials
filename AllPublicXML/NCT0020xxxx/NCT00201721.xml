  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the rate of complete and overall response using rituximab and
      pentostatin with and without cyclophosphamide, to monitor and assess toxicity of this
      regimen, and to determine the overall and progression-free survival in CLL patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Research indicates that both cyclophosphamide and pentostatin work synergistically
      against cancer cells and have a high response rate against chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
      without creating severe side effects in patients. In addition, studies have shown that
      rituximab, a therapy that targets the immune system, has the highest efficacy against CLL and
      the lowest toxicity rate when compared with other immunotherapy drugs. Studies also show that
      rituximab enhances the efficacy of the chemotherapy agents cyclophosphamide and pentostatin.
      This study offers the combination of immunotherapy with two promising chemotherapy agents
      against CLL.

      Purpose: This study is evaluating the efficacy and safety of combination treatment with
      cyclophosphamide, pentostatin, and rituximab in patients with CLL. Several tests evaluating
      the genetic and molecular components of CLL will also be performed. Some of these tests will
      be conducted before, during, and after treatments to assess changes resulting from the study
      drugs. Each patient's outcome will be assessed in relation to various aspects of their genes.
