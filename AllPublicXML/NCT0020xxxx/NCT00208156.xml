  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corlux (mifepristone) is a new medication that modulates the body's use of a hormone called
      cortisol. Under normal conditions, cortisol and other hormones are created by the body in
      response to physical and emotional stress, triggering a healthy stress response. People who
      suffer from psychotic major depression may have unusually high levels of cortisol circulating
      within them or abnormal patterns of cortisol levels, overloading the stress response
      mechanism and causing symptoms of psychosis such as delusional thoughts or hallucinations. If
      Corlux can keep the body's cortisol receptors from being overloaded, the stress response
      system may return to normal function, which may result in improvement of symptoms. The
      purpose of this study is to allow patients who have already participated in an earlier 8 week
      study of Corlux versus placebo (an inactive pill) to receive additional courses of treatment
      with Corlux periodically if a psychotic episode should reappear during a period of one year.
