  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase IV study is intended to compare intragastric acid suppression of oral esomeprazole
      (NEXIUM ® Delayed-Release Capsules) with that of oral pantoprazole (PROTONIX ® Delayed
      Release Tablets ), in subjects who continue to require acid-suppressive therapy following a
      course of intravenous (iv) pantoprazole (PROTONIX ® I.V. for Injection).
