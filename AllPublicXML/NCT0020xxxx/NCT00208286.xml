  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This post-market clinical follow-up study was designed to compile long-term knee replacement
      outcomes of the PFC Sigma fixed and PFC Sigma mobile Rotating Platform (RP) knee systems. The
      first patient had surgery on November 8, 2001 and the final patient had surgery on July 29,
      2005. There were 120 knees consented by a single site, which was the planned sample size in
      the study protocol, with 117 receiving one of the study devices. The study was terminated as
      the primary outcome was met and the investigator decided to conduct the study without sponsor
      support after 2009.

      Performance and safety will be assessed using the following surgeon and patient based outcome
      tools:

        1. American Knee Society Knee and Function Scores

        2. Knee Society Radiological Analysis

        3. Oxford Knee Score

        4. SF 12 Score

        5. Anterior Knee Pain Score

      Specific objectives of the evaluation being to assess the following:

        1. Improvement in functional recovery

        2. Incidence of anterior knee pain

        3. Improvement in Quality of life

        4. Incidence of tibial loosening

        5. Incidence of excessive polyethylene wear

    <measure>To Compare Range of Motion (ROM) between subjects receiving Sigma Rotating Platform mobile bearing and Sigma fixed bearing components</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Range of motion is knee flexion (how far the patient can bend their knee) minus knee extension (how far the patient can straighten their knee). The result of this subtraction is the range of motion (bending and straightening) for that knee.</description>

    <measure>Change in SF-12 Physical and Mental Component Scores from Baseline to 1 and 2 years</measure>
    <time_frame>1 and 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) is a patient reported outcome survey that evaluates functional health and well-being. The survey is converted into 2 summary measures that are scored from 0 to 100 (where 100 indicates the highest level of health) - the Physical Component Score (PCS-12) and Mental Component Score (MCS-12). At times, the survey is also displayed via 8 domain scales that are also scored from 0 to 100 (where 100 indicates the highest level of health) as follows: Physical Function, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Mental Health, Role Emotional, Social Function, and Vitality. The response metric is the change score, or delta, from pre-operative assessment to post-operative assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in American Knee Society Knee and Function Scores from Baseline to 1 and 2 years</measure>
    <time_frame>1 and 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>American Knee Society (AKS) knee score is a 0-100 point score (where 100 indicates excellent knee condition) that evaluates the affected knee. The knee score is composed of Pain, Range of Motion, and Stability. American Knee Society (AKS) function score is a 0-100 point score (where 100 indicates excellent knee function) that evaluates the affected knee. The function score is composed of Walking and Stair Climbing ability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Oxford Knee Score from Baseline to 1 and 2 years</measure>
    <time_frame>1 and 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Oxford Knee Score (OKS) is a 12 to 60 point patient reported outcome (PRO) score (where 12 indicates the best outcome) that evaluates the affected knee. The total score is composed of Pain and Function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anterior Knee Pain from Baseline to 1 and 2 years</measure>
    <time_frame>1 and 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Anterior Knee Pain is assessed by the patient into 1 of 4 categories: None, Mild, Moderate, or Severe.</description>
