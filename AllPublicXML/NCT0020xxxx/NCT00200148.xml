  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With a major liver or pancreas operation, there is a chance that one will require a
      transfusion of blood products (either red blood cells or plasma). This may be necessary
      during the operation or a few days after surgery. The surgeons at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
      Cancer Center perform a very large number of liver or pancreas resections every year and have
      pioneered techniques that minimize bleeding during the operation. Even so, liver or pancreas
      operations such as the one that will be undergone carry a 50% chance of requiring a
      transfusion. A technique that might lower the need for transfusions is called acute
      normovolemic hemodilution (ANH). ANH was first introduced over twenty years ago and has been
      used in many types of operations, including liver or pancreas resection. The studies done on
      ANH at other hospitals suggest that it may help conserve blood. Researchers at Memorial
      Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center are conducting a study to determine if ANH is better than the
      'standard technique' that is currently used in all patients. The purpose of this study is to
      find out which of the two techniques is better.

      The purpose of the study is to see if ANH lowers the need for the transfusion of blood
      products during and after liver or pancreas resection.

      The second purpose of the study is to see how ANH changes the length of the operation, the
      length of time one spends in the hospital, and the complication rate after surgery. The
      researchers will also see if ANH requires any changes in the administration of anesthesia.

      Despite improvements in peri-operative outcome, major hepatic resection and
      pancreaticoduodenectomy remains associated with a high risk of major blood loss and
      perioperative blood transfusion.The risks associated with allogeneic blood transfusions are
      well-known, including immunosuppression, incompatible transfusion, and transmission of
      infectious agents. Clearly, efforts to reduce the use of allogeneic blood products are
      warranted in order to avoid potential transfusion-related complications, reduce hospital cost
      and avoid periods of critical blood shortage.

      ANH is an approach to blood conservation that involves removal of whole blood from a patient
      immediately prior to an operation that is likely to be associated with significant blood
      loss. Following blood removal, euvolemia is restored with crystalloid and/or colloid. The
      harvested blood, which has a greater red cell mass than the blood lost intraoperatively, is
      re-infused as needed during the procedure or at the completion of the operation. ANH is more
      attractive than preoperative autologous blood donation for several reasons: it is technically
      and logistically much simpler, it requires no special equipment and costs less (no storage or
      administrative costs), it is associated with a lower chance of administration error, it
      requires no obligate pre-operative delay and is not associated with a waste of autologous
      units. In addition, because coagulation factors are preserved and later re-infused, ANH may
      reduce the need for post-operative fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Additionally, ANH may have an
      impact on low CVP anesthetic management during partial hepatectomy, which is standard at
      MSKCC and at many other centers.

      The present study will help elucidate the efficacy of ANH as a means of reducing the
      allogeneic transfusion rate in patients undergoing major hepatic resection. If shown to be
      effective in reducing the use of allogeneic blood products, ANH will not only impact the
      current practice of hepatic resectional surgery but may also change current practice in other
      surgical disciplines.

      This will be a prospective randomized study. Eligible patients will be consented for the
      trial prior to the operation.

    <description>For those patients randomized to ANH, the pre-calculated volume of blood will be withdrawn to a target hemoglobin of 8.0 - 8.5 g/dl (maximum of 3 L) using the formula VL=EBV x (HO-HF)/Hav, as above. The removed blood will be stored in a standard citrate-phosphate-dextrose buffer solution in blood storage bags in the operating room. During removal of blood, colloid and crystalloid solutions will be administered via peripheral intravenous lines in order to maintain euvolemia. For all patients, arterial blood will be sampled every 30 minutes during the resection for assessment of arterial blood gases/pH; Hgb levels will be measured every 30 minutes.For patients randomized to ANH, autologous blood will be re-infused in the reverse order from which it was removed, and allogeneic blood will given only after all autologous blood has been given.</description>

    <description>An 8.5 French central venous catheter and an arterial line will be placed in all patients. If the patient has a central line already in place, this may be used in place of the 8.5 French internal jugular catheter. Continuous monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, ECG (II, V5), CVP, end tidal CO2, oxygen saturation, temperature and urine output will be performed for all patients.For all hepatic resections, standard low CVP anesthetic management will be employed.For all patients, arterial blood will be sampled every 30 minutes during the resection for assessment of arterial blood gases/pH; Hgb levels will be measured every 30 minutes.All patients will receive standard postoperative management. Routine laboratory studies, including comprehensive panel, CBC and coagulation profile, will be obtained daily in the post-operative period.</description>
