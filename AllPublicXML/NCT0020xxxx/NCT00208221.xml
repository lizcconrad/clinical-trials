  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a dose of ramipril combined with a normal dose
      of telmisartan 80 mg will be more effective than ramipril 20 mg in reducing microalbuminuria
      in hypertensive patients with diabetes.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of ramipril 10 mg and telmisartan 80 mg
      versus ramipril 20 mg in patients with diabetes type II, hypertension and microalbuminuria
      (Urinary-albuminuria creatinine ratio of 2.0 to 25 mg/mmol) on

        1. Microalbuminuria

        2. Blood pressure (systolic, diastolic and ABPM), Renin-angiotensin system, Catecholamines,
           Oxydative stress

        3. Comparison at 4, 8 and 12 weeks with addition of hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg if BP over
           130/80 mmHg
