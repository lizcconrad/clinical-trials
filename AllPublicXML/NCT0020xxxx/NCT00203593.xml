  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether eight weeks of exercise performed at an
      intensity of approximately 65% VO2max will improve symptoms associated with fainting
      (vasovagal syncope).

      Background: Vasovagal syncope affects 20-30% of the population, and for those who faint
      recurrently it causes a significant reduction in the quality of life. Although significant
      progress has been made in the past 15 years in our understanding of its diagnosis and
      prognosis, our therapeutic attempts often end in failure. Many patients who have been
      diagnosed with vasovagal syncope have a reduced orthostatic tolerance. Improved orthostatic
      tolerance has been achieved through exercise in a number of studies on healthy individuals.
      However, its efficacy as a means of treatment for those with vasovagal syncope has not been
      thoroughly explored.

      Comparison: Subjects will be randomized to one of two groups: an exercise group or control.
      The exercise group will be asked to train at a target of approximately 65% of their maximum
      exercise capacity (VO2max) for 8 weeks/3 times per week. The control group will be asked to
      perform a series of neck rotation exercises. Orthostatic tolerance will be examined in both
      groups pre and post intervention.
