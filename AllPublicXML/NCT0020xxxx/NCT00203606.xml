  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C infects as many as 300,000 Canadians. Up to 25% of those infected will develop
      cirrhosis and be at risk for liver failure and liver cancer. Cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C
      is the most common reason for liver transplantation in Canada. The largest group of infected
      people are those who use injectable street drugs. However, people who continue to use drugs
      are routinely excluded from scientific studies testing new treatments for Hepatitis C and are
      generally recommended not to receive available treatments. Although several reasons are given
      to justify excluding these people from treatment, little scientific evidence is available to
      support it. We plan to examine how successful treatment with the current standard treatment
      of pegylated interferon and ribavirin is in those who continue to use injection drugs. We
      will compare the results of treatment of 70 active drug users to results of published
      clinical trials (this is a change from initial plan to compare to treatment results of 70
      local) reformed drug users). Our goal is to determine whether reasonable success rates can be
      achieved in active drug users that would then further justify their routine treatment.
