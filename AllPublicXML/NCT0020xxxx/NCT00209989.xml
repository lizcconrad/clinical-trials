  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy by the determination of the Time To
      Progression (TTP) in patients with resectable GBM or non surgical GBM with a size less than 5
      cm treated with the combination of ZARNESTRA plus Radiation therapy.
