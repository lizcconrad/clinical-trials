    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with chlamydial infections (a sexually transmitted disease) are asked to
      notify their sex partners and tell them to seek medical evaluation. This project tests an
      enhancement to the materials provided to patients to help convince their partners to seek
      evaluation against the standard of care, which is a brief notification instruction. The
      desired outcomes are greater levels of notification by participants of their partners and
      lower levels of reinfection among participants.

      Patients diagnosed with chlamydial infections (a sexually transmitted disease) are asked to
      notify their sex partners and tell them to seek medical evaluation: patient referral. Rates
      of actual referral by patients are unknown, but estimates derived from several evaluations
      suggest somewhere between 30 - 55% of partners are notified and tested (for chlamydia).
      Current prevalence and yearly rates of infection suggest this level of partner notification
      and treatment is insufficient to control the disease.

      As a program, this project has disseminated notification activities to community health
      centers that see chlamydial infections, all under the aegis of the awardee (Boston Medical
      Center). Diagnosis and partner notification can be recorded remotely , but centrally accessed
      through a secure database. To enhance patient referral effectiveness, this project tests
      brief instructions to refer (standard of care) against a &quot;kit&quot; containing a specific
      notification of exposure to chlamydia, an accurate health message about the nature and
      prognosis of the infection (treated and untreated), options for seeking free or low-cost
      evaluation and treatment, and a satisfaction survey. A second, crossed condition is pure
      patient referral against a contract (72 hours to notify, after which study staff will refer
      cases to public health professionals for notification).

      Principal outcomes measured are levels of notification by participants of their partners and
      levels of reinfection among participants. We also measure psychosocial mediating effects, as
      well as potential unintended consequences of patient referral: incident partner violence
      against prevalent (baseline rates) violence, depressed affect
