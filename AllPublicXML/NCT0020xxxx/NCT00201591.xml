  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigated if aerobic endurance exercise of different intensity has different
      impact on the physical capacity and myocardial function in patients with coronary artery
      disease. Patients with stable CAD trained for 10 weeks, and oxygen consumption and myocardial
      function were measured before and after this period. Patients were randomly assigned to each
      exercise group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peak oxygen consumption was measured by gas-analysis. Myocardial function was measured by
      echocardiography. Exercise was performed on treadmills under close supervision of an exercise
      physiologist. Patients had to complete over 70% of sessions to be included in analysis. Three
      sessions were scheduled every week. Heart rate (HR) was about 85 % of max HR in the high
      intensity group, and about 65 % in the moderate intensity group.
