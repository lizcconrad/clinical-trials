    <time_frame>Data collected at 0, 1.5, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours after start of infusion.</time_frame>
    <description>QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTcF) was assessed using triplicate 12-lead serial electrocardiograms (ECGs) that were performed at selected times after the first dose of ixabepilone without rifampin and at matched times prior to the first dose of ixabepilone.

    <description>Triplicate 12-lead serial ECGs were performed pre-dose (just prior to infusion), 1.5, 3 (just prior to end of the infusion even if infusion lasted for less than or more than planned 3 hrs), 4, 6, 8 and 24 hrs after start of ixabepilone infusion. Triplicate 12-lead serial ECGs were also to be performed on the date prior to dosing at times approximating post-dose schedule (pre-dose triplicate set of ECGs also qualified as the 24-hr baseline ECGs).

          <description>All treated participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug. On Day 1 of Cycle 1, each participant received a single 3-hour IV infusion of ixabepilone 40 mg/m^2. On Day 15, participants were administered an oral dose of 600 mg rifampin in the clinic and on Days 16-21, participants self-administered rifampin once daily at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the ingestion of food. On Day 22 (Cycle 2), participants were administered an oral dose of 600 mg of rifampin while in a fasted state in the clinic. Participants were then administered a single 3-hour IV infusion of ixabepilone 40 mg/m^2. On Days 23-28, participants self-administered a 600-mg oral dose of rifampin once daily at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the ingestion of food. During Cycle 3 and beyond, participants received a single 3-hour IV infusion of ixabepilone at a dose of 40 mg/m^2 (unless their dose had been reduced) on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for a maximum of 6 full cycles.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Identified ECG Abnormalities</title>
        <description>Triplicate 12-lead serial ECGs were performed pre-dose (just prior to infusion), 1.5, 3 (just prior to end of the infusion even if infusion lasted for less than or more than planned 3 hrs), 4, 6, 8 and 24 hrs after start of ixabepilone infusion. Triplicate 12-lead serial ECGs were also to be performed on the date prior to dosing at times approximating post-dose schedule (pre-dose triplicate set of ECGs also qualified as the 24-hr baseline ECGs). Normal ranges for ECG are as follows: heart rate: 40 - 125 bpm; PR: 0.1 - 0.2 msec; QRS: 0.06 - 0.12 msec; QTC: 0.3 - 0.45 msec; QT: 0.3 - 0.5 msec.</description>

On Day 15, participants were administered an oral dose of 600 mg rifampin in the clinic and on Days 16-21, participants self-administered rifampin once daily at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the ingestion of food. On Day 22 (Cycle 2), participants were administered an oral dose of 600 mg of rifampin while in a fasted state in the clinic. Participants were then administered a single 3-hour IV infusion of ixabepilone 40 mg/m^2. On Days 23-28, participants self-administered a 600-mg oral dose of rifampin once daily at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the ingestion of food. During Cycle 3 and beyond, participants received a single 3-hour IV infusion of ixabepilone at a dose of 40 mg/m^2 (unless their dose had been reduced) on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for a maximum of 6 full cycles.</description>
