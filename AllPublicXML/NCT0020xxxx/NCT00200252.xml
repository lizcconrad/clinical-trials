  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mothers are given the medication oxytocin after birth to help the uterus (womb) contract and
      therefore reduce blood loss. In Canada, oxytocin is given either into the muscle of the thigh
      or into a vein. However, it is not known which route is better.This study will test which
      dose and route of oxytocin is best in reducing blood loss following vaginal delivery.
