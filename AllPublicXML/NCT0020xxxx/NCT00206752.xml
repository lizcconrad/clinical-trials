  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of avoiding opposite side neck
      radiation therapy in patients with clearly one side squamous cell cancer of the head and
      neck. We aim to assess the reduction in treatment volume (amount of radiation therapy
      required), and the resultant xerostomia and mucositis, with the delivery of unilateral neck
      radiation therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be treated with definitive external beam radiation plus/minus chemotherapy
      plus/minus neck dissection in the ipsilateral neck (post radiation). The primary site will be
      treated with definitive radiation therapy, or definitive surgery plus post-operative
      radiation therapy. Primary endpoints are loco-regional control, as well as quality of life,
      xerostomia, mucositis, and neck fibrosis.

      Salivary evaluations shall be performed prior to the initiation of radiation therapy, during
      the second week of EBRT, and at the completion of radiation. Evaluations will also be
      conducted at 3, 6, and 12 months after the completion of EBRT.

      Oral mucositis will be assessed prior to the initiation of EBRT and weekly during EBRT.
      Evaluations will also be conducted at 3 and 6 months after the completion of EBRT. Two
      standardized mucositis scales will be used: the RTOG scale and the WHO scale.

      Clinical response will be evaluated by physical exam and PET/CT. PET/CT scans will be done at
      3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, and then when clinically indicated during follow-up.
