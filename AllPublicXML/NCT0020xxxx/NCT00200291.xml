  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reinforcing value of food, or how much a person &quot;wants&quot; a food, is an important
      determinant of food intake. Thus far, food reinforcement has only been studied in laboratory
      settings, and no studies have examined whether the reinforcing value of food is altered when
      dietary changes are made. The chronic deprivation that occurs when a low-calorie, low-fat
      diet is implemented for weight loss may increase the reinforcing value of all foods, but
      particularly for restricted high-fat foods. Greater increases in the reinforcing value of
      high-fat foods relative to low-fat foods may be detrimental for sustaining newly adopted
      eating behaviors that produce weight loss, whereas greater increases in the reinforcing value
      of low-fat foods relative to high-fat foods may aid in maintaining healthy eating behaviors.
      The aim of this application is to measure food reinforcement in a clinical setting to
      determine if food reinforcement changes when a traditional weight loss diet is prescribed.
      For this ancillary study, 147 volunteers will be recruited from the 165 overweight and obese
      women participating in the Program to Reduce Incontinence by Diet and Exercise (PRIDE) at The
      Miriam Hospital. As part of PRIDE, these participants will be randomized in a 2-to-1 ratio to
      either a 6-month weight loss intervention or usual care. Assessments of food reinforcement,
      dietary intake, and weight will occur at 0 and 6 months. Given that the intervention group
      changes their diet relative to the usual care group, it is hypothesized: 1) the intervention
      group will have greater increases in the reinforcing value of both high- and low-fat foods
      than the usual care group from 0 to 6 months; and 2) within the intervention group, decreases
      in frequency of consumption of high-fat foods will be related to increases in the reinforcing
      value of high-fat foods from 0 to 6 months. These results will lead to a novel line of
      research, examining the relationship between food reinforcement and weight loss maintenance,
      so that diets can be designed to promote changes in food reinforcement that aid in sustaining
      dietary changes and weight loss.
