  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C infection is a prevalent chronic disease. It is particularly prevalent among
      intravenous drug abusers. Bergen fengsel is a regional prison housing 250 inmates, of which
      as many as 70 are recorded HCV RNA PCR positive annuallly. In this study inmate males and
      females will be randomized to standard screening and initiation procedure, or to a rapid
      initiation procedure in the hospital's infectious diseases outpatient clinic. The study aims
      at studying if rapid inclusion will increase the possibility to conclude treatment while the
      prisoner still is incarcerated, thus improve the chances of reaching a sustained virologic
      response, compared to standard inclusion, where prisoners, as other out patients will wait
      for inclusion for several months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Serologic evidence of chronic hepatitis C infection by an anti-HCV test

          -  Serum HCV-RNA quantifiable at &gt; 600 IU/mL or 1000 copies/mL by the Roche AMPLICOR HCV
             MONITOR Test, v2.0

          -  Patients with both normal or elevated serum ALT are eligible

          -  Compensated liver disease (Child-Pugh grade A clinical classification)

          -  Patients with cirrhosis or transition to cirrhosis must have an abdominal
             ultrasonography, CT scan or MRI scan without evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and
             a serum AFP &lt; 100 ng/mL within 2 months of randomization

          -  Negative urine or blood pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential)
             documented within the 24 hour period prior to first dose of study drug
