  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose is to study the safety and effectiveness of the Concentric Retriever
      Device(CRD)in ischemic stroke patients who undergo clot retrieval with the CRD within 8 hours
      of stroke symptom onset. The CRD has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      to retrieve foreign bodies (such as pieces of metal) from blood vessels in the body. The CRD
      is a small metal wire with a loop at the end (like a corkscrew) that removes clots from
      arteries and thereby restores blood flow to the brain. Prior versions of the CRD may have
      been too soft to pull out clots, just as a corkscrew that is too soft would not pull out
      corks. The current version of the CRD is not as soft and may be more effective in retrieving
      clots. Hypothesis: By restoring blood flow to the brain, stroke symptoms may get better or
      the stroke may be prevented from getting worse.

      The primary objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of the Concentric Retriever in the
      treatment of thrombotic occlusions originating in the internal carotid, middle cerebral (M1
      and M2 segments), basilar, posterior cerebral or vertebral arteries. A maximum of 50 patients
      may be enrolled at a single site, University of California, Los Angeles.

      Primary endpoints: Achievement of recanalization (TIMI/TICI grade II or III flow) immediately
      post procedure without occurrence of major complications will be assessed. Major
      complications are defined as vessel perforation, intramural arterial dissection, symptomatic
      intra-cranial hemorrhage, and significant embolization in a previously uninvolved arterial
      territory.

      Secondary endpoints: Assessment of patient's neurological condition and functional state
      using the NIHSS, Barthel Index, and Modified Rankin at 30 and 90 days post-procedure. A
      composite of major adverse events at 30 and 90 days post-procedure will be reported. Major
      adverse events are defined as death and new stroke.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        1(a) -Patients who present within 8 hours of stroke onset and are not candidates for
        treatment with t-PA who have clinical signs consistent with the diagnosis of ischemic
        stroke such as impairment of language, motor function, sensation, cognition, and/or gaze,
        or vision.

        1(b). Patients who have had an acute ischemic stroke treated with intravenous thrombolytic
        therapy where vascular imaging (TCD, CTA, MRA, angiography) shows a persistent occlusion
        after the end of the infusion treatment.

        2. Patients &gt; 18 years of age. 3. NIHSSS &gt; 7 4. Angiogram shows a thrombotic occlusion
        originating in the internal carotid, middle cerebral (M1 or M2 segment), basilar, posterior
        cerebral, or vertebral arteries.

        5. Patient/patient guardian is willing to comply with the protocol requirements and return
        to the treatment center for all required clinical evaluations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is pregnant (if within child bearing age).

          2. Patient has baseline glucose of &lt; 50mg/dL (&lt;50 mg/mM).

          3. Patient has excessive arterial tortuosity that precludes the device from reaching the
             target area.

          4. Patient has known hemorrhagic diathesis, coagulation factor deficiency, or oral
             anticoagulant therapy with INR &gt; 2.0.

          5. Patient received Heparin within 48 hours with a PTT greater than 2 times the lab
             normal.

          6. Patient has baseline platelets &lt; 30,000.

          7. Patient has history of severe allergy to intra-arterial contrast medium.

          8. Patient has severe, sustained hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt; 185 mm Hg or
             diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mm Hg).

             NOTE: If the blood pressure can be successfully reduced and maintained at the
             acceptable level using medication (i.e. Nipride), the patient can be enrolled.

          9. CT Scan or MRI reveals significant mass effect with midline shift.

         10. Patient's angiogram shows an arterial stenosis (&gt;50%) proximal to the embolus.

         11. Patient's anticipated life expectancy is less than 3 months.
