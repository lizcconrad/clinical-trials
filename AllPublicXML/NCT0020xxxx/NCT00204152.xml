      The purpose of this study is to test the clinical efficacy of two psychotherapies for early
      onset chronic major depression, including Behavioral Activation (Jacobson et al., 2001), and
      an integrated version of Behavioral Activation and Stress Innoculation Coping (BASIC) for
      short-term (16 weeks) of individual psychotherapy for adults with chronic major depression.
      The control condition is an individual workbook condition of Behavioral Activation. These
      psychotherapies focus on behavior activation, stress reduction and coping strategies to
      counter depressive symptoms.

      Early-onset unipolar major depression is linked with considerable morbidity and mortality
      (Birmaher et al., 1996). The goal of this project is to test the efficacy of Behavioral
      Activation (BA; Jacobson et al., 2001) and an integrated version of Behavioral Activation (BA
      + Stress Inoculation Coping; BASIC) for the short-term psychotherapy of adults with chronic
      major depression (onset before age 18) and a history of early life stress before age 18.
      Exposure to stress during the developmental years has been linked with early-onset depression
      (Rao et al., 1996), a propensity to generate stress during the life span (Hammen et al.,
      1998), and a greater psychological sensitivity to stress as an adult (Post et al., 1992). And
      while incidence of early life stress is high among depressed adults, there are no behavioral
      treatments designed to address the unique needs of these individuals. We aim to develop a new
      treatment for a specific group of depressed patients, namely individuals who report early
      onset of depression and early life stress. We include the critical elements of behavioral
      activation and stress reduction strategies to address the avoidance, stress sensitivities,
      and coping deficits often observed in this population.

      The specific aims are: 1) to determine if the addition of stress reduction strategies
      (packaged in BASIC) enhance the effects of BA, as indexed by the rate early remission; 2) to
      investigate if exposure to BA and BASIC reduce risk of relapse within three months of
      treatment termination, as indexed by reduced rates of relapse by the 3-month follow-up; and,
      3) to learn if effects of BA are mediated by changes in activity behaviors or the acquisition
      of compensatory behavioral skills, and likewise whether enduring effects of BASIC are
      mediated by changes in stress regulation or the acquisition of stress regulation skills. Our
      approach is to compare BA and BASIC to a self-guided bibliotherapy of BA (control condition)
      using a randomized clinical trial design to distinguish between conditions. We anticipate
      that this study will promote our understanding about the efficacy of BA and the discovery of
      mechanisms of treatment response. We expect this project to facilitate our understanding of
      the mechanisms that promote treatment gains and contribute to depressive relapse.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  depressed male and female subjects between ages 18 to 58 years.

          -  current and primary diagnosis of DSM-IV Major Depressive Disorder (e.g., no lifetime
             history of bipolar I or II disorder, current anxiety disorders, or current substance
             dependence disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 1994).

          -  should also have upon study entry a score of 14 or higher (moderate depression) on the
             Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD; Hamilton, 1960) and a score of 20 or
             higher (moderate depression) on the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II; Beck et al.,
             1996a).

          -  background of high childhood trauma (70-item Childhood Trauma Questionnaire with a
             Total Score of 9 or higher).

          -  reasonably fluent in English to complete the evaluation.

          -  history of bipolar affective disorder,

          -  history of psychosis (including schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,
             schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, or psychotic organic brain syndrome)

          -  current non-psychotic Axis I disorder if it constitutes the predominant aspect of the

             project (including anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, dissociative disorders, or
             eating disorders, etc.),

          -  history of substance dependence in the past six months,

          -  antisocial, borderline, or schizotypal personality disorder,

          -  evidence of any medical disorder or condition that could cause depression or preclude
             the use of study treatments,

          -  current treatment with catecholaminergic antihypertensive medication, including
             reserpine, beta-blockers, clonidine, alphamethyldopa, etc. (diuretics, ACE inhibitors
             and calcium channel inhibitors will be allowed),

          -  clear indication of secondary gain (e.g., court ordered treatment or compensation
             issues),

          -  current suicide risk sufficient to preclude treatment on an outpatient basis (any
             patient scoring 3 or above on the suicide item on the HRSD or BDI must be cleared for
             study participation by the PI).
