  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The obesity epidemic observed in recent years can be largely attributed to an obesogenic
      environment that encourages overeating and sedentary lifestyles. Behavioral weight control
      treatment, the most empirically validated intervention approach, produces initial weight
      losses of 10%; however, maintenance of initial weight loss and behavior change has not been
      achieved. These disappointing long-term results may reflect the fact that participants are
      given only minimal, indirect instruction on how to change their environment to support their
      new weight-regulating behaviors. While in theory, the behavioral model emphasizes
      environmental antecedents and consequences of eating and exercise, in practice, only 1 to 2
      sessions in standard treatment are dedicated to stimulus control-types of skills. By teaching
      weight control skills in a contextual vacuum, participants remain vulnerable to the same
      environmental influences that maintained their unhealthy eating and exercise habits. Given
      that the majority of eating and exercise is home-based, a logical step in strengthening
      behavioral treatment and moving toward an ecological model of behavior is to expand the focus
      of treatment from the individual to the individual plus their home environment. We propose to
      test the long-term impact of a behavioral weight control program designed to directly modify
      both the physical and social home environment of weight loss participants. Two hundred
      overweight and obese men and women will be randomly assigned to either 18 months of standard
      behavioral treatment (SBT) or 18 months of standard behavioral treatment plus direct
      modifications to the home environment (SBT+Home). SBT+Home will incorporate many strategies
      that have shown promise in improving weight loss (e.g., food and exercise equipment
      provision, spouse involvement) but will be the first to study both physical and social
      factors within the home simultaneously and will be the longest examination of the home
      environment conducted to date. Participants and spouses will be assessed at baseline, 6, 12,
      and 18 months. We hypothesize that by broadening the focus of treatment from the individual
      to the individual plus their home environment, SBT+Home will produce both better long-term
      weight loss and better maintenance of initial weight loss and behavior change. This home
      environmental approach, if successful, has potential applications to the maintenance of other
      important health behaviors.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  are between 21-70 years of age.

          -  have a body mass index (BMI) between 25-50 kg/m2 .

          -  live with another overweight adult who is between 18-70 years of age and has a BMI
             between 25-50 kg/m2 and who is willing to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  report a heart condition, chest pain during periods of activity or rest, or loss of
             consciousness on the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q; items 1-4).
             Individuals endorsing joint problems, prescription medication usage, or other medical
             conditions that could limit exercise will be required to obtain written physician
             consent to participate.

          -  report conditions that in the judgment of the Principal Investigator would render them
             potentially unlikely to follow the protocol for 18 months including an illness likely
             to be terminal within 18 months, plans to move out of the area, substance abuse or
             other significant psychiatric problems, or dementia.

          -  report being unable to walk 2 blocks (1/4 mile) without stopping.

          -  are currently participating in a weight loss program and/or taking a weight loss
             medication.

          -  are currently pregnant or intend to become pregnant in the next 18 months.
