  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus
      artesunate versus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine alone in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria.

    <textblock>
      Resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to anti-malarial drugs is a serious impediment to the
      control of malaria. In order to facilitate formulation of effective regional drug policies
      and to provide a database for decision-making on the implementation of combination therapy
      (CAT), it is essential that the in vivo response to CAT be investigated. In the South East
      African Combination Anti-malarial Therapy (SEACAT) evaluation, there is a comprehensive
      evaluation of the phased introduction of combination anti-malarial therapy in Mozambique. As
      a component of this evaluation, in selected Mozambique sites where intensity of malaria
      transmission is high, a direct parallel group comparison of monotherapy (SP) with CAT
      (artesunate plus SP) will be conducted according to this protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, older than 12 months.

          -  Weight &gt; 10 kg.

          -  Diagnoses of pure uncomplicated acute P. falciparum malaria parasitaemia of up to 500
             000 asexual parasite/mcl blood with axillary temperature of greater than or equal to
             37.5Â°C or history of fever (defined as within the previous 24 hours).

          -  Documented informed consent.

          -  Lives close enough to the study site for reliable follow up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has received anti-malarial treatment in the past 7 days.

          -  Is infected with other malarial species (such subjects may be excluded retrospectively
             from the analysis).

          -  Severely ill (based on WHO Criteria for severe malaria ) or if patient is considered,
             in the opinion of the investigator or designee, to have moderately severe malaria
             (e.g. prostrate, repeated vomiting, dehydrated) or other danger signs.

          -  Has received cotrimoxazole, trimethoprim, chloramphenicol, folate or tetracyclines
             (including doxycycline) in the past 7 days or is likely to require these during the
             study period.

          -  History of G6PD deficiency.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Has a history of allergy to any of the study drugs (including other sulphonamides e.g.
             cotrimoxazole, other artemisinin derivatives e.g. co-artemether).

          -  Serious underlying disease that in the opinion of the clinic team and/or Principal
             Investigator would make the patient unsuitable for the study in terms of their safety
             or study analysis.
