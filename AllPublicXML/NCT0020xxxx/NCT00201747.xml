      To determine the most efficacious of two combination regimens of sequential CPT-11 and MMC in
      patients with advanced and previously untreated esophageal and GE junction adenocarcinomas.

  <detailed_description>

      Rationale: Previous studies suggest that both irinotecan and Mytomycin C when administered
      alone have some efficacy against stomach cancer. Based on laboratory testing, researchers
      hypothesized that Mytomycin C may enhance the efficacy of irinotecan through an enzyme called
      Topoisomerase I. In addition, because Mytomycin C has severe side effects, combining these
      chemotherapy agents together may allow for lower dosages resulting in greater efficacy and
      reduced side effects. A recent study indicates that the combination of these drugs has
      promising anti-tumor activity against esophageal and stomach cancers. The current study
      builds on previous research to explore the most effective schedule for administering these
      drugs together.

      Purpose: This study is evaluating the combination of irinotecan and Mytomycin C on two
      different treatment schedules in patients with advanced esophageal and stomach cancers.
      Characteristics of different genes will also be measured, along with genetic and molecular
      changes by comparing test results from the beginning and end of the study.

      Treatment: Patients in this study will receive irinotecan and Mytomycin C in one of two
      treatment schedules. Both drugs will be administered in patients through an intravenous
      infusion. A computer will randomly assign patients to a treatment group. Group one will
      receive Mytomycin C on day 1 and irinotecan on days 2 and 9. Group two will receive Mytomycin
      C on days 1 and 8 and irinotecan on days 2 and 9. After day 9, patients in both groups will
      not be given any study drugs for almost three weeks to complete a four week cycle. Several
      tests and exams will be given throughout the study to closely monitor patients. Patients will
      continue receiving the study drugs until they experience disease growth or unacceptable side
      effects.
