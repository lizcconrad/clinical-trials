  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 3-year prospective investigation is to examine the short-term and
      long-term (1 year)efficacy of the bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) in adults with single
      sided deafness

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Limited studies have been done on the BAHA in adults with single sided (sensorineural)
      deafness, and these studies have evaluated only short-term efficacy at one month post
      implantation. The findings of the limited number of studies to date on the BAHA with single
      sided deafness demonstrate that the BAHA improves understanding in noisy or group situations
      and understanding conversation when addressed by a speaker on the side of the bad ear and
      most users have judged the BAHA to have at least satisfactory benefit. But conflicting
      findings have been obtained regarding whether the BAHA improves the ability to locate the
      source of a sound. Additionally, no studies have been done to see whether the magnitudes of
      the improvements seen at one month post implantation increase over time because of learning
      effects or brain plasticity.

      This investigation will show whether the previously reported BAHA benefits at one month post
      BAHA sound processor fitting, related to speech recognition in noise and subjective
      satisfaction, persist at one year, and whether learning effects increase the magnitudes of
      these benefits from one month to one year post BAHA sound processor fitting. This long-term
      investigation also attempts to resolve the conflicting findings pertaining to the BAHA effect
      on localization abilities.

      Subjects with hearing impairment will comprise 20 adults with single sided deafness who
      consent to remediation with the BAHA.In order to see how the adults with unilateral hearing
      loss will differ from the normal-hearing subjects over time, a control group of 20
      normal-hearing individuals also will be evaluated over time, to see how closely the results
      of the unilateral deafness group approximate the results of the normal individuals.
