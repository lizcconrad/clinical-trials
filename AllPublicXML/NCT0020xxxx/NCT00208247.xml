      Background: The central feature of hypochondriasis is preoccupation or fear of having a
      serious disease based on misinterpretation of bodily signs. Psychotherapeutic treatments have
      developed with focus on different aspects of the condition. Several controlled trials have
      examined the effectiveness of different treatment strategies.

      Hypothesis: Hypochondriasis is accessible for treatment. Specific cognitive treatment focused
      on misinterpretation of bodily sensations is more effective than short-term non-specific
      psychodynamic psychotherapy.

      Method: Patients with hypochondriasis were randomisation to cognitive behavioural therapy
      (CBT), psychodynamic psychotherapy, or waiting list. Patients on waiting list were
      subsequently randomised to CBT or dynamic psychotherapy. The patients received six-teen
      sessions over a period of six month. Follow-up assessments were made six and twelve month
      after treatment.

    <description>Patients in the waiting-list group were asked to keep in touch with their GP, who had been informed of the trial in writing. The patients and their GPs were instructed not to begin any other treatment during the study period. After 6 months, the patients on the waiting list were re-evaluated for inclusion and exclusion criteria and, if they still met the criteria, re-randomized to CBT or STPP.</description>
