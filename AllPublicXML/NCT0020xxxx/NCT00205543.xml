      In this study we will examine whether suture repair of the palate, or roof of mouth, has any
      effect on results of palate surgery performed for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, or UPPP, is the most common surgical procedure performed for the
      treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. The procedure involves removal of redundant tissue from
      the lower palate (roof of mouth), including the uvula, and then suturing the cut edges of the
      remaining tissue together. However it is frequently noted by surgeons that sutures placed in
      the roof of the mouth do not stay intact. Also, in standard tonsillectomy, which involves
      removal of the tonsils and thus creation of a wound near the palate, no suturing is used,
      which does not seem to affect how the area heals. Previous studies have shown no significant
      differences in complication rates, post-operative pain, or symptom outcomes in patients
      undergoing tonsillectomy either with or without suture repair of the tonsillectomy wound. In
      this study we will examine whether suture repair following UPPP has any effect on
      post-operative pain, healing, or treatment success in terms of symptom resolution or
      post-operative sleep study results.
