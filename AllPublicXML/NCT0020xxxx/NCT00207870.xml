  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supracondylar fractures are the most common elbow fractures in children. In the current
      orthopedic literature crossed pinning and lateral-only entry techniques are co-gold standards
      of operative treatment. The crossed pinning technique has been shown to be biomechanically
      superior especially under torsional loading but has a higher incidence of iatrogenic injury
      to the ulnar nerve. All studies comparing these techniques to date have been either
      biomechanical or retrospective in nature. A randomized, controlled, prospective study
      comparing these two popular techniques has not been performed.

      The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate the amount of displacement incurred
      when treating type III supracondylar humerus fractures in children with crossed pinning
      versus lateral-entry only technique. Overall complication rate, loss of reduction, iatrogenic
      neurovascular injury, and pin tract infection rates between the two cohorts will be
      evaluated. The study population will comprise all patients less than ten years of age
      presenting to Scottish Rite Hospital during the study period with a type III supracondylar
      fracture managed by the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Orthopedic Group. All patients will
      be randomized to one specific treatment arm based on surgeon preference established at the
      onset of the study. The hypothesis to be tested is that no difference in amount of
      displacement or overall complication rate is present between these two techniques.
      Radiographic parameters measured pre-operatively, immediately post-operatively and four weeks
      post-operatively will be quantitatively evaluated and compared. Chart reviews to determine
      complications during the treatment period will be made. Pre-study power analysis and
      post-study statistical analysis will be performed.

      Pre-operative consent forms for study participation will be reviewed with all families at the
      time of the pre-operative visit. Screening will be performed at the time of evaluation in the
      emergency room. Patients will be assigned to a particular group based on the surgeon that
      performs their surgery. Each surgeon at the onset of the study will commit to one technique
      of operative management with the understanding that this technique may be abandoned by the
      surgeon in any case where it is felt to be inadequate. Changing technique will be considered
      a failure of the technique. Data regarding the treatment will be collected from the chart and
      x-rays at the time of treatment and at follow up visits in the orthopedic office.
