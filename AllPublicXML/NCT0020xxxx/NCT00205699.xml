  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of overweight and obesity, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are increasing in children. Increased adiposity and related
      reductions in insulin sensitivity are major risk factors for the development of
      hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, T2DM, and cardiovascular disease. Reductions in lifespan
      attributable to obesity impact younger individuals most measurably. Antipsychotic medications
      are extensively used in children, with certain agents producing greater increases in weight
      and adiposity than other commonly used drugs in this age group. Increased use of atypical
      antipsychotics in children has been stimulated by reported efficacy for behaviors such as
      aggression that can occur in a variety of disorders. However, no previous randomized clinical
      trial has sensitively quantified the metabolic effects of widely used atypical
      antipsychotics. This study would address clinically relevant questions concerning both the
      safety and efficacy of these agents in antipsychotic-naïve aggressive children with conduct
      disorder, with permitted co-morbidity for a variety of psychiatric conditions including
      attention deficit disorder, bipolar disorder, high functioning pervasive developmental
      disorder, autism and schizophrenia. The project aims to describe and compare the outcome of
      12 weeks of prospective, randomized treatment with olanzapine, risperidone or aripiprazole on
      insulin action in skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue, insulin secretion, abdominal fat
      mass, total body and fat-free mass, resting metabolic rates, efficacy for symptoms of
      aggression and non-metabolic adverse events. Children aged 6-18 will be studied, exploring
      effects of stimulant therapy and age-related differences in vulnerability to
      treatment-induced adverse metabolic changes. Aims are addressed by measuring glucose and
      lipid kinetics with stable isotope tracers, area-under-the-curve for post-load insulin and
      c-peptide during frequently sampled oral glucose tolerance tests, body composition with dual
      energy x-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), indirect calorimetry and
      standardized assessments of efficacy and adverse events. Treatment effects will primarily be
      analyzed using repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), controlling for baseline
      adiposity and other key risk variables. Relevant data are critically needed to target
      clinical therapy and basic research, identify medical risks, and guide regulatory decisions
      in this vulnerable population.

      The proposed randomized clinical trial aims to assess both the safety and efficacy of
      atypical antipsychotic agents in antipsychotic-naive aggressive children with various
      childhood psychiatric disorders during 12 weeks of prospective, randomized treatment with
      olanzapine (Zyprexa), risperidone (Risperdal) or aripiprazole (Abilify).

      Aim 1: To evaluate effects of selected antipsychotic treatments on insulin action in skeletal
      muscle (glucose disposal), liver (glucose production) and adipose tissue (lipolysis).

      Aim 2: To evaluate effects of selected antipsychotic treatments on insulin secretion.

      Aim 3: To evaluate effects of selected antipsychotic treatments on abdominal fat mass, total
      body fat and total fat-free mass.

      Aim 4: To evaluate effects of selected antipsychotic treatments on resting metabolic rates
      (carbohydrate and fat oxidation).

      Aim 5: To evaluate effects of selected antipsychotic treatments on efficacy for symptoms of
      aggression.

      Important secondary aims include the assessment of non-metabolic adverse events, and the
      assessment of each antipsychotic treatment condition in children with and without concomitant
      stimulant therapy. Reduced adverse metabolic effects are hypothesized during concomitant
      stimulant therapy. Children aged 7-18 will be studied, exploring age-related differences in
      vulnerability to treatment-induced adverse metabolic changes. Finally, treatment effects on
      regulatory hormones, including cortisol, glucagon, leptin, ghrelin and adiponectin will be
      explored. This will allow the assessment of possible confounds to the interpretation of the
      primary hypotheses. It will also permit the generation of additional hypotheses concerning
      mechanisms contributing to drug-induced changes in weight and fat mass. Relevant data on the
      primary and secondary aims are critically needed to assess the risks as well as benefits of
      clinical therapy in children, to identify needs for additional basic research, as well as to
      guide administrative and regulatory decision-making.

          -  Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) score ≤ 60

          -  Not previously treated with an antipsychotic; individual subjects with remote, brief
             prior antipsychotic exposure may be considered for enrollment by the PI on a case by
             case basis

          -  Patient assent and informed consent obtained from the parent or guardian

          -  No clinically significant (based on PI determination) changes in permitted medications
             (e.g., stimulants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) for
             approximately 1 month prior to Baseline evaluations

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active suicidality or primary dx of major depressive disorder

          -  Any lifetime use of antipsychotics or non-serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor

               -  endocrine disease, including type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus;

               -  coagulopathy;

             may themselves worsen or otherwise alter weight gain, glucose and lipid regulation or
             otherwise make it difficult to assess the effects of the antipsychotic alone; (note
             that exposure to many psychotropic agents including stimulants and SSRI's is permitted
