    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have a diagnosis of clinically definite MS with a relapsing disease
             course as determined by the Poser criteria

          2. Patients must be on high dose interferon therapy (Betaseron® 250 µg or Rebif® 44 µg)
             for at least 1 year prior to study entry

          3. Patients must have experienced at least one documented relapse during the past year
             prior to screening. Pseudo-relapses must be ruled out. A gadolinium enhancing lesion
             is not required.

          4. Patients must be ambulatory, with a Kurtzke EDSS score between 0-5 inclusive

          5. Patients must be between the ages of 18 and 50 years inclusive

          6. Women of childbearing potential must practice an acceptable method of birth control.
             Acceptable methods include oral contraceptive, contraceptive patch, long-acting
             injectable contraceptive, double-barrier method (condom or IUD with spermicide), or
             partner's vasectomy

          7. Patients must be relapse-free and off corticosteroids (IV or oral) for at least 30
             days prior to the screening visit

          8. Patients must be relapse-free and off corticosteroids between the screening and
             baseline visits

          9. Patients must be willing and able to give written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of experimental or investigational drugs, and/or participation in an
             investigational drug study within 6 months prior to study entry

          2. Previous treatment with glatiramer acetate (injectable)

          3. Previous treatment with immunomodulators (except IFNβ), immunosuppressive agents,
             IVIG, or plasma exchange in the 6 months prior to screening; previous treatment with
             cladribine in the past 2 years

          4. Previous total body irradiation or total lymphoid irradiation

          5. Chronic corticosteroid (IV, IM, and/or PO) treatment (more than 30 consecutive days)
             in the 6 months prior to study entry

          6. Pregnancy or breastfeeding

          7. Life-threatening or other clinically significant disease

          8. Any condition which the investigator feels may interfere with participation in the
             study, including alcohol and/or drug abuse

          9. A known sensitivity to gadolinium (gadolinium acid)

         10. A known history of sensitivity to mannitol

         11. Inability to successfully undergo MRI scanning
