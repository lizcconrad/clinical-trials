  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Does dilation of blood vessels (vasodilation), which decreases aortic stiffness, have a
      greater effect on heart myocardium relaxation (diastole) than vasodilation which affects mean
      pressure equally without improving aortic stiffness?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60 subjects, 30 with hypertension and 30 without will attend two visits to the GCRC. At each
      visit, pulsatile hemodynamics (by using tonometryâ€”a non-invasive means to obtain arterial
      pressure tracings) and Doppler tissue imaging relaxation velocity (a measurement of
      myocardial relaxation obtained by echocardiography) data will be collected before and after
      administration of vasodilator medication. At the first visit, each patient will receive an
      oral dose of the vasodilator hydralazine (does not effect aortic stiffness), and at the
      second visit each patient will receive intravenous nesiritide (does effect aortic stiffness).
      The relationship between timing of the reflected pulse wave and myocardial relaxation
      velocity will be studied at baseline and following administration of each vasodilator to
      determine if changing aortic stiffness has an impact on myocardial relaxation.
