  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to determine how FDG-PET can be incorporated into the
      assessment of the axilla in the staging and treatment of women with early stage breast
      cancer.

      A multicentre, prospective, diagnostic accuracy study will be conducted evaluating the
      ability of positronic emission tomography using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) to detect the
      presence or absence of axillary lymph node metastases in newly diagnosed breast cancer
      patients with no clinical evidence of spread of disease beyond the breast.

      Patients will have histologic confirmation of invasive breast cancer and will have a FDG-PET
      scan prior to axillary node assessment. All patients will have a sentinel node biopsy if any
      sentinel nodes can be located. Patients with a positive sentinel node will have an axillary
      node dissection. The results of the PET will be compared to the reference standard of
      histologic examination of all excised (sentinel and non-sentinel) axillary lymph nodes which
      will be referred to as axillary node assessment. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and
      negative predictive values for PET-FDG will be determined.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic diagnosis of invasive breast cancer,

          -  Resectable primary cancer.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The diagnosis of invasive breast cancer was made more than 3 months prior to
             registration,

          -  Patient and/or surgeon are not willing to proceed with a SNB or AND after the PET scan
             is completed,

          -  Patient and/or surgeon are not willing to proceed with a level I and II AND if the SNB
             is positive, if the PET scan shows increased uptake in the ipsilateral axilla, or if
             the surgeon is still gaining experience in the performance of SNB,

          -  SNB or AND has already been done,

          -  Chemotherapy has been given or will be given prior to PET scan or SNB or AND,

          -  Significant serious concurrent medical problems (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes),

          -  Patient is pregnant or lactating,

          -  Patient is unable to lie supine and with both arms above their heads for PET scan,

          -  Known hypersensitivity to FDG,

          -  Clinical evidence of regional nodal metastases (fixed, matted axillary nodes),

          -  Clinical evidence of distant metastases.
