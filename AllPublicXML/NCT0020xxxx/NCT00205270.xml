      Research Question: How do antibody and T cell responses following influenza vaccine compare
      among lung transplant patients, patients waiting for lung transplantation and healthy
      individuals?

      Experimental Design: This interventional parallel group study will compare influenza vaccine
      induced immune responses in three groups: lung transplant patients, individuals waiting for
      lung transplantation and healthy individuals.

      Current and Future Research Activities: Blood will be drawn for these measures of vaccine
      induced antibody response before and 2 to 4 weeks after immunization. Another blood draw will
      be obtained from up to 30 individuals from among the three groups for measures of T cell
      response to immunization. The third blood draw will be done during months 1 to 5 following
      influenza immunization. Genetic material (DNA) will be obtained from cells in the blood to
      look for genetic markers that may be associated with influenza vaccine response. Blood draws
      and immunization for the healthy participants will be done at the General Clinical Research
      Center (GCRC) or in the Clinical Research Facility in Rennebohm Hall. The blood draws for the
      pre-transplant and post-transplant patients will be coordinated with clinically indicated
      laboratory tests in order to avoid additional venipunctures. Influenza immunization is part
      of the routine clinical care of patients with lung disease, and only the immune response data
      will be considered part of the research study.
