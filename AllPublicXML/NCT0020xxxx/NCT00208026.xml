  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Netherton syndrome is a genetic condition that can result in abnormal skin functioning.
      People with this condition often have red and scaling skin; sparse or short hair; and
      problems with absorption of medicines or chemicals that are applied to the skin. If these
      chemicals are absorbed at a high level, they may cause health problems. Elidel (pimecrolimus)
      is a new medicine that is available as a cream. It has been shown to help improve the
      appearance of the skin in patients with another skin condition known as atopic dermatitis,
      and is approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration for use in children
      with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. The purpose of this study is to determine if Elidel
      is safe, to see whether the medication is absorbed through the skin, and to see if side
      effects are associated with its use in children with Netherton syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Netherton syndrome, a rare genodermatosis, manifest a chronic, eczematous
      dermatitis with erythema and scaling that is often recalcitrant to conventional therapy with
      emollients and topical corticosteroids. These patients display an altered epidermal barrier
      with increased permeability to topical agents and are therefore susceptible to evaporative
      transepidermal water loss and infection. Topical therapy with the calcineurin inhibitors
      tacrolimus and pimecrolimus has been demonstrated to improve the skin integrity and the
      quality of life of patients with several chronic dermatoses, including atopic dermatitis. As
      a result of the underlying skin barrier dysfunction, however, the possibility of significant
      systemic absorption and resultant side effects is a concern when these agents are used in
      patients with Netherton syndrome. Experience with topical tacrolimus 0.1% ointment for
      patients with Netherton syndrome has demonstrated both marked efficacy as well as significant
      systemic absorption of the drug in this patient population. Use of topical pimecrolimus in
      patients with Netherton syndrome has not been reported to date. Investigation of the extent
      of systemic absorption and side effects will help to define the safety and efficacy profile
      of topical pimecrolimus in patients with Netherton syndrome.

      <recruitment_details>This was an open-label,single-arm study to investigate the safety profile of topical pimecrolimus cream.
Patients meeting the criteria for diagnosis of Netherton Syndrome were enrolled over a period of 3 years, from September 2005 through March 2008. The study was conducted in my medical office within The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The eligibility was for male and female patients aged 2 to 18 years.They were required to have normal laboratory values within 3 months prior to enrollment. A 4 week washout period was required for systemic steroid, tacrolimus, immunosuppressives, phototherapy, and inhibitors of Cytochrome. 2 week washout for Isoenzyme,tacrolimus and pimecrolimus.</pre_assignment_details>
