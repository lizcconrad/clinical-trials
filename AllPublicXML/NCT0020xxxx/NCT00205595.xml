    <textblock>
      This is a study using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to study the normal distribution of
      the PET ligand (R)-[11C]PK11195. This ligand will be used to study inflammation in the brain
      in several brain disorders like Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain injury.

      At the University Hospital Vrije Universiteit the PET ligand PK11195 labeled with carbon-11,
      (R)-[11C]PK11195, will be used to study microglia activation in-vivo in patients with
      traumatic brain damage, Alzheimer disease, multiple sclerosis and neuritis optica, disorders
      with unknown pathophysiology and treatment difficulties.

      PK11195 (1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-1(1-methylpropyl)-3 isoquinolinecarboxamide) is a
      highly specific ligand for the peripheral benzodiazepine-binding site, which is particularly
      abundant on cells of the mononuclear macrophage line (Myers et al., 1991). In normal human
      brain, the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor ligand PK11195 exhibits low to minimal
      binding primarily associated with the choroid plexus, ependymal linings and glial cells.
      However, following neuronal damage, the cells involved in the ensuing gliosis, microglia,
      show a marked increase in expression of these sites (Stephenson et al., 1995;Conway et al.,
      1998).

      PK11195 labeled with carbon-11 is a PET ligand to peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors
      which has already been used in patients with stroke (Ramsay et al., 1992), Rasmussen's
      encephalitis (Banati et al., 1999), multiple sclerosis (Banati et al., 1997) and facial nerve
      lesions (Myers et al., 1999). However, no tracer kinetic model for quantification has been
      fully validated for(R)-[11C]PK11195. In order to use (R)-[11C]PK11195 for PET-imaging of
      microglia activation and to use it in the longitudinal monitoring of disease progression,
      baseline levels of ligand uptake in a healthy control population are required. This study
      aims to measure (R)-[11C]PK11195 uptake in normal brain in different age groups and to
      develop methods for quantification of specific binding of (R)-[11C]PK11195. Because
      (R)-[11C]PK11195 uptake depends on regional bloodflow, each (R)-[11C]PK11195 scan will be
      preceded by a cerebral bloodflow scan with H215O.

      OBJECTIVES

        -  Determine the distribution of (R)-[11C]PK11195 in normal brain

        -  Develop methods for quantification of specific binding of (R)-[11C]PK11195

        -  Determine the metabolic profile of (R)-[11C]PK11195 in healthy volunteers

      DESIGN OF THE STUDY Forty healthy subjects will be recruited, 20 males and 20 females. This
      is an open study. The study consists of one PET scan, which will be performed at the
      Department of Nuclear Medicine &amp; PET research of the VU University Medical Centre.
