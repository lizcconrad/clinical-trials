  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) is an examination similar to Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (MRI) which uses a magnetic field and a contrast medium when needed to visualize blood flow
      in the arterial vessels throughout the body.

      Gadodiamide, a contrast medium, is already approved and is used to image blood vessels by
      directly injecting it into the vein, but this procedure has not been formally tested to image
      the renal artery vessels using MR.

      The study is designed to determine the presence or absence of a relevant stenosis (ie greater
      than/equal to 50%) or occlusion in renal arteries. Intra-arterial Digital Subtraction
      Angiography will be used as the standard of truth.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Study Subjects must be adults with confirmed or suspected Renal Artery stenosis.

          -  The subject must have been referred for Digital Subtraction Angiography.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a known hypersensitivity to either conventional X-ray or
             gadolinium-based MR contrast media including, but not restricted to, the
             investigational product.

          -  The subject is lactating.

          -  The subject is pregnant as defined by a serum or urine β-HCG pregnancy test obtained
             within 24 hours before investigational product administration.

          -  The subject has received or is scheduled to receive MRI contrast medium within 24 h
             prior to or less than 24 hours after the investigational product administration.

          -  The subject has received or is scheduled to receive X-ray contrast medium within 7
             days prior to or less than 24 hours after administration of investigational product.

          -  The subject has received an investigational product within 30 days prior to or will
             receive an investigational product less than 24 hours after investigational product
             administration.

          -  The subject has an active, serious, life-threatening disease with a life expectancy of
             less than 6 months.

          -  The subject has had a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in the renal region
             performed within 4 weeks prior to investigational product administration.

          -  The subject has a stent in the renal arteries.

          -  The subject has had a kidney transplantation.

          -  The subject has a serum creatinine value of &gt;3.5 mg/dL (309.4 µmol/L).

          -  The subject has previously been included in this study.

          -  The subject has a contra-indication for MRI according to accepted clinical guidelines.
