  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will implement and test a brief, tailored individual-level intervention to be used
      in two New Orleans adolescent clinics with female patients aged 16-24 who douche.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study implements a client-centered behavioral intervention (CCBI) based on Prochaska’s
      Transtheoretical Model of Change (TMC) and the intervention will use Miller’s Motivational
      Interviewing (MI) techniques. This intervention will be evaluated using (1) an
      audio/computer-assisted self-administered interview (ACASI) survey to assess changes in
      respondents’ douching knowledge, attitudes, and practices, and (2) biological testing for
      Bacterial Vaginosis.
