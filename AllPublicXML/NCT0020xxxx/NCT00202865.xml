      This is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled study with two parallel
      treatment groups (placebo and infliximab) in subjects with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) to
      evaluate the efficacy of infliximab 3 mg/kg.

             receiving the last study agent infusion, and have a negative serum pregnancy test
             prior to enrollment. Additionally, male subjects who are sexually active, with women
             of childbearing potential, should ensure that they or their partners are using
             adequate contraception

             Screening.

          -  Have active disease, as evidenced by a BASDAI score of &gt;=4 at Baseline and at
             Screening

          -  Screening tests must meet the following criteria:

               -  Hemoglobin: &gt;=9.0 g/dL (5.6 mmol/L) for men and &gt;=8.5 g/dL (5.3 mmol/L) for women

               -  Serum transaminase levels must be within 3 times the ULN

               -  Serum creatinine &lt;=1.4 mg/dL (107umol/L).

          -  Are capable of reading and understanding subject assessment forms and providing
             written informed consent.

          -  Have had a documented negative reaction to a PPD skin test (PPD induration &lt; 5 mm)
             performed within 1 month prior to the first study infusion. If PPD negative, chest
             x-ray still required.

          -  Subjects must understand English or French.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have had a serious infection (eg, sepsis, hepatitis, abscesses, pneumonia, or
             pyelonephritis), have been hospitalized for an infection, or have been treated with
             intravenous (IV) antibiotics for an infection within 8 weeks prior to randomization.

             lymphoproliferative disease including lymphoma, have multiple sclerosis, or other
             central demyelinating disorder, or have congestive heart failure.

          -  Subjects with unstable doses of NSAIDS, DMARDs, analgesics or corticosteroids at
             Screening who will continue to receive these medications during the study.

          -  Subjects who are receiving &gt;10 mg of prednisone (or equivalent) daily.
