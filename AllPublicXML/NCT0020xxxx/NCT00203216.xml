  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study drug levetiracetam is FDA approved as an add-on medication in the treatment of
      partial onset seizures in adults with epilepsy. The trade name is Keppra®. This is an
      &quot;open-label&quot; trial, which means that all participating patients will receive active study
      drug.

      The Jefferson Headache Center has developed this clinical study to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of levetiracetam in preventing migraine headaches, with or without aura (visual
      disturbances).

      In addition, the study site will be performing a procedure called Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation (TMS). This procedure measures brain activity because it is thought that people
      with migraine experience periods of cortical hyperexcitability or over-activity in the brain.
      This information may help physicians in the future determine which preventive medications
      will work for which patients.

          <title>The Primary Outcome is Defined as Average Change in Frequency of Migraine Attacks Over Each 4-week Interval of the Treatment Period as Compared to the 4-week Baseline Period.</title>
          <description>Number of migraine attacks will be measured at baseline (28 day period prior to start of study medication). The baseline number of attacks will be compared to that in the following 28 day intervals:
visit_4 = first follow-up interval (0 to 28 days after starting study drug)
visit_5 = second follow-up interval (28 to 56 days)
visit_6 = third follow-up interval (56 to 84 days)
visit_7 = fourth follow-up interval (84 to 126 days) The change in headache attacks post-treatment will be averaged in a multiple regression model, looking at the following: visit number, age, gender, BMI</description>
