  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 10-week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial to
      investigate the effect of Cannabis Based Medicine Extract (Sativex) on patterns of brain
      activation associated with movement in 20 MS patients suffering from lower limb spasticity.
      Spasticity is a common symptom in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), occurring all over the course of
      the disease, particularly in the progressive phase.Physiologically, spasticity and
      hyperreflexia habitually seen in patients with pyramidal syndrome is due to lesions of other
      descending pathways, such as the cortico reticulospinal pathways, which participate in
      voluntary movements.It is now known that an endocannabinoid system acts in humans by at least
      two types of cannabinoids receptors, CB1 and CB2. There is evidence to support the view that
      the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-THC), and
      cannabinoids in general, can reduce muscle spasticity in people with MS. Aim of the study
      will be to evaluate the effect of Sativex on: (i) patterns of brain activation associated
      with movement (fMRI) in MS patients suffering from spasticity; (ii) changes in level of
      spasticity (H-reflex); (iii) changes in intracortical excitability and on synaptic
      intracortical network of the motor areas (double shock TMS).

      Baseline assessment will be followed by randomisation and dose introduction. Patients will be
      randomly assigned to two counterbalanced groups starting either with Sativex or with placebo
      as the first drug. They will be dispensed sufficient study medication for two weeks together
      with a diary. During the two-week treatment period all the patients will have to be reached
      the optimal, individualised dosage to subjectively relief spasticity.Patient will return
      after three weeks and they will undergo the fMRI and neurophysiological evaluations.Then
      patients will perform a two-week washout period and they will be requested to intake the
      alternative medicine. After two weeks patients will perform a second fMRI/neurophysiological
      study. Two weeks later, after a second washout period, a last visit will be performed to
      conclude the study.
