  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pivotal study is to determine if a new antimicrobial dressing,
      applied to the sternal incisions of cardiac surgical subjects, will demonstrate a decreased
      cumulative incidence rate(CI) of localized, superficial infections at the sternal incisional
      site as compared to the control group, regular, non-antimicrobial dressing.

          -  Be undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery with a median sternotomy.

          -  Be able to return to the study site, if needed, to have the sternal surgical incision
             site inspected.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Be participating concurrently in another clinical trial that involves an
             investigational drug or device that would interfere with this study.

          -  Subject is to receive another topical antimicrobial agent (i.e., Dermabond® Topical
             Skin Adhesive) other than the study dressing (as assigned by the randomization
             schedule).
