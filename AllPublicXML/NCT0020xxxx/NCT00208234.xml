    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Xolair can reduce the abnormal increase in
      limitation to airflow in patients with asthma in a relatively short time period. Another
      purpose is to determine if Xolair will decrease the amount of inflammation in the lungs of an
      asthmatic patient in the same time period.

      Xolair, a recombinant humanized monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, has been studied extensively
      and proven efficacious in the treatment of asthma and other allergic disorders. In moderate
      to severe allergic asthmatic patients, Xolair reduced asthma exacerbations and improved
      symptoms. However, there is limited data on the effects of Xolair on airway hyperreactivity,
      an important component of asthma.
