  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled study is conducted on patients with histological stage III colorectal
      cancer assigned to postoperative adjuvant therapy of uracil-tegafur plus leucovorin (UFT+LV),
      UFT+LV / UFT, or UFT+LV+PSK / UFT+PSK. The usefulness of the three regimens was evaluated by
      comparing the disease-free survival rate, overall survival rate, incidence and severity of
      adverse event, and quality of life.

      A multicenter randomized open-label controlled study is conducted on patients with
      histological stage III and curability A or B colorectal cancer [according to General Rules
      for Clinical and Pathological Studies on Cancer of the Colon, Rectum and Anus, 6th edition
      (Japanese Classification of Colorectal Cancer, English edition), also according to pTNM
      classification to facilitate overseas publication] given postoperative oral therapy of
      tegafur-uracil plus leucovorin (UFT+LV) (5 courses), UFT+LV (5 courses) / UFT (1 year), or
      UFT+LV+PSK (5 courses) / UFT+PSK (1 year). The usefulness of the three regimens as
      postoperative adjuvant therapy was evaluated by comparing the disease-free survival rate
      (DFR), overall survival rate (OS), incidence and severity of adverse event, and quality of
      life (QOL).
