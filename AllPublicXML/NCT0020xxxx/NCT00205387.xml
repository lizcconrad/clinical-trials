    <textblock>
      Cardiac elastography is a new technique to analyze strain and strain rates in many organ
      systems, including the heart. In this study, cardiac elastography derived from the analysis
      of raw radiofrequency data obtained from a conventional clinical echocardiograph system will
      be compared to processed information that comes from the same echocardiograph system. The
      purpose of this study is to determine if cardiac elastography can accurately determine strain
      and strain rates as compared to more conventional means.
