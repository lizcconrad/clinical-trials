      Hypotheses:

        1. Subjective self-reported data can be used to accurately reflect functioning across the 5
           key domains.

        2. Cancer and its various treatment modalities will exert detrimental effects on the 5 key
           domains in older adults with cancer.

        3. Some aspect of baseline patient characteristic will be predictive of cancer-related
           outcomes.
