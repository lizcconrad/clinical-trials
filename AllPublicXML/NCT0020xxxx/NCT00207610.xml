  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anemia is common among low-income women after they have given birth. Anemia, or low
      hemoglobin in the blood cells, is usually caused by not having enough iron. Blood cells
      usually carry oxygen to other parts of the body. Without enough hemoglobin, the ability of
      blood cells to carry oxygen is decreased. Memory and work may be impaired. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate three methods of giving iron to prevent anemia among low-income
      women after they have given birth.

      Currently the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations to prevent iron
      deficiency advocate selective screening and treatment of anemia at about 6 weeks postpartum.
      However, among some groups, such as low income women, data suggest that anemia and iron
      deficiency are common. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of three stategies to
      prevent iron deficiency among low income postpartum women in Mississippi.

      Comparisons: Clinics will be randomized to one of three strategies: 1)Selective anemia
      screening and treatment of anemic women, 2)universal anemia screening and treatment of anemic
      women, or 3)universal iron supplementation of 65 mg a day for three months.
