      TITLE: Aripiprazole effects on reward processing in deficit syndrome schizophrenia Principal
      Investigator: Erica Duncan, M.D.

      Background- This is a study of the way people with schizophrenia may feel when they get
      rewards. Certain parts of the brain play a part in people feeling happy when they win some
      sort of reward or have a good thing happen to them. Some people with schizophrenia may have
      trouble feeling pleasure because part of their brains, the frontal cortex, may not work
      properly. We are doing this study to understand how the frontal cortex works in people with
      and without schizophrenia when they are trying to win a reward. We will use a special kind of
      brain scan called Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to show the brain working in
      action. fMRI scanning uses a big magnet to take special pictures of the brain.

      A new medicine called aripiprazole has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for
      treating symptoms of schizophrenia. This medicine has a new mechanism of action that helps
      neural functioning in the part of the brain that is involved with planning and goal setting.
      We think this new medication may help with brain processing of rewards. We are therefore
      studying the brain with fMRI scans before and during treatment with this aripiprazole.

      Objective- The objective of this study is to determine whether subjects with negative
      symptoms of schizophrenia have abnormal functioning of brain circuits relevant to reward
      processing, and to determine whether any such abnormalities are normalized by treatment with
      aripiprazole.

      Research Plan-Aim 1. Define impairments in the neural correlates of reward processing in
      primary deficit syndrome schizophrenics compared to normal controls.

      Ten stable outpatients with primary deficit syndrome schizophrenia will be compared to ten
      normal controls in a BOLD contrast fMRI experiment constructed to assess in a parametric
      design the recruitment of reward circuitry in response to increasing monetary reward. We
      predict that frontal cortical areas important in reward processing such as the OFC and ACC
      will have reduced activation in the schizophrenic subjects.

      Aim 2. Assess the ability of aripiprazole to normalize reward circuit functioning in deficit
      syndrome schizophrenia, and correlate fMRI changes with clinical changes in negative
      symptoms.

      The ten schizophrenic subjects in Aim 1 will be switched from standard antipsychotic
      treatment to twelve weeks of open label aripiprazole and retested with the fMRI monetary
      reward task. We predict that twelve weeks of aripiprazole treatment will normalize the
      activation of OFC and ACC in response to monetary reward stimuli. We further predict that the
      degree of normalization in fMRI activation will correlate with negative symptom improvement
      on aripiprazole.

      Methods- Up to 25 volunteers with schizophrenia and 25 volunteers without a psychiatric
      disorder will participate in this study at the Atlanta VA Medical Center. Subjects will first
      be interviewed about their medical and psychiatric history, and any current symptoms they are
      having. They will receive an fMRI scan during which they will play a computer game that
      rewards correct responses with money. This fMRI session will allow for the assessment of
      which parts of the brain are functioning during rewarding conditions. The results will be
      compared for subjects with and without schizophrenia.

      The subjects with schizophrenia will have their antipsychotic medication tapered and switched
      to aripiprazole during a twelve week treatment phase. They will be seen at the end of Week 1,
      Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 10, and Week 12. At the last visit the fMRI scan will be
      repeated during the same reward task.

      Clinical Relevance- The inability to experience pleasure and the inability to pursue goals is
      an important symptom of schizophrenia. These symptoms probably play a huge role in preventing
      many people with schizophrenia from leading full and fulfilling lives. A central defect in
      reward processing pathways in the brain may account for these symptoms. If aripiprazole can
      be demonstrated to improve functioning in these brain pathways, this would greatly advance
      our understanding of schizophrenia and could bring greater functioning to patients with
      schizophrenia.

      ARIPIPRAZOLE EFFECTS ON REWARD PROCESSING IN DEFICIT SYNDROME SCHIZOPHRENIA

      Principal Investigator: Erica Duncan, MD

      Specific Aims

      The chronic negative symptoms of schizophrenia remain poorly responsive to
      psychopharmacologic treatment. The impaired motivation of primary deficit syndrome patients
      prevents them from pursuing social and occupational goals and prevents them from developing
      meaningful and productive lives. This proposal is based on the test of a hypothesis that
      schizophrenic patients with enduring deficit symptoms suffer from impairments in reward
      processing and the translation of perceived reward salience into goal-oriented behavior.
      Preclinical and clinical research has revealed the functioning of a distributed neural
      network in the processing of reward stimuli. Regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) such as
      orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are key frontal cortical
      elements of a neural circuit that mediates reward salience, reward expectation, and reward
      approach behavior. Aripiprazole, in virtue of its' activity as a dopamine (DA) partial
      agonist, is uniquely suited to enhance functioning of these frontal areas crucial to reward
      processing. We hypothesize that primary deficit syndrome schizophrenia is associated with
      functional deficits in reward circuitry detectable by fMRI scanning during a monetary reward
      task. We further hypothesize that treatment with aripiprazole will normalize reward circuit
      function in these subjects and thus contribute to improvements in negative symptoms. The
      following specific aims will test these hypotheses:

      Aim 1. Define impairments in the neural correlates of reward processing in primary deficit
      syndrome schizophrenics compared to normal controls.

      Ten stable outpatients with primary deficit syndrome schizophrenia will be compared to ten
      normal controls in a BOLD contrast fMRI experiment constructed to assess in a parametric
      design the recruitment of reward circuitry in response to increasing monetary reward. We
      predict that frontal cortical areas important in reward processing such as the OFC and ACC
      will have reduced activation in the schizophrenic subjects.

      Aim 2. Assess the ability of aripiprazole to normalize reward circuit functioning in deficit
      syndrome schizophrenia, and correlate fMRI changes with clinical changes in negative
      symptoms.

      The ten schizophrenic subjects in Aim 1 will be switched from standard antipsychotic
      treatment to twelve weeks of open label aripiprazole and retested with the fMRI monetary
      reward task. We predict that twelve weeks of aripiprazole treatment will normalize the
      activation of OFC and ACC in response to monetary reward stimuli. We further predict that the
      degree of normalization in fMRI activation will correlate with negative symptom improvement
      on aripiprazole.

      Background and Significance

      Negative Symptoms as a Deficit in Reward Processing Antipsychotic medications are often able
      to relieve the positive symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucinations, delusions, and
      disorganization. However the response of deficit symptoms to psychopharmacology remains
      disappointing. Many patients with minimal active psychotic symptoms are severely impaired in
      their functioning because of enduring deficit syndrome features.

      A key component of the deficit syndrome is a lack of motivation to pursue goals in
      educational, occupational, social, and recreational domains. This proposal rests on the
      hypothesis that a core feature of the amotivational component of the deficit state is a
      deficiency in reward processing. This deficiency in turn fails to provide sufficient
      stimulation of conditioning reinforcement of approach behavior serving the pursuit of
      rewards. In most patients the impairment is not so severe that the patients fail to pursue
      the primary rewards of food and drink. But motivation to pursue more complex secondary
      reinforcers such as economic success, stable loving relationships, avocations, intellectual
      fulfillment and other uniquely human goals are strikingly lacking in deficit syndrome
      patients.

      Frontal Cortical Hypofunction in Negative Symptoms Refinements in the DA hypothesis have
      emphasized an imbalance between mesocortical and subcortical/mesolimbic DA activity.
      Hyperactivity of the mesolimbic DA system has been implicated in the positive symptoms of the
      illness; hypofunctioning of the mesocortical DA pathway has been implicated in the
      pathophysiology of negative symptoms (Weinberger 1987; Davis et al.1991). The finding of
      neurophysiologic hypofunction of the frontal cortex during cognitive activation studies in
      schizophrenic subjects has given rise to the concept of hypofrontality (Weinberger et al.
      1986; Berman et al. 1986; for review see Weinberger et al. 1994). Furthermore, frontal
      hypofunction has been linked specifically to negative symptoms irrespective of the severity
      of positive symptoms in unmedicated schizophrenics (Wolkin et al. 1992).

      Neural Circuitry of Reward Processing Research into the neural correlates of reward
      processing indicates the importance of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons and distributed reward
      circuits to the coding of reward anticipation and salience, and the translation of motivation
      into approach behavior. Key structures that have been implicated in reward processing on the
      basis of animal studies include DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia
      nigra and their target areas such as the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), amygdala, and OFC (Wise
      1980; Wise and Hoffman 1992; Koob 1992; Robbins and Everitt 1996; see Schultz 2000, 2001 for
      review). Circuitry linking these areas is hypothesized to mediate several aspects of reward
      processing such as the detection of primary or secondary reward stimuli, prediction of
      expected future rewards, and the use of information to control goal-directed or motivated
      behavior (Schultz 2000). Recently developed methods are being used to study the reward
      pathways in normal humans and subjects with substance abuse disorders in the fMRI
      environment. These studies implicate the mesocorticolimbic DA system and functionally
      connected areas: OFC, ACC, dorsolateral PFC, amygdala, NAcc, and insula (Grant et al. 1996;
      Childress et al. 1999; Maas et al. 1998; Garavan et al. 2000; Kilts et al. 2001; Wexler et
      al. 2001). fMRI paradigms using money as a secondary reinforcer reveal activations in many of
      these same areas: amygdala, NAcc, ventral striatum, and areas of PFC (Thut et al. 1997;
      Elliott et al. 2000; Elliott et al. 2003). The fact that very similar areas are activated by
      primary reinforcer paradigms in animal studies, drug cue studies in substance abusers, and
      monetary reward paradigms in normal controls suggests that the study of monetary reward
      processing is a valid strategy to assess the integrity of reward circuitry in experimental
      paradigms.

      Overlap of Reward Circuitry and Areas Implicated in Negative Symptoms As indicated above,
      dopaminergic hypofunction in the PFC is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of
      negative symptoms. The presentation of reward or stimuli that predict reward stimulates the
      phasic activation of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain (Shultz 2000) that innervate the
      PFC. Hence there is a critical overlap of circuitry implicated in negative symptoms and
      circuitry that subserves reward processing. This overlap supports the use of reward paradigms
      to explore the functional integrity of mesocortical DA inputs and PFC function.

      Aripiprazole and Negative Symptoms The novel antipsychotic, aripiprazole, has a unique
      pharmacological mechanism of action that makes it potentially unique for the amelioration of
      negative symptoms. Aripiprazole is thought to increase DA activity in the PFC by virtue of
      its' activity as a partial agonist at post-synaptic DA2 receptors (Burris et al. 2002). We
      hypothesize that treatment with aripiprazole will normalize the function of PFC reward
      circuitry through increased DA functioning in frontal cortical regions (OFC, ACC) that
      subserve reward processing.

      Potential Importance of Proposal for Treatment Indications of Aripiprazole The severe
      impairment of motivated behavior in patients with deficit syndrome schizophrenia is strongly
      suggestive of an abnormality in the neural circuits that mediate reward processing and the
      translation of reward salience to motivated behavior. To date there are no published fMRI
      studies of the functioning of reward circuits in subjects with deficit syndrome
      schizophrenia. We hypothesize that negative symptom schizophrenics will exhibit impaired fMRI
      estimated activation of reward circuitry compared to normal controls, and that aripiprazole
      treatment will normalize functioning of this circuitry.

      The demonstration of improvements in negative symptoms in medication trials has been elusive.
      Even an agent capable of improving reward processing might not produce detectable decreases
      in rating scales designed to measure negative symptoms over the short term. This is because
      patients with chronic deficit states have compromised functioning due to the cumulative
      effects of social and occupational dysfunction. In patients such as these, the normalization
      of reward processing circuits by a medication such as aripiprazole would only be the first
      step. These patients are likely to require considerable psychosocial rehabilitation to recoup
      occupational and social functioning and achieve meaningful gains in negative symptom rating
      scales. However, normalization of reward circuitry function would strongly suggest that
      aripiprazole has potential to improve chronic negative symptoms when combined with a
      supporting rehabilitative program. Significant changes in reward circuit function would also
      strongly support the early intervention potential for aripiprazole to prevent chronic
      deterioration in function if first break patients were treated with this agent early in their
      course.

      Materials and Methods

      Subjects Ten male schizophrenic subjects ages 18-60 will be recruited. Diagnosis will be
      confirmed by structured diagnostic interview (SCID-I). Primary deficit syndrome will be
      confirmed by rating with the Schedule for the Deficit Syndrome (SDS), a scale that defines
      schizophrenic subjects according to whether they have chronic negative symptoms even across
      periods when positive symptoms are in remission (Kirkpatrick et al. 1989). This scale thus
      allows for the differentiation of those patients who have negative symptoms consistently
      across clinical states from those whose negative symptoms emerge when they are acutely
      psychotic and remit when positive symptoms remit. Additionally, subjects must have a minimum
      score of 30 on the SANS. Subjects will be excluded for clinically significant unstable
      medical illness, history of neurological disease including head trauma with loss of
      consciousness &gt;5 minutes, active substance abuse or dependence within the prior three months,
      any contraindication to fMRI, left handedness, mental retardation, color blindness,
      antipsychotic treatment resistance, or known allergy to or nonresponse to aripiprazole.
      Subjects with schizophrenia will be excluded if they do not have a working telephone.

      Ten male normal comparison subjects will recruited, matched in mean age and ethnicity to the
      schizophrenic group. Absence of psychopathology will be confirmed by SCID-I, NP version.
      Subjects will be excluded for clinically significant unstable medical illness, history of
      neurological disease including head trauma with loss of consciousness &gt;5 minutes, active
      substance abuse or dependence within the prior three months, any contraindication to fMRI,
      left handedness, color blindness, or mental retardation. Normal controls will be matched to
      schizophrenic subjects with regard to monthly income so that monetary rewards during the task
      will have comparable reinforcement value.

      Baseline Assessment Prior to fMRI scanning all subjects will be assessed for smoking status
      by means of the Fagerstrom Smoking Tolerance Questionnaire (Fagerstrom 1978) and nicotine
      dependent subjects will be instructed to smoke their usual amount prior to reporting for
      scanning. Screening for intact vision (≥ 20/25 uncorrected or corrected with eyeglasses or
      contact lenses) by means an eye chart will be conducted. Cognitive status will be assessed in
      the following domains: attention (Continuous Performance Test), psychomotor reaction time
      (finger tapping test), memory (California Verbal Learning Test), IQ (Weschler Abbreviated
      Scale of Intelligence, vocabulary and matrices subtests), and executive function (Stroop
      Task). The schizophrenic subjects will be rated for severity of psychopathology by means of
      the PANSS, Abrams and Taylor Rating Scale for Emotional Blunting (A&amp;T), SANS, Clinical Global
      Impression Scale (CGI), and the Quality of Life Scale. Current side effects to antipsychotics
      will be assessed by means of the Barnes Akathisia Scale and the Simpson Angus Scale.
      Schizophrenic subjects will have 30cc of blood drawn for CBC and SMA-12 to ensure stable
      baseline medical status prior to switching to aripiprazole.

      Cognitive Task Meaningful comparisons of schizophrenic and non-schizophrenic subjects by a
      cognitive task necessitates the use of a simple task to minimize confounds related to group
      differences in cognitive ability. A parametric manipulation of reward contingency will
      control for group differences in task performance. The proposed monetary incentive task,
      adapted from that of Elliott et al. (2003), is chosen because of its simplicity and
      parametric design. The subjects will be given a simple target detection task in which they
      will be instructed to squeeze a response bulb when they see a red or blue square. Different
      colored squares will be presented on a screen for 1.3 sec each. When they correctly signal
      the target stimuli they will see a reward stimulus informing them of how much money they have
      won on that trial. For trials with non-targets (paying no reward if the subject squeezes the
      bulb) the subjects will see a neutral text telling them to wait. The reward amounts will vary
      from 5¢ to $1 per trial (5¢, 25¢, 50¢, 75¢, or $1). The task will be divided into five blocks
      separated by 30 sec rest periods. Each block will contain 40 trials. Trial types will be
      presented in randomized order within each block: 30% of trials will contain one of the two
      target stimuli. Each block will pay correct responses at one of the five monetary reward
      levels. The task is designed specifically to allow for both an &quot;on-off&quot; assessment of
      activations in the presence or absence of reward, but also for a parametric analysis of brain
      areas that increase their activation with increased reward levels. The subjects will be told
      that their payment for participation in the fMRI scan will be the total money they accumulate
      by correct responses during the task. This latter point is important in that the money won
      during task performance has a real world salience more likely to enhance reward-related
      activations than if all subjects automatically were paid the same amount regardless of their
      accuracy. Thus the subjects receive actual rather than simulated reward.

      fMRI Scanning Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI scanning will be performed on a
      research dedicated Siemens 3T whole body MRI scanner located in the Emory Hospital MRI
      Center. Foam padding will be used to restrict the subjects' head motion within the magnet. 30
      axial slices of 3 mm thickness will be acquired parallel to the AC-PC line with a matrix size
      of 64 x 64 over a field of view of 22 x 22 cm, using a TE of 30 msec. With this protocol we
      have successfully imaged the orbitofrontal cortex with minimal magnetic susceptibility
      artifacts. The functional images will be obtained using a T2* weighted spiral-scan pulse
      sequence (TR 3000 msec, TE 25 msec, flip angle 60 deg). High resolution anatomical
      T1-weighted MR images will be acquired for localization of task-related neural activations
      (TR =10 msec, TE = 4.5 msec, TI=900 msec, FOV=24 cm, 256 x 256 matrix, contiguous 3 mm slices
      covering the whole brain).

      Aripiprazole Treatment After receiving the first scan, the schizophrenic subjects will be
      started on open label aripiprazole 15 mg po qd. Over the subsequent six weeks they will be
      titrated to a target dose of 30 mg po qd and maintained on this dose for the next six weeks.
      The aripiprazole titration schedule will be as follows: 15 mg Weeks 1-2, 20 mg Weeks 3-6, and
      then 30 mg. During the first six weeks of the treatment phase their prior antipsychotic will
      be gradually tapered down (75% of total daily dose in Week 1 and 2, 50% of total daily dose
      in Weeks 3 and 4, 25% of total daily dose in Week 5 and 6) and then discontinued.

      The subjects will be brought in for study visits at the end of Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week
      6, and Week 8, Week 10, and Week 12. At each study visit they will be rated with the PANSS,
      SANS, CGI, and A&amp;T. Extrapyramidal side effects and akathisia will be rated with the Simpson
      Angus Scale and the Barnes Akathisia Scale respectively. The Quality of Life Scale, the CVLT,
      CPT, and Stroop Test will be repeated at the end of Week 12.

      Stopping Rules for Subjects with Schizophrenia There is a risk of symptom exacerbation when
      antipsychotic medication is switched. For this reason, several safeguards will be put into
      place.

        1. Subjects will be excluded if they have a history of suicidal, or assaultive behavior
           during psychotic decompensations.

        2. The subjects will be given a cross-titration whereby their prior antipsychotic
           medication is gradually tapered over six weeks while aripiprazole is being titrated to
           maximum dose.

        3. Subjects in the schizophrenia group will be closely monitored during the treatment
           phase. They will be given reminder calls the day before each study visit. If they do not
           come for a scheduled visit, the study staff will call and reschedule for the soonest day
           they can come in. Subjects without a working telephone will be excluded.

        4. At each visit subjects will be rated with the CGI. If the CGI Global Improvement Scale
           is rated 6 (Much Worse) or 7 (Very Much Worse) at any visit, they will be dropped from
           the study and their previous antipsychotic will be resumed at the dose prior to
           enrollment.

      fMRI Image Analysis Imaging data will be analyzed by means of MATLAB and statistical
      parametric mapping software (SPM99). The images will be resliced and corrected for motion by
      registration to the first functional image acquired for each subject using a 6 parameter
      transformation (Friston et al 1995). Images will be spatially normalized to a Montreal
      Neurological Institute template. A high-pass filter will be used to remove low frequency
      noise. Image smoothing using a 6 mm Gaussian kernel will be used to enhance signal-to-noise
      ratios and accommodate differences in neuroanatomy to facilitate group comparisons. The
      delayed cerebral blood flow response to activation conditions will be modeled using the
      standard hemodynamic response function. Statistical analysis will proceed using a random
      effects model to examine outcomes of the parametric design of the experiment (Buchel et al.
      1998). We will model both linear and nonlinear hemodynamic responses in regions of interest:
      Nacc, amygdala, striatum, thalamus, OFC, ACC, and hippocampus.

      Analysis of Behavioral Data For Aim 1, cognitive data will be analyzed with a between
      subjects MANOVA to compare neurocognitive results between schizophrenics and normal controls.
      For Aim 2, behavioral rating scale data and repeated cognitive test scores (for CVLT, Stroop
      Test, CPT) will be analyzed with a repeated measures MANOVA model using timepoint as a within
      subjects factor.

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is less than or equal to 60 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Although the study was planned as a repeated measures study with fMRI testing at baseline and after 3 months, difficulty with recruitment and technical difficulties with obtaining fMRI data relegated the study to a single baseline timepoint.</limitations_and_caveats>
