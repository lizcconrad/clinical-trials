      The clinical trial will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with patients being
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio into groups A and B, respectively:

      Group A: TRP01 1g b.i.d. for 26 weeks

      Group B: placebo capsules b.i.d. for 26 weeks

      After the initial screening, clinic visits will take place at 0, 13 and 26 weeks. The
      blinding will be maintained until all patients have completed the 26-week trial. Any patients
      wishing to continue taking the medication upon completion of the trial will be provided a
      prescription for the drug and may purchase it at their own expense.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be selected in order to fulfill both of the following definitions:

          -  Dementia according to DSM-IV criteria :

               -  development of multiple cognitive deficits manifested by both memory impairment
                  and one or more of the following cognitive disturbances: aphasia, apraxia,
                  agnosia, disturbance in executive functioning

               -  the above-mentioned deficits cause significant impairment in social or
                  occupational functioning

               -  they do not occur exclusively during the course of delirium

          -  Dementia according to communicative disorders and stroke criteria (NINCDS-ADRDA)

               -  dementia established clinically and documented by a Folstein Mini-Mental State
                  Examination (MMSE)

               -  deficits in two or more areas of cognition

               -  progressive worsening of memory and other cognitive functions

               -  no disturbance of consciousness

               -  absence of systematic disorders or other brain diseases that in and of themselves
                  can account for progressive deficit in memory and cognition

        Furthermore, patients must fulfill the following criteria:

          -  men, or postmenopausal or surgically sterilized women

          -  with severity of dementia of mild to moderate degree as reflected by a score of
             greater than 14 but less than 26 on the MMSE

          -  with a minimum one-year duration of the symptomatology (progressive worsening of
             memory and other cognitive functions)

          -  living at home or in an institution provided that they have reliable caregivers

          -  able to perform the required psychometric tests and evaluations. Visual and auditory
             acuity (with glasses or hearing aid if required) must be sufficient to complete the
             protocol-specified procedures.

          -  Clinical laboratory battery (see section 7.2.2) must yield results within normal
             limits or determined as not clinically significant by the study physician for the
             patient’s sex and age

          -  Patients and their substitute decision-makers must have signed the written informed
             consent form

             findings:

               -  Vascular dementia, as evidenced by Modified Hachinski Ischemia Scale

               -  Depressive pseudementia, as evidenced by cognitive disturbances concomitant to a
                  major depressive episode according to DSM-IV and/or a history of more than one
                  major depressive episode
