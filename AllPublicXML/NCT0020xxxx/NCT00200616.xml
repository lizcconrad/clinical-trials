  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, prospective, multicenter study in order to assess the usefulness of antimicrobial
      prophylaxis in children with isolated vesico-ureteral reflux (grade III or less).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A voiding cystourethrogram was performed for each child less than 3 years old with a first
      urinary tract infection. In case of vesico-ureteral reflux, a randomization was done between
      continuous antimicrobial prophylaxis with low dose of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and no
      antibioprophylaxis. Duration of follow up was 18 months.
