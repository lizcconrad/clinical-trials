  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether physicians can make more informed treatment,
      admission, and discharge decisions related to patient care by having serial Triage® BNP test
      results available to assess disease severity, while patients are being treated for HF in the
      Emergency Department and/or during their admission. This is believed to lead to a better
      outcome as well as more efficient and cost-effective treatment.

      This is a patient-randomized clinical study consisting of patients who present to the ED
      requiring treatment and/or admission for HF. At each site, patients will be randomized into
      either a control arm or an experimental arm. Serial blood samples will be collected from all
      patients throughout their stay in the ED and the hospital. In the experimental arm, the
      Triage® BNP test will be performed on all blood samples collected and each BNP result will be
      made available to the attending physicians immediately. In the control arm, blood samples
      will not be analyzed on-site for BNP but instead sent directly to Biosite Inc. for testing.A
      comparison will be made between the control and experimental arms of the study to determine
      if there are any significant differences in length of stay, re-hospitalizations, all cause
      mortality, BNP levels, quality of life, and costs to treat patients.
