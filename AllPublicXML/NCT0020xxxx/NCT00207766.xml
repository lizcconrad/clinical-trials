      A study of infliximab in patients with Fistulizing Crohn's Disease

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a medical research study for patients with Crohn's disease who have one or more
      draining enterocutaneous fistula (fistula from the bowel to the skin). Fistulas are a common
      complication of Crohn's disease. Fistulas rarely close spontaneously but they may get better
      with treatment of the underlying Crohn's disease. This study will investigate the safety and
      efficacy of maintenance dosing of an anti-TNF (anti-tumor necrosis factor) antibody (a
      protein), called infliximab, compared to a placebo (inactive substance) in providing
      sustained reductions in the number of draining fistulas.

      Subjects will receive infliximab at weeks 0, 2 and 6 followed by infusions of infliximab 5
      mg/kg or placebo at weeks 14 and every 8 weeks until week 46. Patients who lose response are
      eligible for increasing treatment by 5 mg/kg of infliximab.
