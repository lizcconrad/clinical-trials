      A.OVERVIEW

      This is a 26 week study examining the ability of paroxetine (Paxil) to prevent the
      development of depression and neurotoxicity in patients receiving either 3 million units of
      subcutaneous IFN(interferon-alpha-2b) 3 times/week (plus ribavirin, 1000-1200 mg/d)) or PEG
      (polyethylene glycol) interferon-alpha-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg one time a week) and ribavirin
      (800 to 1,400 mg a day) for chronic hepatitis C (CHC). The IFN plasma half life (t1/2 of 24
      to 34 hours) of PEG, a CHC treatment recently approved by the FDA, is significantly prolonged
      allowing for once a week dosing. Studies indicate that the side effect profile of the two
      forms of IFN-alpha treatment are very similar. CHC patients will be screened for study
      eligibility, and a total of 100 CHC patients between the ages of 18 and 65 years old will be
      enrolled across three sites (30 at Emory site and a combination of 30 from the University of
      Pennsylvania, Rush-Presbyterian-Saint Lukes Medical Center in Chicago and Montefiore Medical
      Center in New York.) Two weeks prior to treatment with subcutaneous IFN-alpha-2b, patients
      who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be stratified on the basis of a history of
      major depression and then randomly assigned to paroxetine or placebo in double blind fashion.
