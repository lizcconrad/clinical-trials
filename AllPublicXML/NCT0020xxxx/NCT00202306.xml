  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the neuroprotective properties of low-dose lithium in young
      individuals at ultra-high risk of developping a first psychotic episode. Fourty individuals
      having some symptoms of an emerging psychotic disorders (without meeting the threshold for a
      full-blown mental illness) will be treated with a low dose of lithium (about a third of the
      dose that is usually used to treat acute mania). We will assess the progression of the
      conditions of these individuals on a montly bases for a year. We will do behavioural,
      cognitive and imaging assessments prior start of the treatment, after three months and one
      year. We hope to demonstrate that low dose lithium will stop or even reverse the progression
      of disease. We expect that behavioral, cognitive and in vivo brain imaging parameters in
      those individuals treated with low dose lithium improve, compared to the monitoring group.

      To investigate whether low-dose lithium is an effective agent in indicated prevention amongst
      subjects at ultra-high risk of developing a psychotic disorder. This aim will be achieved by
      treating a high-risk patient population with low-dose lithium (450mg/day) and investigating
      its effects using clinical, neuropsychological, neuroimaging and cell biological approaches.
      We will recruit 30 patients considered to be at ultra-high risk of developing a first
      psychotic episode, currently receiving treatment at the Personal Assessment and Crisis
      Evaluation (PACE) clinic in Melbourne, Australia. PACE criteria for identifying patients at
      high risk include subjects with a family history of psychosis and a decrease in functioning
      (30% GAF) AND/OR attenuated psychotic symptoms AND/OR brief psychotic symptoms (BLIPS)
      resolving without treatment. Patients who give informed consent will receive treatment with a
      slow release form of low dose lithium for a period of a year, plus supportive therapy.
      Patients who do not consent will receive supportive therapy only. Assessments will be
      conducted at baseline, twelve weeks and one year post-recruitment. Assessments will include
      cognitive functioning, structural MRI, 1H-MRS at 3Tesla and cell biological parameters
      (bcl-2, AP-1; NIMH, Washington DC). In addition, all patients will be seen on a monthly basis
      for a clinical interview, covering psychopathology, global functioning, and quality of life.
