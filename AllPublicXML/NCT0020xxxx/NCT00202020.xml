  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design is subject to relevant SFDA regulations about clinical trials. This
      indication was approved in Japan in 2003.

      From the end of May 2004 to the end of Dec. 2004, 720 patients with previous cerebral
      infarction(see the inclusion criteria) were enrolled in to the study and received one of the
      two treatment regimens, Cilostazol or Aspirin, the ratio of patient number of each group is
      1:1. For each patient, the chance of entering either of these two groups is the same. The
      treatment will continue till the end of 2005. During the treatment period, patients will be
      observed concerning some certain events, mainly reoccurrence of stroke. If the patient
      experiences reoccurrence of stroke, or other event that the doctors think it is not
      appropriate to continue the study medication, this patient would stop the treatment. Patients
      were also required to take MRI head scan before entering the study and on completion of the
      treatment.
