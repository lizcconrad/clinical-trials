  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients who did not respond (did not lose virus during
      treatment) or relapsed (virus went away on treatment but came back after treatment was
      stopped) after treatment with at least twelve weeks of a pegylated (long-acting) interferon
      and ribavirin will be considered for this study. There are two purposes to this study: first,
      to determine how rosiglitazone, a medicine used to treat diabetes, affects the HCV viral
      load; and second, to determine if treatment of insulin resistance with rosiglitazone prior to
      therapy for HCV will improve sustained virologic response (loss of virus that continues
      beyond six months after completion of HCV therapy) to HCV therapy.

      This study will demonstrate the efficacy of treating insulin resistance with rosiglitazone in
      CHC, genotype 1 patients who have failed previous treatment with pegylated interferon and
      ribavirin. Pre-treatment with rosiglitazone may become the new standard of care prior to HCV
      therapy for those patients who are insulin resistant, increasing their chance for achieving
      an SVR on interferon alfacon-1 combination therapy and decreasing the morbidity and mortality
      associated with chronic hepatitis C.
