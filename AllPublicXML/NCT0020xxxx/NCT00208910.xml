  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel procedure for generalized anxiety disorder where an odorant cue is paired with the
      state of deep relaxation during training. It is hypothesized that by smelling the odor in an
      anxiety-provoking situation, the patient will more easily invoke a state of relaxation,
      providing greater relief from the distressing tension and worry that characterize GAD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that by presenting a novel odor to a patient in a state of deep relaxation,
      the odor will serve as a conditioned inhibitory stimulus, or safety signal, in
      anxiety-provoking situations. With the odor serving as a contextual cue for the state of
      relaxation.
