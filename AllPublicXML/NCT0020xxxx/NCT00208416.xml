    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the short-term outcomes of two surgical techniques,
      minimally invasive and conventional, when used in the treatment of patients with hip joint
      disease requiring a total hip replacement. Patients who enter the study will be randomly
      allocated to undergo surgery using the minimally invasive or conventional surgical technique
      and will be evaluated at regular intervals following hip surgery using patient, clinical and
      x-ray assessments with a focus on short term rehabilitation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        i) Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have an existing condition that would

        discharge beyond that required for their hip replacement surgery.

        ii) Women who are pregnant.

        iii) Subjects who are known drug or alcohol abusers or with psychological disorders that
        could effect follow-up care or treatment outcomes.

        the last 6 month(s).

        v) Subjects who are currently involved in any injury litigation claims.

        vi) Subjects with a Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 30.

        migration.

        viii) Subjects requiring a simultaneous bilateral total hip arthroplasty.

        ix) Subjects undergoing the second stage of a staged bilateral who are less than 9 months
        post-arthroplasty
