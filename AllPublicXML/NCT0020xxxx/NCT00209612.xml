  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase I/II study is conducted to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT), and efficacy of a combination chemotherapy using CPT-11 and Paclitaxel in
      pre-treated patients with metastatic gastric cancer. The usefulness of the this regimen is
      evaluated by response rate, median survival time, and progression free survival.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pre-treated measurable metastatic gastric cancer were included in this trial.
      Patients received this combination chemotherapy repeated every 28 days until progression
      disease. Starting dose (dose level 1) were CPT-11 80 mg/m2 on day 1 and 15, Paclitaxel 60
      mg/m2 on day 1 and 15. DLT was defined as follows (according to NCI-CTC version 2.0); Grade 4
      neutropenia, thrombocytopenia(≥25000), Grade 3 neutropenia accompanied fever (&gt;38℃) , and
      Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity (except for nausea, vomit, appetite loss , general
      fatigue, alopecia). Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD) is determined when the incidence of critical
      toxicity exceeds 50% at a certain dose level. Response rate will be calculated according to
      RECIST criteria.
