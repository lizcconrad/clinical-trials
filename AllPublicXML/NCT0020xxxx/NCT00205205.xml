  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A peer mentoring program for persons with SCI was developed. Individuals who experienced SCI
      in the past and have adapted well functionally were asked to serve as mentors for individuals
      with newly-acquired SCI. These individuals undergo volunteer and peer mentoring training
      prior to mentoring activities. They are a subset of the study participants. We are tracking
      their satisfaction with life, positive and negative affect, life adjustment, depression, and
      social support over time. We hypothesize that measures of adjustment will become more
      positive as involvement as a mentor increases. The second subset of study participants are
      the individuals with newly-acquired SCI. They complete a baseline assessment of the measures
      listed above and then at 6 months, one year, and two years after match with a mentor. We also
      collect information about the quantity and quality of the mentoring sessions from both the
      mentor and mentee. We hypothesize that the mentee's adjustment will be positively influenced
      by the number and quality of the mentoring sessions. Due to the relatively small number of
      SCI per year in our program, we opted to offer the mentoring program to all individuals with
      newly acquired SCI, thus there is no control group.
