  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a previous study, we found that acupuncture may decrease fatigue. The aim of this study is
      to determine whether acupuncture is helpful in reducing fatigue in cancer patients treated
      with chemotherapy. We will also study how fatigue, quality of life, mood, level of physical
      activity. This study will involve about 88 patients.

      Primary objective:

      To determine whether acupuncture reduces chronic fatigue after chemotherapy more effectively
      than placebo

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To examine the long-term effects of acupuncture treatment on fatigue

        2. To examine predictors of response to acupuncture treatment in terms of baseline
           symptoms, hemoglobin, age, sex, time since chemotherapy and concurrent treatment

        3. To examine the effect of acupuncture on levels of physical activity and quality of life.

    <description>Acupuncture once weekly for six weeks Brief Fatigue Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment scale. Patients will repeat the BFI and FACT-G at seven and eight weeks after randomization, approximately one and two weeks after their final treatment. HADS will be repeated at week seven. At the end of the study, patients will be asked to state whether they were thought they on true or placebo acupuncture and why.
On the day of the final session of acupuncture treatment (approximately day 35), blood samples will be collected and tested for hemoglobin, thyroid function tests, as described in pretreatment evaluation. The results will be designated &quot;posttreatment&quot; values. Actigraphic monitoring will be conducted in week seven. Patients will be asked to wear the device for seven days just like during baseline evaluation.</description>

    <description>During the placebo phase, placebo acupuncture needles (68) will be applied a few mm away from the points. The placebo acupuncture needle is a blunt tipped needle that moves up inside its handle. However, the needle does not penetrate the skin and instead moves upward inside the handle. Needles will be applied after sterile swabbing of the skin and kept in place for 20 minutes in both group.Patients in the placebo group will be offered true acupuncture after receipt of the week seven and eight fatigue diaries.
Patients will complete the BFI, HADS and FACT-G at baseline, approximately two weeks before randomization and their first treatment. The BFI and FACT-G will be repeated after seven days, that is, one week before randomization. The use of repeat measurement decreases intrapatient variability and hence increases the precision of the baseline measure.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients age 18 - 64 diagnosed with a malignancy (solid tumor or hematologic
             malignancy). We are excluding children primarily because fatigue in children is
             assessed differently from adults (56). Moreover, as children constitute only about 5%
             of the cancer population and as post-chemotherapy fatigue appears to be relatively
             rare in children (57), we would expect little if any accrual from the pediatric
             population. Patients aged 65 and over are excluded for likely non-response, as
             described under preliminary data.

          -  Patients must have received chemotherapy

          -  Patients must complain of fatigue following chemotherapy but not prior to chemotherapy

          -  At least 60 days must have elapsed between the last chemotherapy infusion and
             completion of the first baseline questionnaire. Acute chemotherapy related fatigue
             typically lasts two to three weeks at most (58). Patients with fatigue at 60 days can
             therefore be considered to be chronic cases.

          -  Mean baseline fatigue as measured by the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) must be four or
             above. A score of four on the BFI is considered the threshold between &quot;mild&quot; and
             &quot;moderate&quot; symptoms (18).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anemia, defined as Hb&lt;9 or active treatment for anemia. Iron supplementation is
             allowed as long as the dose has been stable for at least six weeks. Anemia is excluded
             as a major treatable cause of fatigue.

          -  Platelets less than 50,000/microliter or an Absolute Neutrophil Count less than
             1,000/microliter. Patients with low platelets or neutrophils are at the risk of
             bleeding or infection, respectively.

          -  Baseline depression score on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale of 11 or above,
             indicating clinical depression. Patients excluded for depression will be referred for
             appropriate psychiatric evaluation. Depression is excluded as a treatable cause of
             fatigue.

          -  Thyroid disorder, defined as either thyroid stimulating hormone or free T4 out of
             normal range, is excluded as it is a possible cause of fatigue unrelated to cancer
             therapy.

          -  Surgery under general anesthesia; immunotherapy; radiotherapy; or initiation of
             hormonal therapy within the three weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Acupuncture in the previous six weeks.

          -  Change in use of any of the following drugs in the prior three weeks: opiates,
             anti-depressants (other than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) /
             anxiolytics; OR change in use of SSRIs in the prior six weeks. &quot;Change in use&quot; is
             defined as initiation or cessation of treatment, or change in prescribed dose or
             regimen: changes in actual amounts of PRN medication taken are allowed.
