  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of traditional Chinese herbal medicine and various forms of alternative medicine to
      maintain health among the Chinese ethnic group has had a long history and has been deeply
      rooted in the Chinese way of living for centuries. It has been a general belief that these
      therapies consist of “natural” substances and are less toxic than their western synthetic
      drug counterparts. However, recent reports of side effects of systemic traditional Chinese
      medicine, including hypersensitivity, hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, cardiovascular toxicity,
      renal failure, and contact dermatitis, have been increasing.

      Since there is a high prevalence in the usage of traditional Chinese herbal medicine in
      Taiwan, this study examines the frequency of patients using herbal medicine whose initial
      diagnosis in the emergency department (ED) is acute non viral hepatitis. We, the researchers
      at National Taiwan University Hospital, then correlate if the cause of hepatitis is related
      to the use of these herbal drugs by taking a detailed history of medication or herbs used and
      by verifying the contents by chemical analysis of the “medications” used. To our knowledge,
      this is the first study in examining the relationship between non viral hepatitis and the use
      of herbal drugs prior to arriving at the ED. We expect to prove adverse effects of these
      substances, especially hepatitis, is the cause for requiring emergency care.

      Our study design is a prospective, density sampling case control study in which one hundred
      patients with non viral hepatitis will be recruited as our case. We use a questionnaire
      designed by the investigator in the survey of demographic background, education, and income
      status of the cases, as well as the frequency of use of the drug, total dosage used, where
      the drug was purchased, what the drug is used for, and whether they know of any adverse
      effect that the drug might have. If they had taken the drug within three months prior to this
      emergency visit, then they are asked to bring the drug in for examination. Examination of the
      drug includes the use of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and if necessary,
      inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP mass). In contrast, our control group
      consists of subjects that are admitted to the ED due to trauma or fracture. For each case,
      they are matched with two subjects in the control group in both gender and age. They should
      also arrive within two days after the arrival of the case. All cases and controls are
      screened for viral hepatitis and serology must be negative before entering the study. The
      questionnaire is given to both groups. If more than one control is eligible to enter the
      study, then the control is chosen by a random draw in a hat. After this use of density
      sampling, we collect the data and logistic regression is used for analysis.
