  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While there are a variety of arthritis education materials available, the evidence-base on
      most of them is slim, so it i impossible to know what benefits they may have for the people
      who participate. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of the
      mail-delivered self-management education program, Arthritis Basics for Change (ABCS) with an
      emphasis on changes in knowledge, beliefs, behavior, self efficacy and health outcomes, and
      to evaluate the appropriateness, usefulness, and readibility of the program. This project
      will assist CDC's Arthritis Program in determining the usefulness of the ABCs program for
      helping people with arthritis improve their quality of life.
