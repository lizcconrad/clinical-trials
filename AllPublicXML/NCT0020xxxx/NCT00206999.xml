  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We wanted to compare the relation of two different psychophysiological paradigms (PrePulse
      Inhibition of the startle response = PPI and P50 suppression) to each other. Additionally, we
      wanted to test the effect of the combined serotonin- and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor,
      imipramine, on these measures. The primary hypothesis was that PPI and P50 gating would not
      correlate with each other at baseline. The secondary hypothesis was that increased
      noradrenergic and serotonergic activity would disrupt PPI as well as P50 gating.

    <textblock>
      Schizophrenic patients exhibit impairments in filtering of sensory information, as can be
      assessed by use of prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response and P50
      suppression paradigms. In the treatment of negative symptoms or depressive syndromes during
      the course of schizophrenia antidepressants are often combined with antipsychotic medication.
      However, antidepressants increase monoaminergic activity, of which in turn it has been
      suggested to decrease sensory gating, although these presumptions are mostly based on results
      from animal studies. Currently, little is known about monoaminergic modulation of sensory
      filtering in humans, and the few reports that can be found in literature show discrepancies
      with animal studies. The current study was designed to study the effects of increased
      monoaminergic activity on sensory filtering and habituation of healthy volunteers. In a
      double-blind, placebo controlled cross-over design, twenty healthy male volunteers will
      receive either placebo or a dose of 50 mg of imipramine (a dual acting antidepressant), after
      which they will be tested in a P50 suppression-, a PPI-, and a habituation of the startle
      reflex paradigm.
