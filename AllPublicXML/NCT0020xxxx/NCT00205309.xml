  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the impact of acute illness on sequential airway IgA levels in
      intensive care patients who will require prolonged intubation. Infections are the most common
      cause of late deaths in non-head injured trauma patients and a frequent cause of morbidity
      and mortality in hospitalized patients, especially intubated Intensive Care Unit (ICU)
      patients. Nosocomial pneumonia is the most common of these infections, and its incidence in
      defined populations of critically injured patients is responsive to route and type of
      nutrition. This study will focus on the mechanisms of specific immune mucosal defenses in
      intestinal and extraintestinal sites and link enteral feeding (or lack of it) with
      maintenance (or deterioration) of respiratory mucosal defenses.
