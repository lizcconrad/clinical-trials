  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children scheduled for elective surgery are randomized into a control and intervention group.
      Children in the intervention group receive a CD and booklet of relaxation and distraction
      stories to listen to/read during the preoperative period. Preoperative anxiety is assessed by
      the child life specialist in the preoperative holding area. Ease of induction and emergence
      from anesthesia are rated by the anesthesia care provider. Post-hospital behaviors are
      reported by the parents one week after discharge. It is hypothesized that children receiving
      the intervention will have less anxiety, easier induction and emergence from anesthesia, and
      fewer changes in post-hospital behaviors than children in the control group.
