    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to monitor the performance of the Summit™ hip in the treatment
      of patients with hip joint disease requiring a total hip replacement. Patients who enter the
      study will be evaluated at regular intervals following hip surgery using patient, clinical
      and x-ray assessments.
