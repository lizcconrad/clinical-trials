    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are:

        1. To find the highest dose of monthly intravenous Zometa that can be given with daily low
           doses of cyclophosphamide by mouth to children with recurrent or refractory
           neuroblastoma without causing severe side effects.

        2. To find out the side effects seen by giving Zometa and cyclophosphamide on this schedule
           at different dose levels.

        3. To measure blood and urine levels of Zometa during treatment

        4. To preliminarily evaluate the antitumor activity of Zometa and concomitant oral
           cyclophosphamide in children with recurrent and/or refractory neuroblastoma within the
           confines of a Phase I study.

        5. To measure the effects of Zometa on markers of bone breakdown found in urine, blood, and
           bone marrow

        6. To measure the effects of Zometa on the immune system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Zoledronic Acid (Zometa), a new generation, highly potent bisphosphonate used to treat
      osteoporosis and hypercalcemia of malignancy, is widely used in adult malignancies with
      potential for bone metastasis such as breast cancer, multiple myeloma and prostate cancer.
      Bisphosphonates modulate the bone environment by toxicity to osteoclasts resulting in
      decreased bone resorption. Zometa is the first bisphosphonate to affect both osteolytic and
      osteoblastic metastatic lesions. In several large randomized studies in adults with recurrent
      or advanced malignancies, patients randomized to Zometa had delay in progression of bone
      metastases and less morbidity (skeletal related events) when compared to either placebo or
      pamidronate. The toxicity profile of Zometa in adults has been tolerable and includes
      hypocalcemia, temperature rise, and nausea. The most concerning toxicity is decline in renal
      function that appears to be related to cumulative dose and the dose rate of administration.
      In our pre-clinical studies bisphosphonates delayed progression of osteolytic lesions in
      neuroblastoma tumors xenografted into immunocompromised mice while the combination of Zometa
      with low dose cyclophosphamide appeared to prolong overall survival. The primary aim of this
      study is to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose of Zometa combined with low dose oral
      cyclophosphamide in children with recurrent or refractory neuroblastoma. We will also
      evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Zometa in children with neuroblastoma and examine the effect
      of Zometa on markers of bone resorption, cytokines and bone-related growth factors.

    <description>Zometa will be administered intravenously every 28 days beginning on day 0. Cyclophosphamide will be administered daily without interruption (unless toxicity supervenes) beginning day 0. Each course of therapy will be 28 days. On day 0 of each cycle, cyclophosphamide should be given first, followed by Zometa with a separation between the two drugs of at least one hour. All patients are required to take calcium and Vitamin D supplementation for the duration of study participation.</description>
