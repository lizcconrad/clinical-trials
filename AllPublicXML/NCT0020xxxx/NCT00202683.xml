  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is is the first step of a full study named CHEMOGENE because it explores the
      genetic determinant of an alteration of the chemoreflex. This reflex determines
      hyperventilation when the pressure of oxygen falls in the blood. This happens when subjects
      travel to high-altitude where oxygen levels diminish in the atmosphere. Subjects with such an
      altered chemoreflex are intolerant to altitude and develop pulmonary or cerebral edema
      associated with a severe headache. In this study we compare subjects tolerant to high
      altitude (8000 meters)to subjects intolerant to altitude. The chemoreflex is measured i.e.
      the hyperventilation associated with hypoxia and all subjects are scanned for the genes
      implicated in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The idea is that subjects with an impaired
      oxygen sensing will exhibit an altered chemoreflex and will be intolerant to high-altitude.

      Subjects are selected at an outpatient clinic specialised in the diagnosis of tolerance to
      altitude, where the chemoreflex is analyzed during a bicycle exercise performed with a oxygen
      deprived air simulating a 8000 meters altitude.

      All subjects will go later to high altitude for trekking usually. The patients are those
      subjects with an altered chemoreflex who exhibited cerebral edema or pulmonary edema during
      the trekking.

      The controls are the subjects with a normal chemoreflex who did not exhibit any trouble
      during their journey.

      Fourty subjects of each group are included. A blood sample is withdrawn and studied for
      succinate dehydrogenase genes in a blind fashion.

      After completing the inclusion the allelic mutations will be compared in the two groups.
