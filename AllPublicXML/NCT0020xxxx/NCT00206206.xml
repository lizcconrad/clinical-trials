  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In response to the evidence supporting “tight” glucose control (70 – 110) in the critical
      care setting, the MMH ICU developed a protocol utilizing regular intravenous insulin. This
      protocol was initiated in 2002. Monitoring of the data collected revealed effective glycemic
      control when this protocol was used. However, limited utilization has led to overall
      ineffective glycemic control in this ICU. The poor utilization is largely due to a general
      reluctance of physicians to start their patients on an intravenous insulin infusion. As
      contributing to this poor compliance is the “open” nature of the ICU. The MMH ICU is an
      “open” ICU, meaning that many physicians across multiple subspecialties admit to this unit.
      Approaches to controlling hyperglycemia vary greatly, depending largely upon the treating
      physician. In an attempt to improve overall glycemic control in this “open” ICU, the
      Subcutaneaous Insulin Aspart Hyperglycemia Protocol (SIAP) was developed which incorporates a
      subcutaneous insulin aspart regimen that triggers the use of a regular insulin infusion
      protocol when the SIAP is not adequately controlling the patient’s blood glucose.

      This study aims to evaluate 1) the effect the SIAP on overall glycemic control in the ICU, 2)
      the effectiveness that the SIAP has on controlling blood glucose as compared with past
      practices using regular insulin, and 3) the effect the SIAP has on patient complications and
      outcomes in the MMH ICU.
