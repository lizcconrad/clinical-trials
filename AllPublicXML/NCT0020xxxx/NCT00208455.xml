    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to monitor the performance of the DePuy PROXIMA™ hip in the
      treatment of patients with hip joint disease requiring a total hip replacement. Patients who
      enter the study will be evaluated at regular intervals following hip surgery using patient,
      clinical and x-ray assessments. A subset of patients will undergo scans to allow the bone
      mineral density of the bone surrounding the implant to be monitored

        iv) Subjects who are scheduled to undergo a primary total hip replacement whom the surgeon
        considers to be suitable for the DePuy PROXIMA™ hip femoral prosthesis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        i) Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have an existing

        v) Subjects who are currently involved in any injury litigation claims.

        vi) Subjects for whom the surgical procedure is a revision of a previous THR or
        hemi-arthroplasty, or who have previously undergone arthrodesis or osteotomy of the hip.

        vii) Subjects undergoing a simultaneous bilateral hip operation.

        viii) Subjects undergoing the second stage of a staged bilateral for whom the contralateral
        hip is part of this clinical investigation.

        ix) Subjects undergoing the second stage of a staged bilateral for whom the contralateral
        hip was implanted less than six months previously or is not performing satisfactorily
