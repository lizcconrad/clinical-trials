  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common cause of death in the United States. A common
      term for CHD is &quot;blocked arteries.&quot; People with CHD or &quot;blocked arteries&quot; often have high
      blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes. They are also more likely to suffer a heart
      attack. Many heart attacks could be prevented by taking medicines that control blood
      pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes. However, only 50%-60% of patients take their medicines
      as directed. Patients who don't take their medicines regularly are considered noncompliant.

      One of the risk factors for noncompliance is low health literacy. Health literacy is the
      ability to obtain, understand, and act on basic health information. Patients with low health
      literacy may not understand their illnesses as well, or how to take their medicines properly.

      The purposes of this project are

        1. to learn more about the relationship between low health literacy and medication
           compliance, and

        2. to test 2 different strategies designed to help patients take their medicines more
           regularly.

      Patients with CHD were recruited when they arrived for a regular doctor's appointment. We
      measured their health literacy skills, asked questions about how they take their medications,
      and checked their blood pressure and last cholesterol and diabetes measurements. We then
      assigned patients to 1 of 4 intervention groups (intervention ongoing). The first group is
      receiving usual care, which includes regular medication instructions printed on the bottle
      and no reminders to refill medicines. The second group gets monthly postcards reminding them
      to refill their prescriptions. The third group gets a new medication schedule that shows
      them, with pictures and figures, how they are supposed to take their medicines each day. The
      fourth group receives both the postcards and the new medication schedule. We are following
      patients for 1 year to see which intervention has the greatest impact on their medication
      compliance, blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes measurements. We will also examine
      whether patients' health literacy affects the success of the interventions.
