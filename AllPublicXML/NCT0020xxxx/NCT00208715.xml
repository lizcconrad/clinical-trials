      The main purpose of this study is to determine if Provigil® (modafinil) at a dose of 200 mg
      once daily is safe and effective for treating symptoms of sleepiness and fatigue associated
      with Major Depressive Disorder when added to a SSRI.

      Approximately 100 male and female outpatients, who are between the ages of 18 and 65, will be
      enrolled at four sites in the United States. This study consists of two parts. The first part
      consists of 6 weeks of open label treatment with a selected SSRI &amp; double blind treatment
      with Provigil or placebo (inactive medication).

      After the six week double blind treatment phase all patients will enter a four week open
      label treatment phase with Provigil. The dose of Provigil is not to exceed 400 mg and cannot
      be less than 100 mg per day. They will continue taking the prescribed SSRI.
