  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing major abdominal surgery are at highest risk for developing Postoperative
      Ileus (POI), occurring in nearly all cases. Signs and symptoms of POI may include abdominal
      distention and bloating, persistent abdominal pain; nausea and/or vomiting; variable
      reduction of bowel sounds; delayed passage of or inability to pass flatus or stool; and
      inability to tolerate a solid diet. This study will test the ability of alvimopan 12 mg given
      30 to 90 minutes before the scheduled start of surgery to hasten the recovery of GI function
      in patients having partial small or large bowel resections.

    <textblock>
      Postoperative ileus (POI) can be thought of as temporary slowing down or stopping of bowel
      function and a slowing down of movement of contents of the intestines. Patients undergoing
      major abdominal surgery are at highest risk for developing POI, occurring in nearly all
      cases. Signs and symptoms of POI may include abdominal distention and bloating, persistent
      abdominal pain; nausea and/or vomiting; variable reduction of bowel sounds; delayed passage
      of or inability to pass flatus or stool; and inability to tolerate a solid diet. This study
      will test the ability of alvimopan 12 mg given 30 to 90 minutes before the scheduled start of
      surgery to hasten the recovery of GI function in patients having partial small or large bowel
      resections.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is scheduled for a partial small/large bowel resection with primary
             anastomosis; all procedures must be performed completely by open laparotomy.

          -  Subject is scheduled to receive primary postoperative pain management with intravenous
             (i.v.) patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) opioids.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is scheduled for a total colectomy, colostomy, ileostomy, any laparoscopic or
             laparoscopically-assisted procedure, or subject has a history of gastrectomy, total
             colectomy, short bowel syndrome, or multiple previous abdominal surgeries performed by
             open laparotomy.

          -  Subject has complete bowel obstruction.

          -  Subject is currently taking opioid analgesics or has taken more than three doses of
             opioids (oral or parenteral) within the previous 7 days prior to the day of surgery.
