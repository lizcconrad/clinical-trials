  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to assess whether GPI 1485 has the ability to delay or stop disease
      progression and improve symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) that is already
      being treated with a dopamine agonist therapy. Whether the drug is working will be assessed
      by evaluating clinical endpoints such as UPDRS scores and by evaluating images, obtained by
      SPECT scan, of brain activity. Participants in the study will be given either placebo or GPI
      1485 treatment. The duration of the study is 2-years and patients are required to complete 12
      safety visits and 3 SPECT scans. SPECT scans will be taken before, after 1-year, and after
      2-years of treatment with GPI 1485. In completing the SPECT scan, patients will be injected
      with a radioactive investigational drug b-CIT and pictures taken using a Single Photon
      Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) camera.

      In this phase II study, the investigational new drug (not approved by the FDA) GPI 1485 is
      being assessed for its ability to delay or stop disease progression and improve symptoms in
      patients with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease (PD). These potential effects of GPI 1485
      are based on animal studies in which the drug was shown to both protect nerves from damage
      and to regrow damaged nerves. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive
      either GPI 1485 or placebo (inactive pill). GPI 1485 will be supplied as an oral tablet
      formulation to participants enrolled in the study. Participants randomly assigned to receive
      GPI 1485 will be required to take four tablets four times a day by mouth. GPI 1485 matching
      placebo will also be supplied as an oral tablet formulation. Participants randomly assigned
      to placebo will be required to take four placebo tablets four times a day by mouth. The
      duration of this study is 24 months which includes 12 clinical visits at one of 21
      participating sites and three imaging visits to Molecular NeuroImaging (MNI) in New Haven
      Connecticut. At MNI, participants will be injected with a radioactive investigational drug
      b-CIT to obtain images of the activity in the brain with Single Photon Emission Computed
      Tomography (SPECT). This will evaluate whether GPI 1485 slows or delays the loss of brain
      activity in patients with mild to moderate PD. During this study you will also have other
      clinical evaluations including a physical exam, blood work, ECG (tracing of your heart
      rhythm), and urinalysis. Tests specific to Parkinson's disease will also be performed
      including: Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Dyskinesia Rating Scale,
      Bilateral finger-tapping test, and Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS). In addition
      assessments of your health and mood will be done.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female patients 40 - 80 years of age with a diagnosis of idiopathic PD &lt; 10
             years. The diagnosis of idiopathic PD will be based on the medical history, neurologic
             examination, current response to anti-PD medication(s), and the presence of at least
             two of the following at the time of diagnosis: resting tremor, bradykinesia, or
             rigidity.

          2. Females must be postmenopausal for &gt;= 12 months, surgically sterile, or agree to use
             acceptable forms of contraception. A negative serum pregnancy test must be confirmed
             prior to first dose for women of childbearing potential.

          3. Clinical diagnosis of idiopathic mild to moderate PD characterized by a Hoehn and Yahr
             rating of 1 to 3 in the 'Off' state (measured before the first dose of anti-PD
             medications on the day of assessment).

          4. UPDRS Motor 'Off' rating of 8-30 (measured before the first dose of anti-PD
             medications on the day of assessment).

          5. Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score of &lt;= 25.

          6. Currently treated with an optimized dose of a dopamine agonist (stable dose for &gt;= 1
             month prior to randomization and treatment is optimized in the opinion of the

             the 3 months after randomization.

          8. Concomitant therapy with amantadine, selegiline, or anticholinergics is permitted, but
             not required. If the patient is treated with any of these medications the dose of this
             medication must be judged optimal and stable for &gt; 1 month prior to randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of motor fluctuations including drug-induced dyskinesia, but excluding the
             pre-dose 'Off' state (prior to the first dose of anti-parkinsonian medication(s) on
             the day of assessment).

          2. History of surgical treatment of PD.

          3. Presence of clinical signs consistent with a neurologic disorder other than PD
             including, but not limited to, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy

             corticobasal degeneration, Pick's disease, diffuse Lewy body disease, dementia,
             schizophrenia, psychosis, or hallucinations.

          4. Presence of clinically significant depression as measured by the HAM-D Scale with a
             score &gt; 16. If the patient is on an antidepressant, the dose must be judged optimal
             and stable for ³ 1 month prior to randomization.

          5. Presence of clinically significant, in the judgment of the Investigator, urinary
             incontinence, cardiac arrhythmia, or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension.

             before screening.

          7. Any medical disability (e.g., peptic ulcer disease, severe degenerative arthritis,
             compromised nutritional state) or laboratory abnormality (e.g., serum creatinine &gt; 2.0
             mg/dL) that may interfere with the protocol-specified safety and efficacy
             measurements, present an unacceptable risk to the patient's well-being, or compromise
             the patient's ability to provide informed consent.

          8. Recent history, within the 2 years before screening, of drug or alcohol abuse.

          9. History of anaphylaxis.

         10. Previous treatment with L-Dopa for &gt; 90 days or treatment with L-Dopa within 30 days
             prior to the baseline assessment.

             monoamine oxidase-A (MOA-A) inhibitors.

         13. Previous exposure to GPI 1485 (previously AMG-474-00).
