      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of various doses of nebivolol in
      patients with mild to moderate hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study
      of nebivolol over a range of doses in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The study
      consisted of 2 phases: screening/washout/single-blind placebo run-in followed by
      randomization/double-blind treatment. During the double-blind phase, patients received
      nebivolol or placebo. Patients had 7 scheduled clinical visits during the study.
