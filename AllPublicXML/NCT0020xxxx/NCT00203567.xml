    <textblock>
      Patients with Bipolar I or II Disorder with a Major Depressive Episode who sign informed
      consent and meet eligibility criteria will begin treatment with extended release
      carbamazepine (ERC-CBZ ). The dose of ERC-CBZ will be initiated at 200mg twice daily and
      increased as tolerated by 200mg/day every 3 days up to 1200mg/day by week 2 (target dose).
      Then the dose may be increased at the investigator's discretion, up to1600mg/day as tolerated
      by week 8, if needed for a greater therapeutic response. Efficacy will be assessed biweekly
      with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Clinical Global
      Impression-Bipolar (CGI-BP). Safety is assessed biweekly with adverse events self-reports and
      laboratory evaluations. ).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 19 -65.

          -  Diagnosis of Bipolar I or II Disorder, currently experiencing a major depressive
             episode without psychotic features, as confirmed by the Mini International
             Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.).

          -  Must have experienced at least two previous mood episodes during the past 10 years, at
             least one of which was a hypomanic, full manic or mixed episode. The current
             depressive episode must be ≥ 2 weeks, but ≤ 2 years in duration.

          -  Must currently have clinically significant depressive symptoms as defined by a CGI-S
             total score of ≥ 4.

          -  Must have been washed out of all psychotropic medications (except for the allowed
             concomitant sedatives for insomnia) for their bipolar illness for at least 3 days for
             mood stabilizers and 1 week for antidepressants prior to study drug initiation
             (medications should be tapered at the investigator's discretion prior to washout),
             while continuing to meet entry criteria for depressive symptoms. Must be willing to
             discontinue all psychotropic medication (except for the allowed concomitant sedative
             for insomnia) during the study period.

          -  No substance abuse/dependence for the previous 4 weeks (except for nicotine/caffeine)

          -  Must give informed consent, and/or consent must be obtained from a legally acceptable
             representative (as required by IRB) prior to the initiation of any protocol required
             procedures.

          -  Must be able to understand the nature of the study, agree to comply with the
             prescribed dosage regiments, report for regularly scheduled office visits and
             communicate to study personnel about adverse events and concomitant medication.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use medically approved methods of birth
             control to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to four weeks after
             completion of the study in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized.
             WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to the
             start of the study.

          -  Male or female, any race or ethic origin

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with current diagnosis of delirium, dementia, amnestic or other cognitive
             disorder; schizophrenia; borderline or antisocial personality disorder; or any other
             mental disorder that would interfere with efficacy or safety evaluations or
             compliance.

          -  WOCBP who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for
             the entire study period and for up to four weeks after completion of the study.
             Acceptable methods include oral, injectable or implanted contraceptives, intrauterine
             devices or barrier methods such as condoms, diaphragm, and spermicides. Women who are
             pregnant or breast-feeding, or who plan to become pregnant during the study.

          -  Patients at significant risk of committing suicide or homicide based on history,
             mental status exam, or investigator's judgment.

          -  Patients receiving psychotherapy (individual, group, marriage, or family therapy)
             unless participation has been regular for at least 3 months prior to randomization.

          -  Patients with clinically significant thyroid pathology that would interfere with
             efficacy or safety evaluations and patients with a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)
             level &gt; 60% above the upper limit of normal. Patients who are undergoing treatment for
             their thyroid pathology (e.g. thyroid supplementation) should be stable for at least
             two months prior to randomization.

          -  Patients who have a history or evidence of a medical condition that would expose them
             to an undue risk of a significant adverse event or interfere with assessments of
             safety or efficacy during the course of the trial, including but not limited to
             hepatic, renal respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrine, neurologic, or hematologic
             disease as determined by the clinical judgment of the investigator.

          -  Patients with a history of seizures (except for a single childhood febrile seizure,
             posttraumatic, alcohol withdrawal) or a history of severe head trauma, or stroke.

               -  Other abnormal laboratory test or vital sign result that in the investigator's
                  judgment, is medically significant, in that it would impact the safety of the
                  patient or the interpretation of the results.

             formulations) for bipolar depression.

             last dose was less than one full cycle plus one week

          -  Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for
             treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g. infectious disease) illness during
