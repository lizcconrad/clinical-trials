  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess lung immune responses in patients with active
      pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and in healthy control persons who are exposed to Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis in households of patients with TB or who are unexposed.

      BACKGROUND:

      M. tuberculosis infects a third of the world's population, and TB is the leading cause of
      morbidity and mortality due to a single infectious agent. However, only 5% to 10% of M.
      tuberculosis-infected subjects without an underlying immunodeficiency develop disease during
      their lifetimes. Therefore protective immunity is induced in the majority of subjects.
      Understanding correlates of protection against M. tuberculosis in humans is needed to better
      direct efforts in the development of antituberculosis vaccines.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Patients are treated according to good clinical practice; however, no study medications are
      given as part of the research study. This study involves a one-time bronchoalveolar lavage
      and venipuncture to obtain immune cells for laboratory studies of immune responses.
