      To assess the usefulness of Gemcitabine plus S-1 therapy based on the antitumor effect and
      survival period. By performing a phase I/II study of this combination in patients with
      inoperable or with postoperative pancreatic cancer.

    <textblock>
      A multicenter Open-label, single-arm, phase I/II clinical trial is conducted on patients with
      histological stage IV Pancreatic cancer given gemcitabine plus S-1. The usefulness of this
      regimens as 1st line therapy for pancreatic cancer was evaluated by the disease-free
      survival(DFS), median survival time (MST), incidence and severity of adverse event.
