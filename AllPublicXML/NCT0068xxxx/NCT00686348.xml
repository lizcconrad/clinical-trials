      The objectives of this post-marketing observational study are to assess the safety and
      effectiveness, as measured by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and growth hormone (GH)
      levels, of Somatuline® Depot (lanreotide) Injection when administered by a health care
      professional (HCP), the patient, the patient's partner or parent/guardian as part of their
      routine acromegaly care. Treatment convenience and acromegaly symptom relief will also be
      assessed through questionnaires, and demographic and medical history information will be
      collected.
