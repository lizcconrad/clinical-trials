  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IPI-504-06 is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of IPI-504 as compared to placebo in patients with
      metastatic and/or unresectable GIST following failure of at least imatinib and sunitinib.

      Approximately 195 patients will be randomized using a 2:1 ratio to receive either IPI-504
      (N=130) or placebo (N=65). Upon unblinding, patients receiving either IPI-504 or placebo may
      receive IPI-504 in the open-label portion of the study if defined inclusion criteria are met.

      Early and frequent imaging timepoints (Weeks 2, 5, 8, 14 and every 6 weeks thereafter) are
      incorporated into this study to capture progression events and limit patient exposure to
      ineffective agents.
