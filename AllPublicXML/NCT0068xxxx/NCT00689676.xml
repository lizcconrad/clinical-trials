  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to describe the performance of very low birth-weight preterm
      toddlers regarding expressive language and cognitive development during sensorimotor and
      beginning of pre-operational periods, as well as to compare the performance presented by
      these children to that presented by their full-term peers, according to Genetic Epistemology
      theoretical principles.

      The hypothesis of this study is that very-low birth weight preterms would present a poorer
      performance, concerning expressive language and cognition development,than their full-term
      peers.

    <textblock>
      Very low birth weight preterm infants are known to have risks of cognitive and behavioral
      problems, including learning difficulties, attention deficits and hyperactivity, as well as
      neuromotor deficits. Moreover, they are reported to have a high risk of speech and language
      impairments up to school age, even in cases where major neurological abnormalities are
      excluded. Impairments have been reported both in receptive and expressive language and, more
      specifically, in morphosyntax and naming.
