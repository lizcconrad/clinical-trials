  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the project is to evaluate advantages from the use of a bearable continuous
      interstitial glucose monitoring device (GuardianR) during educative sessions of diabetic
      patients dedicated to functional insulin therapy teaching. This concept of intensified
      treatment is based on testing and explanation of simplified decision making algorithms to
      adapt insulin dose to every true life conditions. As self monitoring of capillary glucose
      level is needed to validate those algorithms, we postulate that using a device able to
      permanently control interstitial glucose readable by both medical team and patient himself
      (during the session and the 5 following days after discharge) could significantly improve
      safety and efficiency of such educative session.

      Two groups of 60 patients (experimental and control groups) will be followed and evaluated at
      6 and 12 months. We do think that this new tool would facilitate education of patients and
      lead further to a better glycemic control.
