      RATIONALE: Panobinostat and imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of panobinostat when
      given together with imatinib in treating patients with previously treated chronic phase
      chronic myelogenous leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of LBH589 given in combination with imatinib
           mesylate in CML patients who are in Major Cytogenetic Remission (MCR) with residual
           BCR-ABL positive cells after at least 1 year of daily imatinib mesylate treatment.

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity of LBH589 given
           in combination with imatinib mesylate in CML patients.

      Secondary

        -  To study the effect of LBH589 given in combination with imatinib mesylate on cytogenetic
           response status and BCR-ABL levels in CML patients in major cytogenetic remission on
           imatinib mesylate treatment.

      Tertiary

        -  To study the effect of LBH589 given in combination with imatinib mesylate on residual
           BCR-ABL positive primitive progenitors in CML patients in major cytogenetic remission on
           imatinib mesylate treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is dose-escalation study of panobinostat.

      Patients receive oral panobinostat once daily on days 1, 3 and 5; 8, 10, and 12; 15, 17, and
      19; and 22, 24, and 26. Patients also receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily on days 1-28.
      Treatment repeats every 21 or 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month and then every 3
      months for up to 1 year.
