    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify an effective dose of allergen-specific immunotherapy
      for cat hair (Felis domesticus) administered by the oral/sublingual route.

    <textblock>
      This was a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups study
      conducted in 3 centers in the US (NCT00689299). Study drug was sublingually dosed once daily
      as 0.15 mL of US standardized cat hair extract dosed either undiluted, as 1:10 dilution, or
      placebo. Target dose was obtained on Day 3 of dose titration escalating through 1:100 and
      1:10 dilutions on Day 1 and Day 2 in the high dose group or placebo and 1:100 dilutions in
      the low dose group. Treatment duration was 20 weeks. Adult (&gt;18 years) study subjects had
      positive history for cat allergy without asthma, positive skin test to cat allergen, absence
      of immunotherapy during the prior 2 years, and absence of other confounding baseline
      conditions. The primary outcome parameter was average Total Symptom Score (TSS) during a
      1-hour cat chamber exposure. TSS is the sum of 7 items rated from 0 - 3 (none to severe) for
      nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing) and non-nasal
      symptoms (eye watering, eye itching, and itching palate/ ear/ throat).

    <description>Sum of individual symptoms scores, 7 items, 21 points maximum
Total Symptom Scores during environmental chamber exposures at week 20. The Total Symptom Score was defined as the sum of the scores from the following seven symptoms rated 0-3 (0=absent, 1=mild, 2= moderate, 3=severe): runny nose, sneezing, itching nose, nasal congestion, watery eyes, itchy eyes, and itchy ears/palate/throat.
Total Symptom score could range from 0-21; the lower the score, the more favorable the outcome. Each symptom parameter was graded by the study subject every 10 minutes for up to 60 minutes during the baseline (Day 0) and during the Week 20 environmental chamber exposures.</description>

          -  Written informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Documented allergy to cat hair as demonstrated by a positive epicutaneous skin test
             (wheal &gt;3 mm) and symptoms of allergic rhinitis during exposure to cats.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential, defined as not surgically sterile or at
             least 2 years postmenopausal, must agree to use one of the following forms of

        <description>Sum of individual symptoms scores, 7 items, 21 points maximum
Total Symptom Scores during environmental chamber exposures at week 20. The Total Symptom Score was defined as the sum of the scores from the following seven symptoms rated 0-3 (0=absent, 1=mild, 2= moderate, 3=severe): runny nose, sneezing, itching nose, nasal congestion, watery eyes, itchy eyes, and itchy ears/palate/throat.
Total Symptom score could range from 0-21; the lower the score, the more favorable the outcome. Each symptom parameter was graded by the study subject every 10 minutes for up to 60 minutes during the baseline (Day 0) and during the Week 20 environmental chamber exposures.</description>
