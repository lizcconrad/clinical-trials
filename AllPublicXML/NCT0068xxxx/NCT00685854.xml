    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether the drug ranibizumab (Lucentis) can help prevent vision loss
      in people with macular telangiectasia, a condition in which new blood vessels grow in the
      retina at the back of the eye and can leak. Such changes in blood vessels are seen in other
      diseases associated with changes in a body chemical called vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF). Ranibizumab is an anti-VEGF drug that is effective in treating another eye disease,
      age-related macular degeneration, with similar changes in eye blood vessels.

      People 18 years of age and older with macular telangiectasia in both eyes with no new blood
      vessel growth in either eye may be eligible for this study. They must have vision better than
      20/400 in the study eye.

      Participants undergo the following procedures:

        -  Ranibizumab injections in the study eye at least four times over 12 weeks. Depending on
           the response to treatment and the side effects, additional injections may be given every
           4 weeks for up to 1 year. The eye is numbed before the injection and the eye area is
           cleaned with an antiseptic. Antibiotic drops are used for 3 days following the injection
           to prevent infection.

        -  Evaluations before starting treatment, at the time of each injection, and 8 weeks after
           the last treatment:

             -  History and physical examination.

             -  Eye examination with dilation, microperimetry and photography: The eye examination
                measures visual acuity, eye pressure and eye movements. For the microperimetry
                test, subjects sit in front of a computer screen and press a button when they see a
                light on the screen. Measurements and photographs of the retina are also taken.

             -  Fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography to examine the blood vessels in the
                eye: A dye called fluorescein or indocyanine green is injected into a vein in the
                arm. The dye travels through the veins to the blood vessels in the eyes. A camera
                takes pictures of the dye as it flows through the blood vessels.

             -  Pregnancy test: Women who are able to become pregnant have a urine pregnancy test
                before each ranibizumab injection.

      Retinal telangiectasis is a group of rare, idiopathic retinal vascular anomalies affecting
      the retinal capillaries in which irregular capillary dilation and incompetence occur in the
      macula. This is the group 2 in the Gass classification of idiopathic juxtafoveal
      telangiectasia in which fluorescein angiography showed leakage with capillary dilation. These
      patients typically are diagnosed in their fifth or sixth decade of life. Both sexes may be
      affected. Minimal exudation, superficial retinal crystalline deposits, and right-angle
      venules characterize this disorder. The pathogenesis of the disease is unknown. Because of
      the leakage of the retinal vessels and also the finding of neovascularization, it is possible
      that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may be implicated in this disease.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible role of ranibizumab for the treatment
      of eight participants with macular telangiectasia with hyperfluorescence on fluorescein
      angiography, with vision better than 20/400, without neovascularization. The primary outcome
      of this study will be the proportion of participants that lose 15 letters or more in ETDRS
      BCVA at 12 months compared with baseline. The secondary outcomes measured at one year will
      include the proportion of participants who lose 10 letters or more, the mean change in ETDRS
      BCVA, the change in central retinal thickness, the extent of fluorescein leakage, the change
      in fundus autofluorescence, change in size of neovascular membrane and the change in central
      retinal sensitivity. This is a pilot study designed to evaluate the feasibility and potential
      efficacy of treating patients with macular telangiectasia in a larger, phase III study within
      the organization of the MAC TEL Research Group, sponsored by the Lowy Foundation. Currently,
      the research group is enrolling 200 patients affected with this condition for a natural
      history study in 22 international clinical centers.

          -  Participant must understand and sign the informed consent.

          -  Participant must be at least 18 years of age.

          -  Participant must have macular telangiectasia in both eyes.

          -  Participant must have vision loss of better than 20/400 in the study eye.

          -  Participant must have clear ocular media and adequate pupillary dilation to permit
             good quality stereoscopic fundus photography.

          -  All women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at
             baseline, and be willing to undergo testing immediately prior to each injection and
             monthly for at least two months following the last dose of ranibizumab.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Safety and toxicity of ranibizumab have not yet been investigated in children.
             Further, it is unlikely that younger participants will be able to comply with all
             examinations and intravitreal injections. Therefore, participants below the age of 18
             will be excluded from participation in the study. This ocular condition is not
             commonly found in participants below the age of 18.

          -  History (within past five years) or evidence of severe cardiac disease (apparent in
             electrocardiogram abnormalities, clinical history of unstable angina, acute coronary
             syndrome, myocardial infarction, revascularization procedure within six months prior
             to baseline, atrial or ventricular tachyarrythmias requiring ongoing treatment).

          -  History of stroke within 12 months of study entry.

          -  History within the past 30 days of a chronic ocular or periocular infection (including
             any history of ocular herpes zoster).

          -  Current acute ocular or periocular infection.

          -  Any major surgical procedure within one month of study entry.

          -  Known serious allergies to fluorescein dye.

          -  Previous participation in a clinical trial (for either eye) involving anti-angiogenic
             drugs (pegaptanib, ranibizumab, bevacizumab, anecortave acetate, Protein Kinase C
             inhibitors, etc.).

          -  Previous intravitreal drug delivery (e.g., intravitreal corticosteroid injection or
             device implantation) in the study eye.

          -  History of vitrectomy surgery in the study eye.

          -  History of glaucoma filtering surgery in the study eye.

          -  History of corneal transplant in the study eye.

          -  Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation and premenopausal women not using
             adequate contraception. The following are considered effective means of contraception:
             surgical sterilization or use of oral contraceptives, barrier contraception with
             either a condom or diaphragm in conjunction with spermicidal gel, an IUD, or
             contraceptive hormone implant or patch.
