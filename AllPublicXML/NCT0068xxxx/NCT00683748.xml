    <textblock>
      After transplantation, if insufficient immunosuppression is achieved, rejection and graft
      loss follows. If to much immunosuppression is given, the patient suffers risk for infections
      and malignancies. Despite careful dosing and monitoring of drug levels, the biological
      effects of the immunosuppression given is difficult to predict and varies significantly. As a
      result, the degree of immunosuppression (or immunosuppressive status) remains unknown and
      clinical problems related to under- or over-immunosuppression are common. Thus, a method to
      determine the degree of immunosuppression would be of great and direct clinical importance
      and the results would be improved. T cells are the principal cells of the immunesystem
      causing rejection. Furthermore, all immunosuppressive regimes targets T cells. Thus, T cell
      reactivity could reflect the biological effects of the immunosuppression and the
      immunosuppressive status. In addition, T cells are of crucial importance in the immunedefence
      against viral diseases. Therefore, data on virus specific T cell reactivity could aid in
      diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of viral disease. The proposed study aim to develop a
      clinically useful method to monitor cellular immunity and the degree of immunosuppression
      after transplantation by determinations of the specific T cell reactivity to several
      clinically relevant viruses.
