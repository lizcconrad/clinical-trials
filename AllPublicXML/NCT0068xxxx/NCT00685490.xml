    <textblock>
      To evaluate the long term outcomes of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), with and without internal
      limiting membrane (ILM) peeling, in eyes with persistent macular edema secondary to branch
      retinal vein occlusion (BRVO).

      Results suggest the following hypothesis:

        -  PPV, with and without ILM peeling, appears to be beneficial in eyes with persistent
           macular edema due to BRVO

        -  Effectiveness is maintained long term

        -  ILM peeling does not significantly affect postoperative best corrected visual acuity
           (BCVA)

    <description>Concurrent phacoemulsification and intraocular lens insertion in the capsular bag was performed, followed by PPV with separation of the posterior hyaloid from the optic disk and posterior retina with a posterior vitreous detachment was not present. Indocyanine green (ICG)-assisted peeling was performed in all consecutive patients between April 2000 and June 2003. 0.1% ICG solution was injected over the macular region. Immediately after application, the dye was washed out using a vitreous cutter. Repeated injection of ICG was not required. Triamcinolone acetonide (TA)-assisted ILM peeling was performed in all consecutive patients from July 2003 to November 2006.</description>
