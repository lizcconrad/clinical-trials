    <textblock>
      Curcumin as well as the ashwagandha extract are ingredients from traditional indian medicine
      and have been shown to be potent anti-cancer compounds in laboratory as well as animal
      studies. This study will test the safety and efficacy of a curcumin formulation and the
      ashwagandha extract in high grade relapsed or metastatic osteosarcoma where no other second
      line chemotherapy is being given. The pharmacokinetics will be studied along with response as
      measured on CT scans and PET scans as well as the quality of life and any toxicity.

           chemotherapy is planned and in which disease is not amenable to surgery.

        2. Patient should be able to follow-up 3 monthly for clinical and imaging assessment as
