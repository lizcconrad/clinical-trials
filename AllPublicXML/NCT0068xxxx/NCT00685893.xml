    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate an intervention to improve the care given
      to patients who are dying in the intensive care unit (ICU) and their families. This study is
      a multi-center randomized trial of a multi-faceted quality improvement intervention designed
      to improve the quality of palliative and end-of-life care in the ICU setting. The
      intervention targets the hospital and the outcome evaluation occurs at the level of the
      individual patient and family with surveys completed by family members and nurses as well as
      standardized medical record review.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of the severity of illness, the intensive care unit (ICU) is a setting where death is
      prevalent and where the majority of deaths involve decisions to withhold or withdraw
      life-sustaining therapies. There is substantial data to suggest that the quality of
      end-of-life care in the ICU is poor. Many patients die with moderate to severe pain,
      physicians are often unaware of patients' wishes regarding end-of-life care, and the care
      patients' receive is often not consistent with their treatment preferences. Our study aims to
      evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-faceted intervention to improve the quality of care for
      patients dying in, or shortly after a stay in, the ICU using a randomized controlled study of
      12 hospitals. In addition we plan to examine the variability in, and predictors of, the
      quality of dying and end-of-life care in community hospital ICUs with the purpose of
      identifying the current quality of end-of-life care and the institutional, clinician, and
      patient factors associated with the quality of this care. We will evaluate the successful and
      unsuccessful components of the intervention and describe the institutional and clinician
      facilitators and barriers to the intervention's implementation, with a focus on identifying
      interventions to improve care for the dying at other sites.

    <description>We include information about end-of-life decision-making, communication skills, pain and symptom management, and withdrawal of life support. The primary methods of delivery will be a grand rounds lecture by one of the physician investigators and the viewing of an educational video for nurses and respiratory therapists. The content of the educational components will be structured to cover four topics: the principles of decision-making about end-of-life care in the ICU; communication with patients, families and the ICU team; pain and symptom management; and, the principles and practice of withdrawal of life support.</description>

    <description>We identify physicians, nurses and other clinicians from each hospital to serve as the local champions. The role of the local champions is to help implement the intervention and be a role model for end-of-life care in the ICU. Local champions participate in interactive education and training sessions with the investigators and the other local champions from their institution to discuss barriers to good end-of-life care at their location and to strategize about how to overcome those barriers.</description>

    <description>Study staff meet with ICU directors with 4 goals. The first goal is to familiarize the director with the educational content of the intervention. Secondly, the results of the family satisfaction data collected are shared without identifying information. The aggregated results of the other participating hospitals are disclosed, also without identifiers. Third, we elicit and discuss the institution-specific barriers to providing high quality end-of-life care in the ICU. Lastly, we hope that by educating the directors we can engage these clinical leaders to serve as role models in their institutions.</description>

    <description>We have developed a set of orders that encompass the various aspects of withdrawing life support from patients. Individual department directors at each hospital will decide if they want to implement a similar order form at their institution and whether they want to modify the form to fit their specific institutional needs. In addition to the order forms, we encourage hospitals to develop a family pamphlets and resources that can be given to families to provide education about the intensive care unit experience.</description>
