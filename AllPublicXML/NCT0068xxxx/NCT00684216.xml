  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies the effects on quality of life and on time to second progression of the
      sequence endocrine therapy-capecitabine versus the sequence capecitabine-endocrine treatment.
      It is anticipated that the time on study (which is the time between randomization and the
      discontinuation of the second treatment in the sequence) will be similar for both arms of the
      study. The quality of life during this period, however, could be better in the patient group
      receiving the most effective first agent in the sequence. If this proves to be true, the
      conventional wisdom that endocrine therapy should be continued until no further endocrine
      options remain, must be abandoned.

      This is a randomized phase II/II study. Patients are randomized for the sequence
      capecitabine-hormonal therapy versus hormonal therapy- capecitabine. At progression the
      patient should receive the other protocol treatment (e.g. if the patient was randomized to
      capecitabine, at progression the treatment should be switched to hormonal treatment).
