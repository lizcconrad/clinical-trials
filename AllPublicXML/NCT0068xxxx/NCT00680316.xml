  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase IV, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed
      to evaluate the effect of Pulmozyme on pulmonary function, health-related quality of life
      (HRQOL), and respiratory symptoms in 3- to 5-year-old children with cystic fibrosis (CF).
      Approximately 40 patients were planned to be enrolled in this study. However, only 3 patients
      were eligible for random allocation and received treatment: 1 patient in the Pulmozyme group
      and 2 patients in the placebo group. All 3 patients completed the study assessments but did
      not have usable pulmonary function test (PFT) data.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Most patients were unable to perform the test being used to measure lung function, thus it
    became clear the study would not yield clinically meaningful data

    <measure>Change in Reactance at 8 Hz (Xrs8) From Visit 2 to Visit 3 (Change From Baseline at Visit 2 to Visit 3, After Study Drug Treatment).</measure>
    <time_frame>from Visit 2 to Visit 3 (16 +/- 2 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The fundamental principle of forced oscillometry is that lung function can be assessed by measuring changes in pressure and flow in response to external pressure applied at the airway opening. Reactance is complex measure that incorporates the changes in pressure and volume and the rate of these changes in response to pressure oscillations at a specific frequency. (8Hz was used for the primary endpoint). Reactance is thought to reflect the elastic properties of the lung.</description>

    <measure>Change in Respiratory Symptom Domain Score From the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire Revised (CFQ-R) for Parents of Preschoolers and for Preschoolers</measure>
    <time_frame>from Visit 2 to Visit 3 (16 +/- 2 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The CFQ-R for Preschoolers and the CFQ-R for Parents of Preschoolers was designed specifically to measure the impact of CF for patients with a diagnosis of CF. Each question is answered using a 4-point Likert scale.
In order to calculate the domain/symptom scale scores, the following algorithm is followed
Re-number items which have been reverse coded
Calculate the mean of the items to be included. If more than half of the items are missing, then the score is considered missing
Re-scale to result in a scaled score which ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health</description>

          <title>Change in Resistance at 4, 6, 8, and 10 Hz (Rrs4, Rrs6, Rrs8, and Rrs10)</title>
          <description>The fundamental principle of forced oscillometry is that lung function can be assessed by measuring changes in pressure and flow in response to external pressure applied at the airway opening. Resistance is complex measure that incorporates the lack of changes in pressure and volume and the rate of these changes in response to pressure oscillations at a specific frequency. (10Hz was used for the secondary endpoint).</description>
          <population>Children were unable to perform forced oscillometry (FOT) or did not remain stable during the study. No efficacy analyses were performed because no patients had complete (pre- or post-treatment) data for pulmonary function tests, including FOT.</population>

        <title>Change in Respiratory Symptom Domain Score From the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire Revised (CFQ-R) for Parents of Preschoolers and for Preschoolers</title>
        <description>The CFQ-R for Preschoolers and the CFQ-R for Parents of Preschoolers was designed specifically to measure the impact of CF for patients with a diagnosis of CF. Each question is answered using a 4-point Likert scale.
In order to calculate the domain/symptom scale scores, the following algorithm is followed
Re-number items which have been reverse coded
Calculate the mean of the items to be included. If more than half of the items are missing, then the score is considered missing
Re-scale to result in a scaled score which ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health</description>
