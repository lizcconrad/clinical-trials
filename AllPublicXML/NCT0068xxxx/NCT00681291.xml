  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, third-party blinded, multicenter,
      interventional evaluation of inguinal hernia repair comparing Strattice to light weight
      polypropylene mesh. Performance and outcomes measures to be compared include postoperative
      resumption of activities of daily living, nature and incidence of short- and long-term pain
      and complications, and incidence of hernia recurrence.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Activities Assessment Scale at 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The AAS includes 13 items covering a broad sample of sedentary, movement-related and graded-intensity physical activities. Respondents are asked to rate the degree of difficulty performing each of these activities in the previous 24 hours on a 5-point scale from &quot;No difficulty = 1&quot; to &quot;Not able to do it = 5.&quot; The AAS has three subscales: sedentary activities (items 1-4); ambulatory activities (items 6-8); work/exercise activities (items 11-13). The AAS total and subscale scores are transformed to produce a range of 0-100, with higher values indicating greater functional activity. Subjects completed the assessment at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months. It is the change from baseline to 3, 6, 12 and 24 months which is the primary outcome measure (Baseline calculated value minus time point calculated value). Therefore, a negative number indicates an increase in activity from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Activities Assessment Scale at 3 Months</title>
        <description>The AAS includes 13 items covering a broad sample of sedentary, movement-related and graded-intensity physical activities. Respondents are asked to rate the degree of difficulty performing each of these activities in the previous 24 hours on a 5-point scale from “No difficulty = 1” to “Not able to do it = 5.” The AAS has three subscales: sedentary activities (items 1–4); ambulatory activities (items 6–8); work/exercise activities (items 11–13). The AAS total and subscale scores are transformed to produce a range of 0–100, with higher values indicating greater functional activity. Subjects completed the assessment at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months. It is the change from baseline to 3, 6, 12 and 24 months which is the primary outcome measure (Baseline calculated value minus time point calculated value). Therefore, a negative number indicates an increase in activity from baseline.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to 3 Months</time_frame>
        <population>Of the 88 participants in Arm 1 who started the study, 81 completed the Activities Assessment Scale at 3 months. Of the 84 participants in Arm 2 who started the study, 77 completed the Activities Assessment Scale at 3 months.</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Activities Assessment Scale at 3 Months</title>
          <description>The AAS includes 13 items covering a broad sample of sedentary, movement-related and graded-intensity physical activities. Respondents are asked to rate the degree of difficulty performing each of these activities in the previous 24 hours on a 5-point scale from “No difficulty = 1” to “Not able to do it = 5.” The AAS has three subscales: sedentary activities (items 1–4); ambulatory activities (items 6–8); work/exercise activities (items 11–13). The AAS total and subscale scores are transformed to produce a range of 0–100, with higher values indicating greater functional activity. Subjects completed the assessment at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months. It is the change from baseline to 3, 6, 12 and 24 months which is the primary outcome measure (Baseline calculated value minus time point calculated value). Therefore, a negative number indicates an increase in activity from baseline.</description>
