    <textblock>
      Subjects with moderate-to-severe chronic psoriasis not responding to standard or biologic
      therapy will be eligible to enroll in this study. Subjects will receive infliximab infusions
      (5 mg/kg of body weight) at Weeks 0, 2, 6, and 14 followed by a 12-week follow-up period. The
      efficacy of infliximab will be evaluated by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI).

    <description>PASI 75 response is defined as participants who achieved at least a
75% improvement in PASI score from Baseline to Week 10. The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their responses to therapy. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72 (the higher the number, the worse the disease).</description>
