  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present protocol will utilize simultaneous recording of brain activity during attention
      and memory tasks in insomnia participants after ramelteon vs. zolpidem vs. placebo
      administration. The investigators hypothesize that amplitudes of associated with memory will
      be unchanged by ramelteon, whereas zolpidem will significantly reduce brain activity
      associated with stimulus processing as evidenced by abnormal reduction in the amplitude of
      specific brain regions relative to placebo.

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed research has two specific aims: 1) demonstrate that ramelteon has no effect on
      event related potential components that reflect basic sensory processes (P1 and N1), and will
      not impair attention and memory processes, whereas the benzodiazepine receptor agonist
      zolpidem will significantly reduce (relative to placebo) the amplitude of these event related
      potential components throughout the cerebral cortex and 2) show that ramelteon reduces the
      abnormal hyperarousal in insomnia as reflected through a reduction in the contingent negative
      variation component of the event related potential across frontal and parietal brain regions.
