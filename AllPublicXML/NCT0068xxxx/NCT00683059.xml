      The purpose of this study is to determine what effects the drug Abraxane has on bladder
      cancer.

    <textblock>
      For those patients with advanced bladder cancer who have progressed on a platinum based
      regimen, no widely accepted standard second line therapy currently exists. Taxanes including
      paclitaxel have exhibited clinical activity in this disease and are sometimes given off
      study. However, toxicities including neurotoxicity and hypersensitivity reactions often limit
      the use of paclitaxel. ABRAXANE may allow delivery of a greater dose of paclitaxel to those
      with bladder cancer with an easier method of administration and with less toxicity.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histological or cytological diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma.
             Mixed histologies are permitted as long as transitional cell carcinoma is the major
             component (i.e. &gt;50% of the pathologic specimen). Pure or predominant squamous cell
             carcinomas are not permitted.

          -  Patients with transitional cell carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter are
             permitted.

          -  Patients must have metastatic or locally advanced unresectable disease.

          -  Patients must have received one and only one prior chemotherapeutic regimen which
             included a platinum (at least one cycle) for metastatic/recurrent disease. Neoadjuvant
             or adjuvant chemotherapy will be considered to have been first line if the patient
             progressed within 12 months of the last dose.

          -  Neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy (with or without a taxane) is permitted if
             registration is greater than 12 months since the last dose (patients must then have
             received one platinum containing regimen in the metastatic setting)

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;= 2.

          -  Estimated life expectancy of &gt;12 weeks.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease according to RECIST criteria.

          -  If female of childbearing potential, pregnancy test is negative within 72 hours priors
             to first dose of study drug.

          -  If fertile, patient agrees to use an effective method of contraception to avoid
             pregnancy for the duration of the study.

          -  Adequate organ function; Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1.5 x 109/L. Platelet count &gt;100
             x109/L. Hemoglobin &gt;90 g/L. Total bilirubin &lt;1.5x upper limit of normal. Transaminases
             &lt;3x upper limit of normal (&lt;5x if liver metastasis are present) Calculated creatinine
             clearance &gt;40 ml/min (Cockcroft &amp; Gault formula)

          -  Able to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior taxane therapy for metastatic disease (or &gt; 12 months since a taxane-containing
             neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy).

          -  Pre-existing peripheral neuropathy &gt;1 by NCI-CTC criteria.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females.

          -  Uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal involvement (treated brain metastasis permitted
             if both known lesions and medications e.g. steroids for that indication are stable).

          -  History of serious or concurrent illness that might be aggravated by study treatment.

          -  History of class II-IV congestive heart failure.

          -  Other malignancies except adequately controlled basal cell carcinoma of the skin or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix or incidental prostate cancer (T1a, Gleason &lt;7 PSA
             &lt;10ng/ml) or any other tumor within 5 years prior to enrollment.

          -  Other investigational therapy or radiation therapy within 30 days before registration.

          -  Patients not willing to employ adequate contraception for the duration of the study.
