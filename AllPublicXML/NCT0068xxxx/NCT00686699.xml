  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to determine if preladenant (SCH 420814, MK-3814) can reduce
      drug-induced involuntary movements in participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
      disorder. Participants were to be evaluated for two 14-day treatment periods with a 3-week
      washout period between treatment periods. The primary outcome measure, Extrapyramidal Symptom
      Rating Score (ESRS), was to be evaluated frequently during the treatment periods.

    <time_frame>Up to 6 hours post-dose on Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>The ESRS total score consists of 4 subscales: 1) a questionnaire of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and drug-induced movement disorders (DIMD) over the previous 7 days (7 items scored as 0=Absent to 3=Severe; score range: 0-21), 2) an examination of Parkinsonism and akathisia (17 items scored as 0=None to 6=Severe; score range: 0-102), 3) an examination of dystonia (10 items scored as 0=Absent to 6=Most Severe; score range 0-60) and 4) an examination of dyskinesia (7 items scored as 0=None to 6=Severe; score range: 0-42). The ESRS total score could range from 0 to 225, with a lower score reflecting a better outcome.

The ESRS total score could range from 0 to 225, with a lower score reflecting a better outcome. The lowest ESRS total score for each participant within the 6-hour range on Day 14 was analyzed.</description>
