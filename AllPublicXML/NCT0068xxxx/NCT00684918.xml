      This protocol will evaluate the efficacy of obatoclax in older patients with previously
      untreated AML.

      The Pilot Safety portion of the study will evaluate the safety of obatoclax administered by a
      3 hour infusion for 3 days in a row. The Pilot Schedule portion of the study will randomize
      16 patients in to one of two cohorts: 1) patients receiving obatoclax administered by a 3
      hour infusion for 3 days in a row or 2) patients receiving obatoclax administered by a 24
      hour infusion for 3 days in a row. The schedule with the best overall efficacy and safety in
      the Pilot Schedule portion of the study will then be utilized in the Phase II portion of the
      study.
