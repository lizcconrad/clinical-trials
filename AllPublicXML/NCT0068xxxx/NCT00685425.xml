    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate, using an exercise challenge approach, the dose
      response of levalbuterol HFA MDI in adolescent and adult subjects with asthma

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, modified-blind, active controlled, multicenter, parallel treatment, 3x3 dose
      level crossover study evaluating the dose response of levalbuterol in subjects 12 years of
      age and older with exercise induced bronchoconstriction. This study was previously posted by
      Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and
      in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.
