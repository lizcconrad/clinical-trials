    <textblock>
      The project objective is to validate a new indirect estimate of insulin status in both
      pregnant African-American women and Caucasian women in southern Louisiana who are at risk for
      gestational diabetes mellitus. There are racial differences in carbohydrate metabolism that
      are potentially linked to complications during pregnancy and to increased risks of obesity
      and diabetes in later life. The investigators will explore the use of indexes of insulin
      status to identify the metabolic risk profile of pregnant women which may vary by race.
      Understanding whether there are differences which vary by race may influence clinical
      screening and treatment of pregnant women.

      The major goal of our proposed study is to validate a new approach to estimating insulin
      sensitivity and ß-cell function in African-American women compared to non-Hispanic white
      women in southern Louisiana who are at a high risk for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
      We will determine whether the whole body insulin sensitivity index (WBISI) and insulinogenic
      index (IGI) [derived from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)] can be used during 24-28
      weeks of pregnancy to accurately estimate the degree of insulin resistance relative to ß-cell
      function in women with GDM in those with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) as well as those
      who are glucose tolerant. Fasting values will also be assessed using the homeostasis model
      assessment (HOMA-IR and HOMA-%B) to evaluate insulin resistance and ß-cell function. We will
      explore the potential use of these measures to define the metabolic risk profile of these
      pregnant women and compare them with obstetric outcomes. We will determine if there are
      differences in risk that vary by race. Second, given the high likelihood that women who
      manifest GDM will develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), identification of these patients by
      ethnic group or other independent determinants will permit intervention after delivery that
      might delay or prevent the onset of type 2 DM.
