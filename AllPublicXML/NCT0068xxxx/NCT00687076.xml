  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) occurs when arteries become narrowed or hardened because of
      a build-up of plaque or fat deposits. PAD develops most often in arteries in the legs, which
      can result in reduced blood flow to the legs and feet, occasionally causing leg pain and
      fatigue. Early identification of PAD and treatment with lifestyle changes or medications can
      help to keep legs healthy and lower risk for heart attack and stroke, but endovascular or
      surgical procedures may be necessary for people with severe PAD. Even after endovascular
      intervention, PAD symptoms must be continually monitored to prevent the development and
      progression of blockages in the arteries. The best approach for monitoring symptoms is still
      undetermined. This study will compare the effectiveness of an intensive combination of lipid
      modifying medications versus standard lipid modifying medications in treating people with
      significant PAD who have had an endovascular intervention.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PAD occurring in the legs is a serious disease that affects about 8 million people in the
      United States. A person's risk for PAD increases with age but can also be raised by smoking
      or having diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease. Symptoms of PAD
      may include leg cramps or pain while walking, foot pain while resting, and skin wounds or
      ulcers on feet and toes. However, because only about one in three people with PAD knows to
      seek treatment for these symptoms, many end up with advanced disease that requires
      significant medical intervention, such as an endovascular or other surgical procedure to open
      the blocked arteries. While these procedures are helpful in treating people with severe PAD,
      lifestyle modifications and certain medications are also needed for long-term management of
      PAD and improved quality of life. An intensive combination of lipid modifying medications may
      be superior to standard lipid modifying medications in reducing PAD-associated risk factors
      and improving overall health in people with PAD. This study will compare the effectiveness of
      an intensive combination of lipid modifying medications versus standard lipid modifying
      medications in preventing blockages and re-narrowing of arteries in people with significant
      PAD who have had an endovascular intervention.

      Participation in this study will last a minimum of 2 years and a maximum of 5 years. All
      participants will first undergo baseline assessments that will include a medical history,
      vascular and physical exam, electrocardiograph (EKG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan,
      3D ultrasound, blood pressure measurement test in the legs, treadmill walking distance test,
      urine test, blood draw, and questionnaires. A portion of the blood draw will be used for DNA
      analysis and genetic testing.

      Participants who have not had an endovascular intervention in the 3 months before study entry
      will undergo a standard of care percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) procedure. First
      these, participants will complete a series of clinical review assessments that will include a
      review of social, vascular, and clinical history. Next, they will undergo the PTA procedure,
      which will involve the inflation and deflation of a small balloon in the area of the blocked
      artery. Additionally, participants may have a metal mesh tube called a stent placed in the
      blocked area, if deemed necessary by their physicians.

      All participants will then be assigned randomly to receive standard care plus an intensive
      combination of lipid modifying medications (Simvastatin, Plavix, aspirin, Ezetimibe, and
      Niaspan) or standard lipid modifying medications with placebo (Simvastatin, Plavix, aspirin,
      placebo Ezetimibe, and placebo Niaspan). Participants will take their assigned medications
      daily for 24 months. Follow-up visits will occur at Day 10; Week 6; and Months, 6, 12, and 24
      after beginning the study medications. During follow-up visits, participants will repeat the
      baseline assessments and the clinical review assessments from the pre-PTA visit. The Week 6
      follow-up visit will include only a blood draw, questionnaires, and the clinical review
      assessments. Participants will also be contacted by phone to check their status every 2 to 3
      months during treatment and every 6 months after treatment for up to 3 years.

    <description>The primary outcome variable was the change in superficial femoral artery (SFA) wall volume over 24-months, as determined by MRI. The 24-month changes in SFA lumen and SFA total vessel volumes were also analyzed.
Analysis details: A total of 102 patients were randomized. 87 patients completed baseline MRI. Between randomization and the baseline visit, 1 patient withdrew from the study, 8 patients opted out from baseline imaging, and 6 additional patients declined blood collection at baseline. The multilevel models (primary endpoint) used all available imaging data (n=91), including patients who only completed baseline imaging (n=20) or completed at least 2 imaging visits other than baseline (n=4).</description>

        <title>Effect of Intensive Lipid Modification Medication Therapy on Progression of Atherosclerosis and Restenosis of Femoral Arteries Measured Using High Resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to Examine the Femoral Artery for Progression of Atherosclerosis</title>
        <description>The primary outcome variable was the change in superficial femoral artery (SFA) wall volume over 24-months, as determined by MRI. The 24-month changes in SFA lumen and SFA total vessel volumes were also analyzed.
Analysis details: A total of 102 patients were randomized. 87 patients completed baseline MRI. Between randomization and the baseline visit, 1 patient withdrew from the study, 8 patients opted out from baseline imaging, and 6 additional patients declined blood collection at baseline. The multilevel models (primary endpoint) used all available imaging data (n=91), including patients who only completed baseline imaging (n=20) or completed at least 2 imaging visits other than baseline (n=4).</description>
        <time_frame>Measured at baseline and Months 6, 12, and 24</time_frame>
        <population>Multilevel models were used to describe changes over time in the MRI outcome variables and to compare the drug therapy groups. The advantage of multilevel models is the capability to use data with missing or irregularly timed observations, due to death or loss to follow-up, on the outcome variable.</population>

          <title>Triple Therapy</title>
          <description>Participants will receive standard of medical care and treatment with intensive lipid modification using a statin plus Ezetimibe and Niaspan.
Ezetimibe: Daily dose of 10 mg of Ezetimibe
Niaspan: Daily dose of 1500 mg of Niaspan
Statin therapy: Daily dose of 40 mg of Simvastatin (If unable to tolerate Simvastatin, participants will take a daily dose of Atorvastatin.)
Standard care: Standard of medical care for PAD
Aspirin: Daily dose of 325 mg of aspirin
Clopidogrel: Daily dose of 75 mg of clopidogrel for 3 months or as recommended by the primary care physician
Inclusion criteria were life-style-limiting claudication consistent with Fontaine Stage IIa/IIb or angiographically confirmed Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus A-C lesions in the SFA.</description>
