    <textblock>
      Levobupivacaïne (Chirocaine®) is a new local anaesthetic recently marketed in France. The
      goal of this prospective work is to study the pharmacokinetic aspect of this drug after
      injection around the sciatic nerve (subgluteal way).

    <textblock>
      The originality of this work is to call upon a modelling of pharmacokinetic by using the
      principle of the pharmacology of population.

      This work also proposes to appreciate a dynamic aspect since data of effectiveness and
      tolerance will be collected with regular intervals during the first 24 hours after the
      beginning of the study.
