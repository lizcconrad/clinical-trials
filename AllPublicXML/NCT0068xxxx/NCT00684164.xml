  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low sodium levels (hyponatremia) are a frequent occurrence in medically ill patients, and in
      particular those with neurological injury. Hyponatremia has been associated with worse
      outcome, problems with memory and concentration and impaired balance. Standard treatment for
      low sodium (salt) levels is to give the patient a salt containing solution thru a catheter
      (small flexible tube) in a vein in the arm or leg. One of the major complications of this
      treatment is excess body fluid which may cause heart problems or accumulation of fluid in the
      lungs and may require additional medications to remove extra water from the body.

      FDA approval has recently been granted for a new drug - Conivaptan - for use in hyponatremic
      conditions. Conivaptan works by excreting free water from the body and thereby produce
      concurrent rise in serum sodium concentrations. Conivaptan has not been evaluated
      specifically in patients with brain injuries. The primary objective of this study is to
      demonstrate the safety and efficacy of intravenous Conivaptan for the treatment of
      hyponatremia in patients with brain injury. If effective, Conivaptan may represent a safe
      treatment option.
