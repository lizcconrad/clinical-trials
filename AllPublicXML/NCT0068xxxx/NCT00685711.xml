  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cat allergy is an increasingly prevalent condition, affecting 10-15% of patients with
      allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma. Cat-PAD is a novel, synthetic, allergen-derived
      peptide desensitising vaccine, currently being developed for the treatment of cat allergy.
      This study will investigate the safety of Cat-PAD administered as increasing single doses.

      This study is designed as a two centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, escalating single
      dose study in up to 88 cat allergic subjects. Cohorts of 8 subjects will be enrolled. Each
      cohort will undergo screening 14-28 days before treatment and a baseline challenge for EPSR
      and LPSR to cat allergen injected into the arm 7 days before treatment. On the treatment day,
      subjects will be injected either intradermally (into the skin) or subcutaneously (under the
      skin) with a single dose of Cat-PAD or placebo and safety observations made for 8 h. After 21
      days, subjects will again have cat allergen injected into the arm and the EPSR and LPSR will
      be recorded. The dose of Cat-PAD will be increased in successive cohorts, provided that the
      previous dose tested was well tolerated.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A reliable history of rhinoconjunctivitis (sneezing, rhinorrhoea, nasal blockage,
             itchy/red/sore/watering eyes) or controlled asthma (GINA (2006) classification 1) on
             exposure to cats for at least 1 year.

          -  Late-Phase Allergic Skin Reaction (LPSR) to 0.010 HEP units Leti cat allergen eight
             hours after intradermal injection of greater than 25mm diameter response on single
             arm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with asthma falling under GINA(2006) classification 2 (partly controlled) and
             3 (uncontrolled).

          -  A history of anaphylaxis to cat allergen.

          -  Subjects with a cat specific IgE &gt;100 kU/L.

          -  Subjects with an FEV1 &lt;80% of normal.

          -  Subjects with an acute phase skin response to cat allergen with a weal diameter &gt;
             30mm.

          -  Subjects who suffer from hay fever, and cannot complete the clinical study outside the
             pollen season.

          -  Allergen immunotherapy during the last 5 years or Cat Dander immunotherapy ever.

          -  Use of the following therapies for the periods specified prior to the screening visit
             will make the subject ineligible for the study: corticosteroids: (depot: 90 days;
             systemic: 30 days; dermatological, intranasal, inhalational: 15 days); cromones (14
             days); antihistamines other than loratadine (nasal and long-acting oral: 10 days;
             short-acting oral, ocular: 7 days); leukotriene inhibitors (10 days); anticholinergics
             (7 days); alpha-adrenergic agonists (7 days); tricyclic antidepressants (14 days). If
             it becomes a medical necessity for a subject to use one of these contraindicated
             medications during the study this will become an individual stopping criteria.

          -  Subjects for whom administration of adrenaline is contra-indicated (e.g. subjects with
             acute or chronic symptomatic coronary heart disease or severe hypertension).

          -  Subjects being treated with beta-blockers
