  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the degree of improvement in insulin resistance and features of the
      metabolic syndrome in non-diabetic overweight or obese subjects after training in a
      low-intensity, moderate-intensity or non-aerobic exercise program, as well as self-initiated
      exercise behavior after the assigned exercise program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized, open study comparing low-intensity and moderate-intensity
      aerobic exercise versus non-aerobic (stretching) exercise on direct measurements of insulin
      resistance and variables associated with the metabolic syndrome. This 6-month intervention
      will be followed by an additional 6-month follow-up period during which subjects will be
      encouraged to maintain their exercise regimen (along with their prescribed diet) but without
      scheduled supervision. Behavioral variables associated with adherence will be analyzed along
      with changes in the above physiological variables.

          -  Body mass index of 25-45 kg/m2

          -  Subjects not currently following a regular exercise program nor an optimal diet, and
             who self-report their activity level as sedentary

          -  Able to understand and sign the informed consent form, follow the instructions given
             in the study, attend all necessary clinic visits, and undergo all required study
             procedures

             pulmonary, orthopedic, rheumatological or neurological diseases)

          -  Cardiovascular disease not controlled with medical therapy, or invasive vascular
             procedures within six months prior to screening

          -  Subjects found on resting EKG or stress testing to have underlying cardiac

             Î²-adrenergic blockade agents, at least until agents of alternate drug classes can be
             substituted

          -  Subjects with concurrent endocrinopathies

          -  Subjects receiving concurrent treatment with metformin, thiazolidinediones, systemic
             glucocorticoids, or any weight loss agents

          -  Subjects who expect to require medications during the course of the study that may
             affect their metabolic profile, including systemic glucocorticoids and hormone
             replacement therapies

          -  Subjects who cannot complete the stress test due to physical limitations

          -  Any other factors that, in the opinion of the investigators, may interfere with the
