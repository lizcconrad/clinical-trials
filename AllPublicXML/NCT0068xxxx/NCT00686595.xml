  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and effect on the quality of life of
      infliximab in adults with moderate-to-severe psoriasis who are resistant to etanercept after
      12 weeks of treatment or have failed 24 weeks of treatment with etanercept. Infliximab will
      be administered as an intravenous infusion of 5 mg/kg at Baseline (Week 0), Visit 3 (Week 2),
      Visit 4 (Week 6), Visit 6 (Week 14), and Visit 8 (Week 22).

    <measure>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 Response Rate at Week 10</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PASI correlates to the physician's assessment of psoriasis symptoms including redness of lesions, thickness of lesions, scaliness of lesions and extent of disease. Each parameter is graded from 0-4, 0 refers to no disease and 4 to severe involvement. The body is divided into 4 areas for scoring (head, arms, trunk to groin, legs to top of buttocks), and the final score ranges from 0-72. The PASI 75 response rate at Week 10 is measured as the percentage of participants who achieved at least 75% improvement from baseline PASI at Week 10.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>SAPASI is the participant's measurement of severity of psoriasis. The participant estimates the area of psoriatic involvement for each body district (head, upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs) and scores it from 0 (no involvement)-6 (90-100% involvement); and the extent of psoriasis from 0 (no involvement) to 4 (very marked) for each - erythema, desquamation and induration of the plaques. The final score computed by the investigator ranged from 0-72. The percent reduction in SAPASI at Week 18 compared to baseline is reported.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>The BSA is the physician's evaluation for the extent of disease. The entire body area is divided into 4 districts: head, upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs to which corresponds the 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% of the entire body surface respectively. The investigator assesses the percentage of the participant's body surface area affected by psoriasis in each district. The final affected BSA value is the sum of the percentage of each district.

Participants answered 29 questions referring to the previous 4-week period, on a 5-point scale from &quot;never&quot; (=0) to &quot;all the time&quot; (=4). The score for each scale ranges from 0 to 100 and higher scores reflect a worse quality of life. The percent reduction in SKINDEX-29 scores at Week 18 compared to baseline is reported.</description>

        <title>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 Response Rate at Week 10</title>
        <description>PASI correlates to the physician's assessment of psoriasis symptoms including redness of lesions, thickness of lesions, scaliness of lesions and extent of disease. Each parameter is graded from 0-4, 0 refers to no disease and 4 to severe involvement. The body is divided into 4 areas for scoring (head, arms, trunk to groin, legs to top of buttocks), and the final score ranges from 0-72. The PASI 75 response rate at Week 10 is measured as the percentage of participants who achieved at least 75% improvement from baseline PASI at Week 10.</description>

        <title>PASI 50 Response Rate at Week 24</title>
        <description>PASI correlates to the physician's assessment of psoriasis symptoms including redness of lesions, thickness of lesions, scaliness of lesions and extent of disease. Each parameter is graded from 0-4, 0 refers to no disease and 4 to severe involvement. The body is divided into 4 areas for scoring (head, arms, trunk to groin, legs to top of buttocks), and the final score ranges from 0-72. The PASI 50 response rate at Week 24 is measured as the percentage of participants who achieved at least 50% improvement from baseline PASI at Week 24.</description>

        <title>Percent Reduction in Self-Administered Psoriasis Area Severity Index (SAPASI) at Week 18</title>
        <description>SAPASI is the participant's measurement of severity of psoriasis. The participant estimates the area of psoriatic involvement for each body district (head, upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs) and scores it from 0 (no involvement)-6 (90-100% involvement); and the extent of psoriasis from 0 (no involvement) to 4 (very marked) for each - erythema, desquamation and induration of the plaques. The final score computed by the investigator ranged from 0-72. The percent reduction in SAPASI at Week 18 compared to baseline is reported.</description>

          <title>Percent Reduction in Self-Administered Psoriasis Area Severity Index (SAPASI) at Week 18</title>
          <description>SAPASI is the participant's measurement of severity of psoriasis. The participant estimates the area of psoriatic involvement for each body district (head, upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs) and scores it from 0 (no involvement)-6 (90-100% involvement); and the extent of psoriasis from 0 (no involvement) to 4 (very marked) for each - erythema, desquamation and induration of the plaques. The final score computed by the investigator ranged from 0-72. The percent reduction in SAPASI at Week 18 compared to baseline is reported.</description>

The entire body area is divided into 4 districts: head, upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs to which corresponds the 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% of the entire body surface respectively. The investigator assesses the percentage of the participant’s body surface area affected by psoriasis in each district. The final affected BSA value is the sum of the percentage of each district.

        <title>Percent Reduction in Skin Index Questionnaire (SKINDEX-29) Score at Week 18</title>
        <description>The SKINDEX-29 measures the quality of life in dermatological participants, who complete a questionnaire assessing 3 scales - burden of symptoms, social functioning and emotional state. Participants answered 29 questions referring to the previous 4-week period, on a 5-point scale from “never” (=0) to “all the time” (=4). The score for each scale ranges from 0 to 100 and higher scores reflect a worse quality of life. The percent reduction in SKINDEX-29 scores at Week 18 compared to baseline is reported.</description>
