  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In total, 70 smokers will be randomized to: standard of care smoking cessation medication
      varenicline alone (an FDA-approved smoking cessation medication) or varenicline plus
      contingency management (CM) (a behavioral procedure with rewards for target behaviors, like
      smoking abstinence). Patients in both conditions will receive varenicline for 12 weeks with
      standard smoking cessation therapy and regular breath and urine sample monitoring for
      smoking. Patients assigned to CM will earn chances to win prizes for each breath sample that
      tests negative for smoking, and urine samples that test negative for smoking will result in
      even greater chances for prizes. More CM patients are expected to achieve and maintain
      abstinence than patients receiving varenicline alone.
