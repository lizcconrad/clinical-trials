  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) occurs in 2-3% of the US population and carries a 15-20%
      chance of progression to cirrhosis. It is closely associated with obesity, hyperlipidemia and
      insulin resistance. Therapy usually includes recommendations to increase exercise and to
      begin weight reducing diets but these goals are variably achieved and their relative effects
      in conjunction with pharmacological intervention have not been well defined. Moreover, these
      lifestyle changes can confound results of treatment trials if not quantified through
      conditioning testing and measures of body fat. Polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially
      formulation rich in omega-3, are widely accepted and endorsed in the medical community for
      their beneficial effects on hyperlipidemia and coronary disease risk reduction. Recent data
      suggests that omega-3 fatty acids ameliorate hepatic steatosis in humans and in animal models
      of NASH by reducing hepatic fat content. We hypothesize that a one year course of omega-3
      fatty acid (3gm/day) will produce improvement in NASH histological injury independent of
      changes in weight (BMI) or degree of conditioning measured by the lactate threshold. The
      effects of the supplement will be compared to a placebo group and controlled for these
      lifestyle changes.
