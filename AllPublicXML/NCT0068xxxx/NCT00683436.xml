      Prospective patients will spend 2 nights in the sleep lab for baseline PSG assessments. Those
      who meet the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria will return for four treatment periods
      with two consecutive nights in each. Study medication will be administered in the sleep
      laboratory 30 minutes before the patient's usual bedtime.
