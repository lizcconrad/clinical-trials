  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, adult Indonesian subjects with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfected
      with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) will be given peginterferon alfa-2b (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin
      (RBV) combination therapy. The efficacy rate (sustained virologic response, end of treatment
      virologic response, and sustained biochemical response), the subject morbidity rate as caused
      by other opportunistic infection (eg, bacterial pneumonia, tuberculosis, and other bacterial
      infection), and the safety and tolerability of this combination therapy will be examined.

SVR was defined as plasma HCV RNA level below lower level of quanitation at the end of 24 weeks follow-up (week 48 or 72).
The study was terminated due to low enrollment. This analysis was not performed.</description>
