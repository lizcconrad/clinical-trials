    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Average Daily Number of Moderate to Severe Hot Flushes at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The average daily number of moderate and severe hot flushes was calculated as the sum of the number of moderate and severe hot flushes on each day divided by the number of days with data. Moderate hot flushes: sensation of heat with sweating; able to continue activity; and severe hot flushes: sensation of heat with sweating; causing cessation of activity.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Average Daily Number of Moderate to Severe Hot Flushes at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The average daily number of moderate and severe hot flushes was calculated as the sum of the number of moderate and severe hot flushes on each day divided by the number of days with data. Moderate hot flushes: sensation of heat with sweating; able to continue activity; and severe hot flushes: sensation of heat with sweating; causing cessation of activity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Average Daily Severity of Hot Flushes at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Severity ranged from mild (sensation of heat without sweating); moderate (sensation of heat with sweating; able to continue activity) to severe (sensation of heat with sweating; causing cessation of activity). The average daily severity of hot flushes for each time period was calculated as (1*Number of mild+2*Number of moderate+3*Number of severe)/(Total number of hot flushes). For the days with no hot flushes, the severity score was set as 0. As this was derived from the count data, there was no maximum; the minimum score was 0; the higher values showed worse outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Adjusted Means in the Number of Moderate and Severe Hot Flushes at Month 6 and Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6 and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The average daily number of moderate and severe hot flushes was calculated as the sum of the number of moderate and severe hot flushes on each day divided by the number of days with data. Moderate hot flushes: sensation of heat with sweating; able to continue activity; and severe hot flushes: sensation of heat with sweating; causing cessation of activity. Adjusted mean was calculated by using change from baseline as response variable, treatment as factor, and baseline as covariate using the observed cases.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Adjusted Means in the Hot Flush Severity Score at Month 6 and Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6 and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Severity: mild (heat sensation without sweating); moderate (heat sensation with sweating; able to continue activity); severe (heat sensation with sweating; causing cessation of activity). Average daily severity of hot flushes= (1*Number of mild+2*Number of moderate+3*Number of severe)/(Total number of hot flushes). Days with no hot flushes: severity score=0. As it was derived from count data, there was no maximum; minimum score=0; higher values= worse outcomes. Adjusted mean: calculated using change from baseline=response variable, treatment=factor and baseline=covariate using observed cases.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Total Greene Climacteric Scale (GCS) Score and GCS Subscores at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>GCS: a 21 item evaluation of symptoms which asked participants how bothered they were with particular symptom at the moment. Each item was scored as 0 = Not at all, 1 = A little, 2 = Quite a bit, and 3 = Extremely. A total score was derived from the sum of the 21 items (range 0-63). GCS was also used to generate 6 individual scores (psychological symptoms [range 0-33], anxiety [range 0-18], depression [range 0-15], somatic symptoms [range 0-21], vasomotor symptoms [range 0-6], and sexual dysfunction [range 0-3]). A decrease in the total climacteric score indicated an improvement in symptoms.</description>

          <description>Severity ranged from mild (sensation of heat without sweating); moderate (sensation of heat with sweating; able to continue activity) to severe (sensation of heat with sweating; causing cessation of activity). The average daily severity of hot flushes for each time period was calculated as (1*Number of mild+2*Number of moderate+3*Number of severe)/(Total number of hot flushes). For the days with no hot flushes, the severity score was set as 0. As this was derived from the count data, there was no maximum; the minimum score was 0; the higher values showed worse outcomes.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Adjusted Means in the Hot Flush Severity Score at Month 6 and Month 12</title>
        <description>Severity: mild (heat sensation without sweating); moderate (heat sensation with sweating; able to continue activity); severe (heat sensation with sweating; causing cessation of activity). Average daily severity of hot flushes= (1*Number of mild+2*Number of moderate+3*Number of severe)/(Total number of hot flushes). Days with no hot flushes: severity score=0. As it was derived from count data, there was no maximum; minimum score=0; higher values= worse outcomes. Adjusted mean: calculated using change from baseline=response variable, treatment=factor and baseline=covariate using observed cases.</description>

Each item was scored as 0 = Not at all, 1 = A little, 2 = Quite a bit, and 3 = Extremely. A total score was derived from the sum of the 21 items (range 0-63). GCS was also used to generate 6 individual scores (psychological symptoms [range 0-33], anxiety [range 0-18], depression [range 0-15], somatic symptoms [range 0-21], vasomotor symptoms [range 0-6], and sexual dysfunction [range 0-3]). A decrease in the total climacteric score indicated an improvement in symptoms.</description>

        <description>GCS: a 21 item evaluation of symptoms which asked participants how bothered they were with particular symptom at the moment. Each item was scored as 0 = Not at all, 1 = A little, 2 = Quite a bit, and 3 = Extremely. A total score was derived from the sum of the 21 items (range 0-63). GCS was also used to generate 6 individual scores (psychological symptoms [range 0-33], anxiety [range 0-18], depression [range 0-15], somatic symptoms [range 0-21], vasomotor symptoms [range 0-6], and sexual dysfunction [range 0-3]). A decrease in the total climacteric score indicated an improvement in symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Total Greene Climacteric Scale (GCS) Score and GCS Subscores at Month 12</title>
        <description>GCS: a 21 item evaluation of symptoms which asked participants how bothered they were with particular symptom at the moment. Each item was scored as 0 = Not at all, 1 = A little, 2 = Quite a bit, and 3 = Extremely. A total score was derived from the sum of the 21 items (range 0-63). GCS was also used to generate 6 individual scores (psychological symptoms [range 0-33], anxiety [range 0-18], depression [range 0-15], somatic symptoms [range 0-21], vasomotor symptoms [range 0-6], and sexual dysfunction [range 0-3]). A decrease in the total climacteric score indicated an improvement in symptoms.</description>
