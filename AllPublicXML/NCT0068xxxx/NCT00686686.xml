  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with psoriasis will receive intravenous infliximab 5 mg/kg given over a 2-hour
      period at Weeks 0, 2, and 6 (induction therapy) to evaluate the efficacy of infliximab at
      Week 18. Subjects who achieved &gt;=75% improvement in Psoriasis Pustulosa Palmoplantaris Area
      and Severity Index (PPPASI) score at Week 8 AND had deterioration of PPPASI score of 50% from
      Week 8 until Week 12 were to receive an additional infusion at Week 12.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieve at Least 75% Improvement in Palmoplantar Psoriasis Activity Severity Index (PPPASI) After 3 Infusions.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The PPPASI score is an overall score of disease signs: extent, scales, erythema, erosions (fissures), induration and pustules. &quot;Extent&quot; is rated on a scale range from 0-6; all other signs are rated on a scale range from 0 to 4 in a target palm and/or sole. Total score range:0-26. A reduction in score is considered an improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieve a Moderate Response.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Moderate response is defined as a 50% to 75% reduction in PPPASI score from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Achieving Clear to Minimal PGA Score at Weeks 12 and 18.</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 12 and 18</time_frame>
    <description>The Physician Static Global Assessment (PGA) documents the physician's assessment of the subject's psoriasis status according to the following categories: induration, scaling, and erythema. Each category is rated from 0 to 5, where 0 represents no evidence of induration/scaling/erythema (&quot;clear&quot;), 1 represents &quot;minimal&quot; induration/scaling/erythema, and 5 represents the most severe induration/scaling/erythema.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Respond to the Fourth Infusion.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 and Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>&gt;=25% reduction in PPPASI score would be considered a response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific quality of life (QOL) instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on a subject's QOL. It is a 10-item questionnaire that can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect QOL: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships, and treatment. The DLQI was completed by the subject prior to the PPPASI and PGA evaluations.
The DLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>

        <title>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific quality of life (QOL) instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on a subject's QOL. It is a 10-item questionnaire that can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect QOL: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships, and treatment. The DLQI was completed by the subject prior to the PPPASI and PGA evaluations.
The DLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>
