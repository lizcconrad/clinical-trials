  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of an
      extended-release (ER) formulation of pramipexole in comparison with placebo for the treatment
      of fibromyalgia.

      The objective of the open-label phase is to assess the safety profile and effect of
      Pramipexole (PPX) extended-release (ER) in fibromyalgia patients over a 24-week period.

    <measure>The Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey, Physical Functioning Subscale (Change From Baseline).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 29</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 Health Survey is a self-administered 36-item instrument completed by the patient .

    <measure>Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) Total Score (Change From Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 29</time_frame>
    <description>FIQ is a self-reported scale completed by the patient that measures patient status, progress, and outcomes over the past week.
The FIQ is composed of a total of 20 items; the first 11 items measure physical functioning, and each item is rated on a four-point Likert scale. Items 12 and 13 measure the number of days the patient felt well and the number of days the patient felt unable to work due to their fibromyalgia symptoms. Items 14 through 20 are numerical, 11-point Likert scales (marked in 10-point increments) on which the patient rates work difficulty, pain, fatigue, morning tiredness, stiffness, anxiety, and depression. The total score ranges from 0 to 80. A higher score indicates a more negative impact</description>

    <measure>Euroqol- 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Survey (Change From Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 29</time_frame>
    <description>The Euroqol- 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Health Survey is a generic, multidimensional, health related, quality-of-life instrument that contains two parts-a health status profile and a visual analog scale (VAS) to rate global health-related quality of life. The profile contains five items corresponding to five health domains- mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood. A single score is generated for each health state. Data from the EQ-5D can be converted into 243 unique health states. For each health state, there exists a corresponding valuation that allows the patient's health to be represented as an index, which is a value between -0.594 and 1; the higher the score, the better the quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 29</time_frame>
    <description>The Tender Point Pain Threshold will be assessed for all 18 tender points by a study clinician. A dolorimeter will be used to exert the pressure at each point and to measure the threshold reading; when the patient first indicates pain, the threshold will be recorded in kg/sq.cm ;If the patient reports pain before 1.0 kg/sq.cm is reached (&gt;0 kg/sq.cm), 1.0 kg/sq.cm will be entered. If the patient does not report pain when the maximum pressure is applied (10.0 kg/sq.cm),0 (no pain) will be entered.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 Health Survey is a self-administered 36-item instrument completed by the patient .
SF 36 has subscales as follows: i) physical functioning (PF), ii) role limitations due to physical problems (RP), iii) bodily pain (BP), iv) general health perceptions (GH), v) vitality (VT), vi) social function (SF), vii) role limitations due to emotional problems (RE), viii) mental health (MH),ix)physical component summary (PCS)and x)mental component summary(MCS).
Among the subscales, Physical functioning was key secondary endpoint while other were additional secondary endpoints.
Each domain is scored by summing the individual items and transforming the scores into a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores indicating better health status or functioning. The number of items per domain varies from 2 to 1</description>

The FIQ is composed of a total of 20 items; the first 11 items measure physical functioning, and each item is rated on a four-point Likert scale. Items 12 and 13 measure the number of days the patient felt well and the number of days the patient felt unable to work due to their fibromyalgia symptoms. Items 14 through 20 are numerical, 11-point Likert scales (marked in 10-point increments) on which the patient rates work difficulty, pain, fatigue, morning tiredness, stiffness, anxiety, and depression. The total score ranges from 0 to 80. A higher score indicates a more negative impact</description>

The profile contains five items corresponding to five health domains- mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood. A single score is generated for each health state. Data from the EQ-5D can be converted into 243 unique health states. For each health state, there exists a corresponding valuation that allows the patient’s health to be represented as an index, which is a value between -0.594 and 1; the higher the score, the better the quality of life.</description>
