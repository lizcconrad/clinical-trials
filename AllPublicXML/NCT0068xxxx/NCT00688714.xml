  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AZD6482 is a new drug substance aiming to prevent blood clots which may arise in
      atherosclerotic blood vessels and cause myocardial infarction or stroke. This is the first
      study with AZD6482 in humans. The primary aim for this study is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of AZD6482 in healthy human volunteers. How the substance is metabolised and
      eliminated from the body will also be studied. This will be done by comparing the effect of
      single ascending doses of AZD6482 to placebo (inactive substance).
