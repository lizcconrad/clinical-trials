    <textblock>
      This study is a 5-year continuation of &quot;The Mediterranean Lifestyle Program.&quot; The purpose of
      this follow-up study is to determine the long-term effects from prior participation in an
      intervention promoting healthful eating, exercise, quitting smoking, stress management, and
      social support. Participants are post-menopausal women with type 2 diabetes.

    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death and functional limitations among
      women in the U.S. Postmenopausal women with diabetes are at especially high risk of CHD, but
      CHD research with this population is very limited. This project addresses the poorly
      understood &quot;natural history&quot; of long-term maintenance of change in multiple behaviors (i.e.,
      dietary, physical activity, social support, smoking cessation, and stress management) related
      to CHD risk, as well as the effects of theoretically important mediating variables on relapse
      and maintenance. The study is a continuation of a research project that has already
      demonstrated significant and consistent positive effects of a lifestyle change intervention
      on reduction of behavioral CHD risk factors. This research relies on a framework that
      synthesizes social-cognitive, social-ecologic, and goal-systems theories.
