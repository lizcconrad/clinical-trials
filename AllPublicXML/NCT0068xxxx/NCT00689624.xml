  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of FOLOFOXIRI plus Cetuximab combination in young
      patients with good performance status with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of FOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab is reasonable safe regimen especially for
      patients with good performance status. The estimated benefit from the combination is greater
      than the possible risk, especially for the patients who will become resectable after
      treatment. It will be extremely interesting to evaluate the resectability rate of this
      specific group of patient with good performance status and unresectable disease when they are
      treated with all active chemotherapeutic agents and cetuximab

             cervical carcinoma. curatively treated

          -  Patients treated with palliative radiotherapy had to have measurable metastatic
             disease outside the irradiation fields.

          -  Patients with severe cardiac dysfunction, liver metastases involving more than 50% of
             the liver parenchyma, chronic diarrhea, or prior irradiation affecting more than 30%
