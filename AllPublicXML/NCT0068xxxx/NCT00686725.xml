  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of early postsurgery
      temozolomide chemotherapy followed by the standard temozolomide regimen, compared to the
      standard regimen alone, for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma
      multiforme.

    <measure>Objective Tumor Assessment After Surgery: Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response was based on neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), clinical neurological examination, and steroid administration.
It was assessed as follows:
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all enhancing tumor (measurable
or non-measurable), no corticosteroid use, and neurologically stable or
improved.
Partial Response (PR): ≥50% reduction in size of enhancing tumor
(measurable or non-measurable) for any measurable lesions or definite
improvement for any non-measurable lesions, corticosteroid dosage stable or
reduced, and neurologically stable or improved.
Progressive Disease (PD): ≥25% increase in contrast enhancement for any
measurable lesions or definite worsening for any non-measurable lesions, or
any new tumor on MRI scans, at an increased dose of corticosteroid, with or without neurologic progression. Clinical or radiological worsening resulting from other than tumor factors were excluded.
Stable Disease (SD): All other situations.</description>

    <description>Standard therapy regimen:
Treatment will start 4 weeks after surgery. Temozolomide will be administered concomitantly with radiotherapy, at 75 mg/m^2/day orally for 42 days. Four weeks after completing concomitant radiotherapy, temozolomide will be administered for an additional six cycles. Each cycle will last 28 days, and temozolomide will be administered once daily from Day 1 to Day 5 of each cycle. The dose of temozolomide in the first cycle will be 150 mg/m^2/day, and may be increased to 200 mg/m^2/day for Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles depending on nonhematological toxicity observed and neutrophil and platelet count values. Capsules containing 20 mg or 100 mg of temozolomide will be used.
Radiotherapy will be administered in combination with temozolomide. Radiotherapy will be administered for a total daily dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions, 5 days a week for 6 weeks.</description>

It was assessed as follows:
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all enhancing tumor (measurable

improved.
Partial Response (PR): ≥50% reduction in size of enhancing tumor
(measurable or non-measurable) for any measurable lesions or definite
improvement for any non-measurable lesions, corticosteroid dosage stable or
reduced, and neurologically stable or improved.
Progressive Disease (PD): ≥25% increase in contrast enhancement for any
measurable lesions or definite worsening for any non-measurable lesions, or
any new tumor on MRI scans, at an increased dose of corticosteroid, with or without neurologic progression. Clinical or radiological worsening resulting from other than tumor factors were excluded.

Treatment with temozolomide alone will start 2 weeks after surgery at 75 mg/m^2/day orally for 14 days. Then, starting on Day 29 after surgery, temozolomide will be administered according to standard treatment as described for the temozolomide + radiation arm (standard therapy regimen).
Radiotherapy will be administered in combination with temozolomide. Radiotherapy will be administered for a total daily dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions, 5 days a week for 6 weeks.</description>

Treatment will start 4 weeks after surgery. Temozolomide will be administered concomitantly with radiotherapy, at 75 mg/m^2/day orally for 42 days. Four weeks after completing concomitant radiotherapy, temozolomide will be administered for an additional six cycles. Each cycle will last 28 days, and temozolomide will be administered once daily from Day 1 to Day 5 of each cycle. The dose of temozolomide in the first cycle will be 150 mg/m^2/day, and may be increased to 200 mg/m^2/day for Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles depending on nonhematological toxicity observed and neutrophil and platelet count values. Capsules containing 20 mg or 100 mg of temozolomide will be used.
Radiotherapy will be administered in combination with temozolomide. Radiotherapy will be administered for a total daily dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions, 5 days a week for 6 weeks.</description>
