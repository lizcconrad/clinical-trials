      Objectives:The purpose of the study is to explore the efficacy and safety of H1-Coil deep
      brain rTMS in subjects with negative symptoms and cognitive deficits of schizophrenia
      (deficit syndrome), currently treated with atypical antipsychotics.

      Patient Population: The intention is to treat 45 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, who
      are currently suffering mainly from negative symptoms and cognitive deficits (deficit
      syndrome). The patients will be of all racial, ethnic and gender categories, ranging from 18
      to 65 years of age, and have PANSS negativeâ‰¥21 and PANSS positive&lt;24. Patients will be
      recruited from both academic and private research centers.

      Structure: The study is a randomized, prospective, 8 weeks, double blind study. Blinding: The
      treatment administrator and the study personnel and patients will be masked to the treatment
      being administrated.

      Concurrent Control: The study group will receive active rTMS treatment and the control group
      will receive an inactive, sham treatment.
