    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC: Either histologic or cytologic proof
             of a newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer is required. A biopsy with histology
             is preferred, but cytology is allowed. Histology or cytology from involved mediastinal
             or supraclavicular lymph nodes alone will be allowed if a separate distal primary
             lesion is clearly evident on radiographs (i.e., a second biopsy will not be required).

          -  Patients with two or more parenchymal lesions on same or opposite sides of the lung
             are ineligible.

          -  Must have unresectable Stage IIIA (N2) or IIIB disease and also satisfy the following
             criteria:

          -  Unresectable Stage IIIA (N2) patients:

               -  N2 mediastinal lymph nodes must be multiple and/or bulky on CT scan or X-ray,
                  such that, in the opinion of the treating investigator, the patient is not a
                  candidate for induction chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy followed by surgical
                  resection.

               -  N2 status must be documented by any one of the following methods:

               -  Histologic or cytologic proof of N2 disease by exploratory thoracotomy,
                  thoracoscopy, mediastinoscopy, mediastinotomy, Wang needle biopsy, fine needle
                  aspiration under bronchoscopic or CT guidance or other method

               -  Node positivity by PET scan

               -  Nodes &gt;2 cm on CT scan

               -  Paralyzed left true vocal cord with separate left lung primary distinct from AP
                  window nodes on CT Scan

          -  Stage IIIB patients:

          -  Pathologic documented or radiographically documented positive N3 nodes.

          -  Patients with positive supraclavicular or scalene lymph nodes must not have disease
             extending up into the cervical region evidenced by one of the following:

               -  Fine needle aspiration, core needle biopsy or excisional biopsy of
                  supraclavicular N3 nodes

               -  Biopsy of contralateral mediastinal N3 nodes by mediastinoscopy, mediastinotomy,
                  or thoracotomy

               -  Fine needle aspiration, core needle or Wang needle biopsy under CT or
                  bronchoscopic fluoroscopic guidance of enlarged contralateral N3 mediastinal
                  nodes

               -  Contralateral mediastinal nodes &gt;2 cm on CT scan

               -  Contralateral node positivity on PET scan

               -  Right sided primary with paralyzed left true vocal cord

          -  Any of the following T4 lesions: Tumor of any size that invades any of the following:
             mediastinum, heart, great vessels, trachea, esophagus, vertebral body or carina:

               -  Written documentation of type of T4 extent by attending surgeon if the patient
                  has had an exploratory thoracotomy or thoracoscopy

               -  T4 involvement of the heart, esophagus, aorta, or vertebral body documented by CT
                  scan, MRI or transesophageal ultrasound

               -  T4 involvement of the mediastinum may also be accepted by CT or MRI criteria if,
                  in absence of the above organ involvement, there is a soft tissue extension
                  directly into the mediastinal space.

          -  Radiographic criteria for involvement of main pulmonary artery or vein is allowed only
             if there is a mediastinal soft tissue mass.

             testing. (Predicted FEV1= FEV1 x % perfusion to uninvolved lung from quantitative lung
             V/Q scan report)

          -  Must have one measurable lesion by chest X-ray or CT scan. Lesion(s) must be
