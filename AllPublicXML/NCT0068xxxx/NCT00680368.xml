      OBJECTIVES: To develop, assess feasibility, and test the validity of the Resident Supervision
      Index (RSI), a survey tool for medical residents designed to measure quantitatively the level
      of supervision the resident received while caring for an outpatient during a patient care
      encounter.

      RESEARCH DESIGN: This is a prospective trial assessing the Residency Supervision Index
      (Index) applied to outpatient care encounters for content validity, test-retest reliability,
      and construct validity.

      OBJECTIVES: To develop, assess feasibility, and test the validity of the Resident Supervision
      Index (RSI), a survey tool for medical residents designed to measure quantitatively the level
      of supervision the resident received while caring for an outpatient during a patient care
      encounter.

      RESEARCH DESIGN: This is a prospective trial assessing the Residency Supervision Index
      (Index) applied to outpatient care encounters for test-retest reliability and construct
      validity.

      METHODOLOGY: Trained interviewers administered the Index during face-to-face and in-clinic
      interviews with 60 consenting resident physicians and their 37 consenting attending
      physicians to descsribe the care they provided to 143 patients at the outpatient clinics
      involving 148 clinical encounters at the Loma Linda VA Medical Center.

      For each encounter, data comes from administering the Resident Supervision Index to the
      resident and attending. Baseline data describing each subject (attending physicians and
      resident physicians) came from face-to-face interviews.

      Test-retest reliability is assessed by re-administering the Index to residents for within 24
      hours of the encounter. Concurrent validity is assessed by re-administering the Index to the
      attending physician responsible for the patient's care.

      CLINICAL RELATIONSHIPS: The study will help our understanding of how residents at VA medical
      centers receive training and are supervised for the purpose of both education and patient
      outcomes.

      IMPACT/SIGNIFICANCE: The instrument is planned for future studies to assess the association
      between resident supervision and training outcomes, clinical workload, patient outcomes,
      quality of care, and care costs.

    <description>This group contains the residents and the attending physicians who consented to participate in the study. They participated in a survey administered by a research assistant. Both physician resident and attending physicians were administered the survey twice within 24-hours and their test-retest responses were compared for reliability. Responses to attending and resident physicians covering the care for the patient and clinical care encounter were compared for accuracy.</description>

          <description>The study began with 112 responders: 75 physician residents and 37 attending physicians. Only 60 of the 75 residents had been supervised by one of the 37 participating attending physicians. Thus, 15 residents were dropped from study. Both resident and their attending physician were surveyed to report total supervision time for each of 148 clinical encounters with 143 patients. There were more clinical encounters than patients because some patients had more than one encounter. There were more physician residents than attending physicians because attending physicians may have supervised more than one resident. There were more clinical encounters than residents because a resident may be involved in more than one clinical encounter with a patient.</description>
