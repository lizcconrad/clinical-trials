      The purpose of this research is to increase community awareness about the relationship
      between physical activity, screen time, and nutrition and how these factors influence healthy
      weight management.

      The problem of obesity is at epidemic proportions and has become the most important public
      health problem confronting the United States today. Of greatest concern is the 300% increase
      in obesity rates among children and youth over the past twenty years. Childhood obesity is a
      precursor of adult obesity.

      The Switch™ Program is a unique community and family-based behavior change initiative that
      helps motivate children to change three critical health behaviors that are risk factors for
      childhood overweight and obesity. Through community education, family-based strategies and
      partnerships with schools, 3rd, 4th and 5th graders are encouraged to: Switch what you Do™
      Switch what you View™ Switch what you Chew™.

    <description>1300 students (male and female) were recruited through two separate school districts in Lakeville, Minnesota and Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Informed consents went to all students who chose to participate. Demonstration and Control school were randomly selected. Baseline data was collected regarding physical activity, screen time, and nutrition, standard body measurements, and baseline data, and salivary cortisol levels were taken. Parent and teacher surveys were also conducted. After baseline selected demonstration sites and students were provided with information focused on improving healthy behaviors while the control sites served as matched comparison groups.</description>
