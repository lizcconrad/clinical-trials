  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that application of 4% Chlorhexidine to the cord stump and
      meticulous hand washing by primary health care providers of newborn infants will reduce the
      incidence of Omphalitis and thereby Neonatal Mortality as compared to standardized dry cord
      care.

    <textblock>
      The prime objective of this study is to estimate the independent effect of 4% Chlorhexidine
      solution application to cord stump and hand washing with soap by mothers of newborns for 2
      weeks after birth in reducing Omphalitis in neonates compared to routine cord care by TBAs
      (Traditional Birth Attendant) in rural district of Sindh, Pakistan.

      This study will be conducted in existing health infrastructure in a community setting with
      the help of two principal health care providers, TBAs and CHWs Community Health Workers)
      involved in maternal and newborn care. The TBAs conducting delivery wil be trained to wash
      hands with soap and water after completion of delivery and apply chlorhexidine to the
      Umbilical Cord Stump. The procedure will be repeated by the mother on the subsequent days up
      til 14 days from birth. The CHWs will also be trained to recognized signs of Omphalitis and
      record Cord Care in a systemic manner in a structured proforma.

      The study will continue longitudinally for a period of one year to follow newborn for the
      signs of Omphalitis.
