  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Rosuvastatin with
      Atorvastatin by assessing the change of LDL-C in patients with hypercholesterolemia and
      history of coronary heart disease (CHD) or risk equivalent, or a 10 year CHD risk of no less
      than 10%, following 6-week treatment and a possible 6 week extension treatment.
