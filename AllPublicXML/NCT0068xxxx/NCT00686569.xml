  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative anastomotic leakage is a serious complication in patients with oesophageal or
      cardia cancer. Early diagnosis and treatment are mandatory. The primary aim of the present
      study is to investigate the clinical use of mediastinal microdialysis and whether is able to
      detect anastomotic leakage prior to the development of clinical symptoms.

    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing oesophageal or cardia resection for cancer are monitored by mediastinal
      microdialysis during the postoperative period. Subcutaneous microdialysis serves as a
      control. Samples are collected every 4-hour. Samples will be analyzed continuously but the
      results will not be included in the clinical evaluation of the patient.

      A total of 30 patients will be included in this pilot study. The results of the mediastinal
      microdialyses will be compared with the clinical course in each patient. The results form the
      uncomplicated courses will be used to define the normal variations in mediastinal
      microdialysis. This will be compared to results from patients with various complications.
