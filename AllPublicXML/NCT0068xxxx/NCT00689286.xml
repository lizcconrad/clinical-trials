    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritic changes in the knee are a common cause of pain that restricts the subject's
      ability to move and may lead to surgical intervention with total knee replacement. Quadriceps
      muscle strengthening has been shown to improve the dynamic stability of the knee, decreasing
      pain during locomotion and increasing knee function. However, the gains associated with
      improved quadriceps strength have been difficult to achieve on a routine clinical basis
      because the currently available ways to increase muscle strength- through voluntary exercise
      or surface electrical stimulation- have significant practical problems that limit their use.
      The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      neuromuscular stimulation using implantable microstimulators called BIONs to improve the
      strength, range of motion, and health of the knee in patients with knee osteoarthritis. This
      investigation is expected to last 12 weeks for each study participant; the trial will be
      completed over a 3-year period. Patients recruited into the study will have advanced knee
      osteoarthritis for which total knee replacement surgery is being considered. The proposed
      study extends a feasibility study carried out in Milan, Italy on five patients with knee
      osteoarthritis, who were implanted with BIONs.

      Knee Osteoarthritis is a common problem with people over the age of 50 and is often
      debilitating because of the challenges it poses to normal walking function. Research has
      shown that exercise can lessen the effect of the osteoarthritis in the knee if done
      diligently. BIONÂ®s implanted in the thigh can produce contractions of the quadriceps muscles
      without much movement of the knee joint, an advantage if moving the knee is painful. In this
      study, teh subjects will be divided into three groups. Two groups of experimental subjects
      will receive stimulation using BIONs. The first group will have a stimulation paradigm like
      that used in a previous feasibility study that preceded the proposed trial, using
      low-frequency (1-5 PPS) &quot;twitch&quot; stimulation. The second group will have a stimulation
      paradigm in which tetanic-frequency stimulation (25-50 PPS) is used to produce fused muscle
      contractions. A third group of experimental subjects will have a standardized program of
      voluntary exercise.. In Groups 1 and 2, the femoral nerve will be stimulated electrically
      according to the assigned protocol during the 12 week experimental period after implantation
      of the devices. Individuals assigned to Group 3, receiving conventional exercise therapy for
      12 weeks, will be allowed to receive BIONs at the end of the trial, providing they request
      BION therapy and they have been at least minimally compliant with the exercises. All
      participants will be eligible to continue treatment following the initial 12 weeks if
      medically appropriate and resources permit.
