  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic insomnia is thought to occur as a result of hyperarousal. While there is a wealth of
      data to support this position, there is a lack of research to define how hyperarousal
      interferes with sleep initiation, maintenance, and the perception of sleep quality and
      quantity. We propose to use Event-related Potential (ERP) techniques to evaluate information
      processing at sleep onset and during sleep. ERP measures of information processing have been
      well established in good sleepers; they have not been, however, applied to the problem of
      insomnia. The goal of the project is to examine the premise that the occurrence and severity
      of insomnia is fundamentally related to a neurobiologic preparedness to &quot;attend to&quot; and
      &quot;identify&quot; environmental stimuli. Following an extensive screening, patients with insomnia
      and good sleepers will participate in two experimental conditions, requiring that they spend
      four nights in the sleep laboratory over a two week period. ERP data will be gathered prior
      to, following, and during sleep.

      The ultimate objectives for this line of research are to determine 1) if insomnia is
      associated with a failure to inhibit information processing at sleep onset and/or during
      sleep, 2) if the failure to inhibit information processing at sleep onset and/or during sleep
      is associated with the occurrence and/or severity of insomnia symptoms, 3) what brain regions
      are functioning differently so as to give rise to information processing abnormalities, and
      4) the extent to which pharmacologic and/or Cognitive Behavioral treatment for insomnia
      alters information processing abnormalities and/or the associated brain activity.

        Inclusion Criteria for Psychophysiologic Insomnia (PI)

        These subjects will meet RDC criteria for Psychophysiologic insomnia. In addition, the
        complaint of disturbed sleep will have at least one of the following minimal
        characteristics:

          -  &gt; 30 min. sleep-onset latency (SL) (Initial Insomnia)

          -  &gt;2 awakenings per night (&gt;15 min. ea.) and/or wake after sleep-onset (WASO) of &gt; 30
             min (Middle Insomnia)

        Total Sleep Time (TST) will not exceed 6 hours [unless the Sleep Efficiency (SE) quotient
        is &lt; 80%] and the problem frequency must be &gt; 4 nights/week (Severe Insomnia) with a
        problem duration &gt; 6 months (Chronic Insomnia)B .

        Inclusion Criteria for Good Sleeper Subjects

          -  Report that they obtain enough sleep and that their sleep is restorative

          -  Have a score of less than 10 on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)50-52

          -  Have a score of less than 15 on the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST)53

          -  Have a score of less than 7 on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)54

          -  Report retrospectively and prospectively &lt; 15 minutes to fall asleep and &quot;wake after
             sleep onset time&quot; of &lt; 15 minutes and a total sleep time &gt; 6 hoursA

        A These profiles will be evident at both intake (based on retrospective reports) and as an
        average from the two weeks of baseline diaries (based on prospective sampling).

        Exclusion Criteria for All Subjects

        â€¢ Unstable medical illness or acute or history of psychiatric illness (except GAD or MDD -
        Allowed provided that these have resolved and not recurred within 5 years) As ascertained
        with self report questionnaires, a clinical History, a physical exam and a clinical
        chemistry profile.

        To assure that the insomnia is not secondary to these factors

          -  Symptoms suggestive of sleep disorders other than insomnia To assure that the insomnia
             is not secondary to these factors

          -  Polysomnographic data indicating sleep disorders other than insomnia To assure that
             the insomnia is not secondary to these factors

          -  History of head injury with a sustained loss of consciousness To help assure that the
             EEG measures are unconfounded by brain damage

          -  Evidence of active illicit substance use or fitting criteria for alcohol abuse or
             dependence To assure that the insomnia is not secondary to these factors

          -  Use of CNS active medications including antidepressants and hypnotics (within 2 weeks
             or 5 half-lives) To help assure that the EEG measures are unconfounded by medication
             effects such as the &quot;BZ artifact&quot;.

          -  Inadequate language comprehension To assure the quality of self report data as all the
             measures are in English.

          -  Pregnancy Excluded owing to the hormonal changes that occur with pregnancy

          -  Left Handedness To control for EEG differences related to handedness

          -  Nicotine Use To assure that the insomnia is not secondary to these factors

          -  Caffeine use that exceeds 2 beverages per day or occurs past 5pm in the evening.
