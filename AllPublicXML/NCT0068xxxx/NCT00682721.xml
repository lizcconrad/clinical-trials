  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will be examining the effects of suppressive valacyclovir therapy on the stability of
      vaginal flora in women who are seropositive for HSV-2. We have preliminary data that suggests
      the presence of HSV-2 increases the risk for Group B Streptococcus colonization as well as
      many other deleterious organisms (e.g. Streptococcus pseudoporcinus), in addition to
      increasing the risk for acquisition of BV-associated vaginal flora. We will be examining the
      effects of suppressive therapy on the vaginal flora of any HSV-2 seropositive woman.
