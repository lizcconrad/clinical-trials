  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess the reliability of the HIV

      Treatment Readiness Measure (HTRM) to assist clinicians in:

      (1) determining whether or not youth living with HIV are ready to initiate HAART and (2)
      identifying youth who may be in need of additional support services to facilitate their
      adherence to HAART. The current study will examine the psychometric properties of the HTRM
      and establish its test-retest reliability over a two week period. If the HTRM is found to be
      reliable, a subsequent study will examine its predictive validity.

        HIV-infected, English speaking youth between 13 and 24 years of age who are enrolled in
        care at an AMTU or collaborating site, not currently on HAART but planning to initiate
        HAART within the next two months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-positive youth, 13 years 0 days to 24 years 364 days of age

          -  Either HAART naïve (defined as never having taken HAART) or HAART experienced (defined
             as having had at least one experience taking HAART and not having taken HAART for 30
             days prior to study entry)

          -  Not currently on HAART, but planning to initiate HAART within the next 2 months based
             on provider recommendation

          -  Enrolled in care at an AMTU or a collaborating site

          -  Able to speak and understand English

          -  Willing to provide informed consent, or assent with parental permission (if required
             by the site IRB) for participation in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of cognitive impairment or other mental condition that limits his/her ability
             to complete the assessment (per PI or designee discretion)

          -  Determined by the PI (or designee) to be under the influence of psychoactive agents or
             intoxicated at the time of assessment to a degree that would interfere with successful
             completion of the questionnaire

          -  Visibly distraught or unstable

          -  Any clinical condition that would likely interfere with the participant's ability to
             complete the study

        Participants who are unable to speak English will be excluded from the initial testing of
        the HTRM's reliability and validity in keeping with traditional tool development
        strategies. If the initial study indicates that the English version of the HTRM is reliable
        and valid, appropriate methods will be employed to translate the instrument into Spanish
        and the reliability and validity will be re-examined for the Spanish version.
