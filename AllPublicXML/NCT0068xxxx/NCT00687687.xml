  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To estimate the antitumor activity of paclitaxel, carboplatin, plus BSI-201 in patients with
      recurrent or advanced uterine carcinosarcomas.

      Based on data generated by BiPar/Sanofi, it is concluded that iniparib does not possess
      characteristics typical of the PARP inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been
      fully elucidated, however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory,
      iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of
      DNA damage) in tumor cell lines, induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell
      lines, and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines.
      Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have advanced (stage III or IV), persistent or recurrent uterine
             carcinosarcoma with documented disease progression. Histologic confirmation of the
             original primary tumor is required.

          -  All patients must have measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined as at least
             one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest
             dimension to be recorded). Each lesion must be greater than 20 mm when measured by
             conventional techniques, including palpation, plain x-ray, CT, and MRI, or greater
             than 10 mm when measured by spiral CT.

          -  Patients must have at least one &quot;target lesion&quot; to be used to assess response on this
             protocol as defined by RECIST (Section 8.1). Tumors within a previously irradiated
             field will be designated as &quot;non-target&quot; lesions unless progression is documented or a
             biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of
             radiation therapy.

          -  Patients must have a GOG Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2.

          -  Adequate bone marrow,renal, hepatic, and neurological function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for management of uterine
             carcinosarcoma.

          -  Patients with a history of other invasive malignancies, with the exception of
             non-melanoma skin cancer and other specific malignancies as noted in Sections 3.23 and
             3.24 are excluded if there is any evidence of other malignancy being present within
             the last five years. Patients are also excluded if their previous cancer treatment
             contraindicates this protocol therapy.

          -  Patients who have received prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity
             or pelvis OTHER THAN for the treatment of uterine carcinosarcoma within the last five
             years are excluded. Prior radiation for localized cancer of the breast, head and neck,
             or skin is permitted, provided that it was completed more than three years prior to
             registration, and the patient remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease.

          -  Patients MAY have received prior adjuvant chemotherapy for localized breast cancer,
             provided that it was completed more than three years prior to registration, and that
             the patient remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease.

          -  Patients who have symptomatic or untreated brain metastases requiring concurrent
             treatment, inclusive of but not limited to surgery, radiation, and corticosteroids.

          -  Patients who have a significant history of cardiac disease, i.e., myocardial
             infarction (MI) within 6 months of study registration, unstable angina, congestive
             heart failure (CHF) with New York Heart Association (NYHA) &gt; class II, or uncontrolled
             hypertension.

          -  Patients who have a history of seizure disorder or are currently on anti-seizure
             medication.
