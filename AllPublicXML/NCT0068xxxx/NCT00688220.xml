  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine whether a new type of fabric, Celliant, can
      reduce elbow and wrist pain associated with chronic medical conditions such as carpel tunnel
      syndrome, arthritis or tennis elbow and whether it can increase blood flow and oxygenation
      levels in the arms and hands after wearing the material.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A new type of fabric, Celliant, is made from polymer yarns containing optically active
      particles (1-1.2 micron diameter titanium dioxide, quarts and aluminum oxide particles) with
      modify absorption, reflection and transmission of light in the visible and near infrared
      portion of the spectrum. It is believed that the Celliant particles increase skin
      illumination such taht cytochrome pigments and other enzymes are activated, leading to
      increased blood flow and oxygenation of the skin and neighboring soft tissues. In addition,
      numerous anecdotal reports from patients with chronic foot and arm pain indicate that wearing
      Celliant garments for even a few days leads to dramatic improvement in many different painful
      conditions. This is a single center, stratified, randomized, prospective, double-blind study.
      Questionnaires that subjects will be asked complete are 1) Visual Analog Scale, 2) Brief Pain
      Inventory, 3) McGill Short Form Pain Survey and 4) SF-36 Quality of Life Inventory.
