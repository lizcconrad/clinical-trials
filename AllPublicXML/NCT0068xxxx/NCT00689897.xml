      The objective of this study is to evaluate the associations between deqi, the effects of
      acupuncture and personality in primary dysmenorrhea and to characterize the nature of the
      deqi phenomenon on terms of the prevalence of sensations as well as the uniqueness of the
      sensations underlying the deqi experiment.

      The mechanism, by which acupuncture works is not yet clear, therefore there is no unequivocal
      consensus about styles and sensations of acupuncture. whether psychological factor has
      influences on the effects of acupuncture? This study will adopt international practices such
      as visual analogue scale (VAS) to objective evaluation. The confident degree, feeling degree
      for acupuncture and pain intensity were evaluated by the patient with VAS, and the pain VAS
      scores before and after acupuncture were recorded as the indexes for assessment of the
      therapeutic effect.
