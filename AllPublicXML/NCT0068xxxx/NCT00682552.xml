  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Relationship between HPV infection and cervical cancer is well established. Among the HPV
      types identified to date, 15 are classified as high risk HPV (HR-HPV). Detection of HR-HPV
      has been proposed to optimize cervical cancer screening.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective detection and quantification of HR-HPV in patients with proven CIN1 will be
      performed. Relationship between HR-HPV initial viral load and the CIN1 persistence will be
      evaluated.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The women whose last one FCV of screening put in evidence a LIEBG of the neck of the
             womb having been confirmed by the colposcopie.

          -  The inclusive patients will be of more than 18 years old. All the patients will be
             profitable of a regime of Social Security.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patients whose result of the colposcopie is clashing with that of the FCV of
             initial screening (normal collar, LIEHG or the other one).

          -  The patients having an antecedent of DREGS of the neck of the womb, that this one was
             or not handled

          -  The patients having had a hysterectomy.

          -  The patients incapable to receive the information enlightened on the progress and the
             objectives of the study

          -  The patients not having signed enlightened assent
