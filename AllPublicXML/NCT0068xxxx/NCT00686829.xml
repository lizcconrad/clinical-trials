  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide open-label vicriviroc to HIV treatment-experienced
      subjects who successfully completed 48 weeks of treatment on ACTG protocol A5211 (or who
      responded favorably to treatment but discontinued participation due to viral tropism shifts),
      and subjects who screened for ACTG A5211 and met all inclusion and exclusion criteria, but
      were unable to enroll due to protocol closure. Vicriviroc will be administered in combination
      with an optimized background antiviral regimen, chosen by the investigator based on results
      of genotype and phenotype testing, the subject's history of prior antiretroviral drug use,
      and drug toxicity. OBT must include at least 3 antiviral drugs (not including vicriviroc), 1
      of which is a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Successful completion of ACTG Protocol A5211, or favorable response in A5211 but
             discontinued due to tropism shift, or screened for A5211 and met inclusion/exclusion
             criteria but unable to enroll due to protocol closure.

          -  Subjects must also be on a ritonavir-containing antiretroviral regimen at entry, and
             have acceptable hematologic and laboratory parameters.

          -  Female subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use 2 reliable methods of
             contraception, including a barrier method, and must have a negative urine pregnancy
             test prior to dosing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of seizure or drug use that increases risk of seizure, current use of CYP3A4
             inducers, prior history of malignancy, active drug or alcohol use or dependence that
             would interfere with study requirements

          -  Females who are breast-feeding, pregnant, or plan to become pregnant

          -  Participation in a clinical trial with another investigational drug.

          -  Subjects with serious illness requiring systemic therapy and/or hospitalization must
             not begin VCV (if not already on VCV) until subject completes therapy or is clinically
             stable on therapy for at least 14 days prior to enrollment.
