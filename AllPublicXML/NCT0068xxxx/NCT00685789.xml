      on effects of acupuncture treatment for Bell's Palsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through long-term clinical practice，acupuncture treatment on facial paralysis has been
      generally proved effective；the large number of ancient and modern medical literature also
      have suggested that acupuncture is beneficial for facial paralysis. However,a scientific
      basis is still needed to be established to make sure the efficacy of acupuncture be
      recognized internationally.This study will adopt a series of international practice scales
      ,such as House Brackmann Scale,Facial Disability Index(FDI),World Health Organization Quality
      of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), Cattell Personality Factors (16PF),and Cancellation test to
      evaluate the role of deqi and neuropsychological factors in the acupuncture treatment for
      Bell's Palsy.
