  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if the less invasive monitors are as reliable for
      measuring heart function in patients undergoing liver transplantation as the more invasive
      pulmonary artery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary artery catheter (PAC)is considered the gold standard in monitoring of heart
      function during orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Placement of PAC is very invasive (it
      passes thorough the heart chambers and into the pulmonary artery) and its benefits on the
      outcomes have not been proven. This study compares two newer FDA approved much less invasive
      devices to the PAC. The two new devices assess the heart function based either on the
      peripheral arterial waveform alone (Vigileo, Edwards Lifesciences)or the combination of
      peripheral arterial waveform and chemical indicator dilution (LiDCO, Cambridge, UK).

        20 subjects will be enrolled in this observational study in the Liver Transplant Group; 10
        patients in the Other Surgery Control Group for a total of 30 subjects. Patients will be
        recruited from the Operating Room schedule. Written, informed consent will be obtained from
        each subject prior to surgery. All participants will be informed that they may decline to
        participate in, or withdraw from, the study at any time.
