  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to follow cohort of patients with aMCI in order to establish
      whether there are distinct subgroups in terms of evolution or aetiology, with distinct memory
      profiles and profiles of mesiotemporal atrophy and metabolic change

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The syndrome of &quot;amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment&quot; (aMCI) has been introduced for patients
      with intact activities of daily living, with a memory complaint and objective memory decline
      on neuropathological assessment, without significative change in other domains of cognition.
      Follow-up in these patients shows that the memory impairment may remain stable or improve,
      while it worsens or extends to other cognitive domains in others, indicating prodromal AD.
