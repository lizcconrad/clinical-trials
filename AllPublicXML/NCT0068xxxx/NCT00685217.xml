  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized multi-centre trial will recruit women with stress urinary incontinence who
      need surgical treatment for their condition. 300 women will be allocated either to receive a
      TVT Secur or a standard TVT surgical procedure. The main outcome is effectiveness of the
      procedure, determined using a 1-hour pad test (which tests for urine leakage) 12 months after
      surgery. The study will be carried out in 4 to 6 centers and will involve urogynaecologists,
      urologists and general obstetrician-gynaecologists: all clinicians will have received
      adequate training.
