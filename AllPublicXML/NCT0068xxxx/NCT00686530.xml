    <textblock>
      Examination of the fetal brain at autopsy is technically challenging because of marked
      fragility of the brain tissue. Studies have found postmortem fetal MR to be particularly
      useful in examining gross structural abnormalities in fetal brain and spine. We have recently
      included postmortem MR as part of the radiological studies for fetal autopsy workup. Using
      the same MR data, the development of normal layering of the brain, also called laminar
      organization, can also be assessed. This laminar organization of the brain is often disturbed
      in congenital malformations. Our aim is to study the disturbance in laminar organization of
      the postmortem brain with MR, using structural MR and a type of MR sequence called diffusion
      tensor imaging, which is well suited for assessing the organization of the developing brain.
      The postmortem MR findings will be compared with gold standard of histopathology. This will
      help us understand the abnormal development of gray and white matter in brain malformations.
      Knowledge gained from studying the abnormal laminar organization in brain malformations will
      serve as a reference for future studies of fetal brain malformations in-utero using MRI.

      1. Autopsy will be performed at Mount Sinai Hospital according to accepted current
           standards, based on clinical indications. Macroscopic examination of the fetus will be
           performed initially, followed by organ removal for tissue fixation for a period of two
           weeks. The brain is then scanned with MRI at the Hospital for Sick Children. The brain
           is transported in an air-tight container containing 10% formalin and sealed with
           paraffin lined tape. All brains will be anonymised and coded with a number prior to MRI
           examination. Following MR imaging, the tissue will be examined, sampled and reported in
           the usual fashion at Mount Sinai Hospital.

        2. Postmortem MR will be included as part of the autopsy examination in cases of suspected
           brain malformations. Postmortem MR will be performed at the Hospital for Sick Children
           due to availability of expertise in postmortem neuroimaging and imaging will be done
           using 1.5T GE CV/I MRI magnet (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI). Postmortem MR will be
           performed following dissection and tissue fixation to avoid any unnecessary delay in
           tissue fixation. The specimen will be scanned in an air-tight container containing
           formalin 10%, sealed with paraffin lined tape. Structural postmortem MR will include
           coronal spin-echo T1 (TR=517msec, TE=10msec, FOV=18cm, slice thickness=20-30mm,
           matrix=320x256), axial SPGR (TR=23msec, TE=8msec, FOV=18cm, slice thickness=1.1mm,
           matrix=256x256) and T2 imaging in three planes (TR=4115msec, TE=115msec, FOV=16cm, slice
           thickness=20-30mm, matrix=320x256). Diffusion tensor imaging (TR=8300msec, TE=99msec,
           FOV=180mm, slice thickness=2-3mm, b=700mm/sec2, NEX=8, matrix=128x128, 25 directions)
           will be performed in the coronal plane to match the histological sections of brain
           tissue in autopsy.

        3. Analysis. The laminar organization of the fetal cerebrum on structural MR and diffusion
           tensor imaging will be evaluated. In particular, the germinal matrix, intermediate zone,
           subplate and cortex will be assessed. This will be compared with the gold standard of
           histopathology. The presence or absence of corticospinal tracts will also be assessed
           and compared with macroscopic examination and histological sections.

        4. Statistical analysis. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of postmortem MR, both
           structural and diffusion tensor imaging, as compared to the gold standard of autopsy in
           assessing the abnormal laminar organization of fetal cerebrum will be evaluated.

    <description>Postmortem MR will be included as part of the autopsy examination in cases of suspected brain malformations. Imaging will be done using 1.5T GE CV/I MRI magnet. The specimen is scanned, following fixation, using an 8-channel head coil or 8-channel knee coil, depending on the size of the brain. Structural postmortem MR will include spin-echo T1, axial SPGR, and T2 imaging in three planes. Diffusion tensor imaging will be performed in the coronal plane.</description>
