      The purpose of this study is to determine how beta-glucan affects the immune system in
      subjects with non-small cell lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Beta-glucan (Imucell WGP) is an over-the-counter dietary supplement that enhances the body's
      immune system. Imucell WGP is extracted from food-grade baker's yeast, which is permitted for
      use in food by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Studies in animals have shown
      that Imucell WGP helps trigger white blood cells to destroy cancer cells. Other animal
      studies combining Imucell WGP with anti-cancer medications have shown greater tumor
      regression and tumor-free survival.
