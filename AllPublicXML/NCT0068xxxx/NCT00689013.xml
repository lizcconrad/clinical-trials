  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether pharmacist-driven patient interventions can
      have an effect on the number of herpes zoster (Zostavax) vaccinations given in a community
      pharmacy setting.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies exist documenting the perception and satisfaction of patients receiving
      immunizations from pharmacists, as well as the effects of pharmacist involvement in
      advocating and administering vaccinations. The most well documented studies have been
      conducted in hospital settings. Undoubtedly, there is enormous opportunity for the community
      pharmacist to identify potential vaccine recipients, advocate immunization and administer
      said immunizations to their established patient populations. However, there is a lack of
      concentrated study in the implementation of immunization services in the community setting
      and their effects. The investigators intend to evaluate the intervention of pharmacists in an
      immunization program and the resulting changes in immunization rates.

    <description>On Day 1 of the 2nd month, a personalized letter (addressing specific patient) was mailed to current pharmacy patients with indications for the Zostavax vaccine. Current patients were defined as those receiving at least one prescription medication from the pharmacy within 6 months. The personalized letter provided detailed information about herpes zoster infection, the vaccine for herpes zoster prevention, indications for vaccine receipt and contraindications for vaccine receipt.</description>
