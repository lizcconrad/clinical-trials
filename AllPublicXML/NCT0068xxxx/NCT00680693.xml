  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common and disabling functional disorder characterized by
      significant abdominal discomfort and disturbed defecation. It affects over 10% of U.S. adults
      (14% women, 8% men), resulting in major disability, impaired quality of life, and a
      significant health-care burden. Conventional management of IBS is only partially effective in
      some patients and includes use of medications, behavioral modification, dietary approaches,
      and lifestyle changes such as exercise and stress reduction. Although behavioral treatments
      such as cognitive behavioral therapy and hypnosis have been among the most effective
      treatments, they are costly to deliver.

      Mindfulness meditation, a complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) therapy taught in groups,
      is a unique self-regulatory, mind-body approach in which practitioners learn to attend to
      present-moment experiences, letting go of fixation on negative emotions and thoughts of past
      and future. It has been found to be effective in reducing chronic pain and stress and in
      ameliorating disorders with similarities to IBS, including fibromyalgia, headache, and
      depression.

      The overall goals of this exploratory, pilot study of women with IBS are to compare
      mindfulness meditation training to a patient support group (a previously validated control
      condition) in a small, randomized controlled clinical trial, in order to assess the
      feasibility of a larger, definitive trial. Specific aims are to evaluate primary and
      secondary outcome measures, to assess expectancy of benefit and scales measuring mindfulness
      (process measures), and to identify barriers to conducting such a trial in our setting. Sixty
      women meeting Rome II diagnostic criteria for IBS will be randomly assigned to one of two
      treatments - mindfulness meditation training or a support group - and will undergo 8 weekly
      group sessions plus a single day-long session. The primary outcome measure is improvement on
      the validated Irritable Bowel Symptom Severity Scale from pretreatment to the end of
      treatment, with follow-up at 3, 6, and 12 months. Additional variables address alternative
      endpoints (e.g., Adequate Relief of IBS symptoms, disease specific quality of life) and
      mechanism of treatment effects (e.g., coping scales, psychological symptoms, Visceral
      Sensitivity Scale). The multidisciplinary research team includes physicians, psychologists,
      and educators.
