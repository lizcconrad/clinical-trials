          3. Patients with Islet cell carcinomas or pancreatic NET

          4. Patients who received prior therapy with VEGF pathway inhibitor within 4 weeks prior
             to study entry

          5. Patients who entered PRRT within 3 months prior to study entry

          6. Patients who received CT, biotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to study
             entry

          7. Patients who have previously received systemic mTOR inhibitors

          8. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to everolimus or other rapamycins or to its
             excipients

          9. Patients with uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases

         10. Patients receiving chronic systemic treatment with corticosteroids or another

             cervix

         16. Female patients who are pregnant or breast feeding, or adults of reproductive
             potential who are not using effective birth control methods

         17. Patients who are using other investigational agents or who had received
             investigational drugs ≤ 4 weeks prior to study treatment start
