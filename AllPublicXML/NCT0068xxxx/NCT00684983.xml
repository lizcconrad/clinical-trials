      This randomized phase II trial studies capecitabine and lapatinib ditosylate to see how well
      they work compared with capecitabine, lapatinib ditosylate, and cixutumumab in treating
      patients with previously treated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive
      stage IIIB-IV breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as cixutumumab, can block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It
      is not yet known whether capecitabine and lapatinib ditosylate are more effective when given
      with or without cixutumumab in treating breast cancer that has spread nearby or to other
      areas of the body.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare progression-free survival of HER2+ breast cancer patients randomized to receive
      lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate) and capecitabine +/- IMC-A12 (cixutumumab).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of lapatinib and capecitabine +/- IMC-A12 in HER2+
      breast cancer patients.

      II. To compare the overall survival time, time to treatment failure, confirmed tumor response
      rate, and duration of response of lapatinib and capecitabine +/- IMC-A12 in HER2+ breast
      cancer patients.

      III. To assess patient compliance per treatment arm and to compare overall quality of life
      and treatment side effects via patient-reported outcomes between treatment arms.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the role of expression patterns and/or activation of insulin-like growth
      factor (IGF)- and epidermal growth factor receptor (ErbB) family of receptors and signaling
      molecules in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast tumor tissue in predicting response to
      lapatinib and capecitabine +/- IMC-A12.

      II. To determine the role of expression patterns and/or activation of IGF- and ErbB receptors
      and signaling molecules in circulating tumor cells from breast cancer patients in predicting
      response to lapatinib and capecitabine +/- IMC-A12.

      III. To determine the role of changes in expression patterns and/or activation of IGF- and
      ErbB receptors and signaling molecules following treatment with lapatinib and capecitabine
      +/- IMC-A12 in circulating tumor cells from breast cancer patients in predicting response to
      lapatinib and capecitabine +/- IMC-A12.

      IV. To determine the role of expression patterns of IGF-1, IGF-II, insulin, growth hormone,
      and the IGF binding proteins in the serum of breast cancer patients in predicting response to
      lapatinib and capecitabine +/- IMC-A12.

      V. To determine the role of changes in expression patterns of IGF-1, IGF-II, insulin, growth
      hormone, and the IGF binding proteins in the serum of breast cancer patients in predicting
      response to lapatinib and capecitabine +/- IMC-A12.

      VI. Banking of paraffin-embedded tissue blocks/slides and blood products (i.e., serum,
      plasma, and buffy coat) for future studies.

      VII. To assess the proportion of patients whose pathologic specimens were correctly diagnosed
      as HER2 positive (according to 2007 American Society of Clinical Oncology [ASCO] College of
      American Pathologist [CAP] guidelines) metastatic breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: The first 10 patients enrolled on this study are assigned to cohort I (safety
      analysis). All other patients are assigned to cohort II (randomized treatment).

      COHORT I (SAFETY ANALYSIS, closed to accrual): Patients receive cixutumumab intravenously
      (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients also receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice
      daily (BID) on days 1-14 and lapatinib ditosylate PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT II (RANDOMIZED TREATMENT): Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive capecitabine PO BID on days 1-14 and lapatinib ditosylate PO QD on
      days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive capecitabine and lapatinib ditosylate as in Arm I. Patients also
      receive cixutumumab IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until disease
      progression and then every 6 months for up to 5 years.
