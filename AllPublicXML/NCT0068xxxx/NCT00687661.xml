    <textblock>
      Kidney disease is a fundamental part of medicine because of its prominence in Western
      society. Common conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and kidney infections can all
      progress to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) also known as Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD
      5). Once ESRD has begun, kidney function is poor at best, thus the body is unable to
      effectively clear harmful toxins from the blood.

      A common feature of ESRD is vascular calcification, a process where blood vessels (especially
      arteries) attract deposits of the mineral calcium. Over time, these deposits harden and
      thicken in the layers of blood vessels, which limit blood flow to body tissues and can
      produce significant disease including hypertension, heart disease and stroke. Although the
      process of vascular calcification is unknown, there is mounting evidence that it is mediated
      by cellular events that are similar to those seen in bone formation with in the body
      (osteogenesis). With this point in mind, it has been suggested that agents medicine employs
      to limit excess bone formation will reduce the rate of vascular calcification in CKD Stage 5.

      This study will employ one group of drugs called bisphosphonates which have been used to
      limit bone formation. It will study their effect on vascular calcification in adult dialysis
      patients.

      Presently, there exist few therapies aimed at retarding the progression of vascular
      calcification. One study showed that agents that limit the absorption of phosphate from food
      (phosphate binders) slow the progression of vascular calcification, and as a result,
      treatments emphasize phosphate control through diet and phosphate binders. Other studies have
      shown that the use of statins, to lower LDL cholesterol levels may reduce the progression of
      coronary calcification in non-ESRD patients, but data from ESRD are lacking. While these
      treatments have been helpful, the improvements in patients' outcomes have not been
      overwhelming positive.

      This proposed study is not the first to study the use of bisphosphonates on vascular
      calcification. Repeated studies have shown impressive reduction in calcification rates in
      several animal models, which begs the question, how will bisphosphonates fare in human
      subjects? Preliminary research has begun, but clearly an expansive trial on humans is needed
      to explore the use of a promising therapy. Our study hopes to provide insight into this area
      of cardiovascular research.
