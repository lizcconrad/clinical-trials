      A randomized, modified-blind active-controlled multicenter, two-way crossover study of HFA
      levalbuterol (without using a spacer) in subjects 12 years of age and older with asthma. This
      study was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was acquired by
      Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed to Sunovion
      Pharmaceuticals Inc.

    <description>Subjects will receive both treatments: (a) levalbuterol HFA MDI; 45 micrograms (16 cumulative doses); followed by (b) racemic albuterol HFA MDI; 90 micrograms (16 cumulative doses).
The first treatment will be administered, followed by a 7 ±2 days washout period, after which the second of the two treatments will be administered. Cumulative dosing will occur according to the following schedule: 1 puff at 0 and 30 minutes, 2 puffs at 60 minutes, 4 puffs at 90 minutes and 8 puffs at 120 minutes. All study drug will be administered directly without using a spacer for the entire study.</description>
