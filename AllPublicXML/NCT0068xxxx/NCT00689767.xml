      This First In Man study is a prospective, multicentre, single blind, randomized, controlled
      clinical trial of the CINATRA™ ISA 247 Coated Coronary Stent System as compared to the
      CINATRA™ Coronary Stent System. The study will enroll up to 100 evaluable patients at up to 7
      sites. Clinical follow up will occur at 1 month, 6 months, and 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years post
      procedure. Repeat angiography and IVUS will be performed at the 6 month follow up time point
      for all subjects.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with stable angina pectoris (Canadian Cardiovascular Society 1, 2, 3) or
             unstable angina pectoris with documented ischemia (CCS 4, Braunwald Class IB-C, IIB-C
             or IIIB-C), or patients with documented silent ischemia.

          2. Patients who are eligible for coronary revascularization (percutanous angioplasty).

          3. Acceptable candidates for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

          4. Patients with de novo lesion in a native coronary artery &gt;50% and &lt;100% stenosis.

             NOTE: Treatment of lesions in a non-target vessel is up to the investigator's
             discretion (max. two-vessel-disease).

             ONLY a bare metal stent (no drug eluting stent) can be used for this treatment.
             Treatment of any non-target vessel lesions must be successfully completed before
             enrolling patient and placing study stent.

          5. The target lesion must be a maximum length of 13 mm (visual estimate) and able to be
             covered by one stent.

          6. The reference diameter of the target lesion must be 3.0 mm by visual estimate.

          7. Left ventricular ejection fraction of &gt;30%.

          8. Patients willing to provide written informed consent prior to participation and
             willing and able to participate in all follow-up evaluations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients under the age of 18 or unable to give informed consent.

          2. Women who are pregnant. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test within 7 days prior to enrollment and utilize reliable contraception at
             a minimum until after the angiographic follow up.

          3. Patients who previously participated in this study.

          4. Patient is currently participating in an investigational drug or device study that has
             not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current
             study endpoints.

             NOTE: Trials requiring extended follow-up for products that were investigational, but
             have since become commercially available, are not considered investigational trials.

          5. Life expectancy of less than 12 months or factors making clinical and/or angiographic
             follow-up difficult (no fixed address, etc.).

          6. Patients who intend to have a major surgical intervention within 6 months of
             enrollment in the study.

          7. Patients with new ST elevation within 48 hours prior to stenting.

          8. Braunwald Class IA, IIA and IIIA angina pectoris.

          9. Patients with a contraindication to an emergency coronary bypass surgery.

         10. Patients who had previous Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery (CABG).

         11. Any individual who may refuse a blood transfusion.

         12. Serum creatinine &gt;3.0 mg/dL.

         13. Platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm³.

         14. Patients with intolerance or contraindication to acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin),
             heparin, cyclosporin or cyclosporine derivative, clopidogrel or ticlopidine drug
             therapy.

         15. Patients with contrast agent hypersensitivity that cannot be adequately pre-medicated.

         16. Patients who have a stent anywhere within the target vessel.

         17. Any planned interventional treatment of any vessel post study procedure.

             Exclusion Criteria Related to Angiography

         18. Patients with previous PCI of the same segment (i.e. no restenotic lesions).

         19. Previous interventional procedure (less than 6 months) anywhere within the target
             vessel;

         20. Target lesion is located in or supplied by an arterial or venous bypass graft.

         21. Target lesion involves a side branch &gt;2.0mm in diameter.

         22. Ostial target lesion (within 3.0mm of vessel origin).

         23. Target vessel has evidence of thrombus or is excessively tortuous that makes it
             unsuitable for proper stent delivery and deployment .

         24. Patients with total occlusions (TIMI 0).

         25. Significant (&gt;50%) stenosis proximal or distal to the target lesion that might require
             revascularization or impede run off.

         26. Target lesion requires treatment with a device other than the predilatation balloon
             prior to stent placement (including but not limited to, directional coronary
             atherectomy, excimer laser, rotational atherectomy, cutting balloon etc.).
