  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mucosal biopsies, endoscopically-guided brush samples of mucus, and a saline lavage taken
      from the maxillary sinuses of ten CRS patients undergoing sinus surgery are analyzed using
      three microarrays in order to detect bacteria, fungi and viruses. Ten control patients with
      normal sinuses will have the same samples taken. The hypothesis is that bacterial, fungal,
      and viral communities present in the maxillary sinus of patients with CRS are significantly
      different from those patients with healthy sinuses, and that microorganisms identified in
      patients with or without CRS will differ from previously published data obtained using other
      techniques.

      Mucosal biopsies, endoscopically-guided brush samples of mucus, and a saline lavage taken
      from the maxillary sinuses of ten CRS patients undergoing sinus surgery are analyzed using
      three microarrays: 16S rRNA PhyloChip (to detect bacteria), MycoChip (to detect fungi) and
      ViroChip (to detect viruses). Ten control patients with normal sinuses, as assessed by CT
      scan and a sinusitis-specific survey, will have the same samples taken. The hypothesis is
      that bacterial, fungal, and viral communities present in the maxillary sinus of patients with
      CRS are significantly different from those patients with healthy sinuses, and that
      microorganisms identified in patients with or without CRS will differ from previously
      published data obtained using other techniques. Comparing diseased and control flora will
      provide insight into the relative contribution of each pathogen to CRS and may guide the
      development of future therapies.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria (CRS patients):

          -  History of CRS as defined as symptoms (nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, facial pain
             and/or hyposmia) for &gt;12 weeks despite therapy.

          -  Impaired CRS-specific quality of life (SNOT-20 score &gt;1.5).

          -  Evidence of sinus disease on a CT scan (Lund MacKay score greater than or equal to
             10).

          -  Patients with positive skin or RAST testing to an inhalant allergen and/or aspirin
             hypersensitivity will be included. Evidence of atopy is not required but will be
             recorded, along with serum IgE levels, when available.

        Inclusion Criteria (Control patients):

          -  No history of CRS

          -  SNOT-20 score &lt;1.0

          -  No evidence of sinus disease on preoperative imaging

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Control patients with any evidence of CRS, by history, survey, or imaging criteria
             would be excluded.
