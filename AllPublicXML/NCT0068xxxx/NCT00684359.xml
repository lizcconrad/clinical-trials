    <textblock>
      Single center randomized parallel group study to determine if:

        1. there is a temporary increase in platelet reactivity after abrupt discontinuation of
           clopidogrel due to a potential rebound phenomenon.

        2. the effect of sudden discontinuation of clopidogrel 6 months post coronary angioplasty
           with adjunct drug eluting stent implantation compared to 12 month continuation of
           clopidogrel on platelet reactivity. And the association with MACE up to 12 months post
           coronary angioplasty.
