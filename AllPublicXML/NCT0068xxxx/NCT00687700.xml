        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adult males aged between 18 and 50 years.

          -  The subject is able to understand and comply with the protocol requirements,
             instructions and protocol-stated restrictions.

          -  The subject has an increase in sGAW of ≥15% over pre-dose baseline within 2 h of
             administration of 400 µg salbutamol by MDI inhaler at screening or in the 3 months
             before screening.

          -  The subject has an increase in sGAW of ≥25% over pre-dose baseline within 2 h
             following 80 µg ipratropium bromide at screening or in the 3 months before screening.

          -  Subjects who are current non-smokers who have not used any tobacco products in the
             6-month period preceding the screening visit and have a pack history of ≥ 10 pack
             years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has donated a unit of blood within the 56 days or intends to donate within
             56 days after completing the study.

          -  The subject is currently taking regular (or course of) medication whether prescribed

             such as St John's Wort.

          -  The subject has used prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins,
             herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if
             the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (which ever is longer) prior
             to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and
             medical monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or
             compromise subject safety.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical study with a New Chemical Entity (NCE)
             within the past 3 months.

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

             than 28 units for males, or an average daily intake of greater than 4 units.

          -  Are unable to use the inhaler correctly.

          -  The subject has a history of drug or other allergy, which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, contraindicates their participation.

          -  The subject has had a lower respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks of study start.

          -  Subject is unable to perform the sGAW measurements
