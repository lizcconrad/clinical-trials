      1. Purpose:Our animal study demonstrated the effectiveness of subconjunctival injection of
           bevacizumab in the inhibition of corneal neovasculization formation. The purpose of this
           human interventional study is to report the treatment outcome of subconjunctival
           injection of bevacizumab in patients with corneal neovascularization.

        2. Material and methods: We enrolled 13 patients with unilateral or bilateral clinically
           significant corneal neovascularization during Aug. 2007 to Jan. 2008. Subconjunctival
           injection of bevacizumab once per month for at most 7 times was performed according to
           clinical response.

        3. Main outcome measurements: resolution of corneal neovascularization, reduction of lipid
           infiltrate, improved visual acuity.

    <description>subconjunctival injection of bevacizumab ( 1.25 to 2.50mg) according to the clinical judgment. Once per months for three times then reevaluate the drug effect, if the response was adequate, stop the trial; if no improvement, another three month intervention would be performed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant unilateral or bilateral corneal neovascularization that extending over the
             limbus at least 2mm

          -  The underlying etiologies that caused corneal neovascularization included post
             penetrating keratoplasty (PKP), trauma, infectious or non-infectious corneal ulcer,
             post-keratoplasty, etc.

          -  Corneal neovascularization induced lipid keratopathy, corneal edema, or irregular
             corneal surface. The best-corrected visual acuity was less than 20/25

          -  Post-PKP corneal neovascularization that had no associated lipid keratopathy, no
             corneal edema, or corneal irregularity. But the neovascularization was highly possible
             to cause graft rejection.

          -  The corneal neovascularization was refractory to other medical treatment

          -  The patient had received PKP or other corneal surgeries more than half a year ago and
             was not in the acute post-operation phase

          -  The patient had no active endopthalmitis, glaucoma with uncontrolled intraocular
             pressure, or vitreoretinal diseases

          -  The patient signed inform consent to have regular follow up and treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The neovascularization had clinical improvement three months before the first
             injection

          -  The lipid keratopathy had clinical improvement three months before the first injection

          -  The patient that suspected to have poor visual outcome or had already been light sense
             negative

          -  Glaucoma patient that had uncontrolled intraocular pressure

          -  Poor corneal epithelialization

          -  Post-PKP patient that had graft failure or rejection

          -  Patient that had systemic disease which was not suitable for bevacizumab use

          -  Pregnant patient
