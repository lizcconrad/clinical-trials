      The major objective of the proposed study is to demonstrate the suitability of new markers
      for folate status in humans, which avoid blood sampling, as required for the established
      marker RBC folate concentration, but can be obtained from spot urine samples. For this reason
      urine and blood will be collected from volunteers, twice at baseline and in a subgroup after
      6 and 12 weeks of intake of a folic acid supplement

      Specific hypotheses to be tested:

      Correlation study:

        -  The 24 h urinary excretion of total p-ABG, as extrapolated via urinary creatinine
           concentration from the total p-ABG concentration in a spot sample is significantly
           correlated to RBC and plasma folate levels in the studied subjects

        -  The 24 h urinary excretion of FIGLU, as extrapolated via urinary creatinine
           concentration form the FIGLU concentration in a spot sample is significantly correlated
           to RBC and plasma folate levels in the studied subjects

      Intervention study:

      Changes in folate status (RBC folate) after supplementary intake of folate result in
      increased urinary excretion of total p-ABG and FIGLU in subjects identified with a low folate
      status and in subjects identified with a high folate status among the study participants of
      the correlation study

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  age: 18 - 45 years

          -  apparently healthy

          -  normal results on haematologic pattern and blood chemistry tests (according to
             university hospital reference values)

          -  plasma vitamin B12 &gt; 160 pmol/l

          -  no diagnosis of intestinal, renal or thyroid disease (self reported)

          -  only male subjects will be enrolled but regular consumption of vitamin supplements
             (including folate) is not an exclusion criterium, as we aim to cover a wide range of
             folate concentrations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  recent (3 months) treatment with medication, assumed to interfere with folate status

          -  abuse of alcohol or drugs
