      This study has two purposes:

        1. to determine whether lovastatin, a commonly used medication to lower cholesterol in the
           blood, can produce beneficial changes in airway inflammation and in the airway smooth
           muscle

        2. to examine whether lovastatin will have favorable changes in asthma symptoms of patients
           with moderate or severe asthma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years to &lt;65 years

          -  Severe persistent asthma (per 2002 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program
             guidelines)

          -  Treatment with daily fluticasone (500 ug BID) and salmeterol (50 ug BID) during the
             past 4 or more weeks

          -  Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 &lt;80% predicted

          -  Post-bronchodilator improvement in FEV1 of at least 12% and 200 mL or a PC20 to
             methacholine of &lt;8 mg/mL

          -  Evidence of inadequate asthma control in the past 2 weeks: use of rescue inhaler &gt; 4
             days and &gt;8 occasions in the past 2 weeks, daytime asthma symptoms &gt; 4 days in the
             past 2 weeks, or 1 or more nocturnal awakening in the past 2 weeks

          -  No evidence of alternate diagnosis (e.g., sarcoidosis, eosinophilic pneumonia) on
             bronchoscopy performed as part of routine care in the Refractory Obstructive Lung
             Disorders clinic.

          -  Completed research bronchoscopy while on current dose of daily fluticasone and
             salmeterol within 4 weeks of meeting other inclusion criteria. Note: many patients in
             the ROLD clinic require a bronchoscopy to confirm the diagnosis of asthma and exclude
             other diagnosis (e.g., sarcoidosis). These patients are asked to participate in a
             research protocol (separate from this proposal) that allows investigators to collect
             additional samples (endobronchial biopsies, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid,
             endobronchial brushings) at the end of the clinical portion of the bronchoscopy {IRB
             protocol # 15361A entitled, &quot;Airway inflammation in refractory obstructive lung
             disease (ROLD): understanding markers of inflammation and remodeling&quot;}. This protocol
             was recently submitted to the IRB in March 2007.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Severe metabolic disease

          -  Other respiratory or inflammatory disorders (sarcoidosis, emphysema)

          -  Hypokalemia, dehydration

          -  Uncontrolled seizure disorder ( 2 or more seizures in last year)

          -  Major surgery, trauma

          -  Pre-existing liver disease (AST or ALT &gt;10% above the upper limit of normal)

          -  Elevated CK (&gt;50% above the upper limit of normal)

          -  History of alcohol abuse

          -  Current smokers or ex-smokers with &gt; 10 pack-years of smoking

          -  Partial ileal bypass surgery

          -  Concurrent treatment with drugs known to be have potential interactions or associated
             with rhabdomyolysis (Cimetadine, danazole, delavaridine, diltiazem, fenofiibrate,
             nefazodone, niacin, protease inhibitors, quinipristoline/dalfopristin, ranolazine,
             rifampin, telbivudine, telithromycin)

          -  HIV patients taking protease inhibitors

          -  History of allergy or intolerance to statin

          -  Use of 1 or more doses of any cholesterol lowering medication in the previous 12 weeks

          -  Clinical indication for treatment with statins
