  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DNA vaccines, which are small pieces of DNA also known as plasmids, have several advantages
      over traditional vaccines such as live attenuated virus and recombinant protein-based
      vaccines. DNA vaccines appear to be well tolerated in humans. Therefore, we have developed
      our DNA vaccine, VGX-3100, to include plasmids targeting E6 and E7 proteins of both HPV
      subtypes 16 and 18. We have chosen to deliver our candidate vaccines via electroporation (EP)
      using the CELLECTRA™ constant current device to deliver a small electric charge following
      intramuscular (IM) injection, since animal studies have shown that this delivery method
      increases the immune response to our DNA vaccine leading to a decrease in the size of tumors
      caused by HPV 16 and 18. The vaccine is proposed to be given to patients with a history of
      CIN 2 and 3 that have been treated by surgery. We will determine which dose the DNA vaccine
      will be the best tolerated and elicit the strongest immune response.
