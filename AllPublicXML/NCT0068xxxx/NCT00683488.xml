  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To adapt a developmentally appropriate CBT/CM intervention for alcohol and/or marijuana abuse for HIV+ youth, relevant to the context of chronic medical care, emotion dysregulation due to frequent co-morbid psychiatric disorders and sexual risk behavior.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of the CBT/CM intervention for alcohol and/or marijuana abuse, adherence to medical care, emotion regulation, and safer sexual behavior.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To revise the CBT/CM intervention based on information obtained in Phase 1 (this protocol), prepare for Phase 2 (to be supported by NIH), and disseminate the treatment manual to the ATN sites.</measure>

    <description>Focus groups with adolescents with SA (Substance Abuse) will be conducted at each site (one group with 5 to 6 adolescents per site) to provide information on the areas of the intervention in need of adaptation in order to reflect the context of HIV infection.</description>

    <arm_group_label>2</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The first intervention trial will enroll 9 participants (3 participants per site). Exit interviews of participants will assess acceptability, feasibility, and relevance of the intervention. Quantitative assessments pre and post intervention using audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI) will document immediate changes in substance use, sexual risk, and adherence to medical care. Additional qualitative feedback from interviews with mental health providers and study coordinators will address feasibility, acceptability, and relevance of the intervention and its methods.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>3</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The revised intervention will be implemented with 20 participants (6 to 8 at each site). Exit interviews with subjects and feedback from mental health providers and study coordinators will provide the same qualitative information as in the first intervention trial. Quantitative data on participant outcomes such as substance use, sexual risk, and adherence to medical care will be collected pre, post and 3 month post intervention through ACASI.</description>
