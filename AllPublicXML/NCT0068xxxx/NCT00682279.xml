    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I study of oral topotecan administered in combination with
      lapatinib in subjects with advanced solid tumors. This Phase I study will evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of oral topotecan administered in combination with
      lapatinib. This study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 of the study will investigate
      the impact of lapatinib on the bioavailability of oral topotecan (bioavailability phase) and
      Part 2 of the study will consist of dose finding to determine the maximum-tolerated dose
      (MTD) regimen of the combination (dose escalation phase). In Part 2 of the study, the dose of
      oral topotecan will be escalated while lapatinib will be given initially as fixed doses. The
      primary objective of the study is to determine the MTD regimen of oral topotecan administered
      for five-consecutive days every 21 days in combination with daily lapatinib in subjects with
      advanced solid tumors.

             metastases; Renal: calculated creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min.

          -  A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of:

          -  Non-childbearing potential (i.e., women with functioning ovaries who have a current
             documented hysterectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation, or women who are post-menopausal
             defined as documented absence of menses for &gt; 12 months or women with a documented
             bilateral oophorectomy);

          -  Childbearing potential (i.e. women with functioning ovaries and no documented
             impairment of oviductal or uterine function that would cause sterility.) This category
             includes women with oligomenorrhoea (severe), women who are perimenopausal, and young
             women who have begun to menstruate. These subjects must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test at Screening (≤7 days prior to administration of first dose of
             investigational product), and agree to use adequate contraception beginning at least 2
             weeks prior to the first does of investigational product and for 28 days after the
             final dose of investigational product. GSK acceptable contraceptive methods, when used
             consistently and in accordance with both the product label and the instructions of the
             physician, are as follows:

          -  An intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year.

          -  Vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry and is the
             sole sexual partner for that female.

          -  Complete abstinence from sexual intercourse for 14 days before exposure to
             investigation product, through the clinical trial, and for at least 28 days after the
             last dose of investigational product.

          -  Double-barrier contraception (condom with spermicidal jelly, foam suppository, or
             film; diaphragm with spermicide; or male condom and diaphragm with spermicide).

          -  Oral contraceptives are not reliable due to potential drug-drug interaction.

          -  Male subjects with a female partner of childbearing potential are eligible to enter
             and participate in the study if they practice adequate barrier methods of
             contraception (see above) or abstinence during the study from the first dose of
             investigational product until 3 months after the final dose of investigational
             product.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to the first dose of investigational product or who
             have unresolved or unstable, serious toxicity from prior administration of another
             investigational drug and/or of prior cancer treatment.

          -  Subjects who have received an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives

             compliance to the study.

          -  Subjects with psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that
             do not permit compliance with the protocol.

          -  Subjects with clinical history, current alcohol or illicit drug use which, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would interfere with the subject's ability to comply
             with the dosing schedule and protocol-specified evaluations.

          -  Subjects with current active hepatic or biliary disease (with exception of patients
             with Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases or stable chronic
             liver disease per investigator assessment).
