      This project involves two studies focusing on the engagement and treatment of adolescents
      diagnosed with substance use disorders. Study 1 will evaluate a promising parent-based
      engagement intervention, Community Reinforcement Training, designed to facilitate the entry
      of resistant drug-abusing adolescents in treatment. The approach will be compared with an
      Engagement As Usual intervention condition. Study 2 involves a controlled clinical trial
      evaluating the efficacy of an HIV/AIDS prevention intervention embedded in family-based drug
      abuse treatment for reducing HIV/AIDS risk behaviors and substance use. Adolescents who are
      successfully engaged in treatment through Study 1 will be randomly assigned to receive either
      family therapy alone or family therapy with the integrated HIV/AIDS prevention intervention.
      Both studies are being conducted in Portland, Oregon.
