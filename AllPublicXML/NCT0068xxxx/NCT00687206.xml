  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with slight increase in blood pressure levels have an increased cardiovascular risk.
      In particular this has been demonstrated also in subjects with high-normal blood pressure in
      whom an exaggerated blood pressure increase, during exercise, and structural left ventricular
      abnormalities have been shown. On the other hand, the last American and European guidelines
      for management of hypertension recommend more aggressive treatment in young-middle aged
      subjects to achieve a better control of cardiovascular risk due to blood pressure increase.
      In agreement with these recommendations the investigators share the idea that a good blood
      pressure control should be achieved not only at rest, but also during psycho-physical stress
      conditions that frequently occur during daily life. On this basis, the investigators decided
      to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the association of valsartan and
      hydrochlorothiazide (160 an 25 mg daily, respectively) in patients with high-normal blood
      pressure and first degree arterial hypertension with evidence of organ damage.

      The aim of this study is to assess if an early and adequate therapy could bring to a better
      pressure control (even during physical activity) and a regression of organ damage without
      interfering with metabolism and erectile function
