      RATIONALE: Learning about the effect of exemestane on bone mineral density in postmenopausal
      women at increased risk of breast cancer may help plan treatment, decrease the risk of broken
      bones, and help patients live more comfortably.

      PURPOSE: This research study is measuring bone mineral density in postmenopausal women at
      increased risk of developing breast cancer who are receiving exemestane on clinical trial
      CAN-NCIC-MAP3.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the percentage change in bone mineral density (BMD) as measured by dual x-ray
           absorptometry (DEXA) scans of the spine (L1-L4) and total hip 2 years after
           randomization (and registration to the MAP.3B protocol).

      Secondary

        -  To assess the percentage change in BMD as measured by DEXA scans of the spine (L1-L4),
           and total hip 5 years after randomization (and registration to the MAP.3B protocol).

        -  To compare the proportion of women who develop BMD of the spine (L1-L4) and total hip
           below the absolute threshold value for osteoporosis (T score ≤ -2.5 SD below the mean
           peak bone mass in young women) in the treatment groups.

        -  To examine the pattern of changes in BMD parameters and bone biomarkers (i.e., PINP and
           NTx) over time and the impact of covariants using exploratory longitudinal analyses.

        -  To compare the proportion of women who develop clinical skeletal fractures in the
           treatment groups.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo bone mineral density (BMD) measurement by dual x-ray absorptometry
      (DEXA). Blood specimens are collected at baseline and at 1 year, and 5 years and stored in a
      central laboratory for future assays of the bone biomarkers.

      If the subject withdraws from the core MAP.3 study before 5 years, a bone density measurement
      and serum for bone biomarkers is obtained unless performed within the past 3 months. Patients
      may continue to be followed on the MAP.3 core study for fractures (and other MAP.3 study
      endpoints) for a minimum of 5 years after randomization.

    <description>Increased bone turnover may be a risk factor for fracture [Lønning 2005]. However, it is uncertain whether markers of bone resorption and markers of bone formation are both associated with fracture risk [Looker 2000]. Therefore, we will measure bone formation and bone resorption markers at baseline, year 1 and year 5. Blood specimens will be shipped to and stored in a central laboratory for future assays of bone biomarkers. For markers of bone formation, the N-terminal Propeptide of Type I Collagen (PINP) will be measured. For bone resorption markers, serum levels of cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTx) will be measured. Note: Subjects must fast 12-14 hours prior to blood draw.</description>

        Eligible women consenting to be randomized to the core MAP.3 trial will be approached for
        participation in this companion study. They must have an acceptable quality BMD scan by
        DEXA taken within 12 months prior to randomization to MAP.3. A BMD T-score &gt; -2.0 SD (i.e.
        2.0 standard deviations below the average peak BMD of a young adult woman) has been
        established as the study population cut-off because postmenopausal women who have BMD
        T-scores as low as or lower than - 2.0 SD are currently recommended to consider
        pharmacological therapies for their bones
