      The Evaluating Predictors &amp; Interventions in Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction(SOD) study
      (EPISOD) is a randomized sham-controlled study of biliary and pancreatic sphincterotomy as
      treatment for patients with pain after cholecystectomy fitting the criteria for sphincter of
      Oddi dysfunction type III.

      Clinical Trial Phase: Phase III

      Study Sites Seven clinical centers in US

      Study Period Planned enrollment period - 3 years

      Planned duration of the study - 5 years

      Study Population SOD III Patients

      Primary Study Objective: To ascertain whether subjects with SOD III respond to
      sphincterotomy,

      Secondary Study Objectives

      To evaluate:

        -  the association between the results of Sphincter of Oddi Manometry (SOM)
           (abnormal/normal) and the primary outcome (success/failure);

        -  the success rate (as defined in the primary) of subjects who receive biliary
           sphincterotomy alone versus subjects who receive both biliary and pancreatic
           sphincterotomy in the subgroup of patients with manometrically proven hypertension of
           the pancreatic sphincter;

        -  the effects of pre-specified prognostic factors on the primary outcome;

        -  anxiety and depression scores over time and their relation to study outcomes;

        -  the economic impact of SOD III, and of endoscopic sphincterotomy in patients with SOD
           III; and, to,

        -  conduct a careful follow-up study (EPISOD2) of standard of care treatment (separate
           protocol).

      Study Design The EPISOD Trial is a parallel, randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled,
      multicenter Phase III clinical trial of endoscopic sphincterotomy as treatment for adults 18
      to 65 years of age diagnosed with SOD III.

      Sample Size A minimum of 214 subjects will be randomized using a 2:1 allocation in favor of
      sphincterotomy and will be followed for 12 months post-randomization.

    <description>The primary outcome was a dichotomous (success/failure) variable. Success was defined as patients having a RAPID score of &lt;6 days at months 9 and 12 post-procedure, without re-intervention and without use of prescription analgesics during months 10, 11 and 12 unless used for non-abdominal pain for no more than 14 days. The subject was considered a failure if the 12-month RAPID score was missing or collected outside the acceptable window. If the 9-month RAPID was missing, or outside of the window, then the 6-month value was used when available.</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Successful outcome was defined using the primary outcome definition of success at 12 months post randomization. Abnormal sphincter manometry was determined as a basal pressure of more than 40mm Hg in both leads.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients diagnosed with the clinical syndrome of SOD, as defined by the Modified
             Functional Biliary Disorders Module of the Rome III criteria

        <description>The primary outcome was a dichotomous (success/failure) variable. Success was defined as patients having a RAPID score of &lt;6 days at months 9 and 12 post-procedure, without re-intervention and without use of prescription analgesics during months 10, 11 and 12 unless used for non-abdominal pain for no more than 14 days. The subject was considered a failure if the 12-month RAPID score was missing or collected outside the acceptable window. If the 9-month RAPID was missing, or outside of the window, then the 6-month value was used when available.</description>

            <groups_desc>The trial was designed to test for an overall absolute difference of at least 30% in the primary outcome (‘success’) in patients treated with sphincterotomy compared to those treated with sham. Using a 2:1 allocation, an assumed 10% non-adherence rate, and one interim analysis for efficacy using O’Brien and Fleming boundaries and futility using conditional power, the study required 214 patients to be randomized to ensure greater than 90% likelihood of identifying this difference.</groups_desc>
