    <textblock>
      Docetaxel as single-agent therapy (100 mg/m2 and 75 mg/m2, every 3 weeks) produces response
      rates of 26% to 54%. Docetaxel has proven superior compared to best supportive care (BSC) in
      chemotherapy-naïve as well as in platinum pretreated patients. In addition, docetaxel is
      active in cisplatin refractory or resistant patients, producing responses ranging from 18% to
      25%, implying a lack of cross-resistance between docetaxel and cisplatin, probably due to
      their different mechanisms of action. Furthermore, docetaxel is associated with significant
      prolongation of survival when administered as second line therapy, in pretreated patients
      with advanced NSCLC. Phase II studies of pemetrexed in previously untreated patients with
      NSCLC have demonstrated single agent response rates of 17% to 23%. A phase II study of
      pemetrexed in patients with advanced NSCLC, who had progressed during or within 3 months of
      completing first-line chemotherapy, demonstrated a response rate of 8.9% and median survival
      time of 5.7 months. Multivariate analysis established an association between an increased
      risk of severe pemetrexed toxicity and elevated homocysteine (folate and/or B12 vitamin
      deficiency marker) levels. Since December 1999, all pemetrexed-treated patients are required
      to receive folic acid and Vitamin B12. A recently reported phase III study compared
      pemetrexed with docetaxel as 2nd line therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. Treatment with
      pemetrexed resulted in clinically equivalent efficacy outcomes, but with significantly fewer
      side effects compared with docetaxel.
