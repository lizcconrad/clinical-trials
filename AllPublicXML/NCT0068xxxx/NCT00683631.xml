      The purpose of this protocol is to provide access to Therasphere treatment for patients with
      liver tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical resection of the affected portion of the liver offers the best chance for
      disease-free survival in patients with primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)).
      Unfortunately, most of these patients present with disease that is not amenable to surgery
      (multifocal disease) or have other medical contraindications to surgery (limited hepatic
      reserve related to advanced cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis). Fewer than 15% of HCC patients
      are suitable surgical candidates. The objective of treatment with TheraSphere is to
      selectively administer a potentially lethal dose of radioactive material to cancerous tissue
      in the liver of patients with HCC. This type of regional therapy may have several advantages
      over systemically administered treatments and may also be of value as a 'bridging' treatment
      for HCC patients awaiting a donor organ for liver transplantation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients over 18 years of age, of any race or sex, who have histologic proof of
             primary cancer to the liver, who are able to give informed consent, will be eligible.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG Performance Status score of greater than or equal to 2,
             with a life expectancy of &gt; 3 months, non-pregnant with an acceptable contraception in
             premenopausal women.

          -  The histopathology confirmation criterion may be waived in patients with a
             radiographically identifiable liver mass, known laboratory or clinical risk factors
             for cancer or elevated tumor markers such as AFP (clinical diagnosis).

          -  Participation in the TheraSphere Registry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications to angiography and selective visceral catheterization

          -  Evidence of potential delivery of greater than 16.5 mCi (30 Gy absorbed dose) of
             radiation to the lungs

          -  Evidence of any detectable Tc-99 MAA flow to the stomach or duodenum, after
             application of established angiographic techniques to stop such flow

          -  Significant extrahepatic disease representing an imminent life-threatening outcome

          -  Severe liver dysfunction or pulmonary insufficiency

          -  Active uncontrolled infection

          -  Pregnancy
