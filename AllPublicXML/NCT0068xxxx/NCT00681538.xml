    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Sativex® versus Placebo is effective in the
      relief of symptoms of spasticity in subjects with multiple sclerosis, who have been
      identified as having a capacity to respond to Sativex.

      This 19 week, multicentre study was conducted in two phases. Phase A was a preliminary,
      single-blind four week treatment period to identify subjects with a capacity to respond to
      Sativex; eligible, consenting subjects entered a seven day screening period prior to
      returning to the study centre to begin a four week single-blind course of Sativex treatment.
      At the end of this phase, subjects' response to Sativex was assessed; those with the capacity
      to respond (i.e. at least a 20% reduction in mean 0-10 point numerical rating scale (NRS)
      spasticity score between screening and the end of the four week Phase A treatment) were
      eligible for entry into Phase B while those who did not respond took no further part in the
      study other than a follow up visit 14 days later.

      Phase B was a 12 week double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled, parallel group study with
      visits at 28 day intervals and a final follow up visit 14 days after completion or
      withdrawal.

      The level of spasticity, spasm frequency and sleep disruption were collected each day during
      the entire study via an interactive voice response system (IVRS). In addition, study
      medication dosing data were recorded via IVRS throughout Phases A and B. Assessments of other
      secondary and functional measures of spasticity, safety and tolerability, QOL (quality of
      life) and mood were also gathered throughout the study.

    <measure>The Change in Mean Spasticity Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) Score From Baseline to End of Treatment (Phase B).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (last 7 days of Week 4) - End of treatment (last 7 days of Week 17)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked &quot;On a scale of '0 to 10' please indicate the average level of your spasticity over the last 24 hours&quot; with the anchors: 0 = 'no spasticity' and 10 = 'worst possible spasticity'. They were asked to relate 'no spasticity' to the time prior to the onset of their spasticity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Showing an Improvement of at Least 30% or 50% in Their Mean NRS Spasticity Score (Phase B) From Baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) - End of treatment (last 7 days of Week 17)</time_frame>
    <description>A subject was classified as a responder in the evaluable period provided they did not withdraw due to lack of efficacy and achieved at least a 30% or 50% reduction (i.e. improvement) in the mean NRS spasticity score from baseline (Day 1) to the end of treatment(last 7 days of Week 17 Phase B). All other subjects and subjects without evaluable data were considered non-responders.</description>

    <measure>Change in Spasm Frequency (Number of Spasms Per Day) From Baseline to End of Treatment (Phase B).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (last 7 days of Week 4) - End of treatment (last 7 days of Week 17)</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects' baseline spasm frequency was the mean of the last seven days scores (Week 4) of Phase A treatment. The variable for analysis was the change in mean spasm frequency from baseline to the end of treatment (last 7 days of Week 17 Phase B).</description>

    <measure>Change in Sleep Disruption (Daily 11-point NRS) From Baseline to End of Treatment (Phase B).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (last 7 days of Week 4) - End of treatment (last 7 days of Week 17)</time_frame>
    <description>The sleep disruption NRS score was recorded by subjects via a daily call to the interactive voice response system at bedtime. Subjects were asked &quot;On a scale of '0 to 10' please indicate how you your spasticity disrupted your sleep last night&quot; with the anchors: 0 = 'did not disrupt sleep' and 10 = 'completely disrupted (unable to sleep at all)'.</description>

    <measure>Change in Spasticity as Measured Using the Modified Ashworth Scale From Baseline to End of Treatment (Phase B).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (End of Week 4) - End of treatment (End of Week 17)</time_frame>
    <description>All 20 muscle groups were assessed for spasticity (using a 1-5 scale): 1= no increase in muscle tone to 5= passive movement is difficult and affected part is rigid in flexion or extension. The score for all 20 muscle groups were added to give a total score out of 100; minimum score was 20. A decrease in score indicates an improvement in condition.</description>

    <measure>Change in Motricity Index Score From Baseline to End of Treatment (Phase B)for Affected Limbs.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (End of Week 4) - End of treatment (End of Week 17)</time_frame>
    <description>Arm - 3 movements were pinch grip, elbow flexion and shoulder abduction. Leg - 3 movements were ankle dorsiflexion, knee extension and hip flexion. The total arm and leg score was the addition of the score for the 3 arm movements and 3 leg movements, respectively. One point was then added to each limb score to give a maximum score of 100; minimum was 1 point. Where both arms (or both legs) were assessed, the average of the two limbs scores was used as the assessment score; otherwise the affected limb total score was used. An increase in score indicates an improvement in condition.</description>

    <measure>Change in Timed 10-metre Walk From Baseline to End of Treatment (Phase B).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (End of Week 4) - End of treatment (End of Week 17)</time_frame>
    <description>Only those subjects for whom it was appropriate (i.e. ambulatory subjects) were timed how long it took to walk 10 metres. Walk time was only assessed for subjects who successfully completed the Timed 10 Metre Walk. A negative difference from baseline indicates an improvement walk time.</description>

    <time_frame>[Baseline (End of Week 4) - End of treatment (End of Week 17)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D questionnaire provided two outcomes:
A weighted health state index visual analogue scale (VAS)
A self-rated health status VAS EQ-5D Health Status VAS Scale: 0 = worst health state imaginable to 100 = best health state imaginable. An increase in score indicates an improvement in condition.
The weighted health state index used the same VAS as above but was calculated for each assessment without imputation to account for missing values i.e., if one or more individual items was missing then the whole index was missing.</description>

          <description>241 entered Phase B; 124 randomised to Sativex and 117 to placebo. EDSS is a method of quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis.The EDSS quantifies disability in eight Functional Systems (FS) and allows neurologists to assign a Functional System Score in each of these. EDSS steps 1.0 to 4.5 refer to people with MS who are fully ambulatory. EDSS steps 5.0 to 9.5 are defined by the impairment to ambulation. Each score is given a definition and thus can identify for the subject their score depending on their condition e.g. score of 1.0: No disability, minimal signs on 1 FS.</description>

        <description>Arm - 3 movements were pinch grip, elbow flexion and shoulder abduction. Leg - 3 movements were ankle dorsiflexion, knee extension and hip flexion. The total arm and leg score was the addition of the score for the 3 arm movements and 3 leg movements, respectively. One point was then added to each limb score to give a maximum score of 100; minimum was 1 point. Where both arms (or both legs) were assessed, the average of the two limbs scores was used as the assessment score; otherwise the affected limb total score was used.

A weighted health state index visual analogue scale (VAS)
A self-rated health status VAS EQ-5D Health Status VAS Scale: 0 = worst health state imaginable to 100 = best health state imaginable. An increase in score indicates an improvement in condition.
The weighted health state index used the same VAS as above but was calculated for each assessment without imputation to account for missing values i.e., if one or more individual items was missing then the whole index was missing.</description>
