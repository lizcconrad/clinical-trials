      The Purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of 1-MNA, a drug that
      is intended to be used in the treatment of elevated levels of blood fats. This study will
      determine the way that 1-MNA is handled by the body, and will also determine its effect on
      commonly measured blood fat parameters.

      Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) and its management is
      important in preventing the occurrence of cardiovascular events. Dyslipidemia occurs when
      there is an imbalance in the metabolism and clearance of lipoproteins resulting in
      lipoprotein overproduction or deficiency. Lipid related risk factors for atherosclerotic
      coronary artery disease include elevated levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG),
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol
      (IDL-C), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) and reduced concentrations of
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). This lipid risk profile frequently occurs in
      association with other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., obesity, elevated blood pressure,
      diabetes mellitus), and is associated with premature atherosclerosis (NCEP, 2002).

      The Main purpose of this study is to formally evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of 1-MNA, a hypolipidemic agent with previous human exposure in normal
      subjects and patients with Hyperlipidemia.
