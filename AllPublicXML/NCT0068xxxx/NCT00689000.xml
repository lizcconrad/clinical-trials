    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomised, multi-centre phase I-II study of CHR-2797 administered
      orally once a day. The study involves two distinct phases:

        -  Phase I: an open-label, dose-escalating phase of the study to explore the safety,
           tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of CHR-2797.

        -  Phase II: the recommended dose level of CHR-2797, as determined in phase I, will be
           administered to a further cohort of approximately 40 patients to determine whether
           CHR-2797 has sufficient biological activity against the disease(s) under study.

      This is an open-label, non-randomised, multi-centre phase I-II study of CHR-2797 administered
      orally once a day. The study involves two distinct phases:

      Phase I: an open-label, dose-escalating phase of the study to explore the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of CHR-2797. Cohorts of 3-6 patients each will be
      treated with escalating, once daily, oral doses of CHR-2797 for 84 days (12 weeks), of which
      the first 28 days constitute the dose finding/ DLT phase. The starting dose will be 60 mg
      once daily. Doses will be increased in a stepwise fashion by around 40 percent per step until
      the MTD is reached. The proportion of patients with Multiple Myeloma will be limited to one
      third: one per cohort of 3 or 2 per cohort of 6. It is anticipated that 24-30 patients will
      be enrolled in the phase I portion of the trial. A decision will be made with regard to the
      disease indication to be tested in phase II (either AML/MDS or MM or both), after completion
      of phase I, or following definition of MTD.

      Phase II: the recommended dose as determined in phase I, will be administered for 84 days to
      a maximum of 40 patients. The primary objective is to determine whether CHR-2797 has
      sufficient biological activity against the disease(s) under study. A multinomial stopping
      rule has been included in the design that incorporates objective responses and early
      progression into a decision to stop or continue this phase I/II trial. An interim assessment
      will be performed after 15 patients have received the maximum acceptable dose (MAD) dose of
      CHR-2797 with clearly defined early stopping rules.

      There will be a clinical conference at the end of every cohort in the phase I portion of the
      study, between phase I and II and after the first 15 patients have completed therapy in phase
      II.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed, informed consent.

          -  Patients with AML, MDS (subtype RAEB-1 or RAEB-2), or MM whose disease has relapsed or
             is refractory to front line and/ or salvage therapy; elderly patients (≥ 60 years)
             with AML, MDS, MM who are not candidates for chemotherapy and for whom other therapy
             is inappropriate.

          -  Patients should have recovered from the acute adverse effects of prior therapies
             (excluding alopecia and grade II neuropathy).

          -  AML, MDS and MM are diseases of the haematopoietic system and can cause
             myelosuppression. Consequently supportive therapy should be given to ensure adequate
             values, according to local guidelines.

          -  A bone marrow aspirate/ biopsy performed within four weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Adequate bone marrow, hepatic and renal function including the following:

               1. Patients with high blast counts can be included in the trial, if they can be
                  controlled by the use of hydroxyurea (500-3000 mg daily).

               2. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper normal limit.

               3. AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x upper normal limit.

               4. Creatinine ≤1.5 x upper normal limit.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Performance status (PS) ≤ 2 (ECOG scale).

          -  Estimated life-expectancy greater than 3 months.

          -  Female patients with reproductive potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 7 days prior to the start of the trial. A woman with reproductive potential is
             defined as one who is biologically capable of becoming pregnant. Patients who are not
             surgically sterile or postmenopausal must agree to use a medically acceptable and
             highly effective method of birth control for the duration of the study and to continue
             after the end of CHR-2797 treatment for a further 3 months (female patients) or for a
             further 6 months (for male patients and their partners). A highly effective method of
             birth control is defined as any method that results in a low failure rate, including
             implants, injectables, some intra-uterine devices (IUD's), sexual abstinence, and
             vasectomy/ sterilization. Sexually active males and females using oral contraceptive
             pills should also use barrier contraception. Although there is no reason to believe
             that the use of CHR-2797 has an effect on the pharmacokinetics of hormonal
             contraceptives, this has not yet been proven.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anti-cancer therapy including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy,
             immunotherapy or use of other investigational agents within the 4 weeks prior to trial
             entry- except for hydroxyurea (maximum daily dose is 3 g).

          -  Indolent, smouldering myeloma, monoclonal gammopathy with unknown significance.

          -  Patients who need a daily dose of hydroxyurea greater than 3 g to control
             leukocytosis.

          -  Co-existing active infection or serious concurrent illness.

          -  Any co-existing medical condition that in the investigator's judgement will
             substantially increase the risk associated with the patient's participation in the
             study

          -  Psychiatric disorders or altered mental status precluding understanding of the
             informed consent process and/or completion of the necessary studies.

          -  Gastrointestinal disorders that may interfere with absorption of the study drug.

          -  Patients with platelet count(s) &lt; 20,000.

          -  Patients who have had a blood transfusion (platelet support or packed cells) within 7
             days prior to study entry.

          -  Persistent grade II or greater toxicity from any cause (except haematological
             toxicities and peripheral neuropathy).

          -  Patients with grade III-IV peripheral neuropathy.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women.
