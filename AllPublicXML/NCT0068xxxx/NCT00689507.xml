      H9S-MC-JDCF was a multicenter non-randomized, single-arm, open-label, dose-escalation, dose
      confirmation, Phase 1 study of intravenous (IV) LY2127399 in combination with bortezomib in
      patients with refractory or relapsed MM.

    <textblock>
      This is a study of a drug known as LY2127399, which will be given with a common treatment for
      multiple myeloma called bortezomib (Velcade). The primary purpose of this study is to
      (1)Determine the safety of LY2127399 in combination with bortezomib and any side effects that
      might be associated with it; (2)Assess whether LY2127399 in combination with bortezomib may
      help patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma; (3)How much LY2127399 should be
      given to patients along with bortezomib.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma treated with at least 1 prior regimen.
             Prior therapy with bortezomib is allowed if there has been no relapse or progression
             within 3 months of the last dose of bortezomib, and bortezomib is considered by the
             treating physician to be a reasonable therapy for the patient.

          -  Have measurable disease defined by one or more of the following:

               -  Monoclonal protein in the serum of ≥1 g/dL (10 g/L).

               -  Monoclonal light chain in the urine protein electrophoresis of ≥ 200 mg/24 hours.

               -  Involved Serum Free Light Chain (SFLC) level &gt; 10 mg/dL (100 mg/L) provided SFLC
                  ratio is abnormal.

               -  Measurable plasmacytoma.

          -  Are ≥ 18 years of age.

               -  Creatinine ≤ 3.0 mg/dl.

          -  Have an estimated life expectancy of ≥ 16 weeks.

          -  Treatment with prior autologous transplant is permitted. If a transplant is used as
             consolidation following chemotherapy, without intervening disease progression, it will
             be considered one line of treatment with the preceding chemotherapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received treatment within 30 days of the initial dose of study drug with a drug
             that has not received regulatory approval for any indication.

             investigator, would preclude participation in this study.

          -  Have uncontrolled infection.

          -  Females who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Have known positive test results in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B
             surface antigen (HBSAg), or hepatitis C antibodies (HCAb).

          -  Have peripheral neuropathy of &gt; Grade 2, or of any grade with pain, as measured by
             CTCAE v3.0.

          -  Previously treated with LY2127399, or have had significant allergy to humanized
             monoclonal antibodies that, in the opinion of the investigator, poses an increased
             risk to the patient.

          -  Prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

          -  Prior therapy with experimental agents targeting BAFF.

          -  Have QTc interval &gt; 450 msec on baseline 12-lead ECG.
