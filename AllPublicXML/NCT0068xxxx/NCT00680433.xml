  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research into the mechanisms underlying memory impairment in ECT suggests that its
      development may be prevented by the administration of certain medications at the time of ECT
      treatment. For example there are reasons to believe that ketamine, also used as an
      anaesthetic agent, may have such protective properties.

      In this clinical study patients undergoing a course of ECT will be offered the opportunity to
      receive a small dose of ketamine (or a placebo) as part of their anaesthetic at the time of
      ECT treatment. Mood changes and any memory changes will be evaluated to see if the subjects
      who received ketamine had less memory side effects than those who did not, while still
      improving their depression.

      This study will report on two related trials. In the outpatient trial, patients will be
      administered adjunctive ketamine at two different doses (0.25mg/kg; 0.5mg/kg), and a placebo
      (saline), across 3 consecutive sessions within their regular maintenance ECT course. The
      order of conditions will be randomised across participants. Patients will be required to
      learn some words and faces 20 minutes prior to ECT, and complete a detailed cognitive battery
      4 hours after ECT on each of the 3 occasions. The purpose of this trial is to determine
      whether ketamine is superior to placebo in reducing cognitive impairment following ECT and
      what the optimal dose of ketamine is for minimising cognitive and other side effects.
      Projected sample for this trial is N = 17.

      In the inpatient trial, patients will be randomly assigned to receive ketamine or placebo for
      the duration of the acute ECT course. Patients will be administered a detailed cognitive
      battery the day before commencing ECT treatment, the day after the 6th treatment, and 1-3
      days and 1 month following the end of the acute ECT course. The purpose of this trial is to
      examine whether patients in the ketamine condition had superior cognitive outcomes to those
      in the placebo condition during and following a course of ECT. In addition, depressive
      symptomatology will be examined throughout the ECT course to determine whether ketamine
      anaesthesia during ECT has antidepressant, as well as, cognitive benefits. Projected sample
      for this trial is N = 34.

      This entry gives details of the main clinical trial: The effects of ketamine across a course
      of ECT.
