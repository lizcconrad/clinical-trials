  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I inter-patient dose escalation open labeled study assessing multiple doses
      of CYT107 in patients of at least 15 years of age, who are recipients of HLA matched ex vivo
      T cell depleted bone marrow or peripheral blood stem transplants.

      The dose escalation design is aimed at establishing the absence of significant toxicity and
      to define a biologically active dose in this patient population.

      At each dose level, eligible patients will receive 3 doses of CYT107 injected subcutaneously
      (under the skin of the arm, legs, or stomach) once a week for 3 weeks.

      Groups of three patients will be entered at each dose level of CYT107. Three dose levels are
      planned: 10 mcg/kg/week, 20 mcg/kg/week and 30 mcg/kg/week. Three patients must complete day
      42 of the study at a dose level without a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) before there is
      escalation to the next dose level.

      Rationale: Delayed and deficient reconstitution of T cells and their functions are a major
      obstacle to the success of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). CYT-107 may have
      potential clinical use after allogeneic HSCT to enhance lymphoid reconstitution which could
      have a number of beneficial effects including decreased morbidity and mortality from
      post-transplant infections. Our preliminary data with a previous generation IL-7, CYT 99 007,
      raise the possibility that IL-7 could have, in some cases, an anti-GVHD effect while keeping
      the anti-tumor effect of the allograft intact.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To determine the safety and a recommended dose of CYT107 (r-hIL-7) in recipients of an
           HLA-matched related or unrelated ex vivo T-cell-depleted bone marrow (BM) or peripheral
           blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant after initial engraftment and hematopoietic
           reconstitution.

        -  If toxicities are encountered, to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose
           limiting toxicities (DLT).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To define the pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of CYT107 in recipients of allogeneic
           transplants.

      To achieve preliminary characterization:

        -  Of the effects of CYT107 treatment on engraftment and GVHD.

        -  Of the effects of CYT107 on the recovery of T, NK and B cell populations and their
           functions in vitro.

        -  Of a tolerable biologically active range of doses for CYT107 in recipients of allogeneic
           transplants.

        -  Whether and to what degree administration of CYT107 might influence the risk of
           developing an EBV-lymphoproliferative disorder.

        -  Of the effects of CYT107 treatment on leukemia relapse.
