    <textblock>
      Study P05063 is a 3-year long-term follow-up (LTFU) study in participants previously treated
      with boceprevir (BOC) or narlaprevir (NAR) in a Phase 1, 2, or 3 clinical study. Participants
      will be followed for up to 3.5 years after the end of their participation in the treatment
      protocol to document maintenance of the antiviral response (for sustained responders) and to
      characterize the long-term safety after use of this therapeutic regimen. LTFU procedures
      include collection of plasma samples for measuring Hepatitis C Virus ribonucleic acid
      (HCV-RNA) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and HCV sequence analysis. No drug therapy will
      be administered as part of this study.

      In Part 1, participants who previously participated in one of nine boceprevir studies (P03523
      [NCT00423670], P03659 [NCT00160251], P04487 [No NCT], P05101 [NCT00708500], P05216
      [NCT00705432], P05411 [NCT00959699], P05514 [NCT00910624], P05685 [NCT00845065], and P06086
      [NCT01023035]) were followed for response. In Part 2, participants who previously
      participated in one narlaprevir study (P05104 [NCT00797745]) were followed for response.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Relapse During the LTFU Among Sustained Responders From Previous Treatment Studies With Boceprevir or Narlaprevir (Durability of Virologic Response)</measure>
    <time_frame>From End Of Treatment (EOT) date in the previous treatment study to the first date of a positive HCV RNA result for relapsers or the last contact date for non-relapsers in the LTFU (up to 3.5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Durability of response was assessed by the number of participants who relapsed during the LTFU among those that had achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) by 24 weeks after treatment with boceprevir or narlaprevir in a previous Phase 1, 2, or 3 treatment study. In the current LTFU, participants were classified based on the last Hepatitis C Virus ribonucleic acid (HCV-RNA) result available at the time of the data cut-off date as follows: A participant was classified as a sustained virologic responder at a given time point if serum HCV-RNA was undetectable at that time point and there had not been a positive HCV-RNA since the participant was determined to have achieved SVR in the previous study. A participant was classified as a relapser if they were a sustained virologic responder in the previous treatment study and became serum HCV-RNA positive with no subsequent negative results during LTFU.</description>

    <measure>Kaplan-Meier Exposure-adjusted Relapse Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>From EOT date in the previous treatment study to the first date of a positive HCV RNA result for relapsers or the last contact date for non-relapsers in the LTFU (up to 3.5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The distribution of time to relapse was summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates for all participants who were sustained responders at 24 weeks post-treatment in the previous study. Exposure Adjusted Relapse Rate = 1000 × (number of relapses) / (Total exposure time in years). Total exposure time in years = [(total number of days from last day of treatment to the last follow-up day for all subjects who did not relapse) + (total number of days from last day of treatment to the day of relapse for those who relapsed)] / 365.25 days [for 1 year].</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With HCV Treatment-Emergent Resistance Associated Variants (TE-RAVs) of NS3/4A Protease Loci</measure>
    <time_frame>From EOT in the previous treatment study to the last available date in the LTFU (up to 3.5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma samples of all participants receiving at least one dose of study medication in a previous treatment protocol were evaluated by population sequencing and analyzed to detect amino acid variants in the NS3/4A protease known to be associated with reduced susceptibility to boceprevir and narlaprevir. RAVs in the NS3/4A protease gene were evaluated at 12 loci (V36, Q41, F43, T54, V55, V107, R155, A156, V158, D168, I/V170 and M175) on the basis of in vitro studies. A TE-RAV was defined as a RAV not present at baseline and that had not returned to wild type (WT) while the participant was still on treatment. The number of participants with TE-RAVS detected at the EOT in the previous treatment study are reported below, followed by those participants with TE-RAVS that returned to WT during the LTFU (among those with detected TE-RAVS).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Reported During the LTFU</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment in the LTFU study to the last available date in the LTFU study (up to 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Long-term safety was assessed based on the SAEs reported during the LTFU period. An SAE was any adverse drug or biologic or device experience occurring at any dose that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening AE, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongs hospitalization, congenital anomaly or birth defect. Important medical events that did not result in any of these outcomes could still be considered SAEs if they jeopardized the participant and/or required medical/surgical intervention, based on appropriate medical judgment. Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities and out of normal range liver function tests that were not accompanied by clinical manifestations were NOT considered SAEs.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Relapse During the LTFU Among Sustained Responders From Previous Treatment Studies With Boceprevir or Narlaprevir (Durability of Virologic Response)</title>
        <description>Durability of response was assessed by the number of participants who relapsed during the LTFU among those that had achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) by 24 weeks after treatment with boceprevir or narlaprevir in a previous Phase 1, 2, or 3 treatment study. In the current LTFU, participants were classified based on the last Hepatitis C Virus ribonucleic acid (HCV-RNA) result available at the time of the data cut-off date as follows: A participant was classified as a sustained virologic responder at a given time point if serum HCV-RNA was undetectable at that time point and there had not been a positive HCV-RNA since the participant was determined to have achieved SVR in the previous study. A participant was classified as a relapser if they were a sustained virologic responder in the previous treatment study and became serum HCV-RNA positive with no subsequent negative results during LTFU.</description>
        <time_frame>From End Of Treatment (EOT) date in the previous treatment study to the first date of a positive HCV RNA result for relapsers or the last contact date for non-relapsers in the LTFU (up to 3.5 years)</time_frame>

        <description>Plasma samples of all participants receiving at least one dose of study medication in a previous treatment protocol were evaluated by population sequencing and analyzed to detect amino acid variants in the NS3/4A protease known to be associated with reduced susceptibility to boceprevir and narlaprevir. RAVs in the NS3/4A protease gene were evaluated at 12 loci (V36, Q41, F43, T54, V55, V107, R155, A156, V158, D168, I/V170 and M175) on the basis of in vitro studies. A TE-RAV was defined as a RAV not present at baseline and that had not returned to wild type (WT) while the participant was still on treatment. The number of participants with TE-RAVS detected at the EOT in the previous treatment study are reported below, followed by those participants with TE-RAVS that returned to WT during the LTFU (among those with detected TE-RAVS).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Reported During the LTFU</title>
        <description>Long-term safety was assessed based on the SAEs reported during the LTFU period. An SAE was any adverse drug or biologic or device experience occurring at any dose that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening AE, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongs hospitalization, congenital anomaly or birth defect. Important medical events that did not result in any of these outcomes could still be considered SAEs if they jeopardized the participant and/or required medical/surgical intervention, based on appropriate medical judgment. Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities and out of normal range liver function tests that were not accompanied by clinical manifestations were NOT considered SAEs.</description>
