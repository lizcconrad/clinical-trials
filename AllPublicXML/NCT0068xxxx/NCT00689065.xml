  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: CALAA-01 is a targeted therapeutic designed to inhibit tumor growth and/or reduce
      tumor size. The active ingredient in CALAA-01 is a small interfering RNA (siRNA). This siRNA
      inhibits tumor growth via RNA interference to reduce expression of the M2 subunit of
      ribonucleotide reductase (R2). The CALAA-01 siRNA is protected from nuclease degradation
      within a stabilized nanoparticle targeted to tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial will:

        -  Determine the safety, toxicity, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CALAA-01 when
           administered intravenously to patients with relapsed or refractory cancer.

        -  Characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CALAA-01 after intravenous administration.

        -  Provide preliminary evidence of efficacy of intravenous CALAA-01 by evaluating tumor
           response.

        -  Recommend a dose of intravenous CALAA-01 for future clinical studies.

        -  Evaluate immune response, by measuring antibody and cytokine levels, and the effect of
           intravenous CALAA-01 on complement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CALAA-01 is a targeted nanocomplex that contains anti-R2 siRNA. The complete nanocomplex
      formulation consists of four components:

        1. a duplex of synthetic, non-chemically-modified siRNA (C05C)

        2. a cyclodextrin-containing polymer (CAL101),

        3. a stabilizing agent (AD-PEG), and

        4. a targeting agent (AD-PEG-Tf) that contains the human transferrin protein (Tf). The
           cationic polymer interacts electrostatically with anionic siRNA to assemble into
           nanocomplexes below approximately 100 nm in diameter that protect the siRNA from
           nuclease degradation in serum. The siRNA-containing nanocomplexes are targeted to cells
           that over express the transferrin receptor (TfR). Upon reaching a target cell,
           transferrin binds to TfRs on the cell surface and the siRNA-containing nanocomplex
           enters the cell by endocytosis. Inside the cell, chemistry built into the polymer
           achieves unpackaging of the siRNA from the nanocomplex, permitting it to function via
           RNA interference.

    <description>Subjects with solid tumors who satisfy the eligibility criteria will receive two, 21-day cycles of CALAA-01. A cycle will consist of four (4) 30-minute intravenous infusions administered on days 1, 3, 8, and 10 followed by 11 days of rest. If safe, a second 21-day cycle will be administered consisting of infusions on days 22, 24, 29 and 31 followed by 11 days of rest.</description>
