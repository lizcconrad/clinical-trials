  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maintenance venom immunotherapy administered at 6-month intervals to bee-venom allergic
      patients failed to provide protection from systemic reactions after sting challenges. These
      patients should continue their immunotherapy at 1-3 month intervals.

      Background: The intervals at which maintenance venom immunotherapy (MVIT) is administered
      have been progressively extended over the years.

      Objective: To examine whether the administration of bee venom (BV) maintenance dose (MD) at
      6-month interval is safe and efficacious.

      Methods: The usual 3-month interval at which venom allergic patients were receiving their
      MVIT was gradually extended to 6 months. Systemic reactions (SRs) to immunotherapy injections
      or to field stings were regularly recorded. BV allergic patients were deliberately
      sting-challenged after reaching the 6-month interval.
