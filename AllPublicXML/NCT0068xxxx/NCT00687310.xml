    <description>Educational Intervention At the initial visit (Visit 1), patients in the educational intervention group will complete a short Needs Assessment Questionnaire to help the investigator/nurse determine which section(s) of the tailored patient education booklet to give to, educate, and provide instruction on to the patient. This may, at the discretion of the investigator, include providing their patient with a peak flow meter and instructions on its use.Visit 2 will be scheduled for 1-month after the Visit 1 for the education intervention group. All educational materials provided at Visit 1 will be reviewed with the patient at Visit 2. The investigator/nurse will reassess the patient's use of the Turbuhaler® and asthma treatment plan. Patients will also be asked about any adverse events that may have occurred since Visit 1 and/or are observed at Visit 2. Once Visit 2 is completed with the patient, the investigator/nurse will complete the Educator Satisfaction Questionnaire.</description>
