  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate, using an exercise challenge approach, the dose
      response of levalbuterol HFA MDI in pediatric subjects with asthma

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, active controlled, multicenter, parallel treatment, 3x3 dose
      level crossover study evaluating the dose response of levalbuterol in pediatric subjects
      between the ages of 6 and 11, inclusive with exercise induced bronchoconstriction. This study
      was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was acquired by
      Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed to Sunovion
      Pharmaceuticals Inc.

          -  Subject with currently diagnosed life-threatening asthma defined as a history of
             asthma episodes requiring intubation, associated with hypercapnia, respiratory arrest,
             or hypoxic seizures within 3 months prior to study start.

             tract infection in the 3 weeks prior to study start.

          -  Subjects with unstable asthma; or who have had a change in asthma therapy; or a visit
