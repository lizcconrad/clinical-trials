        <description>The average number of micturitions (urinations) per 24 hours was derived from the number of times a patient urinates (excluding incontinence only episodes) per day recorded by the patient in a micturition diary for 3-days prior to clinic visits at Baseline and months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12/end of treatment. Least squares (LS) means were generated from the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group, previous study history, gender and geographical regions as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>

          <description>The average volume voided per micturition was calculated from the volume of each micturition measured by the patient and recorded in a micturition diary for 3 days prior to clinic visits at Baseline and months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12/end of treatment. LS means were generated from the ANCOVA model with treatment group, previous study history, gender and geographical regions as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>
          <population>The full analysis set included all randomized patients who took at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug with a baseline and at least 1 post baseline micturition measurement in the visit diary. N is the number of patients included in the analysis at each time point. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) was used for the Final Visit analysis.</population>

        <description>Nocturia is defined as waking at night one or more times to void. The average number of times a patient urinated (excluding incontinence only episodes) during sleeping time per day was derived from the 3-day patient micturition diary.
LS means are from an ANCOVA model with treatment group, previous study history, gender &amp; geographical regions as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>

        <description>Overactive bladder symptoms were assessed using the symptom bother scale of the overactive bladder questionnaire. The symptom bother scale consists of 8 questions answered by the patient on a scale from 1-6. The total symptom bother score was calculated from the 8 answers and then transformed to range from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating worst severity. A negative change from Baseline in symptom bother score indicates improvements.
LS means are from an ANCOVA model with treatment group, previous study history, gender &amp; geographical regions as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and Final Visit in Health-related Quality of Life (HRQL) Total Score</title>
        <description>Health-related quality of life was assessed by the HRQL subscales (coping, concern, sleep and social interaction) of the overactive bladder questionnaire (OABq). The HRQL total score was calculated by adding the 4 HRQL subscale scores, and transforming to a scale from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. A positive change from Baseline in HRQL score indicates improvements.

        <title>Change From Baseline to Month 12 and Final Visit in Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC)</title>
        <description>The PPBC scale is a global assessment tool that asks patients to rate their impression of their current bladder condition on a 6-point scale from 1: 'Does not cause me any problems at all'; 2: 'Causes me some very minor problems'; 3: 'Causes me some minor problems'; 4: 'Causes me (some) moderate problems'; 5: 'Causes me severe problems' and 6: 'Causes me many severe problems'. A negative change from Baseline score indicates improvement.
LS means are from an ANCOVA model with treatment group, previous study history, gender &amp; geographical regions as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>

          <description>The PPBC scale is a global assessment tool that asks patients to rate their impression of their current bladder condition on a 6-point scale from 1: 'Does not cause me any problems at all'; 2: 'Causes me some very minor problems'; 3: 'Causes me some minor problems'; 4: 'Causes me (some) moderate problems'; 5: 'Causes me severe problems' and 6: 'Causes me many severe problems'. A negative change from Baseline score indicates improvement.
LS means are from an ANCOVA model with treatment group, previous study history, gender &amp; geographical regions as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>

        <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: Specific Health Problem (WPAI:SHP) questionnaire was used to assess the degree and extent to which overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms interfered with work productivity in the last 7 days. Percent overall work impairment takes into account both hours missed due to OAB symptoms and the patient’s assessment of the degree to which OAB affected their productivity while working. A higher percentage indicates greater impairment and less productivity. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D is an international, standardized, nondisease-specific (i.e., generic) instrument for describing and evaluating health status. Participants were asked to indicate which of the following statements best describes their health state:
I have no problems with self-care; I have some problems washing or dressing myself; I am unable to wash or dress myself. In the table below, each row title lists Baseline health status first followed by Final Visit health status and reports the number of patients in that category. Missing data indicates patients with no data available for that Visit.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized, nondisease-specific instrument for describing health status. Participants were asked which statement best describes their health state with regard to usual activities (work, study or leisure): I have no problems performing my usual activities; I have some problems performing my usual activities; I am unable to perform my usual activities. In the table below, each row title lists Baseline health status first followed by Final Visit health status and reports the number of patients in that category. Missing data indicates patients with no data available at that Visit.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>
        <population>The full analysis set included all patients who took at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug and had a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline micturition measurement in the visit diary. LOCF was used for this analysis.</population>

        <description>The EQ-5D is an international, standardized, generic instrument for describing and evaluating health status. Health status is assessed by patients evaluating their health on a vertical, visual analog scale from 0 to 100 where the endpoints are labeled 'Worst imaginable health state' (=0) and 'Best imaginable health state' (=100). On the EQ-5D VAS, a positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The PPBC scale is a global assessment tool that asks patients to rate their impression of their current bladder condition on a 6-point scale from 1: 'Does not cause me any problems at all'; 2: 'Causes me some very minor problems'; 3: 'Causes me some minor problems'; 4: 'Causes me (some) moderate problems'; 5: 'Causes me severe problems' and 6: 'Causes me many severe problems'. Improvement was defined as at least a one point improvement from Baseline to post-baseline and a major improvement was defined as at least a two point improvement from Baseline to post-baseline in PPBC score.</description>

        <title>Safety as Assessed by Adverse Events (AEs), Vital Signs, Laboratory Tests, Physical Examination and Electrocardiogram</title>
        <description>An abnormality identified during a medical test was defined as an AE if the abnormality induced clinical signs or symptoms, required active intervention, interruption or discontinuation of study drug or was clinically significant. The Investigator assessed each AE for causal relationship (not related, possible or probable) to study drug. A serious AE (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence that: resulted in death, was life-threatening, resulted in significant disability/incapacity or congenital anomaly/birth defect, required or prolonged hospitalization or was a medically important event.
The data reported represent the number of participants with adverse events in each category.</description>
