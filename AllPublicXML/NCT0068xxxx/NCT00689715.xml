  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic lesions of the pancreas are defined as round, fluid-filled structures within the
      pancreas detected by radiologic imaging. With widespread use of cross-sectional imaging
      modalities for various indications, such lesions are now detected in nearly 20% of abdominal
      imagings, with the majority discovered incidentally. These lesions encompass a wide spectrum
      of histopathologic entities and biologic behavior, ranging from benign to malignant.
      Substantial morphologic overlap restricts the accuracy in diagnosing specific type of cystic
      lesion in spite of recent advances in diagnostic modalities. It is a challenging issue to
      differentiate each cystic lesion and make a management plan since cystic lesions that are
      relatively common and asymptomatic may possess malignant potential. Although inflammatory
      pseudocysts were thought to account for 80-90% of cystic lesions of the pancreas, with cystic
      tumors accounting for the remaining,10 the latter may occur much more frequently than
      traditionally estimated.

      To date, surgical resection is generally recommended for malignant and potentially malignant
      lesions. However, surgical resection of the pancreas still carries substantial morbidity and
      sometimes mortality, especially for the cystic lesion located in the head portion. Therefore,
      management should be individualized by risk-benefit analysis for each patient.

      Recently, a pilot study of EUS-guided ethanol lavage for cystic tumors of the pancreas
      reported that complete resolution was achieved in only one-third of patients even though
      epithelial lining ablation was demonstrated in all resected specimens. Therefore, more
      effective treatment modalities or ablation agents are required to improve treatment
      responses. Intratumoral or intraperitoneal injection of chemotherapeutic agent has been used
      for endobronchial lesions of lung cancer, brain tumors and advanced ovarian cancer.13-16
      EUS-guided injection of antitumor material has been reported in advanced pancreatic cancer.
      Although local injection of chemotherapeutic agents into pancreatic cystic tumors has not yet
      been reported, it is reasonable to suggest that such an approach may have an additive effect
      on ablation of the epithelial lining of cystic tumor when combined with ethanol lavage.

      Paclitaxel, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, inhibits cell processes that are dependent
      on microtubule turnover. Due to its highly hydrophobic nature,19 paclitaxel is expected to
      exert its effect longer when instilled within a closed cavity such as a cyst. The hydrophobic
      and viscous nature of paclitaxel may reduce the possibility of it leaking through a puncture
      site and causing complications.

      The present study evaluated safety, feasibility and response following EUS-guided ethanol
      lavage with paclitaxel injection (EUS-EP) for treating cystic tumors of the pancreas.

    <description>A curvilinear-array echoendoscope and a 22 gauge needle were then used for cyst fluid aspiration, ethanol lavage and paclitaxel injection. The maximum possible volume of cyst fluid was aspirated, and the needle tip was carefully maintained inside the cyst to avoid parenchymal injury. Ethanol was injected into the collapsed cyst until the original shape was restored, and a lavage was then performed for 3-5 minutes. Pure ethanol (99%) was used for all patients except the first 2 in whom 88% ethanol was used. After reaspiration of the injected ethanol, the cyst cavity was injected with a solution containing 3 mg/mL paclitaxel and the needle then carefully retracted. The high viscosity of paclitaxel necessitated dilution in 0.9% normal saline for administration via a 22G needle. The volume of the paclitaxel solution administered was the same as the volume of the cyst fluid aspirated.</description>
