  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous efforts have focused on the development of closed-loop systems to control anesthesia
      using the electrical activity of the brain (EEG) and EEG-based parameters as surrogate
      measures of anesthetic depth. New systems have been recently developed to considerably
      improve anesthetic control using model-based, patient-adaptive methods. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a new intelligent software, ReinLoop, in
      delivering closed-loop, patient-specific hypnosis.
