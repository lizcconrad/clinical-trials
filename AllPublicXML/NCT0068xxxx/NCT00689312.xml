      The primary objective of this study is to compare the mean taste scores for three fruit
      flavored oral rehydration solutions in children aged 5-10 years old. The secondary objective
      is to compare the proportions of children who indicate a taste preference for one of the
      solutions.

    <textblock>
      In Canada, acute gastroenteritis remains a major cause of morbidity and hospitalizations.
      This, in large part, is due to an inability to realize the full benefits of oral rehydration
      therapy. Because oral rehydration solutions have a salty taste, many mild to moderate
      dehydrated children refuse to drink them. This has resulted in pediatricians recommending
      inappropriate solutions and the unnecessary administration of intravenous fluids. Although
      two meta-analyses have concluded that rice-based ORS (Enfalyte) is as or more effective than
      traditional ORS in reducing stool output, the palatability of different oral rehydration
      solutions have never been evaluated.

      This will be the first prospective trial comparing the palatability of the most commonly
      recommended oral rehydration solutions, Pedialyte and Enfalyte with a newer solution,
      Pediatric Electrolyte. Both Pedialyte and Pediatric Electrolyte contain sucralose, dextrose,
      and fructose while Enfalyte contains rice syrup solids. Although the latter is as, or more
      effective than Pedialyte in reducing stool output, palatability may limit its use. Taste is
      important as children with gastroenteritis are frequently nauseated and may refuse to drink
      or vomit when consuming less palatable solutions.

      We hypothesize that, compared to children who receive a rice-based ORS (Enfalyte), those who
      receive a sucralose ORS (Pediatric Electrolyte or Pedialyte) will report a higher mean taste
      score, will prefer to drink the sucralose sweetened ORS if they had to consume a larger
      volume, and are more likely to drink the entire volume they are provided.
