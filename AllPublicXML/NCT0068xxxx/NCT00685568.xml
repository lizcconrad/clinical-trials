      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. The use
      of celecoxib may keep polyps and colorectal cancer from forming in patients with familial
      adenomatous polyposis.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of
      celecoxib in treating young patients with a genetic predisposition for familial adenomatous
      polyposis.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of celecoxib in pediatric patients with
           genotype-positive familial adenomatous polyposis.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and adenoma burden in the entire colorectum of
           these patients.

        -  Eliminate the learning curve in a phase II/III trial (reproducibility of endoscopic
           techniques, tolerability of procedure).

        -  Compare sedation strategies based on local standards (monitored anesthesia care vs
           conscious sedation).

        -  Validate the ACF scoring technique.

        -  Establish the short-term (3 month) impact of celecoxib on ACF count in order to
           determine appropriateness of ACF as a pathologic endpoint in a phase II/III trial.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 3 months in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 3 months in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo colonoscopy at baseline and at 3 months. Patients also complete psychosocial
      questionnaires at baseline.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline to assess the influence of polymorphisms (CYP2C9,
      uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyl transferase, A6, glutathione S-transferase [GST] M1,
      and Glutathione S-transferase (GST) theta 1 (GSTT1)) on age of onset of phenotype or number
      of colorectal polyps. Plasma drug trough levels are assessed at baseline, 1 month, and 3
      months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 months.
