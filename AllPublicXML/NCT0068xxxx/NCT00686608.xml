  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify how certain parts of the brain that control appetite
      respond to changes in dietary carbohydrate and fat.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To measure fMRI signal change in hypothalamic and brainstem centers associated with control
      of food intake and energy expenditure in response to IV glucose, fructose, and saline. The
      fMRI response to these nutrients will then be compared in obese vs. lean subjects. Frequently
      timed blood samples will be obtained for measurement of nutrients (i.e., glucose) and blood
      levels of other factors (i.e., insulin, ghrelin, lactate) during these infusion protocols,
      and to test associations between these levels and the fMRI response.
