      Background:

      The malignant lymphomas, Hodgkin´s disease (HD) and non-Hodgkin´s lymphoma (NHL), comprise
      approximately 5-6% of all malignancies in adults and account for 10% of childhood cancers.
      Once the diagnosis has been established histologically, extent of disease (staging) and
      response to therapy will be assessed by means of a computed tomography (CT) scan of the body.
      The staging at presentation is important for determining prognosis and choice of treatment.
      Unfortunately, CT is accompanied by a significant amount of radiation exposure which may
      induce second cancers. This is especially important in childhood, because rapidly dividing
      cells are more sensitive to radiation induced effects and children will have more years ahead
      in which cancerous changes might occur. New magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques offer
      an alternative way for staging and follow-up of cancers, including the malignant lymphomas.
      Whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is a radiation-free method which allows imaging of the body with
      excellent soft tissue contrast in a single examination.

      Purpose:

      The aim of this study is to examine if WB-MRI can replace CT in staging of patients with a
      malignant lymphoma.

      Design:

      This will be a multicenter, prospective, diagnostic cohort study (timeschedule: 36 months).
      135 eligible patients will undergo WB-MRI on top of the protocolar imaging routinely done.

      Study population:

      Patients aged 8 years and older with a histological diagnosis of HD or NHL.

      Statistical analysis:

      The challenge of this study will be to show non-inferiority of WB-MRI compared to CT in
      staging malignant lymphoma. Testing of this hypothesis will be one-sided and performed using
      recently proposed techniques by Lui et al.

      Radiation-related risk assessment:

      A risk model will be used, based on the BEIR VII report, for modelling the late-term
      mortality from radiation induced tumors after exposure to ionizing radiation.

      Economic evaluation:

      Actual costs (from a societal perspective) will be determined for the two diagnostic tests.
      In case of clinical equivalence and similar costs or cost savings associated with MRI the
      latter can be considered dominant, obviating further economic evaluation. Otherwise, through
      modelling of expected long term health impact and associated outcomes such as quality of life
      and costs the incremental cost effectiveness will be evaluated.
