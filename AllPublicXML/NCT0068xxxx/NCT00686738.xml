  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop indices predicting response to pre-operative
      chemotherapy in osteosarcoma patients. Histologic response to pre-operative chemotherapy is
      very important for the ultimate outcome of osteosarcoma patients. Conventional methods such
      as CT or MRI evaluating tumor response to chemotherapy is not so efficient in tumors like
      osteosarcoma. Instead, the investigators will test whether blood TGF-b1 levels, PET/CT
      findings, MRS findings as well as the level of NF-kB expression in tumor tissues can predict
      chemotherapy response in osteosarcoma.

      We will conduct a prospective trial to verify the validity of indices utilizing TGF-b1,
      NF-kB, PET/CT, and MRS for predicting response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in osteosarcoma
      patients. We assume that changes in plasma TGF-b1 levels, PET/CT and magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy (MRS) findings during the period of neoadjuvant chemotherapy as well as the
      initial nuclear NF-kB expression status of tumor biopsy specimen either alone or in
      combination may predict a chemotherapeutic response determined by histopathologic necrosis
      fractions of tumors removed. To test this, we will obtain TGF-b1 levels, PET/CT and MRS
      findings at diagnosis and at follow-up (after first and second/third chemotherapy cycle).
      Tumor will then be removed. Chemotherapy regimen comprised of various combination of
      cisplatin, adriamycin, and high-dose methotrexate, ifosfamide, and etoposide. Indices derived
      from TGF-b1, PET/CT, MRS predicting greater than 90% necrosis fractions will be sought
      utilizing statistical methods.

    <description>Study group will be made up of patients hospitalized to National Cancer Center, Korea, aged between 5 and 40 years, and diagnosed with high grade osteosarcoma by histological exam.
In this group, TGF-b1 measurement, PET/CT and MRS examination at diagnosis, after 1st cycle chemotherapy, and 2nd or 3rd chemotherapy (just before surgery) will be made.
In addition, evaluation of NF-kB expression status in tumor specimens at diagnostic biopsy and tumor removing surgery will be done.
The results of above studies will be correlated with the necrosis fractions of the tumor tissues removed by surgery.</description>
