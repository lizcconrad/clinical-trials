  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Silymarin (Legalon), also known as milk thistle, is an alternative medicine commonly found in
      health food and vitamin stores. People with liver disease sometimes use silymarin because it
      is thought to have liver protecting effects; however, this benefit has not been proven. The
      purpose of this research study is to determine the effectiveness of silymarin and assess the
      safety of different silymarin doses in patients with varying severity of liver disease
      compared to a placebo (lactose pill).

      Eligible subjects will be randomized to treatment with placebo or one of two dosages of
      LegalonÂ® 420 mg or 700 mg administered orally thrice daily. Investigators and subjects will
      be masked to treatment assignment. The study design includes a screening period during which
      patients will undergo full medical evaluation to verify protocol eligibility and a treatment
      period of 24 weeks during which time clinic visits and laboratory studies will be performed
      every 2-4 weeks to monitor for safety and efficacy of therapy. Subjects will continue to be
      followed for an additional 12 weeks after the completion of study medication to monitor for
      adverse events and investigate post-treatment outcomes. Participation in this research study
      requires the subject to travel to the clinic for at least 10 visits so recruitment will be
      limited to a geographically restricted area around participating clinical centers.

      This proposal is a phase II study that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of silymarin for
      the treatment of subjects with chronic hepatitis C who did not respond to conventional
      antiviral therapy. The primary objectives of this study are to assess the safety and adverse
      event profile of silymarin over a range of doses compared to placebo and to assess efficacy
      of silymarin in normalizing serum aminotransferase activity in patients with chronic
      hepatitis C. Secondary objectives are to characterize the effect of silymarin on serum levels
      of HCV RNA and to explore relationships between silymarin therapy and serum biomarkers of HCV
      hepatic disease activity (oxidative stress, apoptosis, and fibrogenesis).
