        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is 40 years of age or older.

             oophorectomy or hysterectomy), or is of childbearing potential and practicing one of
             the following methods of birth control: condoms, sponge, foams, jellies, diaphragm or
             intrauterine device (IUD) contraceptives (oral or parenteral) for three months prior
             to study drug administration),a vasectomized partner, total abstinence from sexual
             intercourse

          -  If patient is female and of childbearing potential, the results of a serum pregnancy
             test performed at Screening, prior to the first dose of adalimumab, must be negative.

          -  Patient has a diagnosis of OA of the index knee according to American College of
             Rheumatology criteria, including radiological evidence of OA (Kellgren-Lawrence grades
             2 or 3).

          -  Patient has had continual pain for at least 6 months prior to inclusion in the study.
             This includes pain that has persisted despite conventional treatment, defined as any
             one of the following medications taken daily during the preceding month:acetaminophen
             (2- 4 grams per day)maximum tolerated and recommended doses of an NSAID,
             acetaminophen/codeine combination (i.e. Tylenol No 2, 3, 4) taken at least 3 times
             daily

          -  Patient has had daily knee pain for the month preceding study enrolment.

          -  Patient has a summed pain score of 125-400mm (visual analog scale) on the WOMAC pain
             sub-scale in the index (more symptomatic) knee.

          -  Patient has clinical evidence of a knee effusion in the index (more symptomatic) knee
             at Screening and Baseline.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a history of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to
             constituents of Adalimumab.

          -  Patient has a history of proven systemic arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis.

          -  Patient has a concurrent medical or arthritic condition that could confound evaluation
             of the index joint e.g. post-traumatic or any secondary form of knee OA

          -  Patient has predominant patellofemoral disease
