  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who addicted to Heroin and other opiates suffer from a disease with approved genetic
      basis. It causes to a behavioral response as searching and using those drugs even though they
      know it causes severe damages as physiological, familiar and legal affairs.

      The popular treatment's goal is to &quot;clean&quot; the people from any drug. In a medical and
      pharmacological point of view there is no sense in this approach for all people. This point
      of view believes that Buprenorphine (Subutex) is a correct pharmacological treatment.

      The hypothesis of this research is that people using Buprenorphine have difficulties in
      gaining weight, in sexual and cognitive function (according to subjects' reports)

      The hypothesis of this research is that people using Buprenorphine have difficulties in
      gaining weight, in sexual and cognitive function (according to subjects' reports) We examine
      people who stopped opiates and began Buprenorphine. Every participant in the study will have
      two visits: the first one before receiving Buprenorphine and the second one after 3 months of
      receiving Buprenorphine.
