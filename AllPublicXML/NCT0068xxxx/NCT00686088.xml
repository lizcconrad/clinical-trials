    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the therapeutic activity of different
      concentrations of PRX302 at increasing volumes and/or number of deposits per gram of
      prostate. Therapeutic activity will be determined based on changes in PSA levels, PSA
      velocity, PSA doubling time and tumor burden following treatment.
