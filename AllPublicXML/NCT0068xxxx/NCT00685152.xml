    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and
      safety of high-frequency (20Hz) rTMS applied to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for
      6 weeks. The primary objective is to evaluate the change in PTSD symptoms before and after
      six weeks of high-frequency rTMS treatment as measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD
      Scale (CAPS) in both active and control groups.

    <description>6 weeks of either Active or Sham Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). Active treatment comprises of stimulation with rTMS frequency 20Hz, intensity 110% of Motor Threshold, 20 trains, 9 seconds per train, 51 seconds of intertrain interval that is applied over the Right Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex by a figure eight shaped coil. Treatment will be given 5 times a week for 4 weeks, 3 times a week during Week 5 and 2 times a week during Week 6. Sham treatment will mimic active treatment; The rTMS machine used is MagPro and the company name is Medtronic.</description>
