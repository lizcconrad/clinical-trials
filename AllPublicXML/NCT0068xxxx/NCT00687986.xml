    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for an early stage I lung cancer is surgery. However, surgery can be
      associated with complications and long-term impairment of the quality of life of patients.
      Stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) is a outpatient technique which allows for local control
      rates that are comparable to those achieved using surgery. In this study, patients with stage
      IA non-small cell lung cancer will be randomized to either surgery or SRT in order to study
      the local and regional tumor control, quality of life and treatment costs at 2- and 5-years.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a cytological or histological diagnosis of stage IA non-cell lung cancer
             diagnosed in accordance with Dutch CBO guidelines [2004]. When no pathological
             diagnosis is available, a patient with a new or growing pulmonary lesion with
             radiological features consistent with malignancy AND a lesion showing uptake on a
             FDG-PET scan will be eligible [Herder 2005].

          -  No evidence of regional or distant metastases on a standardized FDG-PET scan within 6
             weeks of any protocol treatment .

          -  The medial extension of tumors should be least 2 cm away from main and lobar bronchi,
             and also minimum of 1.5 cm from large peripheral blood vessels such as the aorta and
             main pulmonary artery. Lesions of at least 2 cm from the mediastinal pleura will be
             eligible if the responsible radiation oncologist judges that the specified normal
             tissue tolerance doses specified in the protocol will not be exceeded.

          -  Patients who are judged by a multi-disciplinary team to have 2 primary lung tumors (on
             the basis of clinical, radiological, FDG-PET and/or cyto-pathology findings) are
             eligible for randomization provided that both surgery and SRT can be performed in
             accordance with protocol requirements.

          -  Patient should be fit to undergo a complete surgical resection of the lesion in
             accordance with Dutch CBO guidelines [2004]

          -  Performance score of ECOG â‰¤ 2 before any treatment.

          -  Able to comply with post-treatment follow-up

          -  Patients must sign and date a written Independent Ethics Committee approved informed
             consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy for the present diagnosis of NSCLC.

          -  History of any active malignancy (other than NSCLC) unless treated more than 3 years
             with curative intent and no recurrence, with the exception of non-melanoma skin
             cancers or in-situ cervical cancers.

          -  Any unstable systemic disease (including active infection, uncontrolled hypertension,
             unstable angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the previous
             year, severe cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, hepatic, renal or metabolic
             disease).

          -  Concomitant treatment with any other experimental drug under investigation.

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Men and women of child-bearing potential not using effective means of contraception
             for 6 months after treatment has been completed.
