  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was performed to measure FEV1, which is the amount of air the participant is able to exhale in 1 second. Normal values for FEV1 in healthy people depend on age and gender, but values between 80% and 120% of the normal value is considered good. Increased FEV1 indicates improvement in asthma control.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Morning (AM) and Evening (PM) Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were to record their daily AM and PM PEFR values in a diary. PEFR can be measured using a peak flow meter that was given to the participant. Normal readings are based on a person's gender, age, and height. A reading of 80 to 100% of the usual or normal peak flow readings indicate that the asthma is under good control. Increased PEFR indicates improvement in asthma control.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Items in the Asthma Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire and the General QOL Questionnaire That Had a Significant (Positive) Change From Baseline to Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaires consisted of items such as General Health Condition (excellent/very good/good/regular/bad), Difficulty to Breathe (always/almost always/considerable part of time/partially/few amount of time/almost never/never), General Asthma Limitations (completely/a lot/enough to be considered/regular/a few/almost nothing/nothing), etc...
The questionnaires together consisted of 44 questions, each question with categorical variables as response. A Friedman test was performed to determine the significance of change in samples from baseline to endpoint, for each question.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Morning and Evening Asthma Symptoms Based on a 3 Point Scale (4 Individual Symptoms) and 24 Points (Summed).</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The symptoms of cough, chest tightness, wheezing, and shortness of breath were each to be graded on a scale of 0 to 3 with 0 being no symptoms present and 3 being very marked symptoms which was disturbing most of the time. Scores were to have been recorded at 12AM and 12PM for a total of 24 points summed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator's Assessment of Response to Therapy Based on a 5-point Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator will assess the subject's response to therapy by interviewing the subject and comparing the current level of symptoms from baseline. A scale of 1 to 5 will be used with 1 being much improved (AM and PM symptom severety/frequency improve &gt;75% from baseline) and 5 being much worse (AM and PM symptom severity/frequency got more than 75% worse from baseline).</description>

    <measure>Patient's Assessment of Response to Therapy Based on a 5-point Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A scale of 1 to 5 will be used with 1 being much improved (AM and PM symptom severety/frequency improve &gt;75% from baseline) and 5 being much worse (AM and PM symptom severity/frequency got more than 75% worse from baseline).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With One or More Mild, Moderate or Severe Asthma Exacerbations</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Exacerbation severity will be characterized based on exacerbation classification from the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) workshop 2005 and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) asthma guidelines.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Adhered to Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The compliance was measured via medication consumption. In the end of the last week of study (Week 12), a review of the remaining study drug in the initial prescribed Twisthaler device was done. A Twisthaler reading of 0 indicates no study drug left and full compliance.</description>

        <description>Spirometry was performed to measure FEV1, which is the amount of air the participant is able to exhale in 1 second. Normal values for FEV1 in healthy people depend on age and gender, but values between 80% and 120% of the normal value is considered good. Increased FEV1 indicates improvement in asthma control.</description>
