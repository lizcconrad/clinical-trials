  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to develop and conduct well-designed trial to assess
      whether a multi-factorial intervention involving physical activity and cognitive training
      reduces the risk of significant cognitive decline in older individuals.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence from small or uncontrolled studies indicates that physical exercise and cognitive
      training have considerable promise as prevention strategies, to the extent that they are
      often recommended; however, their efficacy has not been established by an adequately powered
      randomized clinical trial.

      This pilot study will provide the experience and data to assess whether physical activity and
      cognitive training separately improve cognitive function over 6 months. It will also
      determine whether a combination intervention holds promise beyond individual interventions
      without compromising adherence, and will provide information necessary to design a
      well-organized and efficient full scale, multi-center randomized clinical trial.

      The Physical Activity Training (PAT) will consist of center-based and home-based sessions to
      include aerobic, strength, flexibility, and balance training. The actual time spent
      exercising will vary from person to person and will also vary depending on what stage of the
      study they are in.

      The Cognitive Training (CT) intervention was developed to improve consciously-controlled
      memory processing or recollection of episodic memory information and produces changes in
      performance that transfer to executive function, such as working memory, planning and memory
      monitoring, as well as long term item memory and cognitive processing speed.

      The Healthy Aging Education (HAE) control will combine health education-based lectures with
      light stretching and toning. HAE will include an experiential component, in which
      participants will learn how to take charge of their health and seek out appropriate medical
      services and information. Topics such as medications, foot care, traveling and nutrition will
      be covered.

    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Composite of 5 tasks:
Self-Ordered Pointing Task of planning, working memory, and monitoring. Subjects view 16 abstract shapes and choose a shape so that each is selected by the 16th trial and none is chosen more than once. (Eriksen, Percept Psychophysiology 1974;16:143-49).
N-Back Test of working memory. Subjects see individual letters and indicate whether the letter is the same as the nth back letter, with n equal to 1 and 2. (Dobbs, Psychol Aging 1989;4:500-3.)
Eriksen flanker task of response incompatibility. Subjects see an arrow facing either right or left and indicate the direction.The target displays can be neutral congruent, or incongruent. (Eriksen, Percept Psychophys 1974;16:143-49.)
Trail Making Test-Part B of alternating attention. Subjects connect 25 labeled circles and are scored by completion time. The lower the scores the better the performance. See details in the primary outcome.
Raw scores for each test were converted to z-scores.</description>

    <measure>Composite Episodic Memory</measure>
    <time_frame>Change a 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Composite of 4 components.
The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) of verbal learning. Subjects hear 12 words and repeat as many as possible. This is repeated twice for a total of 3 trials. 20 mins later the subject is asked to recall as many words as possible. Subjects also do a recognition trial with 24 words. Scores for immediate and delayed recall, and recognition are calculated.(Brandt J. Clin Neuropsych 1991;5:125-42).
The Logical Memory (LM) test The LM test has 2 parts. In Part 1, subjects hear a story and recall as many pieces as possible immediately and after a 30 minute delay. Subjects receive a story unit score for accuracy of re-telling story details and a thematic score for recalling story themes. The higher the scores the better the performance. ( Wechsler D. The Wechsler Memory Scale-3rd Edition (WHM-III). Psycholog Corp, Harcourt, Inc.)
Individual scores are converted to z-scores and averaged to form the composite.</description>

          <description>The Physical Activity Training ((PAT) intervention consisted of center-based and home-based sessions comprised of aerobic, strength, flexibility, and balance training with a targeted duration of 150 minutes/week. It included two center and two home-based training sessions per week for four months. Its primary focus was walking with the explicit intent of improving cardiovascular fitness. Other forms of endurance activity (e.g., stationary cycling) were used when regular walking was contraindicated for medical or behavioral reasons. Center-based physical activity sessions were supplemented with additional tailored home-based walking sessions at 1-2 per week during the first month.
Physical Activity Training (PAT): Two 1-hour center and two 15- to 45-minute home-based training sessions per week to include aerobic, strength, flexibility, and balance training for 6 months. The ultimate goal is to accumulate 150 minutes of walking per week between center and home-based sessions.</description>

          <description>The Cognitive Training (CT) intervention was developed to improve consciously-controlled memory processing or recollection of episodic memory information. Sessions were center-based, conducted via computer, carried out with small groups, and monitored by skilled trainers. Training consisted of four consecutive 10-12 min sessions per day, administered two times per week for two months, which then tapered to one time per week for two additional months. For each session, participants studied a list of 30 words, followed by a recognition test consisting of the 30 studied words and 30 new words with each new word repeated once, and asked to respond “yes” to study words and “no” to the new items both times they occurred.

          <title>Physical Activity Training</title>
          <description>The Physical Activity Training ((PAT) intervention consisted of center-based and home-based sessions comprised of aerobic, strength, flexibility, and balance training with a targeted duration of 150 minutes/week. It included two center and two home-based training sessions per week for four months. Its primary focus was walking with the explicit intent of improving cardiovascular fitness. Other forms of endurance activity (e.g., stationary cycling) were used when regular walking was contraindicated for medical or behavioral reasons. Center-based physical activity sessions were supplemented with additional tailored home-based walking sessions at 1-2 per week during the first month.
Physical Activity Training (PAT): Two 1-hour center and two 15- to 45-minute home-based training sessions per week to include aerobic, strength, flexibility, and balance training for 6 months. The ultimate goal is to accumulate 150 minutes of walking per week between center and home-based sessions.</description>

          <title>Cognitive Training</title>
          <description>The Cognitive Training (CT) intervention was developed to improve consciously-controlled memory processing or recollection of episodic memory information. Sessions were center-based, conducted via computer, carried out with small groups, and monitored by skilled trainers. Training consisted of four consecutive 10-12 min sessions per day, administered two times per week for two months, which then tapered to one time per week for two additional months. For each session, participants studied a list of 30 words, followed by a recognition test consisting of the 30 studied words and 30 new words with each new word repeated once, and asked to respond “yes” to study words and “no” to the new items both times they occurred.
Cognitive Training (CT): Two 1-hour sessions per week for the first two months and then one 1-hour session per week for months 3-6.</description>

          <description>The Modified Mini Mental State Exam (3MS) Memory Functioning questionnaire asks the participant to rate on a scale of 1 (always) to 7 (never) how often remembering something presents a problem. In order to participate, subjects had to score at least an 88 or greater if their education level is greater than 8 years and if education level was 0-8 years, scores had to be at least an 80 or higher. The possible scores (units on a scale) range from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflecting better global cognitive functioning.</description>

        <description>Composite of 5 tasks:
Self-Ordered Pointing Task of planning, working memory, and monitoring. Subjects view 16 abstract shapes and choose a shape so that each is selected by the 16th trial and none is chosen more than once. (Eriksen, Percept Psychophysiology 1974;16:143-49).
N-Back Test of working memory. Subjects see individual letters and indicate whether the letter is the same as the nth back letter, with n equal to 1 and 2. (Dobbs, Psychol Aging 1989;4:500-3.)
Eriksen flanker task of response incompatibility. Subjects see an arrow facing either right or left and indicate the direction.The target displays can be neutral congruent, or incongruent. (Eriksen, Percept Psychophys 1974;16:143-49.)
Trail Making Test-Part B of alternating attention. Subjects connect 25 labeled circles and are scored by completion time. The lower the scores the better the performance. See details in the primary outcome.

            <description>The Physical Activity Training ((PAT) intervention consisted of center-based and home-based sessions comprised of aerobic, strength, flexibility, and balance training with a targeted duration of 150 minutes/week. It included two center and two home-based training sessions per week for four months. Its primary focus was walking with the explicit intent of improving cardiovascular fitness. Other forms of endurance activity (e.g., stationary cycling) were used when regular walking was contraindicated for medical or behavioral reasons. Center-based physical activity sessions were supplemented with additional tailored home-based walking sessions at 1-2 per week during the first month.
Physical Activity Training (PAT): Two 1-hour center and two 15- to 45-minute home-based training sessions per week to include aerobic, strength, flexibility, and balance training for 6 months. The ultimate goal is to accumulate 150 minutes of walking per week between center and home-based sessions.</description>

            <title>Cognitive Training</title>
            <description>The Cognitive Training (CT) intervention was developed to improve consciously-controlled memory processing or recollection of episodic memory information. Sessions were center-based, conducted via computer, carried out with small groups, and monitored by skilled trainers. Training consisted of four consecutive 10-12 min sessions per day, administered two times per week for two months, which then tapered to one time per week for two additional months. For each session, participants studied a list of 30 words, followed by a recognition test consisting of the 30 studied words and 30 new words with each new word repeated once, and asked to respond “yes” to study words and “no” to the new items both times they occurred.
Cognitive Training (CT): Two 1-hour sessions per week for the first two months and then one 1-hour session per week for months 3-6.</description>

The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) of verbal learning. Subjects hear 12 words and repeat as many as possible. This is repeated twice for a total of 3 trials. 20 mins later the subject is asked to recall as many words as possible. Subjects also do a recognition trial with 24 words. Scores for immediate and delayed recall, and recognition are calculated.(Brandt J. Clin Neuropsych 1991;5:125-42).
The Logical Memory (LM) test The LM test has 2 parts. In Part 1, subjects hear a story and recall as many pieces as possible immediately and after a 30 minute delay. Subjects receive a story unit score for accuracy of re-telling story details and a thematic score for recalling story themes. The higher the scores the better the performance. ( Wechsler D.

Sessions were center-based, conducted via computer, carried out with small groups, and monitored by skilled trainers. Training consisted of four consecutive 10-12 min sessions per day, administered two times per week for two months, which then tapered to one time per week for two additional months. For each session, participants studied a list of 30 words, followed by a recognition test consisting of the 30 studied words and 30 new words with each new word repeated once, and asked to respond “yes” to study words and “no” to the new items both times they occurred.
Cognitive Training (CT): Two 1-hour sessions per week for the first two months and then one 1-hour session per week for months 3-6.</description>

          <title>Combined Intervention</title>
          <description>The Combined Intervention (PACT) was designed so that participants received both cognitive and physical activity training on the same day. To avoid the potential impact of physical fatigue on cognitive training, the cognitive treatment was delivered prior to the physical activity treatment. It included both the PA and CT interventions.
Physical Activity Training (PAT): Two 1-hour center and two 15- to 45-minute home-based training sessions per week to include aerobic, strength, flexibility, and balance training for 6 months. The ultimate goal is to accumulate 150 minutes of walking per week between center and home-based sessions.

          <title>Healthy Aging</title>
          <description>The Healthy Aging Education control intervention consisted of weekly lectures based on health education and was based on a program developed by the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders pilot trial [Rejeski, 2005; LIFE, 2006]. Topics such as medications, foot care, traveling and nutrition were covered. The purpose of the intervention was to provide contact time with participants.
Healthy Aging Education (HAE): One 1-hour lecture each week for 3 months, then monthly.</description>
