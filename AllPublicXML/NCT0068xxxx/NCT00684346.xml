      The purpose of this study is to determine if 18Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission
      Tomography (PET) imaging can detect changes in airways inflammation in Cystic Fibrosis (CF)
      patients after treatment for a pulmonary exacerbation.

    <textblock>
      Neutrophils play a key role in the pathogenesis of CF lung disease. We know that neutrophilic
      inflammation is related to a decline in pulmonary function. Therefore, early
      anti-inflammatory intervention is an opportunity to slow this irreversible pulmonary
      destruction. However, the development of sensitive, non-invasive diagnostic tools of airways
      inflammation is essential to the study and implementation of anti-inflammatory therapies. Our
      current armentarium of measures of airways inflammation is limited. BAL is invasive and not
      clinically acceptable as a tool for the serial measurement of inflammation. Sputum samples
      are highly variable and not reliable.

      18FDG-PET is a promising tool because it is non invasive, has been shown to quantify the
      amount and location of neutrophilic inflammation and has the potential to be used to track
      inflammation over time. Therefore, the goal of this research study is to evaluate the ability
      of 18FDG -PET imaging to detect changes in airways inflammation in CF patients in response to
      conventional treatment for a pulmonary exacerbation
