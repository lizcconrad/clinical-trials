  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comprehensive therapy of traditional Chinese medicine (CTTCM) could relieve risk of
      recurrence and metastasis for stage II &amp; III colorectal cancer, the investigators take this
      clinical trial with retrospective-prospective cohort study based on previous studies by
      international multi-center way.

      If the study shows a positive result, a pragmatic randomized controlled study with
      prospective, multi-centre and large-sample design will be given continuously. The aim is to
      establish recommended programs suggested by CTTCM strategies under conventional Western
      medicine therapy (CWMT) for stage II &amp; III colorectal cancer.
