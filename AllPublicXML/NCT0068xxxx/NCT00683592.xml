      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, 8-week, clinical trial is
      designed to assess the efficacy and safety of vilazodone and to evaluate genetic biomarkers
      of treatment response associated with vilazodone use in adult patients diagnosed with MDD by
      the DSM-IV-TR criteria. This study will enroll approximately 470 patients at approximately 10
      clinical sites. Safety and efficacy will be assessed at each visit. A DNA sample will be
      collected and analyzed for response to vilazodone.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in the MADRS (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) Total Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is an observer rating scale that has proven to be an efficient and practical measure of depression. The scale was constructed to be sensitive to treatment effects. The change from baseline in MADRS total score has a possible range of -60 to 60 where negative values reflect improvement in depression symptom severity. The method of last observation carried forward was utilized for subjects who discontinued prematurely.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in the HAM-D 17 (17-Item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 1, week 2, week 4, week 6, week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D 17 is a 17-item subscale of the HAM-D 21, which is designed to be completed by a trained rater. It is designed for rating depressive symptom severity in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of depressive disorder. The change in HAM-D 17 has a possible range of -52 to 52 with negative values indicating improvment in depression symptom severity. The method of last observation carried forward was utilized for subjects who discontinued prematurely.</description>

    <measure>The CGI-I (Clinician's Global Impression of Improvement) Score at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I scale measures change from the baseline state at every visit after the baseline visit. It permits a global evaluation of the patient's improvement over time. At the scheduled clinic visits, the clinician assessed the patient's improvement relative to the symptoms at baseline on a CGI-I item using a 7-point scale, where 1 = very much improved and 7 = very much worse. The method of last observation carried forward was utilized for subjects who discontinued prematurely.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in the HAM-A ( Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-A is a rating scale developed to quantify the severity of anxiety. It consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (severe). Change from baseline in the HAM-A total score may range from -52 to 52 with negative value indicating improvement in anxiety symptom severity. The method of last observation carried forward was utilized for subjects who discontinued prematurely.</description>

    <measure>MADRS (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) Response Rate at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>MADRS response was defined as ≥ 50% decrease from baseline in MADRS total score at Week 8. The response rate is the percentage of subjects in each treatment group meeting the criteria for response. The method of last observation carrier forward was utilized for subjects who discontinued prematurely.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>MADRS (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) Remission Rate at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>MADRS remission was defined as a MADRS total score &lt; 10 at Week 8. The remission rate is the percentage of subjects in each treatment group who met the criteria for remission. The method of last observation carried forward was utilized for subjects who discontinued prematurely.</description>

The change from baseline in MADRS total score has a possible range of -60 to 60 where negative values reflect improvement in depression symptom severity.

        <description>The HAM-A is a rating scale developed to quantify the severity of anxiety. It consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (severe). Change from baseline in the HAM-A total score may range from -52 to 52 with negative value indicating improvement in anxiety symptom severity. The method of last observation carried forward was utilized for subjects who discontinued prematurely.</description>
