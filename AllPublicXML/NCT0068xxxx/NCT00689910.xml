  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic disposition of raltegravir in pregnant HIV-1
      infected women. These results will be compared to pharmacokinetic data obtained following
      pregnancy as well as to studies previously carried out in nonpregnant women and male
      patients. By determining the disposition characteristics for this specific patient
      population, antiretroviral (ARV) dosing can be optimized during pregnancy. Appropriate dosing
      is necessary to minimize adverse effects, slow progression of disease, and further reduce the
      risk for vertical transmission. Data will also be obtained on genital tract penetration and
      placenta transfer of raltegravir to the newborn.

      The subjects enrolled in this study will take an antiretroviral based regimen containing
      raltegravir twice daily both during and after their pregnancy. The specific regimen will be
      chosen by their own primary care provider based on their antiretroviral history and
      resistance testing. They will undergo a series of blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis
      over 12 hours on two occasions; a) during their 3rd trimester and b) approximately 3 months
      postpartum. Concentrations of raltegravir in the infant will be assessed by cord and infant
      blood sample at delivery and a blood sample at approximately 3 months of age.

      Hypothesis: The pharmacokinetic exposure of raltegravir as measured by the 12 hour area under
      the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC0-12h) during third trimester pregnancy is
      similar to the AUC0-12h estimated three months post-partum.

        Preliminary eligibility will be determined by the study investigators, research staff, and
        the patient's primary pregnancy healthcare provider. During a dedicated visit to the
        primary investigator's office, potential participants will undergo a screening examination
        including review of physical exam and blood work obtained by their primary pregnancy
        provider within two weeks of study enrollment. Those that qualify will then provide written
        consent and be able to continue in the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female, 16 years old or older

          -  Pregnant, at least 14 weeks gestation in order to initiate raltegravir treatment if
             decided by their pregnancy health care provider. The first pharmacokinetic study visit
             occurs no sooner than 26 weeks gestation (3rd trimester)

          -  Normal fetal heart motion by ultrasound, vital signs and brief physical exam as
             conducted by their primary pregnancy health care provider within two weeks of study
             entry (part of their standard prenatal care)

          -  Intolerance or resistance to at least two classes of antiretroviral agents

          -  Availability of a raltegravir-optimized background regimen based on referring
             provider's selection and resistance testing

          -  English or Spanish speaking

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to follow study protocol or drug administration

          -  Women who are planning to breastfeed (this is not recommended for HIV-infected women
             to reduce HIV transmission to the baby)

          -  Women unable to sign informed consent

          -  Women with a history of anaphylaxis or other life threatening adverse event associated
             with antiretroviral therapy
