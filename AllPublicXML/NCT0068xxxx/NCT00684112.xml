    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether the use of gabapentin will improve
      postoperative analgesia and reduce opioid consumption and side effects in children undergoing
      corrective spinal surgery for idiopathic scoliosis. Secondary aims are to evaluate whether
      use of gabapentin reduces pain scores, decreases postoperative nausea and vomiting, decreases
      persisting pain and improves patient satisfaction.

    <textblock>
      Surgical correction of scoliosis involves major orthopedic surgery, and can lead to severe
      acute postoperative pain and persistent neuropathic pain. The mainstays of treating
      postoperative pain are acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
      systemic opioids, and local anesthetic techniques. Despite being effective, their use is
      limited by adverse side effects. Acute postoperative pain involves multiple mechanisms and
      neural pathways, therefore a combination of different analgestic medications acting through
      different mechanisms, may be the most effective treatment. This strategy may also reduce the
      need for, and side effects of, using high doses of any one particular class of drugs.

      Gabapentin is safe and well tolerated with few side effects and has minimal interactions with
      other drugs. The use of gabapentin to treat acute postoperative pain may improve quality of
      analgesia, result in decreased requirements for opioids and might consequently reduce the
      incidence of opioid induced side effects. It may also have a direct effect on postoperative
      nausea and vomiting, and decrease the incidence of persistent neuropathic pain. These
      qualities make gabapentin an attractive agent for use in management of postoperative pain in
      children undergoing corrective spinal injury.

      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether the use of gabapentin will improve
      postoperative analgesia and reduce opioid consumption and side effects in children undergoing
      corrective spinal surgery for idiopathic scoliosis. Secondary aims are to evaluate whether
      use of gabapentin reduces pain scores, decreases postoperative nausea and vomiting, decreases
      persisting pain and improves patient satisfaction.
