  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefits and risks of lixisenatide (AVE0010), in
      comparison to placebo, used in a 2-step dose titration regimen in monotherapy, over a period
      of 12 weeks of treatment.

      The primary objective is to assess the effects of lixisenatide, in comparison to placebo, on
      glycemic control using a 2-step dose titration regimen in terms of glycosylated hemoglobin
      (HbA1c) reduction (absolute change) at Week 12.

      Secondary objectives are to assess the effects of lixisenatide, in comparison to placebo, on
      glycemic control in terms of HbA1c reduction when it is used in a one-step dose titration
      regimen over a period of 12 weeks, body weight, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour
      postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) after a standardized meal, to assess the safety and
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and anti-lixisenatide antibody development.

    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 4-arm, unbalanced design, parallel
      group study with a two-step titration regimen or a one-step titration regimen. The study is
      double-blind with regard to active and placebo treatments; however neither the study drug
      volume nor the titration regimens (that is, two-step or one-step) are blinded.

    <measure>Absolute Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Absolute change = HbA1c value at Week 12 minus HbA1c value at baseline. The on-treatment period for this efficacy variable is the time from the first dose of study drug up to 3 days after the last dose of study drug or up to the introduction of rescue therapy, whichever is the earliest. For a patient to be included in mITT population, both baseline and at least 1 post baseline assessment for at least 1 efficacy variable, were required.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in 2-Hour Postprandial Plasma Glucose (PPG) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The 2-hour PPG test measured blood glucose 2 hours after eating a standardized meal (performed in selected sites). Change was calculated by subtracting baseline value from Week 12 value. The on-treatment period for this efficacy variable is the time from the first dose of study drug up to the last dosing day of study drug or up to the introduction of rescue therapy, whichever is the earliest. For a patient to be included in mITT population, both baseline and at least 1 post baseline assessment for at least 1 efficacy variable, were required.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Requiring Rescue Therapy During the Double-Blind Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Routine fasting self monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) and central laboratory FPG values were used to determine the requirement of rescue medication. If fasting SMPG value exceeded the specified limit for 3 consecutive days, the central laboratory FPG was performed. Threshold values for fasting SMPG/FPG: from baseline to Week 8: &gt;270 milligram/deciliter (mg/dL) (15 mmol/L) and from Week 8 to Week 12: &gt;240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L). For a patient to be included in mITT population, both baseline and at least 1 post baseline assessment for at least 1 efficacy variable, were required.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Glucose excursion = 2-hour PPG minus plasma glucose 30 minutes prior to the standardized meal test (performed in selected sites), before study drug administration. Change was calculated by subtracting baseline value from Week 12 value. The on-treatment period for this efficacy variable is the time from the first dose of study drug up to the last dosing day of study drug or up to the introduction of rescue therapy, whichever is the earliest. For a patient to be included in mITT population, both baseline and at least 1 post baseline assessment for at least 1 efficacy variable, were required.</description>

    <time_frame>First dose of study drug up to 3 days after the last dose administration</time_frame>
    <description>Symptomatic hypoglycemia was an event with clinical symptoms that were considered to result from a hypoglycemic episode with an accompanying plasma glucose less than 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L) or associated with prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration if no plasma glucose measurement was available. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was symptomatic hypoglycemia event in which the patient required the assistance of another person and was associated with either a plasma glucose level below 36 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration, if no plasma glucose measurement was available.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 61 centers (68 were initiated) in 12 countries between May 14, 2008 and December 14, 2009.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 795 patients were screened of which 434 (54.6%) were screen failures; main reason for screen failure was glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values being out of the defined protocol range (greater than or equal to 7% and less than or equal to 10%). A total of 361 patients were randomized.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Symptomatic hypoglycemia was an event with clinical symptoms that were considered to result from a hypoglycemic episode with an accompanying plasma glucose less than 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L) or associated with prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration if no plasma glucose measurement was available. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was symptomatic hypoglycemia event in which the patient required the assistance of another person and was associated with either a plasma glucose level below 36 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration, if no plasma glucose measurement was available.</description>
