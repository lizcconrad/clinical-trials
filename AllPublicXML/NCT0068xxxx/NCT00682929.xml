  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if the use of inhaled cannabis (marijuana) and oral
      cannabinoid (dronabinol, Marinol or THC, which is an active ingredient of marijuana) is safe
      and effective in reducing the symptoms of spasticity and tremor in patients with
      secondary-progressive or primary progressive multiple sclerosis.

    <textblock>
      The treatment of MS is far from satisfactory. For acute attacks, high dose corticosteroids
      seem to reduce the duration of attacks and to reduce the likelihood of future attacks.
      Immunomodulatory agents, available in this disease over the last decade, reduce the frequency
      of severe attacks by about one third. The remainder of the treatments are symptomatic, aimed
      at reducing the disability already present.

      Recent research into the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptor systems suggest that cannabis may
      have the potential for affecting both the pathogenic mechanisms and the symptoms of MS. In
      light of the autoimmune hypothesis of the etiology of MS, THC could directly alter immune
      function in a manner that might reduce (or increase) the primary pathology of the disease.

      Comparisons: Three treatment arms will be compared:

        1. inhaled cannabis and oral placebo

        2. inhaled placebo and oral THC

        3. inhaled placebo and oral placebo

      The effects of these agents analyzed at 3 weeks and 7 weeks.

    <measure>Change From Week 0 to Week 3 in the Rate of Torque Increase, Flexion</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>A modified servo-controlled torque motor system (Lido WorkSet II) was designed for this study to analyze the resistance to passive movement of the knee. It determines the amount of torque required to move the knee joint (without voluntary resistance) at high velocities (up to 200 degrees per second) and at slow velocities (as low as 10 degrees per second). The slow displacement torque is a measure of the passive resistance to movement (from the connective tissue and the non-contracting muscle) and the rapid displacement torques are the sum of the passive and active (involuntary) resistance. The active (involuntary) resistance is the result of the stretch reflex and correlates well with the clinical assessment of spasticity. The change was calculated by taking the value at Week 3 and subtracting the value at Week 0. A negative result indicates a decrease in the torque measured and correlates to a decrease in spasticity and a better outcome.</description>

Higher values indicate more impaired function. The change was calculated by taking the Week 7 score and subtracting the Week 0 score. A negative result indicates an improvement in function and correlates to a better outcome. Fatigue did not contribute to this FS score or the EDSS total score.</description>

    <description>The EDSS is a method of quantifying disability in MS patients and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time. The EDSS quantifies disability in 7 functional systems (FS): visual, brainstem, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel and bladder, and cerebral, and includes a measure of ambulation. Neurostatus version 10/2002 was used for this study. The total EDSS score ranges from 0 to 10, in 0.5 unit increments. A score of 0 is the lowest (normal neurological exam) and 10 is the highest (death due to MS). Higher values indicate more impaired function. The change was calculated by taking the Week 3 score and subtracting the Week 0 score. A negative result indicates an improvement in function and correlates to a better outcome.</description>

        <description>A modified servo-controlled torque motor system (Lido WorkSet II) was designed for this study to analyze the resistance to passive movement of the knee. It determines the amount of torque required to move the knee joint (without voluntary resistance) at high velocities (up to 200 degrees per second) and at slow velocities (as low as 10 degrees per second). The slow displacement torque is a measure of the passive resistance to movement (from the connective tissue and the non-contracting muscle) and the rapid displacement torques are the sum of the passive and active (involuntary) resistance. The active (involuntary) resistance is the result of the stretch reflex and correlates well with the clinical assessment of spasticity. The change was calculated by taking the value at Week 3 and subtracting the value at Week 0. A negative result indicates a decrease in the torque measured and correlates to a decrease in spasticity and a better outcome.</description>

A negative result for this outcome indicates an improvement in ambulation and correlates to a better outcome.</description>
          <population>Only 28 subjects completed the study through the Wk 7 visit; Of these 28 subjects, all 28 subjects had Ambulation Index assessments at both the Week 0 and Week 7 study visits and were able to be analyzed for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Change From Week 0 to Week 3 in the Rate of Torque Increase, Extension</title>
        <description>A modified servo-controlled torque motor system (Lido WorkSet II) was designed for this study to analyze the resistance to passive movement of the knee. It determines the amount of torque required to move the knee joint (without voluntary resistance) at high velocities (up to 200 degrees per second) and at slow velocities (as low as 10 degrees per second). The slow displacement torque is a measure of the passive resistance to movement (from the connective tissue and the non-contracting muscle) and the rapid displacement torques are the sum of the passive and active (involuntary) resistance. The active (involuntary) resistance is the result of the stretch reflex and correlates well with the clinical assessment of spasticity. The change was calculated by taking the value at Week 3 and subtracting the value at Week 0. A negative result indicates a decrease in the torque measured and correlates to a decrease in spasticity and a better outcome.</description>

        <description>A modified servo-controlled torque motor system (Lido WorkSet II) was designed for this study to analyze the resistance to passive movement of the knee. It determines the amount of torque required to move the knee joint (without voluntary resistance) at high velocities (up to 200 degrees per second) and at slow velocities (as low as 10 degrees per second). The slow displacement torque is a measure of the passive resistance to movement (from the connective tissue and the non-contracting muscle) and the rapid displacement torques are the sum of the passive and active (involuntary) resistance. The active (involuntary) resistance is the result of the stretch reflex and correlates well with the clinical assessment of spasticity. The change was calculated by taking the value at Week 7 and subtracting the value at Week 0. A negative result indicates a decrease in the torque measured and correlates to a decrease in spasticity and a better outcome.</description>

        <population>Only 28 subjects completed the study through the Wk 7 visit; Of these 28 subjects, only 26 subjects had Lido assessments at both the Week 0 and Week 7 study visits and were able to be analyzed for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Change From Week 0 to Week 3 in Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) Score</title>
        <description>The PASAT is a measure of cognitive function that specifically assesses auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability; The test is presented via recording on a CD to control the rate of stimulus presentation. Single digits are presented every 3 seconds and the patient must add each new digit to the one immediately prior to it. The test score is the number of correct sums given (out of a possible 60) in each trial. There are 2 test forms, A and B. The forms were alternated and at least 1 practice test (10 sums) was performed prior to each trial. The change was calculated by taking the Week 3 score and subtracting the Week 0 score. A negative result indicates an improvement in performance and correlates with a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Week 0 to Week 3 in Functional System Score - Vision</title>
        <description>The EDSS is a method of quantifying disability in MS patients and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time. The EDSS quantifies disability in 7 functional systems (FS): visual, brainstem, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel and bladder, and cerebral, and includes a measure of ambulation. Neurostatus version 10/2002 was used for this study. The FS Vision score is determined by a 7-point scale, with 0 being the lowest (normal) and 6 being the highest (grade 5 plus maximal visual acuity of better eye of 20/60 (0.3) or less).
Higher values indicate more impaired vision. The change was calculated by taking the Week 3 score and subtracting the Week 0 score. A negative result indicates an improvement in vision and correlates to a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Week 0 to Week 3 in Functional System Score - Brainstem</title>
        <description>The EDSS is a method of quantifying disability in MS patients and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time. The EDSS quantifies disability in 7 functional systems (FS): visual, brainstem, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel and bladder, and cerebral, and includes a measure of ambulation. Neurostatus version 10/2002 was used for this study. The FS Brainstem score is determined by a 6-point scale, with 0 being the lowest (normal) and 5 being the highest (inability to swallow or speak). Higher values indicate more impaired function. The change was calculated by taking the Week 3 score and subtracting the Week 0 score. A negative result indicates an improvement in function and correlates to a better outcome.</description>

          <title>Change From Week 0 to Week 3 in Functional System Score - Cerebellar</title>
          <description>The EDSS is a method of quantifying disability in MS patients and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time. The EDSS quantifies disability in 7 functional systems (FS): visual, brainstem, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel and bladder, and cerebral, and includes a measure of ambulation. Neurostatus version 10/2002 was used for this study. The FS Cerebellar score is determined by a 6-point scale, with 0 being the lowest (normal) and 5 being the highest (unable to perform coordinated movements due to ataxia). Higher values indicate more impaired function. The change was calculated by taking the Week 3 score and subtracting the Week 0 score. A negative result indicates an improvement in function and correlates to a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Week 0 to Week 7 in Functional System Score - Bowel and Bladder</title>
        <description>The EDSS is a method of quantifying disability in MS patients and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time. The EDSS quantifies disability in 7 functional systems (FS): visual, brainstem, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel and bladder, and cerebral, and includes a measure of ambulation. Neurostatus version 10/2002 was used for this study. The FS Bowel and Bladder score is determined by a 7-point scale, with 0 being the lowest (normal) and 6 being the highest (loss of bowel and bladder function). Higher values indicate more impaired function. The change was calculated by taking the Week 7 score and subtracting the Week 0 score. A negative result indicates an improvement in function and correlates to a better outcome.</description>

        <population>Only 28 subjects completed the study through the Wk 7 visit; Of these 28 subjects, only 27 subjects had FS Bowel &amp; Bladder assessments at both the Week 0 and Week 7 study visits and were able to be analyzed for this outcome measure.</population>

A score of 0 is the lowest (normal neurological exam) and 10 is the highest (death due to MS). Higher values indicate more impaired function. The change was calculated by taking the Week 7 score and subtracting the Week 0 score. A negative result indicates an improvement in function and correlates to a better outcome.</description>

The change was calculated by taking the Week 3 score and subtracting the Week 0. A positive result indicates an improvement in mental health status and correlates to a better outcome. A negative result indicates a decline in mental health and correlates to a worse outcome.</description>
          <population>Only 28 subjects completed the study through the Wk 7 visit; Of these 28 subjects, only 23 subjects completed all SF-36 mental component questions at both the Week 0 and Week 7 study visits and were able to be analyzed for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Change From Week 0 to Week3 in MS Quality of Life Inventory (MSQLI) - Modified Fatigue Index Score</title>
        <description>The Modified Fatigue Index is a 21-item scale developed to assess the perceived impact of fatigue on daily activities. It is a part of the MS Quality of Life Inventory. The scale is measured from 0-84. The scale is set up so that a higher score indicates a greater impact of fatigue on a patient's daily activities. The change was calculated by taking the Week 3 score and subtracting the Week 0 score. A negative result indicates a decrease in the impact of fatigue on daily activities and correlates to a better outcome. A positive result indicates an increase in the impact of fatigue on daily activities and correlates to a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Week 0 to Week 3 in MS Quality of Life Inventory (MSQLI) - Sexual Satisfaction Scale Score</title>
        <description>The Sexual Satisfaction Scale is a 4-item scale developed to assess the impact of multiple sclerosis on sexual function and satisfaction. It is a part of the MS Quality of Life Inventory. The scale is measured from 4-24. The scale is set up so that a higher score indicates greater problems with sexual satisfaction. Subjects that answered &quot;No&quot; to the question, &quot;Do you have a relationship with one primary partner&quot;, did not complete the scale. The change was calculated by taking the Week 3 score and subtracting the Week 0 score. A negative result indicates an improvement in sexual satisfaction and correlates to a better outcome. A positive result indicates a decrease in sexual satisfaction and correlates to a worse outcome.</description>

The scale is measured from 0-26. The scale is set up so that a higher score indicates greater bowel control problems. The change was calculated by taking the Week 3 score and subtracting the Week 0 score. A negative result indicates an improvement in bowel control and correlates to a better outcome. A positive result indicates a decrease in bowel control and correlates to a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>The Perceived Deficits Scale is a 20-item scale developed to assess the patient's perceived cognitive deficits. It is composed of four 5-item subscales: Attention/Concentration, Retrospective Memory, Prospective Memory, and Planning/Organization. It is a part of the MS Quality of Life Inventory. The total score is measured from 0-80. The scale is set up so that a higher score indicates greater perceived cognitive impairment. The change was calculated by taking the Week 3 score and subtracting the Week 0 score. A negative result indicates a decrease in the perception of cognitive impairment. A positive result indicates an increase in the perception of cognitive impairment. Since patient perceptions of cognitive impairment may not correlate with objective measures of cognitive impairment, the results should be interpreted with caution.</description>

        <title>Change From Week 0 to Week 7 in MS Quality of Life Inventory (MSQLI) - Perceived Deficits Scale Score</title>
        <description>The Perceived Deficits Scale is a 20-item scale developed to assess the patient's perceived cognitive deficits. It is composed of four 5-item subscales: Attention/Concentration, Retrospective Memory, Prospective Memory, and Planning/Organization. It is a part of the MS Quality of Life Inventory. The total score is measured from 0-80. The scale is set up so that a higher score indicates greater perceived cognitive impairment. The change was calculated by taking the Week 7 score and subtracting the Week 0 score. A negative result indicates a decrease in the perception of cognitive impairment. A positive result indicates an increase in the perception of cognitive impairment. Since patient perceptions of cognitive impairment may not correlate with objective measures of cognitive impairment, the results should be interpreted with caution.</description>

          <title>Change From Week 0 to Week 7 in MS Quality of Life Inventory (MSQLI) - Modified Social Support Scale Score</title>
          <description>The Modified Social Support Scale is an 18-item scale developed as a measure of perceived social support. It is a part of the MS Quality of Life Inventory. The total score is measured from 0-100. The scale is set up so that a higher score indicates greater perceived support. The change was calculated by taking the Week 7 score and subtracting the Week 0 score. A positive result indicates an improvement in perceived support and correlates to a better outcome. A negative result indicates a decrease in perceived support and correlates to a worse outcome.</description>
          <population>Only 28 subjects completed the study through the Wk 7 visit; Of these 28 subjects, only 26 subjects completed all Modified Social Support scale questions at both the Week 0 and Week 7 study visits and were able to be analyzed for this outcome measure.</population>
