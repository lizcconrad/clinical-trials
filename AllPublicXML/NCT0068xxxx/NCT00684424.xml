    <measure>Responders: Number of Subjects With a 50% or Greater Reduction in Seizure Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Responders: number of subjects with a 50 percent (%) or greater reduction in partial seizure frequency from Baseline to Final visit. Seizure frequency in treatment period = total number of partial seizures in maintenance treatment phase * 28 divided by total number of days in the maintenance treatment phase. Missing category includes subjects with missing attack date, insufficient length of treatment period or no seizures in both baseline and treatment periods. Subjects with zero seizures in the baseline period and some seizures in the treatment period were treated as non-responders.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Antiepileptic Drugs Used in the Past</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Antiepileptic drug history: number of subjects who took each class of antiepileptic drug prior to entering the study. Subjects who took more than one antiepileptic drug were counted for each of the drug classes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 28 Day Partial Seizure Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 16 (Final Visit )</time_frame>
    <description>Change in 28-day partial seizure frequency between the baseline period and treatment period. Baseline period = the 4 weeks (28 days) prior to Baseline visit. Treatment period = last 12 weeks (84 days) of the study (maintenance treatment phase excluding 4-week titration phase). Seizure frequency in baseline period = total number of partial seizures in baseline phase * 28 divided by total number of days in the baseline phase. Seizure frequency in treatment period = total number of partial seizures in maintenance treatment phase * 28 divided by total number of days in maintenance treatment phase.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Seizure Freedom: Number of Seizure-free Subjects During the Last 4 Weeks of the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8 up to Week 16 (Last 4 weeks of the treatment period)</time_frame>
    <description>Seizure Freedom (responders): subjects with no seizures (partial or other) during the last 4 weeks of the study. Non-responders: subjects with seizures (partial or other)during the last 4 weeks of the study. Subjects, who discontinued less than 4 weeks into the observation period were excluded from analysis. The 4 week period excludes the titration phase of the study. Missing category includes subjects with missing attack date or insufficient length of treatment period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Concomitant Drug Treatments</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 16 (Final Visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Concomitant drugs treatments (drugs other than, and in addition to study medication): number of subjects who took each concomitant drug during the study (baseline through end of study). World Health Organization (WHO) Drug (v02Q2) coding dictionary applied.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale of Anxiety (VAS-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 16 (Final Visit), Last Observation Carried Forward</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analog Scale of anxiety self assessment: metric measurement (in 2 mm interval) from the visual analog scale; 0 mm = no anxiety, 100 mm = extreme anxiety at each visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Final Visit in Visual Analog Scale of Anxiety (VAS-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16 (Final Visit), Last Observation Carried Forward</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analog Scale of anxiety self assessment: metric measurement (in 2 mm interval) from the visual analog scale; 0 mm = no anxiety, 100 mm = extreme anxiety. Change from Baseline to Final Visit: score at final visit minus score at baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Categorical Scores on Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S scale: physician's global impression of a subject's clinical condition, at baseline in terms of severity. Numerical scale ranging from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill subjects). Numbers of subjects in each category are presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Categorical Scores on Clinical Global Impression of Change(CGI-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16 (Final Visit)</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-C scale: physician's global impression of a subject's clinical condition in terms of change from baseline. Improvement = CGI response of very much improved, much improved, or minimally improved. No Change = CGI response of no change. Worsening = CGI response of very much worse, much worse or minimally worse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medical Outcomes Sleep Scale (MOS-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16 (Final Visit )</time_frame>
    <description>MOS-S: subject reported measure with 12 items that assess key constructs of sleep over the past week. Scoring based on 7 subscales: sleep disturbance, snoring, awakened short of breath or with headache, sleep adequacy, and somnolence (range:0-100); sleep quantity (range:0-24), and optimal sleep (yes:1, no:0). Six(6) and 9 item index measures of sleep disturbance were constructed to provide composite scores. Scores are transformed (actual raw score minus lowest possible score divided by possible raw score range * 100); total score range: 0 to 100; higher score = greater intensity of attribute.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Change in Response Categories in Medical Outcomes Sleep Scale (MOS-S): Optimal Sleep Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16 (Final Visit)</time_frame>
    <description>MOS: subject rated questionnaire to assess sleep quality and quantity. Optimal sleep subscale is derived from Sleep Quantity average hours of sleep each night during the past week. Number of subjects with response: YES (Optimal) if sleep quantity was 7 or 8 hours per night, or response = NO (Non-Optimal) if sleep quantity was less than (&lt;) 7 hours per night. Number of participants with shift in response categories from Baseline to Final Visit.</description>

        <title>Medical Outcomes Sleep Scale (MOS-S)</title>
        <description>MOS-S: subject reported measure with 12 items that assess key constructs of sleep over the past week. Scoring based on 7 subscales: sleep disturbance, snoring, awakened short of breath or with headache, sleep adequacy, and somnolence (range:0-100); sleep quantity (range:0-24), and optimal sleep (yes:1, no:0). Six(6) and 9 item index measures of sleep disturbance were constructed to provide composite scores. Scores are transformed (actual raw score minus lowest possible score divided by possible raw score range * 100); total score range: 0 to 100; higher score = greater intensity of attribute.</description>
