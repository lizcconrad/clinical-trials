    <textblock>
      To verify the number of metastatic brain tumors detected in contrast-enhanced MRI, which is
      the primary variable, increases after an additional dose of Magnevist (SH L 451A) comparing
      images after an initial dose (0.1 mmol/kg) with those after an additional dose (0.1 mmol/kg,
      a total dose of 0.2 mmol/kg) intra-individually in patients with metastatic brain tumors.
      Safety was also to be assessed.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are confirmed to have 1-5 metastatic brain tumor by the latest
             contrast-enhanced cerebral CT or contrast-enhanced cerebral MRI, and the lesion(s)
             have not been treated by surgery or by stereotactic radiosurgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are scheduled to receive another contrast medium for MRI (except for oral
             agents) or iodine contrast medium (except for oral agents), or to undergo surgical
             procedures during the period from the day before administration of Magnevist (SH L
             451A) to examination of safety on the following day.

          -  Patients who underwent or are scheduled to undergo radiotherapy during the period from
             14 days before administration of Magnevist (SH L 451A) to examination of safety on the
             following day.

          -  Patients who were treated or are scheduled to be treated with anti-cancer agents
             (except for treatment only by the oral agents of the fixed dose continuously from 28
             days or more before administration of Magnevist (SH L 451A)) during the period from 28
             days before administration of Magnevist (SH L 451A) to examination of safety on the
             following day.
