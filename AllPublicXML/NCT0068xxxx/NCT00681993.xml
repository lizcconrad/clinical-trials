  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast conserving therapy, (BCT), which consists of wide local excision of the tumor followed
      by 6 weeks of whole breast irradiation, (WBI), is integral to the management of breast
      cancer. Evidence now suggests that WBI may not be necessary and treatment to the involved
      area only, partial breast irradiation, (PBI), may suffice. PBI can be achieved by
      interstitial or intracavitary brachytherapy, intra-op, or post op external beam radiation
      therapy. The feasibility, toxicity and efficacy of PBI are currently being studied in both
      the U.S. and Europe. Review of smaller studies suggests that PBI will prove to be comparable
      to WBI. Chemotherapy combined with radiation has been shown to increase local control in BCT
      when compared to radiation alone. However there is little data on how sequencing or timing of
      these therapies with respect to one another affect outcome. As a result there is no consensus
      about the optimal combination. There are real and potential benefits to concurrent
      chemo-radiation therapy. Concurrent therapy 1) allows both treatments to start closer to
      surgery, theoretically maximizing the benefits of each modality; 2) shortens the overall
      treatment program; and 3) may also improve local control via chemo-sensitization of residual
      cancer cells. However, concurrent chemotherapy and WBI have been associated with prohibitive
      skin toxicity. Since less breast tissue is treated with PBI, this skin toxicity may no longer
      be prohibitive. We have shown in J0381 that PBI and concurrent dose dense AC is safe. As a
      follow-up, we propose a phase I/II trial addressing the toxicity and efficacy associated with
      PBI delivered concurrently with various chemotherapy regimens.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Eligibility Criteria:

        Each of the criteria in the following section must be met in order for a patient to be
        considered eligible for registration.

          -  Patient must be older than 18 years of age

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed (by routine H&amp;E staining) adenocarcinoma
             of the breast, with the primary tumor &lt; 4 cm and 0 - 3 positive axillary lymph nodes
             (pathologic T1-2, pathologic N0 -N1, M0). Patients with squamous carcinomas or
             sarcomas of the breast cancer are NOT eligible.

          -  Patient must have a history and physical within six weeks prior to the start of any
             protocol therapy.

          -  Patient must have had a bilateral mammogram prior to surgery.

          -  Patients must have undergone a segmental mastectomy (SM) with a level I and ll
             axillary dissection or sentinel lymph node biopsy. Surgical margins at time of SM must
             be negative (&gt; or = 2 mm) for both invasive carcinoma and for non-invasive ductal
             carcinoma. Patients who have post-operative margins which are negative but less than
             2mm will be considered eligible if the surgeon states that the margin in question
             could not be improved.

          -  Patient must have a Medical Oncology consult and be recommended to receive one of the
             following regimens: Cyclophosphamide and Doxorubicin (AC); Taxotere, Doxorubicin and
             Cyclophosphamide (TAC); Taxotere and Cyclophosphamide (TC) or Taxotere, Carboplatin
             and Trastuzumab (TCH) prior to registration. The use of additional chemotherapy,
             hormonal therapy or Trastuzumab after the initial regimen is at the discretion of the
             medical oncologist.

          -  Patients must be registered such that radiation therapy begins no sooner than 7 days
             prior to, but no later than 7 days after, day 1 of cycle 1 (C1D1). Patient must start
             chemotherapy and radiation less than 14 weeks from the last breast surgical procedure.

          -  Patients must NOT have received any neo adjuvant chemo or hormonal therapy for the
             current cancer.

          -  Patients must have a performance status 0 or 1 by ECOG criteria

          -  Patients must not have received prior radiation therapy to the involved breast at any
             time for any reason.

          -  Any patient with active local-regional disease prior to registration is not eligible.

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or
             squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or any other cancer from which the
             patient has been disease-free for 5 years.

          -  Patients must not be pregnant due to the potential for fetal harm as a result of this
             treatment regimen. Women of child-bearing potential must use effective non hormonal
             contraception while undergoing radiation therapy. Women of child-bearing potential
             must also have a negative pregnancy test within six weeks prior to start of protocol
             therapy.

          -  Patients must not have a serious medical or psychiatric illness which prevents
             informed consent or compliance with treatment.

          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and given
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.
