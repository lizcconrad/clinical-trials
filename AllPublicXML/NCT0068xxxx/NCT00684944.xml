    <textblock>
      This is an open label, dose-ranging study of two doses of TRx0014 in patients with mild or
      moderate Alzheimer's Disease. The trial is made available to any patient ongoing on treatment
      in the clinical trial designated TRx-014-001 at termination of that study. Treatment for each
      individual patient will continue for as long as the treating physician feels there is benefit
      to the patient. This current protocol covers each patient for 12 months in the first
      instance.
