  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pre-pubic approach of the tension free vaginal sling placement is a new approach in the
      treatment of SUI. The retropubic approach of the tension free vaginal sling is the standard
      method of device delivery; in addition a suprapubic and a transobturator approach are
      alternative methods of delivery. All of these delivery approach systems are intended to place
      the mesh &quot;tension free&quot; in the mid-urethra.

      There are currently no studies that investigate the pre-pubic delivery approach in the United
      States. However, the largest series of cases in Europe using the pre-pubic system was done by
      Ulmsten (published in the European Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Reproductive
      Biology) 107 (2003) 205-207, titled &quot; Pre-Pubic tension free vaginal tape application: an
      alternative to classic tension free vaginal tape application in selected patients with SUI.&quot;

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using a pre-pubic
      approach to the placement of a mid-urethral vaginal mesh.

        -  Demonstrate the mesh can be properly placed in the mid-urethra using a pre-pubic
           approach;

        -  Assess the performance of the delivery device by measuring the ease of use, technical
           complexity, and instrument difficulties

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female greater than 18 years of age

             consent to participate in the study

          -  Diagnosed with genuine SUI confirmed by urodynamic evaluation (urodynamic evaluations
             performed in the past 6 months are acceptable) and documented in the source documents
             as in patients charts, physicians notes, nurses notes, hospital records, etc.

          -  If the patient has an overactive bladder, the condition must be a minor component of
             the patient's disorder demonstrated by the urodynamic testing. This is a physician

          -  discretion for inclusion or exclusion in the study.

          -  Patients are willing to complete (PFDI-short form 20) and PISQ-12 at baseline, 3
