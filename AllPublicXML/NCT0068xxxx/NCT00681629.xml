    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the well-being of schizophrenic patients treated
      with quetiapine XR combined with participation in the integrated care program compared to a
      treatment with quetiapine XR alone over a period of 18 month

At each hospitalisation, the number of days will be computed and at each visit, the cumulative total number of days will be used to calculate total costs. As higher the number of hospitalisation days as higher the costs per patient.</description>
