    <textblock>
      Asthma is a major health problem worldwide. The measurement of fractional exhaled nitric
      oxide (FENO) has been established as a valuable non invasive and simple tool in the diagnosis
      of asthma and may also act as a useful surrogate inflammatory marker on which to base
      treatment decisions in asthma management algorithms. The measurement is useful also in other
      respiratory diseases. Current methods of measuring FENO include on line measurements by heavy
      duty expensive analyzers which are not widely and easily available. Off line measurements of
      breath samples which can be analysed later may be a simple solution. We hypothesize tha toff
      line measurements of NO will be as reliable and valid as those measured on-line
