  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to identify persons with rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism
      (RDP) or mutations of the RDP gene, document prevalence of the disease, and map its natural
      history.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP) is a rare, movement disorder with variable
      characteristics ranging from sudden onset (hours to days) of severe dystonic spasms to
      gradual onset of writer's cramp. RDP has elements of both dystonia and Parkinson's
      diseaseâ€”two neurological diseases with motor and neuropsychological symptoms that hinder the
      quality of life. An internal trigger associated with extreme physiological stress has been
      reported prior to abrupt symptom onset of RDP.

      This study, which is a continuation of an earlier study begun by Dr. Allison Brashear, aims
      to more clearly identify the characteristics associated with RDP and to explore whether
      mutations in the RDP gene are associated with atypical dystonias, Parkinson's disease, and
      other movement disorders.

      Physicians from around the world who suspect their patients may have RDP or other movement
      disorders will send videotaped neurological assessments of their patients and blood samples
      for genetic analysis.
