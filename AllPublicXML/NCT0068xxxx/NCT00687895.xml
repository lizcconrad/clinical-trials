      General objective: To improve the quality of fever case management in children in government
      health facilities in Tanzania Hypothesis:The training of health workers, as well as
      provision, training and use of microscopes for malaria diagnosis will improve the treatment
      of clinical episodes of fever in children while reducing the amount and costs of drugs

      PHC facilities were eligible for the study if they were rural government owned; accessible by
      road during rainy season; and within 3 hours by car from Muhimbili University College of
      Health Sciences (MUCHS), Dar es Salaam

      All children attending the 16 PHC facilities under the study during daytime were enrolled if
      they fulfilled the following criteria:

        1. below five years of age

        2. fever (temperature≥37.5◦C) and/or reported history of fever in last 2 days

        3. able to return to the facility on day 7 after treatment or any other day if symptoms
           were to worsen or recur

        4. the mother/guardian or caretaker consented to participate.

      Patients with severe disease and/or general danger signs requiring inpatient care according
      to the IMCI guidelines were admitted or referred to the health centers or the district
      hospitals
