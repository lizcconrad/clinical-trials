    <textblock>
      The study explores efficacy and safety of the lipid-lowering therapy with CRESTOR in
      statin-naive patients and in patients with previously unsuccessful statin therapy. This study
      was designed to investigate the dynamic of the lipid parameters and therapy tolerability
      during 8-10 weeks treatment with CRESTOR
