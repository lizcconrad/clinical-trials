    <textblock>
      Classical imaging techniques are inaccurate to detect residual cholesteatoma. The aim of our
      study is to evaluate the value of diffusion-weighted MR imaging and delayed contrast enhanced
      T1 weighted spin-echo sequences in the detection of residual cholesteatoma in children, in a
      large serie of surgically verified cases.

    <textblock>
      Classical imaging techniques are inaccurate to detect residual cholesteatoma. Thin-section CT
      detects that the postoperative cavity is filled with a soft tissue mass. Classical MR imaging
      (T2 and T1 weighted spin-echo sequences) can not provide additionnal information about the
      nature of this filling : cholesteatoma, granulation or fibrous tissue.
