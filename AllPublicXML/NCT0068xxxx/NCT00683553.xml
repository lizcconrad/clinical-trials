  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, dose escalation, safety and pharmacokinetic
      study. The study will be conducted in approximately 10 sites in the United States. Up to 48
      patients at high risk for AKI (CCF score ≥ 5 OR an estimated GFR (eGFR) &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2)
      who have undergone major cardiovascular surgery will participate. Patients will receive a
      single IV injection of I5NP or placebo following cardiovascular surgery. I5NP will be
      administered 4 hours (+/- 30 minutes) following removal of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine
      (CBM).

      The duration of the study is approximately 44 days, inclusive of a 14 day screening period.
      Patients will be contacted by phone at 6 and 12 months for follow-up questions. Patient
      visits are screening, day of surgery, hospital in-patient Days 1, 2, 3 - 5 and Day 7 or
      hospital discharge. Safety follow-up will continue until 30 days post-surgery. 2 phone calls
      will be made at 6 and 12 months after date of surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug (I5NP) is a small interfering RNA that is being developed to protect patients from
      acute kidney injury after cardiac bypass surgery. This study will test the safety of I5NP and
      measure how long the drug stays in the blood stream after injection. This study is not meant
      to test if I5NP protects kidneys from the damage that may occur in rare cases during surgery.
      Another purpose of this dose escalation study is to find out the right dose of the
      experimental drug to be given to study subjects in future studies. Even though there were no
      harmful effects seen in the animals tested, we do not know what side effects the experimental
      drug might cause in humans.

        Inclusion Criteria (before surgery):

             including post-hospitalization discharge follow-up

          -  Patient is undergoing any major cardiac or vascular surgery requiring the use of
             cardiopulmonary bypass machine (CBM)

          -  Patient has a cumulative score of ≥ 5 on the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF) Acute
             Kidney Injury (AKI) risk factor scale OR the patient has an estimated GFR (eGFR) &lt;60
             mL/min/1.73 m2, as determined from the simplified (4-variable) MDRD (Modification of
             Diet in Renal Disease) equation at the time of the Screening/Baseline examination
