      The aim of this study is to measure important components of weight change in patients who
      underwent bariatric surgery on measures of fat mass and its distribution and fat-free mass
      (FFM) (bone mineral density, skeletal muscle, and specific organs) at 60 months (T60) and 84
      months (T84) post-surgery, and to compare compartment sizes with stable weight controls.

      Consenting, eligible patients previously enrolled in the ancillary study, &quot;Longitudinal
      Assessment of Bariatric Surgery&quot; (LABS), from Weill Cornell and the University of Pittsburgh
      will undergo the following measures: total body water by deuterium dilution (fat and fat-free
      mass (FFM)), extracellular water by sodium bromide tracer, body density by the BodPod,
      whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (adipose tissue and its distribution; skeletal
      muscle mass; mass of liver, kidneys, heart, and brain), dual energy-X-ray absorptiometry
      (femur bone mineral density (BMD), total body fat, fat-free mass, and bone mineral content),
      and resting energy expenditure (REE). MRI will describe body composition changes at the
      tissue/organ level and adipose tissue distribution allowing us to address questions of
      biological and clinical importance including the body composition changes' influences on REE.
      The specific aims are to: 1) measure important components of weight change in patients who
      underwent bariatric surgery on measures of fat mass and its distribution and FFM (including
      bone mineral density, skeletal muscle, and specific organs) at T60 and T84 months following
      surgery, and also to compare compartment sizes with those seen in stable weight controls; 2)
      measure the amount of change in REE at T60 and T84 compared to T0, following weight loss
      induced by bariatric surgery and to determine its relation to changes in body composition
      compartments, and its duration over the follow-up period. Secondary research questions relate
      to changes in cardiac structure and function, physical activity associations with skeletal
      muscle changes, and adipose tissue depot changes as predictors of cardiometabolic parameters
      (glucose metabolism and serum lipid composition). Subjects will be women and men (n=100)
      equally distributed between the New York and Pittsburgh sites.
