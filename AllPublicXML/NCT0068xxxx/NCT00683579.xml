    <textblock>
      ATN 071 is a prospective cohort study comparing neurocognitive functioning in four groups of
      youth, age 18-24: Two groups with CD4+ T cells above 350 cells/mm3 and HIV RNA &gt;1,000
      copies/ml, one initiating HAART (Group 1) and the other not initiating treatment (Group 2);
      and two groups with CD4+ T cells &lt; 350 cells/mm3, one initiating treatment (Group 3) and the
      other not initiating treatment (Group 4). Groups 2 and 3 represent standard of care. Group 1
      and a portion of group 2 will be co-enrolled in ATN 061 and will be randomly assigned to
      group by that protocol.

        English or Spanish speaking youth, 18 years 0 days to 24 years 364 days, with HIV-1
        infection acquired after age 9 via behavioral means, in the following immunological and
        treatment categories:

          1. Early initiation of HAART and enrolled in 061 Arm A; CD4+ T cells above 350 cells/mm3
             and HIV RNA &gt;1,000 copies/ml;

          2. Initiation of HAART per DHHS guidelines (standard of care) but not yet meeting
             criteria. There will be 25 participants from ATN 061 preferentially enrolled into this
             protocol; an additional 25 participants will be enrolled with similar biomedical
             characteristics.

          3. Initiation of HAART per DHHS guidelines (not part of ATN 061).

          4. Meeting DHHS guidelines for initiating HAART, but not initiating due to unwillingness
             or providers' expectation of poor adherence.

          -  HIV positive participants age 18 years and 0 days to 24 years and 364 days (the lower
             age limit of this study is driven by the restriction of ATZ use to age 18 and
             greater);

             determined by two consecutive measures within 6 months of entry with the second
             measure being collected at pre-entry to ATN 061;

          -  Infected with HIV after the age of nine via behavioral means;

          -  Participant initiating HAART.

        Group 4 ONLY:

          -  HAART has not been prescribed due to either participant's refusal to initiate HAART or
             provider's concerns about participant's predicted inability to adhere to regimen.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Groups 1 and 2:

          -  For Groups 1 and 2: any history of an AIDS-defining illness;

          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site personnel,
             would interfere with meeting study requirements;

          -  History of cognitive or motor impairment due to non-HIV-related conditions (for
             example, prematurity, cerebral palsy, closed head injury, CNS cancer or cranial
             irradiation, etc.) or psychosis. Youth with diagnoses of learning disabilities or
             attention deficit hyperactivity disorder will be allowed in the study;

          -  Enrollment of youth with chronic or acute medical conditions other than HIV that could
             potentially impact upon neurocognitive functioning requires protocol chair approval.
