      The present pharmacokinetic study is designed to assess the pharmacokinetics of RSG XR as
      monotherapy in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) as such information will not be
      obtained from the current phase III trials . The study aims to enroll fourteen patients
      (seven of each APOE genotype). Each patient will receive a single oral dose of 4mg of RSG XR
      in the morning under fasted conditions and PK samples will be taken up to 36h.

          -  be negative. More than one pregnancy test may be required (i.e., when the time period
             between enrolment and study treatment is &gt; 7 days).

          -  Pregnancy testing will be performed at screening, pre-dose (Day 1) and follow-up visit
             for all women of child-bearing potential and those who have been postmenopausal for
             less than 1 year. If clinically indicated, a urine or serum pregnancy test may be
             performed at anytime during the study.

          -  Brain CT or MRI scan performed within the past 12 months or at Screening, showing no
             evidence of any other potential cause of dementia other than Alzheimer's disease.

          -  Neurological exam without focal changes (excluding changes attributable to AD or
             peripheral trauma).

          -  Subjects who live with or who have a regular caregiver who is willing to attend all
             visits, oversee the subject's compliance with the protocol specified procedures and
             study medication, and who is willing to report on subject's status.

          -  Subject has provided full written informed consent prior to the performance of any
             protocol-specified procedure.

          -  Subjects considered for enrolment must have a QTc (either QTc B (Bazett's

          -  correction) or QTc F (Fridericia's correction)) &lt;450msec at the Screening Visit, with
             the exception of subjects with bundle branch block (for whom either QTc B or QTc F
             must be &lt;480msec).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Type 2 diabetes mellitus where the subject is being treated with insulin, a PPARγ
