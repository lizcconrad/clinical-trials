  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the safety profile and the photoirritant potential of
      eltrombopag in healthy subjects. The study is placebo- and positive controlled, randomized,
      parallel group with three treatment arms: eltrombopag (75 mg QD), placebo, and a positive
      control (ciprofloxacin, 500 mg BID). Eltrombopag will be administered in a double-blind
      fashion with respect to placebo and the positive control, ciprofloxacin, will be administered
      under observer-blinded conditions. Twelve to fifteen subjects will be recruited into each
      arm, to assure total enrollment of 36 evaluable subjects. The primary endpoint is the
      photosensitizing potential of eltrombopag as measured by photoirritant index (PI) and change
      in minimum erythemal dose (MED) in comparison with placebo.

             participants are not permitted to use Hormonal form of contraception (combined oral
             contraceptive pills etc) because of its known potential to induce photosensitivity.
