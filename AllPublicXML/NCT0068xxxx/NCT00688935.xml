  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to identify the presence of desynchronized circadian
      rhythms in 25 children by measuring melatonin secretion in serial blood or saliva samples,
      and to rule out any primary sleep disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will complete 25-hours of hourly salivary, plasma sampling biweekly. Melatonin will
      be measured in urine, for children under the age of 3. Sleep and behavioral questionnaires
      will be completed by parents and/or teachers. This study involves an optional, 1-year
      melatonin treatment sub-study, in which the children will take 0.1 - 3mg daily. A second
      optional sub-study involves a study of the child's sleep through polysomnography, in order to
      identify possible sleep disorders.
