  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The adequate treatment of the American tegumentary leishmaniasis is crucial since the
      disease, differently from the caused by the Old World species, is painful and not
      self-healing and may lead to the disfiguring mucosal involvement. So far, pentavalent
      antimony compounds have been considered the treatment of choice for cutaneous leishmaniasis
      (CL), however, these drugs present high frequency of side effects and important disadvantages
      as parenteral administration and need for careful renal and cardiac monitoring. Azithromycin
      is a macrolide antibiotic, non-expensive, largely commercially available that has shown
      in-vitro and in vivo activity against different species of Leishmania.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral azithromycin
      for the treatment of CL. The efficacy of oral treatment of azithromycin 500 mg/day for 20
      days is going to be compared with the standard treatment of intramuscular injections of 20
      mg/Kg/day of pentavalent antimonials (Glucantime®) for 20 days in patients with CL from two
      endemic regions of Brazil: the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte and Montes Claros (MG)in
      the southeast Brazil and in Corte de Pedras (Bahia), Northeastern Brazil. The patients follow
      up lasts for 12 months.

      Included a new site (University Estadual de Montes Claros - UNIMONTES) in 7 June 2010. The
      site was included due the need to achieve more patients. The ANVISA (National Agency of
      Sanitary Surveillance) approved these site in March 2011 and the start of activities is
      planned for June 2011.
