  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, Phase I study of a new investigational drug, VTX-2337, that may
      stimulate the immune system to help fight cancer. The purpose of the study is to assess the
      safety of the investigational drug and to identify the highest dose that is well-tolerated.
      The pharmacology of VTX-2337 will also be evaluated.
