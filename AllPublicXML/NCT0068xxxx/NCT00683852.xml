      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a reduced dose of aripiprazole is effective
      in treating patients with major depressive disorder
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 60-day, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on the efficacy of
      aripiprazole (Abilify) augmentation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or
      selective serotonin norepinephrine uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) venlafaxine in patients with MDD
      who have responded inadequately to treatment with ADTs. The purpose of our study is to
      evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of low-dose (2 mg/day) aripiprazole (Abilify) as an
      augmentation strategy in MDD non-responding to ADT with SSRIs or the SNRI venlafaxine.

    <measure>MADRS (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome was the difference in response rate (decrease in MADRS total score of at least 50%) using the SPCD (sequential parallel comparison design). The 10-item Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), which measures depression severity over the past week, was completed by clinicians using an MGH structured interview. Each item is measured on a scale from 0 to 6, and the items are summed to find the total score. The total minimum score is 0 units on a scale and the total maximum score is 60 units on a scale, where higher scores indicate more severe depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>MADRS (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) Readmission Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MADRS readmission rate is defined as MADRS score&lt;11. The 10-item Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), which measures depression severity over the past week, was completed by clinicians using an MGH structured interview. Each item is measured on a scale from 0 to 6, and the items are summed to find the total score. The total minimum score is 0 units on a scale and the total maximum score is 60 units on a scale, where higher scores indicate more severe depression.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in MADRS (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) Score From Baseline to the End of Follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-item Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), which measures depression severity over the past week, was completed by clinicians using an MGH structured interview. Each item is measured on a scale from 0 to 6, and the items are summed to find the total score. The total minimum score is 0 units on a scale and the total maximum score is 60 units on a scale, where higher scores indicate more severe depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S scale was administered by clinicians based on assessment of the patient's clinical status. They measured, based on history and scores on other instruments, depressive severity. It consists of one question scored on a seven-point scale (1 = normal to 7 = among the most severe), so a higher total score indicates greater depressive severity. The minimum score is 1, and the maximum score is 7.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Symptom Questionnaire (SQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SQ, a 92-item (yes/no) self-rating questionnaire, includes 4 distress and 4 well-being subscales. There are 68 items for the distress subscales and 24 items for the well-being subscales. Each item has either a Yes/No or True/False answer. For the distress symptom score, add together the following items and score 1 when the answer is Yes/True: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 39, 41, 42, 44, 45, 47, 48, 49, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 79, 80, 81, 82, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 90, 91, 92. Minimum score is 0 and maximum score is 68. A higher score indicates more distress symptoms. For the well-being subscale score, add together the following items and score 1 when the answer is No/False: 4, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 21, 23, 29, 31, 35, 38, 40, 43, 46, 50, 51, 71, 78, 83, 89. Minimum score is 0 and maximum score is 24. A higher score indicates more well-being.</description>

             protocol required procedures.

          2. Patients must be able to understand the nature of the study, agree to comply with the
             prescribed dosage regimens, report for regularly scheduled office visits, and
             communicate to study personnel about adverse events and concomitant medication use.

          3. Patients with a diagnosis of major depressive episode as defined by DSM-IV-TR
             criteria, based on the SCID-I/P; their major depressive episode must be deemed &quot;valid&quot;

             inadequate response to at least one and no more than three adequate antidepressant
             treatments. An inadequate response is defined as less than a 50% reduction in

          5. Patients must have a HAM-D17 ≥ 18 at the end of the screening phase to qualify for
             inclusion. The HAM-D17 will be administered by the study clinicians at the screening

             of pregnancy is minimized.

             WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone
             successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or
             bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea ³ 12
             consecutive months; or women on hormone replacement therapy [HRT] with documented
             serum follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] level &gt; 35 mIU/mL). Even women who are using

             be considered to be of childbearing potential.

             WOCBP must have a negative urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or

             least 16 at both screen and baseline visits;

         10. Treated with an SSRI at adequate doses (defined as 20mg/day or more of fluoxetine,
             citalopram; paroxetine 30mg/day or more or 37.5 mg/day or more of paroxetine CR; 10
             mg/day or more of escitalopram, 50mg/day or more of sertraline, and 150 mg/day or more

        to receive placebo in both phases or to receive placebo in Phase 1 and aripiprazole in
        phase 2, only those meeting non-response criteria will be added to the primary efficacy
        sample:

        <description>The primary outcome was the difference in response rate (decrease in MADRS total score of at least 50%) using the SPCD (sequential parallel comparison design). The 10-item Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), which measures depression severity over the past week, was completed by clinicians using an MGH structured interview. Each item is measured on a scale from 0 to 6, and the items are summed to find the total score. The total minimum score is 0 units on a scale and the total maximum score is 60 units on a scale, where higher scores indicate more severe depression.</description>

          <description>MADRS readmission rate is defined as MADRS score&lt;11. The 10-item Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), which measures depression severity over the past week, was completed by clinicians using an MGH structured interview. Each item is measured on a scale from 0 to 6, and the items are summed to find the total score. The total minimum score is 0 units on a scale and the total maximum score is 60 units on a scale, where higher scores indicate more severe depression.</description>

        <description>The CGI-S scale was administered by clinicians based on assessment of the patient’s clinical status. They measured, based on history and scores on other instruments, depressive severity. It consists of one question scored on a seven-point scale (1 = normal to 7 = among the most severe), so a higher total score indicates greater depressive severity. The minimum score is 1, and the maximum score is 7.</description>
