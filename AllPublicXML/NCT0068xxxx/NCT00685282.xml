  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general hypothesis of the research is that stress decreases fertility and that Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy will reduce stress and increase fertility. Secondarily, we hypothesize
      that stress has a detrimental effect on DNA integrity and that stress reduction will reduce
      DNA damage in the cell.

    <description>The intervention (CBT) will focus on teaching specific skills which are adapted for women undergoing fertility related problems. Through the sessions the participants will learn relaxation techniques such as breathing, progressive relaxation, and guided imagery. Furthermore, suggestions for making healthier choices for coping and for releasing tension will be reviewed and discussed, with an emphasis on making healthy lifestyle changes with balance and perspective rather than in a punishing or depriving way. Each session will consist of: 20 minutes of stress-reduction behavioral relaxation, 40 minutes of cognitive restructuring and 30 minutes personal tailoring of the behavioral homework between each session.</description>
