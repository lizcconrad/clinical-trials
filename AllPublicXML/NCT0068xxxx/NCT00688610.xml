      Antibiotics in patients with acute respiratory tract infections in primary care in
      consideration of procalcitonin as additive parameter.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the ordinary manner of antibiotic- prescription with
      the prescription in consideration of procalcitonin-value in patients with acute respiratory
      tract infections.

    <description>A. attending physician includes patient with acute respiratory infection in study, indicates antibiotic prescription and collects procalcitonin-value. Waits for decision from laboratory either &quot;change of decision&quot; or &quot;retention of decision&quot;. In case of &quot;change decision&quot;: antibiotic is not recommended, patient shall not take antibiotic. In case of &quot;retention of decision&quot;: patient may take the antibiotic.
B. attending physician includes patient with acute respiratory infection in study, indicates NO antibiotic and collects procalcitonin-value. Waits for decision from laboratory either &quot;change of decision&quot; or &quot;retention of decision&quot;. In case of &quot;change decision&quot;: antibiotic is recommended, patient has to be informed about. In case of &quot;retention of decision&quot;: no change.</description>
