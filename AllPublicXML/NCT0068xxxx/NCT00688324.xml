  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NMDA receptors are brain receptors that are stimulated by glutamate. Poorly functioning NMDA
      receptors are thought to be involved in the pathology of schizophrenia. This hypothesis is
      based on the observation that PCP, which blocks the NMDA receptor, produces symptoms and
      cognitive impairments similar to schizophrenia. Efforts to enhance the function of the NMDA
      receptor with glycine and D-cycloserine have met with limited success. An alternative
      approach would be to use the drug acamprosate.

      Acamprosate, FDA-approved for maintenance of sobriety after detoxification from alcohol,
      seems to act through modulation of the NMDA receptor. In the lab, acamprosate has been noted
      to act as an antagonist when the NMDA receptors are maximally stimulated but as an agonist
      when NMDA receptor stimulation is minimal. This &quot;smart drug&quot; action makes acamprosate
      appealing for use in schizophrenia. If acamprosate works as a smart drug in patients, then we
      would predict that it would enhance the function of NMDA receptors in schizophrenia and
      improve cognition and the symptoms of the illness. Additionally, acamprosate seems to
      modulate the NMDA receptor in novel ways distinct from glycine and D-cycloserine.

      We will also see if the response to acamprosate differs based on whether participants do or
      do not have a past history of alcohol use disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to measure the response of symptoms and cognition in people schizophrenia given
      acamprosate or placebo. We hypothesize that symptoms and cognition will improve following two
      weeks of acamprosate. We will also use proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to
      examine the effect of acamprosate on glutamate &amp; glutamine (Glu&amp;Gln) brain levels in people
      with schizophrenia. We hypothesize that Glu&amp;Gln concentrations in people with chronic
      schizophrenia will increase following two weeks of treatment with acamprosate.

      The proposed study will consist of 50 individuals with chronic schizophrenia/schizoaffective
      disorder, 18-55 years old, from in/outpatient programs at the Maryland Psychiatric Research
      Center (MPRC). The dose of acamprosate will follow manufacturer recommendations with two
      333mg tablets given three times per day. MRS will be acquired from areas involved in
      schizophrenia [dorsolateral-prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)] at
      baseline and week two. Symptom ratings and cognitive testing will occur at baseline and be
      repeated at week two.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Treatment Week 0) and End of Study (Treatment Week 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms of psychosis were measured with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). The items rated for psychosis are &quot;Conceptual Disorganization&quot;, &quot;Suspiciousness&quot;, &quot;Hallucinatory Behavior&quot;, and &quot;Unusual Thought Content&quot;. Each item score ranges from &quot;1=Not Present&quot; to &quot;7=Very Severe&quot;.

    <measure>BPRS - Symptoms of Psychosis Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Treatment Week 0) and End of Study (Treatment Week 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The psychosis total score is calculated by adding the scores for scales #4 Conceptual Disorganization, #11 Suspiciousness, #12 Hallucinatory Behavior, and #15 Unusual Thought Content. Each scale ranges from &quot;1=Not Present&quot; to &quot;7=Very Severe&quot;. The minimum psychosis score is 4 and the maximum psychosis score is 28. A higher score indicates a more severe psychosis rating.</description>

    <description>Negative symptoms of schizophrenia measured using the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) Total Score. SANS total score range = 0-85. Higher scores indicate more severe negative symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline (Treatment Week 0) to End of Study (Treatment Week 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive tests will include the DigitSymbol Test (evaluating processing speed), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT; evaluating verbal learning and episodic memory), and NBack (evaluating working memory).
Digit Symbol scaled scores range from 1 to 19, with the larger numbers indicating better performance.
On the CVLT, the delayed recognition score ranges from 0 to 16, with the larger numbers indicating better performance.
On the NBack test, subjects were asked to recall items 0-back, 1-back, and 2-back in a sequence. D-prime scores range from 0 to 8.6. Higher scores are better. As memory load increases from 0 to 1, from 1 to 2, D-prime scores are expected to be lower.</description>

        <description>Cognitive tests will include the DigitSymbol Test (evaluating processing speed), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT; evaluating verbal learning and episodic memory), and NBack (evaluating working memory).
Digit Symbol scaled scores range from 1 to 19, with the larger numbers indicating better performance.
On the CVLT, the delayed recognition score ranges from 0 to 16, with the larger numbers indicating better performance.
On the NBack test, subjects were asked to recall items 0-back, 1-back, and 2-back in a sequence. D-prime scores range from 0 to 8.6. Higher scores are better. As memory load increases from 0 to 1, from 1 to 2, D-prime scores are expected to be lower.</description>
