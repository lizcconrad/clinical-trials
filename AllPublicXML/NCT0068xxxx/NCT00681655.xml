      This study will assess whether the presence of a particular form of a gene, GABRA2, affects
      the functional responses of the human brain to alcohol administration and will evaluate that
      relationship in the context of factors known to increase the risk for future alcoholism.

    <description>Each subject completed a total of 2 2.8 hr-long clamping sessions.Within each session, procedures differed only by the content of the infusate. In one session, 6% ethanol was infused. In the other session, only vehicle was infused, quantifying the placebo response for every subject. The order of alcohol or placebo sessions was counterbalanced; subjects were blind to which session was which; sessions were scheduled to occur about 2 weeks apart. Measures were collected before, and at beginning and end of infusion, and included subjective perceptions, EEG, stop-signal performance, eye movements, and auditory responses. Design allowed analysis of effect of alcohol vs placebo, initial effect of alcohol and acute tolerance to alcohol.</description>
