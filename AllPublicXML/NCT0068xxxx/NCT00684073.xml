      This study is designed to determine if opioid dependent subjects who are already receiving
      Subutex® prefer the Suboxone® tablet over the Subutex® tablet after switching from Subutex®
      to Suboxone®. Subjects who are selected to participate in this study will continue their
      prescribed dose of Subutex® (buprenorphine 2 to 16 mg daily) for the first two days of the
      study (Day 1 and Day 2) then switch to and receive an equivalent dose of Suboxone®
      (buprenorphine 2 to 16 mg daily) for the last 3 days of the study (Day 3, Day 4 and Day 5).
      The Day 5 Visit will be the subject's last study visit. Upon completing the study, subjects
      will continue their pre-study prescribed dosage of Subutex®.
