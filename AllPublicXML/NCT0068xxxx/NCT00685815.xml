        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS).

          -  Presence of increased PLMS before receiving treatment.

          -  Patient sleep times are between 9pm and 9am.

          -  Patient's RLS symptoms would occur daily if you were not on medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  RLS secondary to other medical disorders as determined by history and
             physical/neurological examination.

          -  On a treatment (e.g., psychiatric medication) that might significantly alter RLS
             symptoms or study results and who cannot discontinue medication for the extended
             period of the study.

          -  History of multiple adverse drug reactions or specifically an allergy to IV iron.

          -  Currently experiencing a serious medical condition (chronic organ failure, active
             inflammation or infection, congestive heart failure, etc.) that might alter iron
             metabolism, would place them at risk, or interfere with study participation.

          -  An MRI is not possible because of medical reasons (Pacemaker; loose iron in the
             tissue) or concern about severe claustrophobia.

          -  Any condition that is likely to increase iron loss (chronic bleeding, excluding
             menstruation; medically necessary phlebotomy) or consumption (pregnancy).

          -  Serum ferritin &gt;300mg/L or percent iron saturation &gt;50%. This is to exclude subjects
             with probable hemochromatosis.

          -  Significant medical (e.g., inflammatory bowel syndrome; bowel dysmotility syndromes)
             or surgical (e.g., gastrojejunal bypass, colectomy) GI tract problems; and active
             chronic inflammatory processes (e.g., active hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE).
             This is to exclude conditions which will potentially alter iron metabolism.
