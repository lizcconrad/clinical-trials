      Patients (N=102) who meet diagnostic criteria for alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, or opiate
      abuse or dependence will meet with research staff on two days for quit preparation sessions
      (2 per day). These sessions include testing a breath sample for evidence of smoking twice
      each day (separated by at least 5 hours), counseling based on Public Health Service (PHS)
      guidelines for quitting smoking during the second session each day, and setting a quit date.
      After these sessions, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two 4-week conditions:
      (a) standard care or (b) standard care plus prize CM for smoking abstinence with the
      opportunity to win prizes for submitting samples that meet smoking abstinence criteria (e.g.,
      CO ≤ 6ppm; cotinine ≤ 30ng/mL). Nicotine withdrawal and related measures will be assessed
      throughout the intervention. Follow-up data will be collected through 6-months post-quit
      date.
