  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare renal allograft rejection rates during the first year among high-immunological
      risk recipients between patients who received either ATG or the anti-IL2R mAb daclizumab.

  <detailed_description>

      The objective of this randomized, multi-center trial is to directly compare the ATG,
      Thymoglobulin, with the anti-CD25 mAb, daclizumab, in a high-risk, HLA-sensitized renal
      transplant population, in order to elucidate whether there is any significant difference in
      the incidence of acute rejection after one year.

      Eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either ATG (1.25 mg/kg/d from day 0 to day
      7) or daclizumab (1 mg/kg at days 0, 14, 28, 42 and 56). Maintenance immunosuppression
      comprised tacrolimus, MMF and prednisone. The study's primary endpoint was the incidence of
      biopsy-proven acute rejection at one year.
