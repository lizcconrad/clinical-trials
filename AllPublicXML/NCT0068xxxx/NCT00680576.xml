      The purpose of this study is to find out more about how to provide effective further
      treatment for adolescents who have received six weeks of group therapy for substance-use
      problems and continue to use drugs. Treatments used in the study include a group therapy
      (MET/CBT), an individual therapy (CBT), and a family therapy (FFT). The study will look at
      whether abstinence or a very low level of use is a better guide for deciding whether further
      treatment is needed, how well different combinations of treatment work to reduce substance
      use, and whether it is possible to predict in advance which adolescents will respond best to
      which types of treatment. Study investigators expect that a treatment strategy using what is
      learned about these issues in the first half of the project to develop an &quot;adaptive&quot;
      treatment model will work better than a &quot;fixed&quot; treatment to reduce adolescent substance use.
