  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuronal activity in circuits between the basal ganglia (BG) and motor cortical areas is
      abnormally synchronized and rhythmic. The oscillatory activity prevails at 8-30 Hz in
      untreated Parkinson's Disease (PD) and its amplitude at both subthalamic and cortical levels
      inversely correlates with motor impairment. Moreover, these different levels in BG-cortical
      loops are coherent in this frequency band. The 8-30 Hz activity is suppressed by treatment
      following treatment with dopaminergic drugs and is partially suppressed prior to and during
      voluntary movements. An unanswered question is how do BG-cortical loops become so prominently
      engaged in this oscillatory activity? One possible explanation is that the resonance
      frequencies of the loops fall in the 8-30 Hz band in the untreated state, so that
      oscillations in this band are transmitted particularly well. So we hypothesize loop
      resonances in the 8-30 Hz frequency band at rest, which should be suppressed during movement
      and following dopaminergic therapy.

      Stimulate STN (at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 70 and 130 Hz) in chronically implanted
      patients at rest and during simple and complex motor tasks while recording the steady state
      evoked potential over the cortex using EEG over the 19 sites of the classical 10/20 system
      and a channel to record artifact over the stimulator. Experiments will be carried out both in
      the OFF medication and ON medication condition.
