        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score Based on 28-Joints Count Using C-reactive Protein [DAS28-3(CRP)]</title>
        <description>The DAS28-3 (CRP) score is a measure of the perticipant’s disease activity. It is based on the painful and tender joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints) and CRP. DAS28-3 (CRP) scores range from 0 - 10; higher scores indicated greater affectation due to disease activity.

        <description>HAQ-DI: participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.
Change = score at observation minus score at baseline.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI)</title>
          <description>HAQ-DI: participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.
Change = score at observation minus score at baseline.</description>

        <title>Area Under Curve (AUC) for Change From Baseline in American College of Rheumatology-N (ACR-N)</title>
        <description>ACR-N = calculated for each participant by taking lowest percentage improvement in (1) swollen joint count or (2) tender joint count or (3) the median of remaining 5 components of ACR response (participant's assessment of disease activity; participant's global assessment of pain; physician's assessment of disease activity; participant's assessment of physical function; an acute phase reactant value - CRP). Negative numbers indicate worsening. The AUC for ACR-N is measure of the area under the curve of the mean change from baseline in ACR-N. The trapezoidal rule was used to compute AUC.</description>

          <title>Area Under Curve (AUC) for Change From Baseline in American College of Rheumatology-N (ACR-N)</title>
          <description>ACR-N = calculated for each participant by taking lowest percentage improvement in (1) swollen joint count or (2) tender joint count or (3) the median of remaining 5 components of ACR response (participant's assessment of disease activity; participant's global assessment of pain; physician's assessment of disease activity; participant's assessment of physical function; an acute phase reactant value - CRP). Negative numbers indicate worsening. The AUC for ACR-N is measure of the area under the curve of the mean change from baseline in ACR-N. The trapezoidal rule was used to compute AUC.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (&quot;confined to bed&quot;). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state. Change = score at Week 12 minus score at baseline.</description>
