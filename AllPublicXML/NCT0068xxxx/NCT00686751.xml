  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to examine whether vitamin D can reduce the activation of the
      immune system during dialysis. When activated, the immune cells release certain substances,
      called cytokines, which can be measured from small blood samples. We want to study to what
      degree the immune system is activated during a regular dialysis treatment and whether the
      time point of vitamin D administration, either right before the start or right at the end of
      a dialysis treatment, has an impact on the activation of the immune system.

Phase 1: administration of study medication at the end of hemodialysis treatment.
Phase 2: no administration of study medication. Phase 3: administration of study medication at the beginning of hemodialysis.</description>
