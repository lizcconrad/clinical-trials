        <description>Overactive bladder symptoms were assessed using the symptom bother scale of the overactive bladder questionnaire. The symptom bother scale consists of 8 questions answered by the participant on a scale from 1-6. The total symptom bother score was calculated from the 8 answers and then transformed to range from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating worst severity. A negative change from Baseline in symptom bother score indicates improvements.
LS Means are from an ANCOVA with treatment group, gender, and geographic region as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and Final Visit in Symptom Bother Score</title>
          <description>Overactive bladder symptoms were assessed using the symptom bother scale of the overactive bladder questionnaire. The symptom bother scale consists of 8 questions answered by the participant on a scale from 1-6. The total symptom bother score was calculated from the 8 answers and then transformed to range from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating worst severity. A negative change from Baseline in symptom bother score indicates improvements.
LS Means are from an ANCOVA with treatment group, gender, and geographic region as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>
          <population>The full analysis set included all patients who took at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug and had a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline micturition measurement in the visit diary. LOCF was used for the Final Visit analysis. The number of participants included in the calculation for each time point is noted as &quot;N&quot;.</population>

        <description>Health-related quality of life was assessed by the HRQL subscales (coping, concern, sleep and social interaction) of the overactive bladder questionnaire (OABq). The HRQL total score was calculated by adding the 4 HRQL subscale scores, and transforming to a scale from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. A positive change from Baseline in HRQL score indicates improvements.

          <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: Specific Health Problem (WPAI:SHP) questionnaire was used to assess the degree and extent to which overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms interfered with work productivity in the last 7 days. Percent impairment while working was derived from the patient’s assessment of the degree to which OAB affected their productivity while working. A higher percentage indicates greater impairment and less productivity. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D is an international, standardized, nondisease-specific (i.e., generic) instrument for describing and valuing health status. Participants were asked to indicate which of the following statements best describes their health state:
I have no problems with self-care; I have some problems washing or dressing myself; I am unable to wash or dress myself. In the table below, each row title lists Baseline health status first followed by Final Visit health status and reports the number of patients in that category. Missing data indicates patients with no data available for that Visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Final Visit in European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Usual Activities Score</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized, nondisease-specific instrument for describing health status. Participants were asked which statement best describes their health state with regard to usual activities (work, study or leisure): I have no problems performing my usual activities; I have some problems performing my usual activities; I am unable to perform my usual activities. In the table below, each row title lists Baseline health status first followed by Final Visit health status and reports the number of patients in that category. Missing data indicates patients with no data available at that Visit.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>The full analysis set included all patients who took at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug and had a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline micturition measurement in the visit diary. LOCF was used for this analysis.</population>

        <description>The EQ-5D is an international, standardized, nondisease-specific (i.e., generic) instrument for describing and valuing health status. Participants were asked to indicate which of the following statements best describes their health state:
I have no pain or discomfort; I have moderate pain or discomfort; I have extreme pain or discomfort. In the table below, each row title lists Baseline health status first followed by Final Visit health status and reports the number of patients in that category.

          <title>Change From Baseline to Final Visit in European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)Anxiety/Depression Score</title>
          <description>The EQ-5D is an international, standardized, nondisease-specific (i.e., generic) instrument for describing and valuing health status. Participants were asked to indicate which of the following statements best describes their health state:
I am not anxious or depressed; I am moderately anxious or depressed; I am extremely anxious or depressed. In the table below, each row title lists Baseline health status first followed by Final Visit health status and reports the number of patients in that category. Missing data indicates patients with no data available for that Visit.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D is an international, standardized, generic instrument for describing and evaluating health status. Health status is assessed by patients evaluating their health on a vertical, visual analog scale from 0 to 100 where the endpoints are labeled 'Worst imaginable health state' (=0) and 'Best imaginable health state' (=100). On the EQ-5D VAS, a positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 and Final Visit in Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC)</title>
        <description>The PPBC scale is a global assessment tool that asks patients to rate their impression of their current bladder condition on a 6-point scale from 1: 'Does not cause me any problems at all'; 2: 'Causes me some very minor problems'; 3: 'Causes me some minor problems’; 4: 'Causes me (some) moderate problems'; 5: 'Causes me severe problems' and 6: 'Causes me many severe problems'. LS means are from an ANCOVA model with treatment group, gender, and geographical regions as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate. A negative change from Baseline score indicates improvement.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>The full analysis set included all patients who took at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug and had a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline micturition measurement in the visit diary. The number of participants included at each time point (N) only includes those with baseline and post-baseline values. LOCF was used for the Final Visit analysis.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 and Final Visit in Treatment Satisfaction on Visual Analog Scale (TS-VAS)</title>
        <description>The TS-VAS is a visual analog scale (VAS) that asks patients to rate their satisfaction with treatment by placing a vertical mark on a 10 cm line where the endpoints are labeled 'No, not at all' on the left (=0) to 'Yes, completely satisfied' on the right (=10). LS means are from an ANCOVA model with treatment group, gender, and geographical regions as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Improvement in Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) at Week 12 and Final Visit</title>
        <description>The PPBC scale is a global assessment tool that asks patients to rate their impression of their current bladder condition on a 6-point scale from 1: 'Does not cause me any problems at all'; 2: 'Causes me some very minor problems'; 3: 'Causes me some minor problems'; 4: 'Causes me (some) moderate problems'; 5: 'Causes me severe problems' and 6: 'Causes me many severe problems'. Improvement was defined as at least a 1 point improvement from Baseline to post-baseline and a major improvement was defined as at least a 2 point improvement from Baseline to post-baseline in PPBC score.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>The full analysis set included all patients who took at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug and had a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline micturition measurement in the visit diary. The number of participants at each time point (N) only includes those with baseline and post-baseline values. LOCF was used for the Final Visit analysis.</population>
