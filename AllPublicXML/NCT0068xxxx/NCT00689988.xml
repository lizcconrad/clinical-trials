  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with Down syndrome (DS) have language development particularities that have negative
      effects in the communication capacity. By this way, Augmentative and Alternative
      Communication (AAC) is indicated to this population. The aim of this study was to verify the
      AAC impact in the lexical gain of children with DS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Five children with DS, with the same cognitive level, participated in this study.
      Longitudinal follow-up of twelve months of speech-language therapy with AAC use was
      undertaken. A lexical evaluation was done at the beginning and the end of this follow-up.
      Correct responses in the lexical evaluation were increased, but not necessarily in the spoken
      modality. The comparisons showed significant results in use of substitutions processes, and
      to no-answers.
