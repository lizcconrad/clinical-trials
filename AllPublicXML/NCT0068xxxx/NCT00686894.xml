    <textblock>
      Subjects will be given 3 infusions of infliximab according to the label at week 0, 2, and 6.
      Subjects will be followed for a maximum of 18 weeks or until relapse. This study will assess
      the ability of the Power Doppler Ultrasonography (PDUS) to be a reliable marker of enthesitis
      response and relapse in subjects treated with infliximab.

    <measure>The Number of Enthesitis Between Week 4 and Week 12 Evaluated Using Power Doppler Ultrasonography (PDUS) and Proprietary Software.</measure>

    <description>Two measures were to be used for each enthesis evaluation. 1.) Vascularization: yes/no. 2.) Area of hyper-vascularization: mm^2 (continuous) using proprietary software. This study was terminated early due to slow recruitment. As a result, efficacy analyses were not performed.</description>
