      The purpose of this study is to determine the correlation between gastric residence time of
      the SmartPill Capsule and the time required for partial emptying of a standard radiolabeled
      meal as measured by gastric emptying scintigraphy for subjects 65 years of age and older.

    <textblock>
      Gastric emptying scintigraphy is considered the gold standard for evaluating gastric emptying
      and is widely available. Accurate characterization of gastric emptying may guide medical and
      surgical treatment choices. In addition, these techniques may allow for monitoring of
      therapeutic results for follow-up patient management.

      The SmartPill GI Monitoring System offers an alternative non-invasive method for
      characterizing disorders of the stomach. The system consists of an ingestible capsule that
      houses sensors for pH, temperature, and pressure, a receiver for receiving and storing
      signals from the capsule, and software for displaying data on a personal computer. The
      capsule samples at regular intervals and transmits the sensed pH, pressure, and temperature
      data to a portable receiver worn by the subject. After test completion, the recorded data is
      downloaded to a personal computer for subsequent evaluation. This trial is for subjects 65
      years of age and older.
