    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, active-comparator (metformin) controlled study in
      drug-naïve patients with T2DM who have an HbA1c ≥ 7.5%. The duration of the study is 55
      weeks, which will include a 1-week screening period (Visit 1 to Visit 2) and a 54 week
      double-blind, active treatment period. At Visit 2/Day 1 patients who meet all enrollment
      criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two active treatment groups: 1. JANUMET™
      (fixed-dose combination sitagliptin/metformin) or 2. metformin. The starting fixed-dose
      combination of sitagliptin/metformin will be 50/500 mg administered twice-daily and then
      up-titrated to a dose of 50/1000 mg b.i.d. over 4 weeks. The starting dose of metformin will
      be 500 mg twice-daily and then up-titrated to a dose of 1000 mg b.i.d. over 4 weeks. Patients
      who can not tolerate JANUMET™ at a dose of at least 50/500 mg b.i.d. or metformin at a dose
      of at least 500 mg b.i.d. 6 weeks after randomization and throughout the study will be
      discontinued. During the double-blind treatment period patients will remain on the study
      medication, but investigators are allowed to add other antihyperglycemic agents to improve
      glycemic control as necessary. The investigator can schedule additional visits to initiate
      additional antihyperglycemic agents or monitor glycemic control at any time during the study
      period. There will be no fixed visit schedule, but 7 clinical visits are recommended. It is
      also recommended to perform the first visit on active treatment 6 weeks after randomization
      and after this visit to schedule visits every 3 months. All clinical and lab data can be
      obtained using the &quot;Clalit health care information system&quot;.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All laboratory measurements are to be performed after an overnight fast ≥ 10 hours in
             duration. Patients with laboratory screening values/findings not meeting protocol
             inclusion criteria may, at the discretion of the investigator, have one repeat
             determination performed. If the repeat value satisfies the criterion they may continue
             in the screening process. Only the laboratory test not meeting inclusion should be
             repeated (not the entire panel).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Glucose Metabolism and Therapy Criteria

          -  Patient has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus or history of ketoacidosis. Patients
             Requiring Specific Treatments

          -  Patient has symptomatic hyperglycemia requiring immediate initiation of insulin
             therapy.

          -  Patient has a history of intolerance or hypersensitivity to metformin or sitagliptin
             or has any contraindication to use metformin.

        Concomitant Disease of Organs and Systems

          -  Patient has a medical history of active liver disease (excluding hepatic steatosis).

          -  Patient has severe active peripheral vascular disease (e.g., manifested by
             claudication with minimal activity, a non-healing ischemic ulcer, or disease which is
             likely to require intervention such as with bypass or angioplasty).

          -  Patient has unstable or acute congestive heart failure.

          -  Patient has a history of malignancy without documentation of remission/cure. Other
             Criteria

          -  Patient is pregnant, has a positive urine pregnancy test at Visit 1, is expecting to
             conceive within the projected duration of the study, or is breast feeding.

        Exclusion Criteria Based on Lab Abnormalities

          -  Patient has increased serum-creatinine and/or decreased estimated creatinine
             clearance.

          -  If screening labs are repeated, the last laboratory draw/result should be used for
             inclusion.§ Either elevated Creatinine or decreased estimated creatinine clearance
             lead to exclusion of the patient.

          -  Patients whose serum creatinine does not meet the exclusion criteria, but whose
             estimated creatinine clearance is &lt;60 mL/min but ≥50 mL/min, may have a measured
             creatinine clearance (i.e., based upon a 24-hour urine collection). These patients may
             be eligible if their measured creatinine clearance is ≥60 mL/min.

        At Visit 2

          -  Patient has a site fingerstick glucose &lt;130 mg/dL (7.2 mmol/L) or &gt;320 mg/dL (17.8
             mmol/L).

        Note: If the patient meets this exclusion criterion AND the investigator believes that the
        value does not reflect the patient's recent glycemic control based upon recent SBGM values
        and/or the Visit 1 FPG value, the patient should not be excluded at this time. The current
        visit should be changed to an &quot;Unscheduled visit&quot; and the patient should be rescheduled for
        Visit 2. If, at the rescheduled Visit 2, the patient meets this exclusion criterion, the
        patient MUST be excluded.

          -  Patient has a positive urine pregnancy test.

          -  Patient developed a new medical condition, suffered a change in status of an
             established medical condition, developed a laboratory abnormality, or required a new
             treatment or medication between Visit 1 and Visit 2 which meets any previously
             described study exclusion criterion.
