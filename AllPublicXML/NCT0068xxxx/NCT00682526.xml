  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim: To determine the impact of wireless transmission of prehospital ECGs to a hand-held
      computer on time to treatment and myocardial salvage in acute MI patients.

      Background: The TIME-1 investigators documented a 27% (109 to 80 minutes) reduction of time
      from EMT arrival at the scene to successful primary PCI implementing pre-hospital ECG
      transmission to the ED. ECG transmission directly to a physician's cellular phone/PDA through
      a wireless modem has only recently become an option. The recently completed TIME-NorthEast
      (NE) study tested the Welch Allyn version of this system and the results show a reduction in
      time to reperfusion for acute MI patients by 66 minutes (116 to 50).

      Methods: This study will involve approximately 20 sites around the country. The study will be
      divided into two phases: a consecutive control data collection phase (Phase I) and an
      intervention with concurrent control phase (Phase II). Phase II will begin after installation
      of Welch Allyn ECG transmission equipment. The primary end-point will be time to reperfusion
      and secondary end-points will include myocardial salvage, aborted infarction and hospital
      mortality. ECG measurements will be made at a central ECG core lab by a blinded investigator.

      Data Analysis: Patient characteristics for the three periods were compared with the
      chi-square statistic for categorical variables and one-way analysis of variance for age. The
      Wilcoxon rank-sum statistic was used to compare time-to-reperfusion in the pre-study and
      study periods as well as in the Group 1 post-study period. Comparisons were performed
      separately for EMS and self-transport groups.

    <description>The TIME-MC study was conducted from June 2003 to June 2008 at NEMC (Figure 1) and from May 2005 to September 2008 at the six larger medical centers (Figure 2). Two groups were studied. Group 1 included patients at NEMC and Group 2 included patients at the other six medical sites. The study was divided into three periods:
Pre-study period (Group 1 and Group 2). No PH-ECG transmission system was available.</description>

    <description>Study period (Group 1 and Group 2). PH-ECG transmission to a cardiologist's hand-held device was attempted through pre-assigned EMS ambulances equipped with a wireless ECG transmission device in addition to a STEMI code system. In Group 1, this referred to the pilot study at NEMC from June 2003 to May 2005.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients with a diagnosis of acute STEMI defined as 1 mm ST segment elevation in two
        spatially contiguous leads were included. There were two major subgroups: emergency medical
        services (EMS) and self-transport patients. Self-transport patients, who did not have
        PH-ECG transmission, served as a comparison group.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Less than age 18

          -  No intent to undergo reperfusion therapy (PCI or thrombolytics)
