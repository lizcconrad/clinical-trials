  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) serves as a protective gene. It has been shown that one factor
      modulating HO-1 activity is a genetic variation in the HO-1 gene (functional GT length
      polymorphism in the promotor region). Heme arginate is a strong inducer of HO-1 as shown in
      several animal experimental studies. The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the HO-1
      stimulation of heme arginate in healthy humans.
