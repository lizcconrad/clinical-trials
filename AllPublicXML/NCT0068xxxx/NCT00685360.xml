    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OPC-67683 in the treatment of
      multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) for 56 days. In addition to an optimized background
      regimen (OBR).patients will receive will be randomized to:

        -  100 mg OPC-67683 BID

        -  200 mg OPC-67683 BID

        -  placebo BID After 56 days subjects will complete their OBR.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi center, randomized, double-blinded, stratified, placebo-controlled clinical
      trial in three parallel groups. Patients will be randomized to one of the following three
      treatment groups:

        -  Optimized Background Regimen (OBR) plus 100 mg OPC-67683 twice daily

        -  OBR plus 200 mg OPC-67683 twice daily

        -  OBR plus placebo twice daily

      The three treatment groups will comprise approximately 140 patients each (male or female).
      The trial will consist of the following periods:

        -  Pre-treatment Period (Visits 1 to 3 [Day -9 to Day -1])

        -  Treatment Period (Visits 4 to 59 [Days 1 to 56])

        -  Post-treatment Period (Visits 60 to 64 [Days 57 to 84]) Enrolled patients (those
           accepted into the screening period of the trial who signed an informed consent form)
           will be stratified at randomization by extent of pulmonary TB; an equal number of
           patients with and without cavities visible in the lung fields on baseline chest
           radiograph will be allocated to each treatment group. A total of 430 male or female
           patients aged 18 to 64 years, inclusive, with pulmonary, sputum culture-positive MDR TB
           (TB caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains resistant to at least isoniazid and
           rifampicin) or with sputum smears positive for acid fast bacilli (AFB) and a positive
           rapid test for rifampicin resistance on direct sputum within 60 days prior to the
           expected date of enrollment. Patients with positive AFB smears and a positive rapid
           rifampicin resistance test will be enrolled as presumptively culture positive and
           withdrawn as ineligible if they are confirmed to not have sputum culture positive MDR
           TB.
