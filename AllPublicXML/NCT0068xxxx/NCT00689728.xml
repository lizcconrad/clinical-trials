  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore whether LY2127399 is effective in relieving signs and
      symptoms of RA in patients with a history of inadequate response or intolerance to at least 1
      TNFα inhibitor therapy. Examples of these TNFα inhibitor therapies that are currently on the
      market include Enbrel® (etanercept), Remicade® (infliximab), and Humira® (adalimumab).
