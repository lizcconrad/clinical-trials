      Background:

        -  Relapse to drug abuse is thought to result, in many cases, from exposure to cues that
           trigger drug-related memories or emotional associations for example, the association
           between the sight of a crack pipe and a set of responses such as rapid heartbeat and
           desire for cocaine. This type of memory is reconsolidated (actively re-stored) each time
           it is reactivated; however, the reconsolidation process can be disrupted by the drug
           propranolol, which weakens the link between that memory and an emotional response.

        -  Propranolol is traditionally used to treat high blood pressure and other heart-related
           conditions. Researchers are interested in studying whether propranolol disrupts
           reconsolidation of drug-cued memories in individuals who are addicted to cocaine.

      Objectives:

      - To examine whether propranolol can interfere with reconsolidation of cocaine-related
      memories and reduce cravings and drug use in substance abusers.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 55 years of age who are current cocaine users enrolled in a
      methadone treatment program.

      Design:

        -  The study will involve four long sessions (visits 1, 4, 6, and 14) and 10 short
           sessions. The short visits will be for monitoring of participants use of drugs and
           alcohol; the longer visits will involve more tests and lab sessions. Participants will
           be randomized to either the propranolol or placebo group.

        -  The long sessions will involve the following procedures:

        -  An interview session to develop a personalized drug script/cue set.

        -  A two-hour intervention session with baseline measures, drug administration (propranolol
           or placebo), and two script-guided imagery sets. This is the only administration of
           propranolol during the study.

        -  Two follow-up test sessions, 1 and 5 weeks after the intervention session.

        -  Participants will make brief visits to our outpatient clinic for twice-weekly monitoring
           of ongoing drug use via urine screens and self-report, starting 1 week before the
           intervention session and ending 5 weeks later.

      Background

      Relapse to drug abuse or addiction is thought to result, in many cases, from exposure to cues
      that elicit drug-related memories. The term memories is used here not in its everyday sense,
      but in a sense that corresponds more closely to emotional associations for example, the
      association between the sight of a crack pipe and a set of responses such as rapid heartbeat
      and desire for cocaine. Studies in rodents and humans show that this type of memory is
      reconsolidated (actively re-stored) each time it is reactivated, and that the reconsolidation
      process can be disrupted by propranolol. Such disruption does not erase the autobiographical
      memory of an event, but instead weakens the link between that memory and an emotional
      response. Human studies are needed to determine whether propranolol disrupts reconsolidation
      of drug-cued memories in addicted individuals; this would present a novel and exciting
      therapeutic possibility for preventing craving and relapse.

      Objective

      To examine whether administration of propranolol interferes with reconsolidation of
      cocaine-related memories and reduces cravings and drug use in substance abusers.

      Study population

      Up to 200 (60 evaluable) individuals maintained on methadone and using cocaine will be
      recruited from local treatment programs. The target enrollment will include 40% women and 60%
      minorities.

      Experimental design and methods

      Participants will be randomized to one of two groups: propranolol (40 mg, oral,
      immediate-release formulation) or placebo. The study will include four laboratory sessions:
      (1) An information-gathering session that includes an interview to obtain information for
      development of a personalized drug script/cue set. (2) A two-hour intervention session in
      which there will be baseline measures, drug administration (propranolol or placebo, double
      blind), and, starting 60 min after drug administration, two script-guided imagery sets.
      Cue-responsivity data will be collected, but the main purpose of the session is
      interventional. This will be the only administration of propranolol during the study. (3, 4)
      Two follow-up test sessions, 1 and 5 weeks after the intervention session; participants
      responses to re-exposure to the personalized drug script/cue set will be measured. In
      addition to attending the four laboratory sessions, participants will make brief visits to
      our outpatient clinic for twice-weekly monitoring of ongoing drug use via urine screens and
      self-report, starting 1 week before the intervention session and ending 5 weeks later.

      Outcome measures

      Outcome measures will include subjective ratings of drug craving, autonomic responses (heart
      rate, blood pressure, galvanic skin response), and cocaine and heroin use (urine drug screens
      and self-reported drug use).

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. - Age between 18 and 55 years

               2. - Evidence of current cocaine use (self-report)

               3. - Minimum lifetime cocaine use of one year (self-report)

               4. - Minimum use of cocaine of once in the past 30 days (self-report)

               5. - Enrolled in methadone maintenance

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. - Allergy or hypersensitivity to propranolol or other beta blockers.

          2. - History of: schizophrenia (or of any other DSM-IV psychotic disorder), anxiety
             disorders (e.g., panic disorder), or bipolar disorder.

          3. - Current major depressive disorder.

          4. - Current physical dependence on, or current abuse of, alcohol, benzodiazepines, or
             other sedative-hypnotic drugs.

          5. - Cognitive impairment severe enough to preclude informed consent or valid responses
             on questionnaires.

          6. - Pregnant; breast feeding.

          7. - Impaired hepatic function with AST or ALT greater than 5x the upper limit of normal.

          8. - Medical conditions that would contraindicate administration of propranolol (e.g.,
             uncompensated congestive heart failure; pulmonary edema; asthma; COPD; history of
             severe allergic reactions (seasonal, environmental, food, medications, etc.); Raynaud
             s disease; second- or third-degree atrioventricular block; arrhythmias other than
             sinus arrhythmia; thyroid dysfunction; diabetes mellitus; renal impairment.

             Per the American Thoracic Society (ATS), COPD Clinical assessment is based on medical
             history and physical examination. Although a complete examination is indicated for all
             patients, these two components are specifically important for patients with suspected
             COPD. (ATS &amp; ERS, 2004) Accordingly, if medical history and physical exam suggest
             possible COPD the participant will be forwarded for spirometry/pulmonary function
             tests to aid in the diagnosis.

          9. - Bradycardia (heart rate &lt; 60 bpm) on three consecutive readings.

         10. - Systolic blood pressure &lt; 100 mm Hg; diastolic blood pressure &lt; 60 mm Hg; on three
             consecutive readings.

         11. - Medications that could interact with propranolol either pharmacodynamically or
             pharmacokinetically to produce adverse effects. Such medication would include CNS
             depressants (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, other sedatives), antihypertensive
             medications (including nitrates), antiarrhythmic medications, antiseizure medications
             (dilantin), acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil, galantamine),
             aminoquinolines (antimalarial), antipsychotic medications, beta agonists, insulin,
             MAOIs, NSAIDs, rifamycin derivatives, rizatriptan, SSRIs, sulfonylureas, theophylline,
             pseudophedrine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, epinephrine, noriepinephrine, amphetamines,
             and some herbal supplements.

         12. - Current use of beta blockers for any medical condition.
