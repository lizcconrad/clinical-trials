    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to assess which method of lanreotide Autogel administration
      patients with neuroendocrine tumours prefer - self/partner administrations or healthcare
      provided administrations. The study will also assess if self/partner administration can be
      performed without loss of efficacy and with a preserved safety profile. The impact of
      self/partner administration on resource utilisation and costs will be studied. In addition,
      we will also assess the healthcare provider's experience of the two administration practices.

          -  Has abnormal baseline findings, any other medical condition(s) or laboratory findings
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might jeopardise the patient's safety or
