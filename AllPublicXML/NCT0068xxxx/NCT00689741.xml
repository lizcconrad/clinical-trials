  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase IIB MedImmune-sponsored study was to evaluate the efficacy of the
      HPV-16/18 VLP vaccine in the prevention of infection with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 in adolescent
      and young adult women. A vaccine that prevents, or even reduces, the incidence of the common
      types of high-risk HPVs, particularly HPV-16 and HPV-18, could result in significant
      reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer and cancer-related mortality, as well as a
      reduction in the incidence of surgical procedures following abnormal Pap smears.

             have reached 26th birthday)

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject prior to enrolment (for subjects
             below the legal age of consent, written informed consent must also be obtained from a
             parent or legal guardian of the subject)

             method of birth control for 30 days prior to vaccination, have a negative urine
             pregnancy test and must agree to continue such precautions for two months after
             completion of the vaccination series

          -  For subjects not enrolled in the HPV epidemiology study (999910/106) and for subjects
             completing the study (999910/106) &gt;90 days prior to enrolment in the present study:
             agreement to complete both entrance and exit study questionnaires concerning general
             personal information, and sexual, contraceptive, reproductive and other gynaecological
             medical history

             study: agreement to complete the exit questionnaire only.

          -  Normal cervical cytology (Pap smear) at screening, using the Cytyc ThinPrep® Pap Test.
