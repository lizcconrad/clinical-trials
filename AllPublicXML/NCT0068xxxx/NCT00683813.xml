    <textblock>
      Cardiac rehabilitation programs (CRP) are a proven treatment for those with ischemic heart
      disease (IHD). These programs have been demonstrated to improve adherence to regular physical
      activity, a healthy diet and smoking cessation, as well as modify risk factors for IHD such
      as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity and type 2 diabetes. In addition, CRP are cost
      effective and can result in a 25% reduction in reoccurrence of mortality. Despite the known
      benefits of CRP, as little as 10% to 25% of eligible patients attend these programs. One of
      the main barriers to attendance is proximity to a CRP, as the majority of these programs are
      limited to hospitals in large urban areas. However, cardiovascular diseases do not
      discriminate by geography, resulting in a geographic inequity of care for patients living in
      rural, remote and smaller urban/sub-urban centres. Currently there are no CRP specifically
      designed for patients in rural and remote areas. The use of the Internet may present itself
      as a viable alternative. We have recently completed a pilot study of a virtual CRP (vCRP)
      that demonstrated significant improvements in exercise capacity and risk factors. This
      investigation will study the vCRP in a group of IHD patients who do not have access to
      hospital-based CRP.

      Hypotheses A. Participation in a 4 month Internet-based cardiac rehabilitation program will
      result in significant improvements in exercise capacity compared to usual care, in patients
      with diagnosed IHD.

      B. Participation in a 4 month Internet-based cardiac rehabilitation program will result in
      significant improvements in exercise capacity after one year compared to usual care, in
      patients with diagnosed IHD.

      Study Population Men and women over 18 years will be identified from consecutive in-patients
      of the British Columbia Provincial Heart Centre at St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver who
      reside in either the Northern Interior or Coast Garibaldi health areas. Patients will be
      eligible if they have IHD, Internet access, no previous experience with cardiac
      rehabilitation and no physical limitations to exercise. A total of 74 patients (37 per group)
      will be recruited and randomized to either usual care, or a 4 month 'virtual' cardiac
      rehabilitation program delivered via the Internet.

      Usual Care Group Patients randomized to usual care will be provided with simple guidelines
      for safe exercising and healthy eating habits, and return to the care of their primary care
      physician. Patients will return at 4 and 16 months later for outcome assessment. There will
      be no contact between the study personnel and usual care patients for the duration of the
      study, nor will there be any attempt to control the level of patient care.

      Intervention The vCRP has been developed to mimic hospital-based CRP and includes online
      intake forms, one-on-one chat sessions with vCRP nurse, dietitian and exercise specialist,
      data collection (exercise heart rate, blood pressure, glucose- if diabetic), peer-support
      group chat sessions, ask-an-expert chat sessions, education, progress reports and online
      resources. Upon randomization to the intervention, patients will receive access to the
      website, a heart rate monitor and a blood pressure monitor and trained in their use. The
      heart rate monitors allow for exercise heart rate data to be stored and downloaded to their
      home computer and then uploaded to the vCRP webserver. The exercise data will be reviewed
      weekly. A letter to the patient's primary care physician will be sent to outline the vCRP
      intervention, the treatment algorithms to be used and indicate under what circumstances the
      vCRP nurse and/or patient may contact them with regards to their management. Patients will
      receive one-on-one counselling by the nurse, dietitian and exercise specialist via chat
      sessions at 3 to 4 week intervals. After the 4 month intervention, patients will be
      discharged into the care of their primary care physician.

      Outcomes Participants will be assessed at baseline, 4 and 16 months for risk factors and
      lifestyle behaviours. The primary outcomes will be the change in exercise capacity as between
      the two groups from baseline to 4 months, and from baseline to 16 months. Exercise capacity
      will be assessed as total time on a symptom-limited exercise stress test.
