  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this open-label, flexible dose study is to assess the safety and
      efficacy of pramipexole over a 24-week period in children and adolescents (age 6-17 years
      inclusive) diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
      Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria and who have completed either Study 248.641
      (NCT 00681863) or 248.644 (NCT 00558467).
