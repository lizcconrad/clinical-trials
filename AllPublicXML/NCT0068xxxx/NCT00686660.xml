      This is a multi-center prospective follow-up study.

        -  to choose the stable COPD patients in community

        -  to compare different modes of exercise (cycling and walking)

        -  to compare the effect of different exercises on the quality of life,exercise
           endurance,dyspnea and depression

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center prospective follow-up study.More than 20 hospitals participate the
      research. More than 300 stable COPD patients will be recruited.It is a two-year study. There
      are four groups, cycling and walking group(C-WG),cycling and non-walking
      group(C-nonWG),walking and walking group(W-WG),walking and non-walking group(W-nonWG).

        1. All patients from four groups will finish baseline investigation and blood sample,
           including informed consent,questionaires(SGRQ,CRDQ,MRCQ,Depression
           Scale,etc.),spirometry,6MWT,MIP,MEP,BMI,CRP,TNF,IL-8, etc.Patients in C-WG and C-nonWG
           will finish cardiopulmonary test.

        2. Patients receive 8 weeks training program, includes upper and lower extremities
           endurance exercises and respiratory muscle endurance exercises. Patients in both CGs
           cycling at cycle ergometry. Patients in W-WG and W-nonWG walking instead. All patients
           receive training program twice per year, for two years. Patients were supervised by
           physicians or nurses at hospital while they are training.

        3. In the non-training period, patients in W-WG and C-WG will continue to walk at
           community, supervised by nurses who call them every month. The other two groups(C-nonWG
           and W-nonWG) do not receive special requirement on exercise.

        4. Telephone call interview will give to patients every month to find whether they have
           acute exacerbation. Patients are asked to record their activities during daytime in the
           diary cards.

        5. All patients will finish investigation and blood sample after one year and two
           year,including questionaires,spirometry,6MWT,MIP,MEP,BMI,CRP,TNF,IL-8, etc.Patients in
           CG will finish cardiopulmonary test.
