  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary studies with a variety of vaccines suggest target accessibility (potential
      immunogenicity) in a variety of solid tumors to immune directed approaches. However, four
      primary factors limit the generation of effective immune mediated anticancer activity in
      therapeutic application:

        1. identifying and/or targeting cancer associated immunogen(s) in an individual patient

        2. insufficient or inhibited level of antigen presenting cell priming and/or presentation

        3. suboptimal T cell activation and proliferation

        4. cancer-induced inhibition of the anticancer immune response in both afferent and
           efferent limbs.

      In an effort to overcome these limitations, we have designed a novel autologous vaccine to
      address inability to fully identify cancer associated antigens, antigen recognition by the
      immune system (i.e. antigen to immunogen), effector potency, and cancer-induced resistance.
      We have completed clinical investigations using two different gene vaccine approaches to
      induce enhancement of tumor antigen recognition which have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy.
      Specifically, both the use of a GMCSF gene transduced vaccine and a TGFβ2 antisense gene
      vaccine, in separate trials, have demonstrated similar beneficial effects without any
      evidence of significant toxicity in advanced cancer patients. The GMCSF transgene directly
      stimulates increased expression of tumor antigen(s) and enhances dendritic cell migration to
      the vaccination site. TGFβ2 blockade following intracellular TGFβ2 antisense gene expression
      reduces production of immune inhibiting activity at the vaccine site. These agents have never
      been used in combination but the rationale of integrating enhancement of an anticancer immune
      response concurrently with a reduction in cancer-induced immune suppression is conceptually
      sound. We will harvest autologous cancer cells from patients with advanced refractory cancer.
      We have constructed a TGFβ2 antisense / GMCSF expression vector plasmid and have successfully
      demonstrated preclinical activity of the vector function following transfection by
      electroporation and irradiation of autologous cancer tissue.
