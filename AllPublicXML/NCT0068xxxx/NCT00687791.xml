    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the OculusGen™
      (ologen) Biodegradable Collagen Matrix Implant in hacotrabeculectomy surgery. The primary
      endpoint is to prove the effectiveness via the reduction of IOP, and the secondary endpoint
      is to prove the safety via the incidence of complications and adverse events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ologen™ Collagen Matrix is indicated for creating a mature bleb structure to facilitate
      aqueous outflow for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma,
      following traditional filtering surgery (trabeculectomy)

      Within 60 days from the time of implantation, ologen™ Collagen Matrix is totally degraded.
      Postoperatively, mild inflammation may be seen and anti- inflammatory agents are prescribed

    <description>20 enrolled patients will be chosen according to the enrollment acceptance criteria. The evidence for the determination of enrolled patients shall be recorded, reviewed and approved. 2&gt; Phacotrabeculectomy is performed.3&gt; After completing phacotrabeculectomy, implant/place ologen™ Collagen Matrix on top of the scleral flap under the conjunctiva. For every inspection and observation, the detailed description and/or inspection data shall be recorded. If any unwanted adverse event is observed during inspection and observation, it shall be recorded and be reported to the investigation conductor.</description>
