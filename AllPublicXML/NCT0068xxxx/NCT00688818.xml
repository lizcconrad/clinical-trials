    <textblock>
      This multi-centred study will be conducted at three centres. The design will be a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group one. This investigation will evaluate the efficacy of
      add-on Quetiapine XR (extended release) treatment for patients who meet diagnostic criteria
      for depressive disorders and one or more comorbid anxiety disorder.

      The primary objective is to examine the beneficial effect of quetiapine augmentation of
      first-line antidepressants in refractory depression with co-morbid anxiety, compared to
      placebo. It is hypothesized that significant improvement on depression and anxiety symptoms
      will be seen as evidenced by reduction in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and
      Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) scores after the 12 week treatment period for those who
      received Quetiapine XR augmentation compared to those who received placebo.2.2

      Secondary objectives: 1) To establish the tolerability and safety of Quetiapine XR versus
      Placebo in patients with co-morbid depressive and anxiety disorders;2) To assess and compare
      the efficacy of Quetiapine XR versus Placebo improving quality of life in patients with
      co-morbid depressive and anxiety disorders.; 3) To assess and compare the efficacy of
      Quetiapine XR versus Placebo on clinical measures symptoms associated to co-morbid depressive
      and anxiety disorders.
