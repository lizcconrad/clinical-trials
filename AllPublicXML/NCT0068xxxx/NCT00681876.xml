  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II study will evaluate the efficacy of the combination of two monoclonal
      antibodies (Avastin + Erbitux) with irinotecan, in patients with colorectal cancer progressed
      after 1st line treatment with FOLFIRI Avastin or XELIRI Avastin.

    <textblock>
      Treating patients with primary resistance to the most active multi-agent combination remains
      a challenging clinical problem. The reported data demonstrated that addition of ERBITUX may
      reverse IRINOTECAN resistance. Further data support the feasibility of the combination of two
      monoclonal antibodies (AVASTIN+ERBITUX) with IRINOTECAN with better responses compared to
      historical controls (ERBITUX±IRINOTECAN). As such, a phase II study was designed to evaluate
      the efficacy of the combination of AVASTIN plus ERBITUX plus IRINOTECAN as second line
      treatment in patients progressing while on treatment with FOLFIRI AVASTIN or XELIRI AVASTIN
