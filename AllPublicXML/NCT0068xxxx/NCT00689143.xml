  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This exploratory study is the first study in a clinical program where the overall objective
      is to develop a novel pharmaceutical therapy comprising local administration of GM-CSF for
      the treatment of periodontitis. The project hypothesis is based on GM-CSF's antibacterial and
      putative bone regeneration properties. Periodontitis is the major cause of tooth loss in
      people over 35 years of age. An effective pharmacological treatment is today lacking and the
      actual therapy would represent a new treatment option for the large patient group suffering
      from the disease.

      It is suggested that local administration of GM-CSF in the gingival tissue next to the
      periodontal destruction may reduce the infectious condition by an antibacterial effect via
      stimulation of neutrophil phagocytosis of bacteria, enhanced functional activities of
      monocytes and granulocytes, as well as stimulation of bone tissue recalcification.
