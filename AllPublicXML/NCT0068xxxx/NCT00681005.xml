      Backgrounds &amp; Aims: Proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) test has been proposed as a valuable tool in
      the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in Western populations. We assumed
      that a higher prevalence of poor metabolizers in Chinese population might affect the
      diagnostic accuracy of a PPI test.

      Methods: In this open-label, randomized trial, patients with symptoms suggestive of GERD were
      randomly assigned to receive a 2-week test with daily rabeprazole 40-mg or daily pantoprazole
      80-mg after diagnostic endoscopy. Therapeutic response was assessed with a five-grade daily
      record. Genotypes of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 polymorphism were determined.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Consecutive patients with symptoms suggesting GERD will be enrolled from
             gastroenterology outpatient clinics in our academic institute. The typical GERD
             symptom was defined as heartburn and/or regurgitation at least 3 episodes per week in
             recent 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Those who were under maintenance PPI treatment, have a medical contraindication to PPI
             therapy, report a history of peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal surgery,
             malignancy proven by endoscopy, or unwilling or unable to provide informed consent.
