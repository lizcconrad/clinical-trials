      To determine whether the changes in BMI produced in subjects with Bipolar Disorder (BD) and
      Schizoaffective Disorder (SA) by 12 months of treatment with clozapine, can be diminished
      after an intense and highly structured intervention focused on diet and exercise, compared
      with the usual brief counseling regarding weight gain on this drug.
