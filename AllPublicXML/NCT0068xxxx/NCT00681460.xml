  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a condition that manifests as high blood sugar levels
      (hyperglycemia) during pregnancy in previously healthy women. It develops as a result of
      increased maternal body's resistance to insulin - a major hormone that allows for utilisation
      of glucose (sugar taken in with food) within cells. It was found out that GDM occurs more
      frequently in overweight women but also in women with a history of certain conditions such as
      polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Usually, GDM disappears after pregnancy is completed but it
      is associated with some serious hazards for women and her unborn child, if untreated
      properly. Diet is a first-choice treatment but sometimes insulin therapy must be initiated if
      keeping a diet alone is not enough to maintain blood sugar within recommended values. Insulin
      therapy is effective but it requires several injections during each day and insulin is a
      strong acting hypoglycemic agent that may induce rapid falls in blood sugar, also dangerous
      for mother and unborn child.

      In the investigators study, the investigators would like to investigate if metformin that is
      a commonly used hypoglycemic drug can be effectively used for GDM treatment. Metformin has
      been used successfully for a long time to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus and PCOS and,
      according to current data, it is not dangerous neither for mother nor for baby when used
      during gestation.
