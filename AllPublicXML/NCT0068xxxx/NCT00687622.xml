    <textblock>
      MEK111054 is a first-time-in-human, open-label study to determine recommended dose and
      regimen for the orally administered GSK1120212. The study consists of three parts. Part 1
      will identify the maximum tolerated dose. Part 2 will explore the safety, tolerability, and
      effectiveness of GSK1120212. Part 3 will determine a range of effective doses.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Part 1

          -  Written informed consent provided.

          -  18 years old or older.

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of solid tumor malignancy or
             lymphoma that is not responsive to standard therapies or for which there is no
             approved or curative therapy.

          -  Performance Status score of 0 or 1 according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
             (ECOG) scale.

          -  Able to swallow and retain oral medication.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed. This
             criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until
             four weeks after the last dose of study medication. However, the Sponsor advises that
             contraception be used for a total of 16 weeks following the last dose (based on the
             lifecycle of sperm).

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
                  spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/mL and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/mL (&lt;140
                  pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose
                  menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception
                  methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.
                  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal
                  status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least two to four
                  weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this
                  interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their
                  post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use
                  of a contraceptive method.

               -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed
                  in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product
                  label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the
                  risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception
                  until four weeks after the last dose of study medication.

               -  Note: Oral contraceptives are not reliable due to potential drug-drug
                  interaction.

          -  CPP&lt;/= 4.0 mmol2/L2 (55 mg2/dL2)

             &lt;/= 1.3 X ULN; Total bilirubin &lt;/=1.5 mg/dL; AST and ALT &lt;/= 2.5 X ULN (can be higher
             in the presence of liver metastasis.); Creatinine &lt;/= ULN OR Calculated creatinine
             clearance &gt;/= 50 mL/min OR 24-hour urine creatinine clearance &gt;/= 50 mL/min; Ejection

          -  Subjects with melanoma, CRC, or non-small cell lung cancer must provide either the
             results of a BRAF or KRAS mutation assay, archived tumor tissue, or a fresh biopsy.

          -  Subjects must be incurable or resistant to standard therapy.

        Part 3 - As per Part 1 and:

          -  For the biopsy portion of the study, subjects must have accessible tumor for biopsy,
             and willingness to provide pre- and post dose biopsies.

        Exclusion Criteria:
