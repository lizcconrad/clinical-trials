    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD2066 using
      multiple escalating dose panels. There will be separate panels for young healthy volunteers
      and elderly healthy volunteers. Each panel will contain 10 volunteers who will randomly
      receive AZD2066 or placebo. One panel will be run at a time with a fixed dose given. After
      the completion of each panel, a Safety Review Committee will decide if the study can proceed
      to the next dose panel.
