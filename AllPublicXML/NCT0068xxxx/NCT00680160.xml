    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the absorption, systemic pharmacokinetics and
      accumulation in the nail of AN2690 during a 28 day period of daily application of a 7.5%
      solution of AN2690 to all 10 toenails of up to 25 otherwise healthy adult patients with
      onychomycosis.

      For this study, the case definition of onychomycosis included moderate to severe distal
      subungual onychomycosis including subjects with evidence of subungual dermatophytoma or
      yellow spikes, lateral and proximal onychomycosis and severely dystrophic nail plates.
      Subjects with only superficial white onychomycosis were excluded. Confirmation of the
      clinical diagnosis of onychomycosis of at least one great toenail included a positive KOH wet
      mount.
