    <textblock>
      CRFB002D2301: The core study was designed to confirm the efficacy and safety of ranibizumab
      (0.5 mg) as adjunctive therapy when added to laser photocoagulation and/or mono-therapy in
      patients with visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema.

      CRFB002D2301E1: A 24 month open-label extension study for participants who completed the 12
      month core study evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of ranibizumab (0.5 mg) as
      symptomatic treatment for visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema.

    <description>Visual acuity (VA) was assessed on both eyes during every study visit using best correction determined from protocol refraction.

    <description>Participants with ocular (occurring in the eye) serious adverse events (SAEs) and non-serious AEs in the study eye. The study eye is the eye that received the treatment. AEs are the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition occurring after starting the study drug even if the event is not considered to be related to study drug. A serious adverse event is defined as an event that is fatal or life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization or is medically significant.
Additional information about adverse events can be found in the Adverse Event section.</description>

    <measure>Core Study: Mean Change From Baseline in Patient-reported Visual Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI-VFQ-25) was used to measure a patient's subjective assessment of vision-related quality of life. The 12 subscales in the VFQ-25 are general health, general vision, ocular pain, near activities, distance activities, social function, mental health, role difficulties, dependency, driving, color vision, and peripheral vision. The scores on the subscales were added together for a total score, which ranged from 0 to 100. A higher score indicated improvement in quality of life due to vision function.</description>

    <description>Ranibizumab 0.5 mg was administered monthly by intravitreal injection in the study eye for 3 months. After the third injection, treatment was suspended if either one of the following criteria was met:
Improvement in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) could not be attributed to treatment at the last 2 visits, in the opinion of the investigator, or BCVA &gt; 84 letters (approximate Snellen equivalent of 20/20) was observed at the last 2 last visits.
Patients also received sham laser treatment on Day 1 and subsequently at intervals of at least 3 months, if deemed necessary by the evaluating physician.
Active/sham laser treatment was always administered before (sham) intravitreal injections. The minimum interval between the 2 treatments was 30 minutes.
In the extension study at the investigator's discretion, patients received open-label ranibizumab 0.5 mg intravitreal injections once a month until stable vision was reached (a maximum of 24 injections) and could receive laser therapy.</description>

          <description>Active laser photocoagulation treatment was administered on Day 1 and at intervals of at least 3 months, if deemed necessary by the evaluating physician. Patients also received monthly sham intravitreal injection in the study eye for 3 consecutive months. After the third injection, treatment was suspended if either one of the following criteria was met:
Improvement in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) could not be attributed to treatment at the last 2 visits, in the opinion of the investigator, or BCVA &gt; 84 letters (approximate Snellen equivalent of 20/20) was observed at the last 2 last visits.
Active/sham laser treatment was always administered before (sham) intravitreal injections. The minimum interval between the 2 treatments was 30 minutes.
In the extension study at the investigator's discretion, patients received open-label ranibizumab 0.5 mg intravitreal injections once a month until stable vision was reached (a maximum of 24 injections) and could receive laser therapy.</description>

        <title>Core Study: Difference Between the Baseline Level of Visual Acuity (Letters) of the Study Eye and the Mean Visual Acuity Averaged Over All Monthly Post-baseline Assessments From Month 1 to Month 12</title>
        <description>Visual acuity (VA) was assessed on both eyes during every study visit using best correction determined from protocol refraction. VA measurements (number of letters correctly identified) were performed with the patient in a sitting position using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like visual acuity testing charts at a testing distance of 4 meters.</description>

        <description>The National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI-VFQ-25) was used to measure a patient’s subjective assessment of vision-related quality of life. The 12 subscales in the VFQ-25 are general health, general vision, ocular pain, near activities, distance activities, social function, mental health, role difficulties, dependency, driving, color vision, and peripheral vision. The scores on the subscales were added together for a total score, which ranged from 0 to 100. A higher score indicated improvement in quality of life due to vision function.</description>

        <description>Participants with ocular (occurring in the eye) serious adverse events (SAEs) and non-serious AEs in the study eye. The study eye is the eye that received the treatment. AEs are the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition occurring after starting the study drug even if the event is not considered to be related to study drug. A serious adverse event is defined as an event that is fatal or life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization or is medically significant.
Additional information about adverse events can be found in the Adverse Event section.</description>

          <description>Participants with ocular (occurring in the eye) serious adverse events (SAEs) and non-serious AEs in the study eye. The study eye is the eye that received the treatment. AEs are the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition occurring after starting the study drug even if the event is not considered to be related to study drug. A serious adverse event is defined as an event that is fatal or life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization or is medically significant.

Improvement in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) could not be attributed to treatment at the last 2 visits, in the opinion of the investigator, or BCVA &gt; 84 letters (approximate Snellen equivalent of 20/20) was observed at the last 2 last visits.
Patients also received sham laser treatment on Day 1 and subsequently at intervals of at least 3 months, if deemed necessary by the evaluating physician.
Active/sham laser treatment was always administered before (sham) intravitreal injections. The minimum interval between the 2 treatments was 30 minutes.
In the extension study at the investigator's discretion, patients received open-label ranibizumab 0.5 mg intravitreal injections once a month until stable vision was reached (a maximum of 24 injections) and could receive laser therapy.</description>

          <title>Extension Study: Percentage of Participants With Non-Ocular Adverse Events (AEs) in the 24 Month Extension Study</title>
          <description>Participants with non-ocular (not occurring in the eye) serious adverse events (SAEs) and non-serious AEs. AEs are the appearance or worsening of of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition occurring after starting the study drug even if the event is not considered to be related to study drug. A serious adverse event is defined as an event that is fatal or life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization or is medically significant.
Additional information about adverse events can be found in the Adverse Event section.</description>
