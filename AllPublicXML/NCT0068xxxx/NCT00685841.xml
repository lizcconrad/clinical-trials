      This study is a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled,
      multicenter, parallel-group study of adult subjects with a primary clinical diagnosis of
      COPD. Approximately 800 subjects were to be randomized in this study. Study participation
      consisted of a total of eight (8) study visits over approximately four (4) months for each
      subject. This study was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was
      acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed
      to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Subject may be male or female and must be aged less than or equal to 35 years on the
             day the informed consent is signed.

          -  Female subjects greater than or equal to 65 years of age must have a serum pregnancy
             test conducted at Visit 1 and confirmed negative prior to randomization. Subjects of
             childbearing potential must be using an acceptable method of birth control.

          -  Female subjects who are considered not of childbearing potential must be:

               -  documented surgically sterile (defined as status post-hysterectomy or bilateral
                  tubal ligation) OR

               -  postmenopausal

          -  Subject must have a primary diagnosis of COPD, which may include components of chronic
             bronchitis and/or emphysema. Diagnosis can be made during the screening process.

          -  Subject must have a minimum smoking history of 15 pack-years (pack-years = the number
             of cigarette packs per day times the number of years).

          -  Subject must have a chest x-ray that is consistent with the diagnosis of COPD (e.g.,
             not diagnostic of pneumonia, other infection, atelectasis, or pneumothorax or other
             active/ongoing pulmonary conditions) and taken less than or equal to 3 months prior to
             study start. If there is no chest x-ray taken less than or equal to 3 months prior to
             study start, or if recent results are unavailable for review, a chest x-ray will be
             performed.

          -  Subject must be able to complete all study questionnaires and logs reliably. Exclusion
             Criteria

          -  Female subject who is pregnant or lactating.

          -  Subject who has participated in an investigational drug study within 30 days prior to
             study start, or who is currently participating in another investigational drug study.

          -  Subject whose schedule or travel prevents the completion of all required visits.

          -  Subject who is scheduled for in-patient hospitalization, including elective surgery
             (in patient or out-patient) during the trial.

          -  Subject with life-threatening/unstable respiratory status, including upper or lower
             respiratory tract infection, within the previous 30 days prior to study start.

          -  Subject with a known history of asthma or any chronic respiratory disease (including a
             current history of sleep apnea) other than COPD (chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema).

          -  Subject with a history of cancer except non-melanomatous skin cancer. Subjects with a
             history of cancer that is considered surgically cured and without a recurrence within
             the past 10 years may participate in the study. History of hematologic/lymphatic
             malignancy treated with chemotherapy or radiation is not allowed.

          -  Subject with a history of lung resection of more than one full lobe.

          -  Subject who requires continuous supplemental oxygen therapy (unless subject resides at
             elevation greater than or equal to 4,000 feet).

          -  Subject who has had a change in dose or type of any medications for COPD within 14
             days prior to the screening visit.

          -  Subject with a known sensitivity to (R,R)-formoterol, ipratropium, salmeterol or
             albuterol or any of the excipients contained in any of these formulations.

          -  Subject with a history of substance abuse or drug abuse within 12 months of study
             start, or with a positive urine drug screen at study start.

          -  Subject using any prescription drug for which concomitant beta-agonist administration
             is contraindicated (e.g., beta-blockers).
