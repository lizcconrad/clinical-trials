  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is a major public health problem in many provinces of Afghanistan the failure rate of
      chloroquine (CQ) and amodiaquine (AQ) treated Plasmodium falciparum(Pf) malaria has risen to
      more than 60% overall and as high as 90% in Jalalabad. CQ remains fully effective against P
      vivax, and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) remains effective against P falciparum (10-15% of
      cases fail to cure). The current malaria treatment protocol still continuing CQ for P.vivax
      and adopted Artmisinine based combination therapy (ACT) for treating (Pf) malaria, as most
      than 50% malaria has being diagnosed clinically, so due to this and other operational reasons
      the protocol needs to be simplified.

      By comparing 56 day PCR corrected cure rate of DHA-PPQ with the standard treatment regimen as
      primary objective and comparing the safety, gametocytecidal effect and parasite clearance
      time as secondary objectives, our study titled: Randomized, Open Label, controlled,
      non-inferiority clinical trial for comparison of Efficacy &amp; safety, will provide scientific
      evidence to lead the simplification and improvement of the standard malaria treatment regimen
      in Afghanistan; to adopt a policy of treating both vivax and falciparum malaria with the same
      drug regimen.

      With a significance level (α) = 0.05 and a power=80%, the calculated sample size is 274 per
      study arm. Therefore about1100 patients (274 per study-arm: 548 patients with falciaprum
      malaria and 548 patients with vivax malaria) will be recruited in Malaria reference Centers
      (MRCs) of three malaria endemic provinces (Nangarhar in the east, Thakhar in the north-east
      and Faryab in the north-west of country) after signing written inform consent form, according
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria and will be treated as out patients by giving the
      randomized drug dose under observation of study team and followed-up daily for 3 days (as
      treatment course of either arm is once daily dose for three days) and after than weekly up to
      day 56. and the study is planed to conducted in 3 provinces of Afghanistan for approximately
      2 years.

      Patients will be assessed clinically as well necessary laboratory tests will be performed and
      all the bio-medical findings will be recorded in special patient case record form, the
      electronic form of which will be broth to Trop. Med of Mahidol University for final analysis.
      The patients will be receiving the reasonable transportation cost for follow-up visits as
      well as one bed-net at the end of enrollment.
