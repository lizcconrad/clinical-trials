  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary hypothesis is that airway clearance therapy with sine waveform HFCWO using higher
      inflation pressures combined with both low and high oscillator frequencies will result in
      greater sputum production compared to sine waveform HFCWO with lower inflation pressures and
      mid-frequency oscillations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) perform daily airway clearance therapy to facilitate
      removal of secretions from their airways. Many different techniques are available to achieve
      this and there is currently no consensus as to which form of therapy is most effective. High
      frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) is used by CF patients throughout the United States
      and abroad. To perform this therapy, the patient wears a vest which fits over the entire
      torso and is connected to an air compressor. The compressor generates oscillating air pulses
      that are transmitted to the lungs, thereby mobilizing secretions. The most commonly used
      device is The Vest™ Airway Clearance System, (Hill-Rom Inc, St Paul, MN). Adjustment of the
      inflation pressure and frequency of oscillations affects the volume of displaced air and flow
      of air measured at the mouth of the patient. Previous studies indicate this form of therapy
      is as effective as more traditional and cumbersome forms of therapy. However, it is unclear
      which inflation pressures and oscillator frequencies provide optimal airway clearance. Some
      studies of sine waveform HFCWO reported the largest volume of air displacement and highest
      air flow measured at the mouth when using a combination of high inflation pressures with
      either low (7 - 10 Hz) or high frequencies (18 - 20 Hz), but most CF centers in the United
      States use HFCWO with lower pressures combined with mid-range frequencies (10 - 14 Hz).
      Furthermore, there are no previous studies assessing the affect of sine waveform HFCWO
      settings on sputum production. As a result, there is no consensus on which pressure and
      frequency settings are most efficacious for CF patients.

    <description>All sputum expectorated during all HFCWC sessions was collected in a pre-weighed specimen container and immediately sealed. Half the subjects used higher pressure/mixed frequency on day 1 followed by lower pressure/mid-frequency on day 4. Half the patients performed lower pressure/mid-frequency on day 1 followed by higher pressure/mixed frequency on day 4. All specimens were immediately centrifuged at 21,150 g for 15 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was completely removed to eliminate saliva. The sputum &quot;wet weight&quot; was calculated after re-weighing the container with the sputum pellet. The container was then left open in an oven with the temperature set at 65°C for a minimum of 3 days to allow for complete desiccation. The sputum &quot;dry weight&quot; was calculated after re-weighing the container.</description>

    <description>Spirometry was performed prior to, and immediately following, all HCWC sessions on Day 1.

    <time_frame>Sputum produced during the 15 minutes immediately following airway clearance therapy sessions on day 1 and day 4</time_frame>
    <description>Sputum was collected during the 15 minutes immediately following HFCWC sessions on day 1 and day 4. Half the subjects performed higher-pressure/mixed frequency HFCWC on Day 1 followed by lower pressure/mid-frequency HFCWC on Day 4. The other half of subjects performed lower pressure/mid-frequency on Day 1 followed by higer pressure/mixed-frequency on Day 4. Samples were studied with a rheometer (AR1000, TA Instruments, New Castle, Delaware) to assess the dynamic frequency range of stress-strain of a 20 microliter sputum sample over driving frequencies of 1-100 rad/s. Shear storage modulus (G') and shear loss modulus (G&quot;) were determined from these curves after nondestructive creep transformation. G' (or dynamic elasticity) measures stored energy and is a property of ideal solids. G&quot; is directly proportional to viscosity (viscosity x frequency) and is a property of ideal liquids.</description>

    <description>Following each HFCWC session on day 1 and day 4, subjects completed a questionnaire that rated the comfort and efficacy of each HFCWC session using a 5-point scale. The questionnaire was entitled &quot;Post-Therapy Questionnaire&quot;. Scale range for comfort ranged from 1 (very uncomfortable) to 3 (neutral) to 5 (very comfortable). Scale range for how &quot;effective&quot; the HFCWC session was ranged from 1 (minimally effective) to 3 (neutral) to 5 (very effective).</description>

This group subsequently crossed-over to the lower-pressure/mid-frequency HFCWC protocol after a washout period of 2 days. This entailed performing a HFCWC session using a pressure of 5 and frequency of 12 Hz for the entire 30 minute session.

        <title>Sputum Wet and Dry Weight</title>
        <description>All sputum expectorated during all HFCWC sessions was collected in a pre-weighed specimen container and immediately sealed. Half the subjects used higher pressure/mixed frequency on day 1 followed by lower pressure/mid-frequency on day 4. Half the patients performed lower pressure/mid-frequency on day 1 followed by higher pressure/mixed frequency on day 4. All specimens were immediately centrifuged at 21,150 g for 15 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was completely removed to eliminate saliva. The sputum &quot;wet weight&quot; was calculated after re-weighing the container with the sputum pellet. The container was then left open in an oven with the temperature set at 65°C for a minimum of 3 days to allow for complete desiccation. The sputum “dry weight” was calculated after re-weighing the container.</description>
        <time_frame>Produced during each airway clearance therapy session on days 1 and 4</time_frame>
        <population>In a previous study with similar design,21 the standard deviation for the difference in the mean sputum wet weight between treatment arms was 4.6 g. Assuming the same standard deviation for the current study, enrollment of 16 subjects provided an 80% chance of detecting a 3.5-g difference in the sputum wet weights at a significance level of .05.</population>

        <title>Rheology and in Vitro Cough Transportability of Sputum Produced Immediately Following Airway Clearance Therapy Session</title>
        <description>Sputum was collected during the 15 minutes immediately following HFCWC sessions on day 1 and day 4. Half the subjects performed higher-pressure/mixed frequency HFCWC on Day 1 followed by lower pressure/mid-frequency HFCWC on Day 4. The other half of subjects performed lower pressure/mid-frequency on Day 1 followed by higer pressure/mixed-frequency on Day 4. Samples were studied with a rheometer (AR1000, TA Instruments, New Castle, Delaware) to assess the dynamic frequency range of stress-strain of a 20 microliter sputum sample over driving frequencies of 1–100 rad/s. Shear storage modulus (G') and shear loss modulus (G&quot;) were determined from these curves after nondestructive creep transformation. G' (or dynamic elasticity) measures stored energy and is a property of ideal solids. G&quot; is directly proportional to viscosity (viscosity x frequency) and is a property of ideal liquids.</description>

            <description>Sputum was collected during the 15 minutes immediately following HFCWC sessions on day 1 and day 4. Half the subjects performed higher-pressure/mixed frequency HFCWC on Day 1 followed by lower pressure/mid-frequency HFCWC on Day 4. The other half of subjects performed lower pressure/mid-frequency on Day 1 followed by higer pressure/mixed-frequency on Day 4. Samples were studied with a rheometer (AR1000, TA Instruments, New Castle, Delaware) to assess the dynamic frequency range of stress-strain of a 20 microliter sputum sample over driving frequencies of 1–100 rad/s. Shear storage modulus (G') and shear loss modulus (G&quot;) were determined from these curves after nondestructive creep transformation. G' (or dynamic elasticity) measures stored energy and is a property of ideal solids. G&quot; is directly proportional to viscosity (viscosity x frequency) and is a property of ideal liquids.</description>

The questionnaire was entitled &quot;Post-Therapy Questionnaire&quot;. Scale range for comfort ranged from 1 (very uncomfortable) to 3 (neutral) to 5 (very comfortable). Scale range for how &quot;effective&quot; the HFCWC session was ranged from 1 (minimally effective) to 3 (neutral) to 5 (very effective).</description>
