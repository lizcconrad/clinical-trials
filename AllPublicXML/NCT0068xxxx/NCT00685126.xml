    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of two dose levels of levalbuterol
      compared with one dose level of racemic albuterol in pediatric subjects aged birth to 48
      months old.

      A double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group trial of
      levalbuterol in pediatric subjects presenting with acute reactive airways disease. This study
      was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was acquired by
      Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed to Sunovion
      Pharmaceuticals Inc.
