  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with atopic eczema and a poor response to topical corticosteroid applied either
      Protopic or Fluticasone ointment twice a day for 3 weeks. They could continue during 3 more
      weeks once a day if needed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatments were to be applied twice daily until clearance, for a maximum of 3 weeks and then,
      in case of uncleared residual lesions, once daily for up to 3 further weeks. In the event of
      a flare-up the treatment was to be resumed twice a day until the end of the study.

      Statistical methods: An interim analysis was performed on 30% of the planned total sample
      size, i.e. 140 included patients who had completed the study, to reassess the assumptions
      made during the planning phase.
