  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, open-label, multi-dose crossover study assessing the
      pharmacokinetic profiles of diazoxide choline coated versus uncoated formulations in healthy
      volunteers. The primary objective is to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of
      diazoxide choline controlled-release coated tablets versus uncoated tablets in healthy
      volunteers under fed conditions. Secondary objectives are to assess diazoxide choline
      pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters under fasted conditions, and to assess the safety and
      tolerability of diazoxide choline controlled-release coated tablets versus uncoated tablets
      in healthy volunteers.
