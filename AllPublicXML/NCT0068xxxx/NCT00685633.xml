      RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such
      as bicalutamide, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Enzastaurin may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not
      yet known whether giving bicalutamide together with enzastaurin is more effective than
      bicalutamide alone in treating prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying bicalutamide to see how well it works
      compared with giving bicalutamide together with enzastaurin in treating patients with
      prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To compare the two regimens on the proportion of patients with undetectable
           prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (&lt; 0.2 ng/mL) at 44 weeks.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the proportion of patients with PSA decline &gt; 85% at 44 weeks on the
           combination therapy arm compared to that of bicalutamide monotherapy arm.

        -  To assess the distribution of best PSA response in each study arm.

        -  To assess the time to PSA progression and the time to PSA nadir in each arm of the
           study.

        -  To assess the duration of PSA response in each arm of the study.

        -  To characterize the PSA slope before, during, and after treatment.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of enzastaurin hydrochloride in this patient
           population.

        -  To determine whether Gleason score or prior hormonal therapy has any effect on PSA
           response to treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to Gleason score (≤ 6
      vs 7 vs 8-10) and prior hormonal therapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm A:

             -  Weeks 1-12: Patients are observed without treatment. Patients with a
                prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rise of &gt; 50% above baseline or nadir (whichever is
                lowest) and a rise of at least 5 ng/mL, confirmed by a repeat PSA at least 2 weeks
                later, may be started on bicalutamide before the end of week 12 at the discretion
                of the treating physician.

             -  Weeks 13-44: Patients with a rise PSA ≥ 50% above baseline or nadir, and a PSA rise
                of at least 5 ng/mL confirmed by a repeat PSA at least 2 weeks later, are removed
                from study. Patients receive oral bicalutamide once daily. Patients achieving a PSA
                decline ≥ 50% in the absence of toxicity may continue to receive bicalutamide up to
                72 weeks.

        -  Arm B:

             -  Weeks 1-12: Patients receive oral enzastaurin hydrochloride twice daily. Patients
                with a PSA rise of &gt; 50% above baseline or nadir, and a rise of at least 5 ng/mL,
                confirmed by a repeat PSA at least 2 weeks later, may be started on bicalutamide
                before the end of week 12 at the discretion of the treating physician.

             -  Weeks 13-44: Patients with a PSA rise of ≥ 50% above baseline or nadir, and a rise
                of at least 5 ng/mL, confirmed by a repeat PSA at least 2 weeks later, are removed
                from study. Patients receive oral enzastaurin twice daily and oral bicalutamide
                once daily. Patients achieving a PSA decline ≥ 50% in the absence of toxicity may
                continue on this combination therapy up to 72 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years, and
      then every 6 months for up to 10 years.
