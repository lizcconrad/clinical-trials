      RATIONALE: Gathering information about cognitive function over time in postmenopausal women
      with breast cancer may help doctors learn about the long-term effects of aromatase inhibitor
      therapy and plan the best treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying cognitive function in older postmenopausal women
      with stage I, stage II, or stage III breast cancer receiving hormone therapy and in healthy
      volunteers.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Explore the impact of treatment with an aromatase inhibitor on the cognitive function of
           postmenopausal women with stage I-III breast cancer vs in cancer-free, age-matched
           healthy volunteers.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive adjuvant anastrozole or letrozole in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients and healthy volunteers undergo cognitive function testing consisting of
      neuropsychological battery tests and complete self-reported questionnaires (e.g., Squire
      Memory Self-Rating Questionnaire, and FACT-B Quality of Life Measure) regarding cognitive
      ability, quality of life, fatigue, and psychosocial status. Patients and healthy volunteers
      also undergo geriatric assessment at baseline and after 6 months of initiation with aromatase
      inhibitor therapy.
