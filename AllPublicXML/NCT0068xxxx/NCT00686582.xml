  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the current study is to show that the immune response of subjects previously
      vaccinated with one or two doses of IMVAMUNE® can be boosted two years later with one
      IMVAMUNE® vaccination. Assessment of individual antibody titers within short time intervals
      following the booster vaccination will provide information on how fast and effective
      measurable antibody titers can be reactivated.

      In summary, this study is intended to confirm that a single dose of IMVAMUNE® can reactivate
      antibody titers in subjects after being primed with one or two doses of IMVAMUNE®.
