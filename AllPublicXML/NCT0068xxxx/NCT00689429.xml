      A chart review will be performed to extrapolate information including sex, height, weight,
      date/time admitted to HMC, injury data, comorbidities, fracture pattern, antibiotic usage,
      surgical history, wound history, fracture healing, and length of time to return to work.
      Dr.'s Goodspeed and Reid will conduct a radiographic review independently for each subject,
      classifying all fractures according to the Orthopaedic Trauma Association classification
      guide. If a discrepancy in classification is found, then both will discuss together and come
      to a consensus.

      After patients are identified with the Orthopaedic Surgical Database, letters will be sent to
      those patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria informing them of the study and that
      they will be contacted by the research associate in 1-2 weeks. The research associate will
      telephone the patient to discuss the study and answer any questions they may have. Dr.
      Goodspeed will also be available to answer any questions. The research associate with obtain
      verbal consent and proceed by asking questions from the Short Musculoskeletal Function
      Assessment Injury and Arthritis Survey, and the Foot and Ankle Outcomes Questionnaire. The
      medical student will then perform a chart review to extrapolate information including sex,
      height, weight, date/time admitted to HMC, injury data, comorbidities, fracture pattern,
      antibiotic usage, surgical history, wound history, fracture healing, and length of time to
      return to work. Dr.'s Goodspeed and Reid will conduct a radiographic review independently for
      each subject, classifying all fractures according to the Orthopaedic Trauma Association
      classification guide. If a discrepancy in classification is found, then both will discuss
      together and come to a consensus.

      Functional outcomes data will be measured by the Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment
      Injury and Arthritis Survey and the Foot and Ankle Outcomes Questionnaire. Radiographic
      Classifications will be determined according to the Orthopaedic Trauma Association's
      classification guide.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients admitted to the Hershey Medical Center with a primary diagnosis of an open
             pilon fracture and surgically treated between 1/1/2000 and 12/31/2007.

          -  Temporization of the fracture may be performed elsewhere or by other orthopaedists at
             the Hershey Medical Center. Definitive surgery must be performed by Dr.'s David
             Goodspeed, J. Spence Reid, or Robert Simpson.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  closed pilon fracture or pathological fracture; definitive fracture fixation performed
             outside the Hershey Medical center or by a surgeon other than Dr.'s David Goodspeed,
             J. Spence Reid, and Robert Simpson; patient is diagnosed with active infection at the
             time of first surgery at the Penn State Hershey Medical Center; patient is less than
             18 years of age at the time of definitive surgery;

          -  patient is mentally compromised and unable to give consent;

          -  does not cooperate with survey data acquisition; patient is deceased;

          -  patient presented with significant ipsilateral leg fracture or injury at anytime
             within the time frame of the study.
