      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of ceftobiprole treatment on intestinal
      microflora in healthy volunteers.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single center study to investigate the effect on human intestinal
      microflora of multiple doses of ceftobiprole treatment administered at 8 hours intervals for
      7 consecutive days. Careful investigation of the effect of Ceftobiprole treatment on the
      intestinal microflora is of importance since alteration of the intestinal microflora balance
      may facilitate colonization by pathogenic bacteria strains or enable microorganisms already
      present in the normal microflora to develop resistance. A total of 7 fecal samples will be
      collected on day 2, 4, 7, 10, 14 and 21 for determination of ceftobiprole concentration in
      fecal, intestinal microflora pattern and measuring the susceptibility for Ceftobiprole of
      isolated bacterial strains. A total of 13 plasma samples will be collected on day 1, 4, 7,
      10, 14 and 21 for determination of ceftobiprole concentration in plasma. Safety evaluations
      including physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram and
      adverse event monitoring will be performed throughout the study. 500 mg ceftobiprole,
      intravenous infusion over 120 minutes, every 8 hours for 7 consecutive days
