  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza A is one of the best studied viruses, but continues to have a very large impact on
      human and animal health. In addition to causing outbreaks of winter flu, it sometimes mutates
      to create a new virus that spreads quickly around the world. It is puzzling that the same
      virus appears to cause minor or absent symptoms in some people while killing others. Much
      remains to be understood.

      We have assembled an unprecedented group of internationally renowned scientists from England
      and Scotland who will together focus on studying a few hundred people hospitalised during the
      current swine flu pandemic. Such a largescale project has never before been attempted, but we
      are now poised to work together and integrate the many recent advances in biomedical science
      that relate to understanding how influenza causes disease.

      The ultimate goal of this collaborative, intensive study is to discover new and effective
      treatments and to develop better vaccines that can be used in future outbreaks. By
      integrating the information that we will gather, we will create a unique overview of how
      influenza causes illness and what might be done to improve patient management.

      In addition, if the patients are having further respiratory sample collection as part of
      their routine care, for example tracheal aspirates, bronchial lavage and other samples then
      we would like to take an additional amount of these samples for our research.
