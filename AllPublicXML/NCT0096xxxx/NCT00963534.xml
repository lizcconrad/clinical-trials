      In phase I: Establishing maximally tolerated dose of lenalidomide in combination with
      bendamustine and rituximab.

      In phase II: Evaluation of progression free survival with treatment with lenalidomide,
      bendamustine and rituximab

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial consists of both a phase I portion and a phase II portion. In phase I, the MTD of
      lenalidomide is determined, starting with 5 mg/day given up to maximally 25 mg/day. In
      combination with this treatment, bendamustine and rituximab are given at fixed doses.

      The phase I portion follows a sequential dose escalation, 3+3 design. Initially, three
      subjects are started treatment with dose regimen 1 (5 mg/day). After the third subject
      completed two cycles of treatment, if no DLT has occured, the next group of three subjects
      are treated at the next dose level of lenalidomide (10 mg/day). If one of the three initial
      subjects experiences a DLT, the cohort is expanded to six subjects. If less than two out of
      the six subjects experiences a DLT, then the next higher dose group is initiated. If two or
      more subjects experiences a DLT, no higher dose levels will be tested and the MTD dose has
      been exceeded.

      Additional subjects are enrolled at the MTD on the phase II portion of the trial.

      The above described treatment with lenalidomide, bendamustine and rituximab are given in 6
      cycles, cycle length 22 days. Lenalidomide is given day 1-21, bendamustine day 1-2 and
      rituximab day 1. During the following maintenance treatment, single treatment with
      lenalidomide will be given with the same dose of lenalidomide (25 mg/day) for 7 cycles,
      whether in phase I or phase II portion of the trial.
