      The aim of the present study is to assess the effectiveness of belly dance as a treatment for
      pain and improving the quality of life of patients with fibromyalgia.

      Eighty female patients with fibromyalgia between 18 to 65 years were randomly allocated to a
      dance group (n=40) and control group (n=40). Patients in the dance group underwent 16 weeks
      of belly dance twice a week, while the patients in the control group remained on a waiting
      list. Patients were evaluated with regard to pain (Visual Analogue Scale), function (6 minute
      walk test), quality of life (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and SF-36), depression (Beck
      Inventory), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and self-image (Body Dysmorphic Disorder
      Examination) questionnaire. Evaluations were carried out at baseline, after 16 weeks and
      after 32 weeks.

    <description>Belly dance classes twice a week for 16 weeks. Each class had a maximum of eight students. The classes were administered by a physiotherapist with eight years of experience in belly dance. Classes began with a warm-up exercise, followed by the predetermined movements for the day, choreography and a cool-down exercise. The participants received a compact disc with music and an exercise book with the history and movements proposed for the program. Beginning in the fourth week, a set sequence of movements in the form of choreography was established for memorization and training at home.</description>

            <title>Dance Group</title>
            <description>The participants in the dance group took one-hour belly dance classes twice a week for 16 weeks. Each class had a maximum of eight students. The classes were administered by a physiotherapist with eight years of experience in belly dance. Classes began with a warm-up exercise, followed by the predetermined movements for the day, choreography and a cool-down exercise. The participants received a compact disc with music and an exercise book with the history and movements proposed for the program. Beginning in the fourth week, a set sequence of movements in the form of choreography was established for memorization and training at home.</description>
