      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill
      tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain
      after surgery. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy is more effective than
      observation after mastectomy in treating women with stage II breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy to see how well it
      works compared with standard therapy in treating women with stage II breast cancer who have
      undergone mastectomy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the overall survival of women at intermediate risk for locoregional recurrence
           of breast cancer treated with ipsilateral chest wall adjuvant radiotherapy after
           mastectomy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Beginning 12 weeks after mastectomy or 6 weeks after adjuvant chemotherapy,
           patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 3-5 weeks in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive standard of care and observation only. After completion of
           study therapy, patients are followed up twice in the first year, and then annually for
           up to 10 years.
