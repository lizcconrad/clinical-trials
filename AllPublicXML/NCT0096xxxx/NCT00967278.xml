  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the positioning and stabilization of different cardiac
      walls performed during off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) may have dissimilar
      impact on hemodynamics.

      The objective is to evaluate hemodynamics during distal coronary anastomoses in different
      cardiac walls.

      -  Twenty patients undergoing off-pump CABG monitored with pulmonary artery catheter and
           esophageal doppler will be enrolled.

        -  Patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;50%, age &gt;80 yr, creatinine &gt;1.4
           mg/dl, reoperation, valvular heart disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were
           excluded

        -  Data will be collected after volemic and hemodynamic adjustments, after heart
           positioning and establishment of a suction stabilizer and before its removal in
           anterior, lateral or posterior wall artery anastomosis.

        -  Data was compared by means of two-way repeated measures ANOVA.
