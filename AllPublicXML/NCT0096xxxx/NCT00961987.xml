  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot project is to determine if there are differences in patient outcomes
      and healthcare utilization between patients randomly assigned to usual care (a collaborative
      model of maternity care with co-located healthcare professionals but with referrals to
      off-site obstetricians) or to a collaborative model of maternity care with co-located
      healthcare professionals, including obstetricians. It is hypothesized that by creating a
      seamless interface between obstetrical consultation and ongoing longitudinal maternity care,
      patient outcomes (birth outcome data), patient satisfaction and healthcare utilization,
      including number of outpatient visits, ultrasounds, laboratory tests, consultations, etc,
      will be improved in the intervention group compared with the group receiving usual care. The
      results could potentially lead to other sites adopting this innovative model of maternity
      healthcare delivery.
