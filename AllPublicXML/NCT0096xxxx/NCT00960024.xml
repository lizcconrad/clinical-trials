  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims at generating evidence of a work-rehabilitation strategy that benefits the
      people with severe mental illness (SMI) who want to work, increase their sense of well-being
      and integration in society, decrease their financial dependence and experiences of stigma and
      discrimination. The project is likely to help form the basis of how to implement the evidence
      based supported employment (SE)-model, Individual Placement and Support model (IPS), in a
      Swedish work-rehabilitation context. In the long run, evidence of SE in a Swedish context
      could help to decrease the period of sick-leave and increase fulfilling and productive
      lifestyles among people with severe mental illness. In all, the effectiveness of SE can
      improve the quality of life for the target group, the quality in mental health care
      rehabilitation and decrease the costs of treatment and care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence-based mental health treatment and scientific support has gained increased attention
      in Sweden. The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare emphasizes the importance of
      Supported Employment. Especially since there are no study in Sweden that has an RCT-design,
      and that fully take on the responsibility of implementing a SE- intervention in concordance
      with the evidence based version of SE in mental health care, the Individual Placement and
      Support model, IPS. Internationally, SE according to IPS is an evidence-based approach to
      help people with SMI find and keep employment. RCT and quasi-experimental studies showed that
      IPS (Place-Then-Train), is more effective than the traditional stepwise vocational
      rehabilitation model(Train-Then-Place. However, there is no research evidence if the SE/IPS
      will function in relation to a Swedish benefit and health system and work-rehabilitation
      context. This intervention project will therefore not only study the effects of vocational
      and health-related outcomes and experiences, but also study the implementation of SE/IPS, its
      feasibility and level of fidelity in a Swedish context.
