             reaction

          -  History of chronic, dermatological, medical, or physical conditions which would, in
             the opinion of the investigator, preclude topical application of the test products
             and/or influence the outcome of the test (in particular, any immunosuppressive
             condition)

          -  Clinically relevant abnormal findings on the physical examination

          -  A baseline score in skin reaction assessments other than &quot;0&quot; on the areas to be
             patched

          -  Pregnant (verified by beta-hCG-test in urine) and/or nursing women

             and acute stroke

          -  Use of any medication within 4 weeks prior to the first treatment or during the trial,
             which in the opinion of the investigator may influence the trial results or the safety
             of the subjects

          -  Subjects having used nicotine products other than cigarettes within the 3 months
             preceding the trial or within 10 times the respective elimination half-life, whichever
             is longer

          -  Subjects who cannot avoid, throughout the duration of the trial, any swimming, any
             washing of the back and sauna or any intense physical activity that might result in
             excessive sweating

          -  Known sensitivity to adhesive tape

          -  Known sensitivity to any component of the test products

          -  Participation in the treatment phase of a clinical trial within 30 days prior to the
             treatment phase of this trial or within 10 times the respective elimination half-life
