      The purpose of this study is to analyse the physical and psychological side-effects in the
      course of treatment with IFN-alpha. The effectiveness of a specific intervention for the
      management of these side-effects is evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Today, the consideration of the side effects of intensive treatment measures and their
      influence on quality of life are regarded as standard procedures in oncology. Quality of life
      measurements have found their way into clinical studies as patient-reported outcomes. In
      comparison to other tumor types, the field of dermato-oncology has had less research activity
      concerning quality of life. However, in recent years more attention has been paid to health
      related quality of life in malignant melanoma patients, especially under adjuvant treatment
      with interferon-alpha. Data about high dose IFN-α treatment, especially from the USA, show
      that there are significant physical and psychological side effects, such as fatigue and
      depression, which often lead to dosage reduction or termination of treatment. As yet, there
      are very few systematic studies about low dose IFN-α treatment, especially in regard to the
      side effects during the course of the disease.

      Concerning treatment side-effects it is known throughout various areas of oncology that
      specific psycho-oncological interventions assist in the patients' adaptation to the illness
      and handling of the side effects of therapy.
