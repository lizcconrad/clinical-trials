      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of a 10-week Omega-3 Fatty Acid treatment
      phase on brain chemistry of adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) using proton
      magnetic resonance imaging.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study rests on a confluence of findings showing that: 1) Major depressive disorder
      (MDD), is a major public health concern that often emerges in adolescence; which entails 2)
      pathophysiological abnormalities in fronto-striatal structures resulting in death and atrophy
      of glia and neurons; 3) omega-3 fatty acids (FA) effects on brain function in adolescent MDD
      can be assessed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS); and, 4) it is critical
      that commonly used complementary and alternative medicines such as omega-3FA that have face
      validity be tested for their neurobiological effect in MDD.

      Using 1H MRSI, this study examines the effects of Omega-3FA on striatal and anterior
      cingulate cortex (ACC) concentrations of the neurocellular biomarkers total choline (tCho),
      total creatine (tCr), and Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA, ACC only) in adolescent MDD. Hypotheses
      are: 1) relative to placebo, omega-3FA treatment will result in significant reductions of
      striatal and ACC tCho and tCr concentrations, and increased ACC GABA; 2: Regardless of
      treatment condition (placebo or Omega-3FA), MDD adolescents who are improved at the end of
      10-week treatment will exhibit a significant decrease in striatal and ACC tCho and tCr
      concentrations, and increases in ACC GABA relative to unimproved adolescents.

        <title>ACC GABA/Water</title>
        <description>The ratio of gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and water in the brain (ratio divided by 10000 for analysis purposes), that was observed in MR Spectroscopy. GABA, an amino acid produced by cells of the central nervous system, is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, prominent in the human brain.</description>

Omega 3 Fatty Acids: The study medication will consist of combined EPA/DHA with a ratio of 2:1. Dosage will be titrated based on clinical response and side effects. The initial dose will be 1.2g/d. This will be increased gradually by 0.6 per 2 weeks to a possible maximum daily dose of 3.6 g/d. Patients will have to remain on a dose for 2 weeks to provide the opportunity to assess clinical response at any one dose. The total duration of the intervention will be 10 weeks.</description>
