  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that healing may influence the patient's general status by altering
      psychological as well as other body functions of importance for the rheumatoid arthritis.
      This is tested in a three group design with a control group and two groups receiving healing
      with or without a healer present. The study is randomized and double blind.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The central claim of healers is that this process facilitates self-healing in the patient.
      Spiritual healing includes several categories, including 'therapeutic touch' and
      'intercessory prayer', and the healing may be attributed to God, spirits, universal forces or
      energies, biological healing energies residing in the healer, or self-healing powers or
      energies thought to reside latent in the healed organism. The highly controversial
      hypothesized effects of distant or spiritual healing contradict our traditional sense of
      reality and are in conflict with what is generally viewed as being in correspondence with
      modern science.
