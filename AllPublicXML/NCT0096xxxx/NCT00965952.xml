  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to perform a procedure to evaluate the safety of the
      placement of a new device (known as the VFIX device).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the surgeon will not use the actual V-Fix device. Instead, the surgeon will
      use a routine operating room instrument, which is similar to the size and shape of the V-Fix
      device to mimic the placement of the VFIX device by using the routine operating room
      instrument to push the top of your vagina towards the ligament.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

          -  Subjects with apical support prolapse in whom the surgeon may consider a surgical
             procedure to correct level 1 support, with &quot;C&quot; or &quot;D&quot; descent at least halfway down
             the vaginal length (i.e. uterus and cervix or the vaginal vault in hysterectomised
             subjects), and having laparoscopy or abdominal surgery (additional surgery e.g. tubal
             ligation or ovarian cystectomy is also allowed).

          -  Vaginal examination during the screening visit confirms that the lateral fornix of the
             vagina can reach both the left and right SSL and therefore the surgical simulation can
             be performed.

          -  The investigator considers that the subject is medically fit enough to receive
             extended anaesthesia of approximately 15 minutes, to complete the additional
             anatomical observation study procedures.

          -  Subjects agree to participate in the study and document this agreement by signing the
             Ethics Committee approved informed consent.
