  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Computed tomography (CT) creates three-dimensional images based on X-ray imaging. CT is
           useful for determining treatment approaches for certain diseases, such as calcific
           aortic stenosis (narrowing of the aorta because of calcium deposits).

        -  Comparing the data received from CT scans with the data received from heart
           catheterization (which assesses the heart's condition and function) can be used to
           improve treatment in patients with certain heart conditions. Researchers are interested
           in looking at the effectiveness of both procedures in assessing possible surgical
           treatments for patients with calcific aortic stenosis.

      Objectives:

      - To analyze cardiac CT scans in conjunction with existing heart scan results to improve
      treatments for future minimally invasive aortic valve replacement.

      Eligibility:

      - Patients 18 years of age and older who have been diagnosed with aortic valve stenosis that
      may be treated surgically, and who will undergo or have recently undergone heart
      catheterization.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have a CT scan within 90 days of the medically necessary heart
           catheterization, but before any other surgical or catheter treatment.

        -  During the CT scan, patients will be asked to hold their breath intermittently for about
           5 to 20 seconds. Patients will be inside the scanner for less than 30 minutes.

        -  Patients will be asked to return in 3 to 7 days for a blood test to check kidney
           function.

        -  Researchers will analyze the results of the CT scan in conjunction with the previous
           results from the catheterization to determine possible improved treatment options.

      We will collect cardiac computed tomography (CT) data from patients with aortic valve
      stenosis being considered for surgical or catheter treatment. These data will be analyzed
      along with medically-necessary fluoroscopy from cardiac catheterization to learn whether they
      can be combined to enhance future minimally invasive valve treatments.
