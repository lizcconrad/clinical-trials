  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if the insertion site of a perineural
      catheter, or tiny tube placed next to the nerves that go to the hip which you will have
      surgery, affects the amount of pain relief that is experienced after surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the association between perineural catheter location and postoperative
      analgesia, analgesic requirements, ambulatory distance, and flexion following hip
      arthroplasty.

      Primary Hypothesis: Differing the catheter insertion site (femoral vs. psoas compartment) for
      a perineural local anesthetic infusion is not associated with lower pain scores during the
      24-hour period beginning the morning following hip arthroplasty.

    <description>Patients will be randomized with a computer program to receive a femoral catheter. The catheter will be placed using standard technique. The time of catheter placement will be recorded as well as the pain/discomfort of catheter placement as reported by the patient on a 0-10 scale where 0=no pain/discomfort and 10=worst imaginable pain/discomfort.</description>

    <intervention_name>Femoral Nerve Block vs. Psoas Compartment Nerve Block</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients, undergoing hip arthroplasty or hip resurfacing will be randomized to one of two groups: femoral nerve block or psoas compartment nerve block. Patients randomized to femoral nerve block will receive this block prior to surgery. Patients randomized to psoas compartment nerve block will receive this block prior to surgery. Both patients will receive Mepivicaine via catheter prior to surgery and following surgery, Ropivicaine via pain pump.</description>
