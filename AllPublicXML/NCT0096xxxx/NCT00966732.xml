  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a common, costly and debilitating illness which affects mostly women.
      Fibromyalgia patients report widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, stiffness, and
      distress. Several consensus statements indicate that optimal care combines medication,
      exercise, and psychology. Yoga is a popular mind/body discipline which holds promise for
      reducing fibromyalgia symptoms. The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the effects of an
      innovative program, Yoga of Awareness, in which yoga poses are complemented by meditation and
      breathing exercises, presentations on healthy coping, and group discussions. Fifty-six women
      with fibromyalgia will be recruited and randomly divided into two groups. One group will
      receive the yoga program right away, and the other group will wait 3 months before receiving
      the program. Information about fibromyalgia symptoms and functioning will be collected from
      both groups before and immediately after the first group receives the yoga program. When
      results from the 2 groups are compared, the investigators expect patients who received the
      yoga program will have greater gains in fibromyalgia symptoms, physical function and pain
      coping capacities then those waiting to receive the program. If this study shows the yoga
      program is effective, the investigators will use this data in 2010 to apply to the National
      Institutes of Health for a more complete study of its benefits.

    <description>The 8 week yoga program will meet in groups of about 8-10 persons. Each 2-hour session will include gentle stretching, strengthening, and balance poses; meditation exercises; breathing techniques; study of pertinent topics (eg, mind/body stress reactivity), and group discussions (eg, experiences while practicing yoga). Participants will be asked to practice yoga methods at home, guided by a DVD (or audio recordings). The program will be taught by a certified yoga teacher (RYT) who has extensive experience in teaching yoga to medical patients.</description>
