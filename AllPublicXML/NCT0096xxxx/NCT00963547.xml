    <description>Part 1: MK2206 tablets will be given starting at a dose of 45 mg every other day and escalated to 60 mg if tolerated OR starting at a dose of 135 mg weekly and escalated to 200 mg weekly if tolerated. Dose reduction to 30mg every other day or 90 mg weekly may be permitted. The dose of MK2206 will be increased or decreased as required to find the maximum tolerated dose of MK2206 for both the every other day and weekly dosing schedules in combination with trastuzumab. The Part 2 dosing level and schedule of MK2206 will be chosen from the maximum tolerated dose of either the every other day or weekly dosing schedules depending on the toxicity profile and preliminary efficacy.</description>
