    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to prove that the strategy of treatment adjustment at W24
      according to virological response based on ROADMAP concept is better than standard of care
      strategy.

    <description>Patients were to take telbivudine 600 mg orally daily from Baseline.At Week 24, patients in Group I were split into Group I-A or Group I-B based on their virologic load:
Group I-A: This group of patients was those with HBV DNA ≥300 copies/mL at Week 24 and adefovir was to be added at Week 28;
Group I-B: This group of patients was those with HBV DNA &lt;300 copies/mL at Week 24. Telbivudine monotherapy was to be continued until there was a viral breakthrough (confirmed by two examinations with at least 1 month interval with compliance factor excluded) and then adefovir was to be added;
The total treatment duration was 104 weeks.</description>
