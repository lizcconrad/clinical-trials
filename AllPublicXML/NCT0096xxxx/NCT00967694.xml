  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if breathing nitrous oxide (also known as &quot;laughing
      gas&quot;) changes the pressure in a person's eyes. Some patients who need regular eye exams to
      measure their eye pressure often need to be put to sleep with medicine in order to complete
      the eye exam. Some of these medicines are known to cause changes in a person's eye pressure.
      Because of this, such medicines are avoided if the eye doctor needs to measure the patient's
      eye pressure. One medicine that is frequently used to put patients to sleep is nitrous oxide.
      No one really knows what effect nitrous oxide might have on a persons' eye pressure. The
      investigators are interested to see if nitrous oxide causes an increase, decrease, or no
      change in eye pressure. The investigators also want to investigate if there is a difference
      in the effects of nitrous oxide on eye pressure between males and females. Understanding
      these effects of nitrous oxide is important because during such eye exams, the eye doctor
      uses the pressure measurements to make important decisions about treatment and surgery
      options for the patient.

      The investigators hypothesize that the use of inhaled nitrous oxide (N2O) will result in a
      decrease in IOP in healthy volunteers.

      The investigators aim to determine the magnitude and duration of change, if any, in IOP
      caused by inhalation of N2O, and to assess if the gender of the patient has a role in this
      effect.

      An initial pre-anesthetic evaluation and physical examination will be performed by an
      attending anesthesiologist, and an eye exam will be performed by an attending ophthalmologist
      to determine suitability for inclusion according to the above criteria. Ideally the eye exam
      will take place immediately prior to conduction of the study. However, logistical restraints
      may require that the eye exam take place at a separate time/date prior to conduction of the
      study. IOPs will be measured by the attending ophthalmologist (B.E.) who will be blinded to
      the actual readings of the Tonopen by means of a small screen, and a single trained observer
      (E.F.) will record observations from the Tonopen. The nitrous oxide sedation will be managed
      by the attending anesthesiologist (K.L.). All patients will be monitored throughout using
      standardized monitoring (continuous EKG, non-invasive BP, and continuous pulse oximetry).

            <groups_desc>A linear mixed effects model was used to assess change in IOP over time using time-points as the primary independent variable with significance set at p &lt; 0.05. Power calculations showed that 20 subjects would allow detection of a 2.8-mmHg difference in IOP between any two time-points with 80% power assuming a standard deviation of 3.5 mmHg for IOP and a correlation between two time- points of 0.25</groups_desc>

          <title>Nitrous Oxide Administration</title>
          <description>20 healthy volunteers had their intraocular pressure (IOP) measured at baseline and then after 3, 6, 9, and 12 minutes of nitrous oxide administration, and then after 5, 10, and 15 minutes of breathing room air. There was therefore only one study arm, with each individual serving as their control for baseline and then intervention values of IOP measurement.</description>
