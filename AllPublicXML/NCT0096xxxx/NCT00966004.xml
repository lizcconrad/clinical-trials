    <textblock>
      This study examines the superiority of YM178 over the placebo and evaluates the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of YM178 in patients with overactive bladder, and to compare the efficacy
      and safety of YM178 over those of tolterodine, the control drug, without a non-inferiority
      test.

      The drug administration period is 14 weeks in total, consisting of 2 weeks for placebo
      (pre-investigation period) and 12 weeks for the investigational drug (treatment period).
