  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In spite of surgical and chemotherapeutic advances, long term survival for advanced and
      recurrent gynecologic cancers remains dismal and no curative treatment for recurrent disease
      exists. Novel treatment strategies are needed. This is a study to determine the maximally
      tolerated dose of and toxicities associated with intraperitoneal delivery of an infectivity
      enhanced adenovirus that expresses a suicide gene and an gene that allows imaging of gene
      transfer. This vector will be given in combination with intravenous ganciclovir in patients
      with recurrent ovarian and other gynecological cancers.
