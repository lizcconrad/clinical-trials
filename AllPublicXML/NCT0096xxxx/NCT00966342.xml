      This is an invitation to consider taking part in a research study occurring just before the
      upcoming influenza vaccination program across Canada. The purpose of the study is to closely
      assess influenza vaccine safety and immune responses, as part of a nationwide, annual
      surveillance project sponsored by the Public Health Agency of Canada. Such scrutiny is
      important given the changing nature of flu vaccines from year to year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trivalent inactivated vaccines (TIVs) are the principal tools for minimizing seasonal
      influenza morbidity and mortality in populations at increased risk of adverse outcomes. To
      keep pace with the evolution of circulating viruses the composition of TIVs is annually
      updated. Depending upon circumstances, the seasonal formulation may contain 1-3 new variant
      strains representing Canada's supply of H1N1, H3N2 and B 2009 vaccine. Standardized
      manufacturing processes favour consistent vaccine safety and immunogenicity profiles from
      year to year but unanticipated differences can and do occur. As a consequence of the unusual
      occurrence of &quot;oculorespiratory syndrome&quot; in recipients of a Canadian-made TIV for 2000-2001,
      the Canadian regulatory agency has required pre-approval clinical testing of seasonal
      vaccines in adults. This small scale testing (120 subjects) cannot exclude the occurrence of
      infrequent, troublesome adverse effects. Expanded testing is desirable and would best be done
      soon after vaccines are approved for distribution so that results could inform the public
      vaccination programs that follow. Having an established capacity for rapid evaluation of a
      new influenza vaccine will be invaluable in the event of a pandemic, when vaccines will be
      less thoroughly tested before being made available to protect the public.

      The objectives of this study are two-fold:

        1. To assess the safety and immunogenicity of a seasonal TIV influenza vaccine quickly
           enough to inform subsequent public delivery programs.

        2. To use the opportunity to refine preparedness for rapid evaluation of a pandemic
           influenza vaccine.
