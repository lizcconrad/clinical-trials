  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) has emerged as a novel noninvasive technique for assessment
      of airway inflammation, and it provides information on airway lining fluid composition.
      Traditionally, such assessment relies on invasive diagnostic tools such as bronchial biopsy
      and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to obtain specimens from the airway but it is very
      uncomfortable procedure especially for young patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate
      the effect of allergic disease, disease monitoring and exposure to tobacco smoke on airway
      inflammation measured by markers in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) in children with asthma
      allergic to house dust mite. Also, we aim to assess correlations between cytokine
      concentrations in EBC and clinical characteristic of the patients with exercise-induced
      bronchoconstriction as another phenotype of asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Markers that can be identified in the EBC of patients with asthma include pH, hydrogen
      peroxide, nitrogen oxides, eicosanoids, isoprostanes, adenosine, certain cytokines,
      chemokines, and growth factors. Concentrations of these biomarkers are influenced by
      inflammation, oxidative stress, and can be modulated by therapeutic interventions. There is
      evidence that some markers in EBC differ between patients with asthma and controls, and some
      of them can correlate with asthma severity score, lung function. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the effect of allergic disease, disease monitoring and exposure to tobacco smoke on
      airway inflammation measured by markers in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) in children with
      asthma allergic to house dust mite. We will also evaluate the effect of antiasthmatic
      treatment applied out of dust season on the number of exacerbations in &quot;asthma epidemic&quot; in
      September. We will evaluate the effect of exposure to tobacco smoke on antiasthmatic
      treatment.

      Also, we aim to assess correlations between cytokine concentrations in EBC and clinical
      characteristic of the patients with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) as another
      phenotype of asthma. At the first study vist patients with EIB underwent fractional exhaled
      nitric oxide measurement (FeNO) and baseline spirometry, performed exercise treadmill
      challenge (ETC) and EBC samples were obtained at the end of ETC.
