    <description>The primary endpoint is the change in subcutaneous oxygen tension from incision until the time most patients is still undergoing surgery. Subcutaneous oxygen tension is measured every fifteen minutes throughout surgery. The oxygen tension is measured with a polygraphic electrode (Clark's electrode).</description>
