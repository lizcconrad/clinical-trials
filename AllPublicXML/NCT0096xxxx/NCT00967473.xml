      The purpose of this study is to describe rates of spatial distortions related to intraocular
      lens (IOL) misalignment for ACRYSOF® Single-Piece Toric NATURAL IOL Model SN60T9 when
      implanted bilaterally into the capsular bag following phacoemulsification in adult patients
      with bilateral cataract and regular corneal astigmatism. Subjects were implanted with the
      Model SN60T9 in the first operative (study) eye and either Model SN60T9 or Model SN60T8 in
      the second operative eye.

    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Spatial Distortions Related to Intraocular Lens (IOL) Misalignment</measure>
    <time_frame>Before Surgery and 180 days after second eye implant</time_frame>
    <description>Rates of spatial distortions were evaluated by use of the Visual Distortion Questionnaire (VDQ). The VDQ evaluates the rate &amp; frequency of subjects' experiences with potential visual distortions. The fewer the patients that report visual distortions, the better. The VDQ is a binocular assessment, therfore the subject will use both eyes to evaluate visual distortions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduction of Cylinder</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after surgery on second eye</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of subjects with reduction in post-operative refractive cylinder (amount of astigmatism) compared to pre-operative keratometric cylinder in the study eye. The post-operative refractive cylinder should be significantly lower than it was pre-operatively.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lens Axis Misalignment</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of where the surgeon intended to place the lens axis versus final placement of the lens during the surgical procedure, measured in degrees. This number should be close to zero as there should be minimal difference between the two numbers. This assessment is only for the study eye.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults, 21 years of age or older at the time of surgery, of either gender or any race,
             diagnosed with bilateral cataracts;

This number should be close to zero as there should be minimal difference between the two numbers. This assessment is only for the study eye.</description>
