    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of multisite left ventricular (LV)
      biventricular (BiV) pacing on LV hemodynamics in CRT patients. It is hypothesized that the
      effect of simultaneous BiV pacing utilizing multisite LV pacing on LV hemodynamics will be
      superior to conventional BiV pacing.
