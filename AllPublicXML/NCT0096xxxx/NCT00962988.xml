      Research Aims

      The aims of this research study are to determine whether cost-free smoking cessation
      pharmacotherapy:

        1. Helps smokers with Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or stroke to quit smoking over the
           long-term, compared to simply providing a prescription for these medications;

        2. Is a more cost-effective alternative to providing a prescription only for these
           medications in this high risk population.

      Hypotheses to be Tested

      The hypotheses to be tested include the following:

        1. The CO-validated continuous abstinence rate at weeks 26 and 52 following a target quit
           date will be at least 10% higher for the cost-free smoking cessation pharmacotherapy
           intervention group compared to the prescription only usual care group;

        2. Cost-free smoking cessation pharmacotherapy will have a greater cost-effectiveness
           (i.e., cost/quit) than providing a prescription only.

  <detailed_description>

      Smokers with Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or stroke attending a Stroke Prevention Clinic
      and willing to quit smoking will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either a prescription only
      (PO) usual care group or a cost-free (CF) pharmacotherapy experimental group. Participants
      assigned to the prescription only usual care group will be asked to have their prescription
      for smoking cessation pharmacotherapy filled at their own cost at their local community
      pharmacy. Participants assigned to the cost-free pharmacotherapy group will be provided with
      a 12-week supply of NRT, or a 12-week supply of bupropion or varenicline. The pharmacotherapy
      will be provided by the research nurse to the patient immediately. All participants will
      receive identical advice regarding smoking from the attending neurologist, nurse counseling
      for smoking cessation, and follow-up tracking and telephone-based support for up to 26 weeks
      after the target quit date. Non-treatment follow-up will continue to week 52 after the target
      quit date.

    <description>Participants assigned to the cost-free pharmacotherapy group will be provided with a 12-week supply of NRT, or a 12-week supply of bupropion or varenicline.
Patients smoking 10 cigarettes or less will be prescribed 7mg/24hours for 12 weeks. Those who smoke 11- 20 cigarettes per day will be prescribed 14 mg/24 hours for 8 weeks and then nicotine patch 7mg for 4 weeks. Those smoking â‰¥ 20 cigarettes per day will be prescribed 21 mg/daily for 6 weeks and then nicotine patch 14mg/daily for 4 weeks and then nicotine patch 7 mg/daily for 2 weeks.
For patients who are prescribed varenicline, they will start the medication 8 days before the quit date using the following regime: Days 1-3: 0.5mg once/day; Days 4-7: 0.5 mg BID; Day 8-12 weeks 1.0 mg twice daily.
For patients who are prescribed bupropion, they will start the medication 8 days before the quit date using the following regime: Days 1-3: 150 mg daily (in the morning); Day 4-30: 150 mg BID for 3 months.</description>
