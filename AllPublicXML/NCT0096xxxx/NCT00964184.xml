    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV study of 3.5 years duration to evaluate the phenotypic and genetic
      correlates of diabetes (non-Type 1 in young non-obese Asian Indians in North India and pilot
      case control study to evaluate the efficacy of sitagliptin (DPP-4 inhibitor) in a sub-group
      of the study population.

      A phase IV on T2DM with BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2 and age 14-40 years.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To investigate phenotype (body composition, anthropometry, pancreatic imaging and
           endocrine function, insulin resistance, autoantibodies, and other biochemical variables)
           and genetic (known mutations and polymorphisms) correlates in young (age 14-40 years)
           diabetic patients (non-type 1).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To study anthropometric and body fat distribution including truncal fat, subcutaneous
           and intra-abdominal fat in non-obese young patients with diabetes (non-type 1).

        -  To study whether insulin secretion, insulin resistance or a combination of both is/are
           the predominant defect(s) in non-obese young diabetics (non-type 1).

        -  To study the prevalence of autoimmunity and/or specific genetic abnormalities in this
           subgroup of diabetics.

        -  To estimate approximate prevalence of diagnostic subcategories based on the sample of
           population, and profile of complications in each category.

        -  To propose rational use of specialized investigations (e.g. GAD65, HNF-1α mutations etc)
           while investigating a newly diagnosed young diabetic.

        -  To determine the rational therapeutic option and prognosis in this sub-population of
           diabetics based on anthropometric, biochemical, and etiological profiles.

        -  Sample size: 205 patients to be enrolled and 120 patients to be enrolled for sub group
           study
