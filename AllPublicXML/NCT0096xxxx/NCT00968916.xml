      Primary objective: To determine the maximum tolerated dose based on the incidence of dose
      limiting toxicity and the maximum administered dose of AVE8062 administered every 3 weeks in
      patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess the overall safety profile of the drug.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of AVE8062 and its active metabolite RPR
           258063.

        -  To evaluate anti-tumor activity of the drug.

      The duration of the study for each patient will include an up to 4-week screening phase,
      21-day study treatment cycles, an end of treatment visit and a follow-up period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Advanced solid tumor that has become refractory to conventional treatment or for which
             no standard therapy exists.

          -  Patients with signed and dated Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved patient
             informed consent form (ICF) prior to enrollment in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status &gt; or = 2.

          -  Life expectancy of less than 12 weeks.

          -  Concurrent treatment with any other anticancer therapy, including chemotherapy,
             immunotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, gene therapy, or patients planning to
             receive these treatments during the study.

          -  Absence of histologically or cytologically proven cancer.

          -  Male patients who do not agree with contraception. Absence of negative serum/urinary
             pregnancy test within the 7 days prior to the enrollment in the study for female
             patients with childbearing potential. Patients must be post-menopausal, surgically
             sterile, or using &quot;effective contraception&quot; (the definition of &quot;effective
             contraception&quot; will be based on the judgment of the investigator).

          -  Washout period of less than 28 days from prior antitumor therapy (chemotherapy,
             targeted agents, immunotherapy and radiotherapy) or any investigational treatment,
             except for nitrosoureas, mitomycin which may not be used up to 42 days prior to the
             first cycle. No washout period is required for hormonal therapy, however, it must be
