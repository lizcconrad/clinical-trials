      loss program.

    <textblock>
      The high prevalence of obesity and its medical consequences make it one of the most important
      public health issues in the United States today. Few interventions have been consistently
      successful at reducing obesity. This trial will test an intervention program that lasts 22
      weeks, with 16 evening sessions and one weekend day. Participants will be randomized to one
      of two arms. Both arms will receive diet and exercise intervention elements. The study aims
      for gradual weight loss, with a calorie target that will maintain ideal body weight, rather
      than a more calorie restricted diet. The exercise component is based around increasing
      walking. The arms will compare methods for producing long-lasting behavior change.
