  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spirometry is a biomedical test to measure lung function in subject who (may) have a chronic
      respiratory condition. Performing the test requires a certain level of training and
      experience from the health care professional who conducts the test, and sufficient
      cooperation of the patient. Although the test is widely used in primary care in many
      countries, the quality of the test performance seems limited and needs improvement in order
      to avoid false-positive and false-negative test interpretations. In this study, the
      researchers investigated whether a combination of e-learning and bimonthly written
      performance feedback to family practice nurses and assistance regarding their spirometry
      tests improves the rate of adequate tests.
