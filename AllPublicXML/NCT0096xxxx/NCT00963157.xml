  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how the body reacts to different strengths of the H1N1
      flu shot when it is given with or without an &quot;adjuvant.&quot; An adjuvant is a substance that may
      cause the body to produce more antibodies when it is given with a vaccine. This study will
      also compare how age affects the body's response to the H1N1 flu shot. In this study, 3
      strengths of the H1N1 flu shot will be tested combined with an adjuvant. In addition, 2
      strengths of the H1N1 flu shot will be tested without adjuvant. Two H1N1 flu shots of the
      same strength, with or without adjuvant, will be given about 3 weeks apart. Participants will
      include up to 800 healthy adults, approximately 500 individuals ages 18-64 and 250
      individuals greater than or equal to age 65. Study procedures include: physical exam, blood
      samples, completing a memory aid to record vaccine side effects, medications and daily oral
      temperature. Participants will be involved in study related procedures for up to 13 months.

    <textblock>
      Recently, a novel swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus was identified as a significant cause
      of febrile respiratory illnesses in Mexico and the United States. It rapidly spread to many
      countries around the world, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic on
      June 11, 2009. Data from several cohorts in different age groups that received licensed
      trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines suggest that these vaccines are unlikely to provide
      protection against the new virus. Adults are more likely to have measurable levels of serum
      hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) or neutralizing antibody than are children. These
      data indicate the need to develop vaccines against the new H1N1 strain and suggest that
      different vaccine strategies (e.g., number of doses, need for adjuvant) may be appropriate
      for persons in different age groups. This protocol will explore antibody responses following
      vaccination with an inactivated influenza H1N1 virus vaccine at 3 different dose levels
      combined with AS03 adjuvant and at 2 different dose levels administered without adjuvant.
      This study will assess the immune response following a single dose of vaccine with or without
      AS03 adjuvant, to assess whether individuals have any pre-existing 'prime' immunity, such
      that the initial H1N1 vaccination serves as a boost, thus conferring a more rapid time to
      protection with the need for fewer doses. Antibody responses will be assessed at 8 days after
      each dose to evaluate the development of an anamnestic response. In addition, antibody
      responses will be assessed 21 days after each dose. The primary objectives are: safety, to
      assess the safety of inactivated H1N1 vaccine when administered at the 3.75 micrograms (mcg),
      7.5 mcg, or 15 mcg dose combined with AS03 adjuvant and at the 7.5 mcg or 15 mcg dose
      administered without adjuvant; and immunogenicity, to assess the antibody response at Day 21
      following a single dose of inactivated H1N1 vaccine when administered at 3.75 mcg, 7.5 mcg,
      or 15 mcg dose combined with AS03 adjuvant and at the 7.5 mcg or 15 mcg dose administered
      without adjuvant, stratified by age of recipient. The secondary objective is immunogenicity,
      to assess the antibody response following 2 doses of inactivated H1N1 vaccine when
      administered at the 3.75 mcg, 7.5 mcg, or 15 mcg dose combined with AS03 adjuvant and at the
      7.5 mcg or 15 mcg dose administered without adjuvant, stratified by age of recipient.
      Participants will include up to 800 healthy adults who have no history of novel influenza
      H1N1 2009 infection or novel influenza H1N1 2009 vaccination. This is a randomized,
      double-blinded, Phase II study. Subjects will be randomized into 5 groups, stratified by age
      (150 subjects per dose group with 100 subjects in the 18-64 years of age stratum and 50
      subjects in the greater than or equal to 65 years of age stratum), to receive intramuscular
      inactivated influenza H1N1 vaccine at 3.75 mcg, 7.5 mcg, or 15 mcg combined with AS03
      adjuvant (Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively) or at 7.5 mcg or 15 mcg without adjuvant (Groups
      4 and 5, respectively). The vaccine, with and without adjuvant, will be administered at Day 0
      and Day 21. Following immunization, safety will be measured by assessment of adverse events
      (AEs) through 21 days following the last vaccination (Day 42 for those receiving both doses
      and Day 21 for those who do not receive the second dose), serious adverse events (SAEs) and
      new-onset chronic medical conditions through 12 months post final vaccination (Day 365 after
      second vaccination), and reactogenicity to vaccine for 8 days (Day 0-7) following each
      vaccination. Immunogenicity testing will include HAI and neutralizing antibody.

             within acceptable limits in the last 6 months. Any change that is due to change of
             health care provider, insurance company etc, or that is done for financial reasons, as
             long as in the same class of medication will not be considered a violation of this
             inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a
             disease outcome will not be considered a violation of this inclusion criterion.

             preceding 6 months. (Nasal and topical steroids are allowed.)

          6. Have a diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disease, or other major psychiatric
             diagnosis.

          7. Have been hospitalized for psychiatric illness, history of suicide attempt, or

             virus vaccines.

         14. Have an acute illness, including an oral temperature greater than 100.4 degrees
             Fahrenheit, within 3 days prior to vaccination.

         15. Have any condition that would, in the opinion of the site investigator, place them at
             an unacceptable risk of injury or render them unable to meet the requirements of the
             protocol.

         16. Participated in a novel influenza H1N1 2009 vaccine study in the past 2 years or have
             a history of novel influenza H1N1 2009 infection prior to enrollment.

          <description>Blood was collected from all participants 270 days after second vaccination for testing in the HAI assay with Influenza H1N1 2009 virus as the assay antigen. Each sample was tested at least twice according to standard operating procedures and the result of each replicate reported. A participant is counted if the geometric mean of the replicate values was 1:40 or greater.</description>
          <population>Participants who received both H1N1 vaccinations and from whom blood was collected within 14 days of window are included. Two participants were excluded due to eligibility deviations, one due to receipt of the wrong second dose, and two due to receipt of off-study vaccines. Analyses are as treated.
