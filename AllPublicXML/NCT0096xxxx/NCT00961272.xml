      The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir in
      cervicovaginal fluids as compared to blood plasma of HIV-infected pre-menopausal women.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants: Six HIV-positive pre-menopausal women already undergoing therapy with
      raltegravir.

      Procedures (methods): This study will be conducted at a single site: the University of North
      Carolina at Chapel Hill. An outpatient screening visit will assess subject suitability and
      willingness to participate. During one pharmacokinetic visit women will be asked to
      self-collect cervicovaginal samples using a cervicovaginal fluid aspirator at the following
      time points: pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after raltegravir 400mg dose
      administration. One 3mL EDTA tube will be collected at the same time points to analyze blood
      plasma. A follow-up safety visit will be completed within 30 days of the inpatient stay.

        Six HIV-infected adult pre-menopausal women (&gt; or equal to 18 and less than or equal to 49
        years of age) currently undergoing treatment with raltegravir with an intact uterus and
        cervix will be considered for enrollment. Pregnant women and women testing positive for
        STDs (bacterial vaginosis, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomonas) will be
        excluded. The six HIV-infected women enrolled in this study will come from the UNC-Chapel
        Hill Infectious Diseases Clinic and associated clinics in local Health Departments.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection documented by HIV serology or detectable viral load

          -  Able to provide informed consent

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, able to comply with their treatment regimen and
             study procedures

          -  Currently receiving raltegravir as treatment for HIV infection. Subjects must have
             been on raltegravir for at least 3 weeks prior to the inpatient pharmacokinetic
             sampling stay.

          -  All women of reproductive potential (who have not reached menopause or undergone
             bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) must have a negative serum Î²-HCG pregnancy
             test performed at screening.

          -  Subjects must test negative for sexually transmitted infections (gonorrhea, chlamydia,
             trichomonas, bacterial vaginosis, or syphilis) at screening

          -  All study volunteers must agree not to participate in a conception process (e.g.,
             active attempt to become pregnant).

          -  Subjects must be willing to abstain from intercourse, and vaginal instrumentation,
             including douching, within the 48 hours prior to all study visits.

          -  If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy between study visits,
             the female study volunteer/male partner must use at least one reliable method of
             contraception (e.g., condoms, with or without a spermicidal agent; a diaphragm or
             cervical cap with spermicide; an IUD)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Breastfeeding

          -  Any condition which in the opinion of the investigator is likely to interfere with
             follow-up or ability to take the study medication appropriately

          -  A positive test for bacterial vaginosis, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, or
             trichomonas
