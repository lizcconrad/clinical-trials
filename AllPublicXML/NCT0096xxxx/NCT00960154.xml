  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to quantify the difference in thermal injury depth at
      the surgical margin in breast lumpectomy specimens excised with the PlasmaBlade; to
      subjectively assess histopathologic sample quality metrics; to examine the role that
      electrosurgical artifact may play in revision lumpectomy procedures; and to compare these
      endpoints to the standard of care (SOC) technology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lumpectomy is a surgical procedure performed to remove a localized mass of breast tissue that
      is suspicious for malignancy. The purpose of lumpectomy is to minimize the amount of tissue
      removed from the breast to retain normal breast architecture while simultaneously removing
      all of the suspected cancerous tissue. Typically, a scalpel is used for the skin incision and
      a traditional electrosurgical device is used to cut away any cancerous tissue.

      The PEAK PlasmaBlade™ uses pulsed radiofrequency (RF) energy and a highly-insulated handpiece
      design to enable precision cutting and coagulation at the point of application. The
      PlasmaBlade has received FDA clearance for use in plastic, general, and ear, nose, and throat
      (ENT) surgery, and has demonstrated a significantly reduced thermal injury profile in incised
      tissue compared to traditional electrosurgical devices. It is hypothesized that this benefit
      may improve the pathological analysis of excised breast lumps.

      This single site study was granted Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and conducted
      between June 2009 and January 2011. Potential subjects were screened against the inclusion
      and exclusion criteria of the study protocol and were then required to provide informed
      consent prior to enrollment. Following enrollment, subjects were prospectively randomized to
      the SOC or PEAK PlasmaBlade study groups and scheduled for lumpectomy.

    <limitations_and_caveats>Upon Medtronic's acquisition of PEAK surgical, a study integrity audit was undertaken. Results of the audit showed that patient's rights and safety were maintained, but the source data, including baseline demographics, were unverifiable.</limitations_and_caveats>
