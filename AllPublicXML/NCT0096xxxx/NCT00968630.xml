    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the immune response after stem cell transplant in human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients with hematologic cancer (blood cancer).
      Studying samples of blood from HIV-positive patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in the immune system after stem cell transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine the development of donor-derived HIV-1-specific immune response following
      hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) for treatment of hematologic malignancy in HIV+ patients.

      II. Examine the affect of HCT on the pool of latently infected cluster of differentiation
      (CD)4+ T cells in HIV+ patients given HCT for treatment of hematologic malignancy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo leukapheresis for analysis of HIV-1 latent reservoir at baseline and at days
      +90, +180, +365, and +730, and then annually thereafter as feasible.
