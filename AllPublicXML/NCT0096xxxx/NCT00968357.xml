  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SCV-07 (Î³-D-glutamyl-L-tryptophan) is a new immunomodulatory compound that has been developed
      and patented both for composition and immunomodulatory use and is a synthetic dipeptide. The
      efficacy of SCV 07 in treating chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is expected to arise
      from the drug's ability to stimulate the T-helper 1 (Th1) type immune response and to block
      signal transducers and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) mediated signaling. The purpose
      of this study is to determine if SCV-07 alone and/or SCV-07 in combination with ribavirin is
      safe and potentially effective for the treatment of genotype 1 compensated chronic hepatitis
      C in subjects who have relapsed after a response to a previous treatment course of at least
      44 weeks with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. All subjects will receive 4 weeks of SCV-07
      (Lead-in Phase), followed by 4 weeks of treatment with SCV-07 in combination with ribavirin
      (Combination Treatment).

    <description>SCV-07 dosage will remain the same throughout the study for each cohort. Monotherapy Lead-in Phase Treatment (SCV-07) for 4 weeks. Combination Treatment (SCV-07 and ribavirin) for 4 weeks, following &quot;Lead-in Phase&quot;. Re-treatment with peg INF and RBV will be offered in the &quot;Follow-up&quot; to patients who in the opinion of the investigator may benefit from treatment. All patients will have a total of 3 follow-up visits for safety assessments. Women of childbearing potential will be followed up monthly for approximately up to 6 months after the &quot;end of treatment&quot; visit. If pregnancy occurs within the follow-up period, it needs to be followed through 8 weeks after the end of pregnancy.</description>
