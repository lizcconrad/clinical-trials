      The purpose of this study is to see how the body reacts to different strengths of the H1N1
      flu shot when it is given with or without an &quot;adjuvant.&quot; An adjuvant is a substance that may
      cause the body to produce more antibodies when it is given with a vaccine. This study will
      also compare how age affects the body's response to the H1N1 flu shot. In this study, 3
      strengths of the H1N1 flu shot will be tested combined with an adjuvant. In addition, 2
      strengths of the H1N1 flu shot will be tested without adjuvant. Two H1N1 flu shots of the
      same strength, with or without adjuvant, will be given about 3 weeks apart. Participants will
      include up to 800 healthy adults, approximately 500 individuals ages 18-64 and 250
      individuals greater than or equal to age 65. Study procedures include: physical exam, blood
      samples, completing a memory aid to record vaccine side effects, medications and daily oral
      temperature. Participants will be involved in study related procedures for up to 13 months.

      Recently, a novel swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus was identified as a significant cause
      of febrile respiratory illnesses in Mexico and the United States. It rapidly spread prompting
      the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic. Data from several cohorts in different
      age groups that received licensed trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines suggest that these
      vaccines are unlikely to provide protection against the new virus. These data indicate the
      need to develop vaccines against the new H1N1 strain and suggest that different vaccine
      strategies (e.g., number of doses, need for adjuvant) may be appropriate for persons in
      different age groups. Based on clinical data from the clinical trials with vaccines
      containing novel influenza A antigens, a higher dosage, or multiple doses of a novel antigen
      may be necessary to generate potentially protective antibody responses. Alternatively,
      inactivated influenza H1N1 vaccines administered with adjuvants, such as AS03, may confer
      protection to a maximal number of vaccine recipients. This protocol will explore antibody
      responses following vaccination with an inactivated influenza H1N1 virus vaccine at 3
      different dose levels combined with AS03 adjuvant and at 2 different dose levels administered
      without adjuvant. This study will assess the immune response following a single dose of
      vaccine with or without AS03 adjuvant, to assess whether individuals have any pre-existing
      'prime' immunity, such that the initial H1N1 vaccination serves as a boost, thus conferring a
      more rapid time to protection with the need for fewer doses. Antibody responses will be
      assessed 8 days after each dose to evaluate the development of an anamnestic response. In
      addition, antibody responses will be assessed 21 days after each dose. The primary objectives
      are: safety, to assess the safety of inactivated H1N1 vaccine when administered at 3.75, 7.5
      or 15 mcg combined with AS03 adjuvant and at 7.5 or 15 mcg administered without adjuvant; and
      immunogenicity, to assess the antibody response at Day 21 following a single dose of
      inactivated H1N1 vaccine when administered at 3.75, 7.5 or 15 mcg combined with AS03 adjuvant
      and at 7.5 or 15 mcg administered without adjuvant, stratified by age of recipient. The
      secondary objective is immunogenicity, to assess the antibody response following 2 doses of
      inactivated H1N1 vaccine when administered at 3.75, 7.5 or 15 mcg combined with AS03 adjuvant
      and at 7.5 or 15 mcg administered without adjuvant, stratified by age of recipient.
      Participants will include up to 800 healthy adults who have no history of novel influenza
      H1N1 2009 infection or novel influenza H1N1 2009 vaccination. This is a randomized,
      double-blinded, Phase II study. Subjects will be randomized into 5 groups, stratified by age
      (150 subjects per dose group with 100 subjects in the 18-64 years of age stratum and 50
      subjects in the greater than or equal to 65 years of age stratum), to receive intramuscular
      inactivated influenza H1N1 vaccine at 3.75, 7.5 or 15 mcg combined with AS03 adjuvant (Groups
      1, 2, and 3, respectively) or at 7.5 or 15 mcg without adjuvant (Groups 4 and 5,
      respectively). The vaccine, with and without adjuvant, will be administered at Days 0 and 21.
      Following immunization, safety will be measured by assessment of adverse events (AEs) through
      21 days following the last vaccination (Day 42 for those receiving both doses and Day 21 for
      those who do not receive the second dose), serious adverse events (SAEs) and new-onset
      chronic medical conditions through 12 months post final vaccination (Day 365 after second
      vaccination), and reactogenicity to the vaccine for 8 days following each vaccination (Day
      0-7). Immunogenicity testing will include hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) and
      neutralizing antibody testing on serum obtained prior to each vaccination, 8-10 days after
      each vaccination, 21 days (Day 42), 6 months (Day 201) and 12 months (Day 386) following the
      second vaccination.
