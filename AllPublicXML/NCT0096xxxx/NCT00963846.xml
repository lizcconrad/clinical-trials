      Huperzine is a natural plant product with procognitive properties in patients with
      Alzheimer's disease. Cognitive difficulties hamper functioning in schizophrenia as well. The
      present study will investigate whether huperzine improves cognition and functioning in
      patients with schizophrenia.

          6. Has been receiving current doses of psychotropic medication (s) for at least 4 weeks.

          7. Has been clinically stable for at least 12 weeks.

          8. No more than moderate severity (4 on the 1-7 scale) on any PANSS positive item.

          9. No more than 15 on the total of PANSS negative symptom items.

         10. Simpson-Angus Scale total score &lt;7.

         11. Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia total score &lt;11.

         12. Submaximal performance on at least one of the following MATRICS components
             (letter-number span &lt;20 OR HVLT total &lt;31 OR CPT d-prime &lt; 3.47).

         13. Score &gt; 1 SD below age-, gender-, and education-adjusted normal control mean on
             MATRICS composite

             studies.

         15. Fluent in English.
