      RATIONALE: Efavirenz may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well efavirenz works in treating patients with
      metastatic prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the effect of efavirenz on the non-PSA progression rate at 3 months in
           patients with castration-refractory metastatic prostate cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the effect of efavirenz on the PSA response at 3 months.

        -  To assess the effect of efavirenz on overall survival.

        -  To assess the effect of efavirenz on PSA progression-free survival.

        -  To assess the effect of efavirenz on symptomatic progression-free survival.

        -  To assess the tolerability and safety profile of efavirenz.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral efavirenz once daily in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
