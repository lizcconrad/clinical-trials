  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label expanded access trial of prGCD in patients with Gaucher disease who
      require enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and who have been treated with imiglucerase but for
      whom the dose has been reduced or discontinued due to shortage of the product.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gaucher disease, the most prevalent lysosomal storage disorder, is caused by mutations in the
      human glucocerebrosidase gene (GCD), which have been mapped to chromosome 1 q21-q31, leading
      to reduced activity of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase and thereby to the
      accumulation of substrate glucocerebroside (GlcCer) in the cells of the monocyte-macrophage
      system. This accumulation leads to the visceral manifestations of hepatosplenomegaly, anemia
      and thrombocytopenia, as well as to the skeletal features and less frequently also to lung
      involvement.

      prGCD is a plant cell expressed recombinant glucocerebrosidase enzyme for the treatment of
      Gaucher disease. Expression of proteins in plant cell culture is highly efficient, does not
      require post-expression modification of the protein, and is not susceptible to contamination
      by agents such as viruses that are pathological to humans.

      prGCD safety will be observed in this treatment protocol of patients with non-neuronopathic
      Gaucher disease who require enzyme replacement therapy. Eligible patients will receive
      intravenous (IV) infusions of prGCD every two weeks. The dose of prGCD will be equal to each
      patient's previous imiglucerase dose before reduction or discontinuation due to shortage. The
      infusions will be administered at the selected medical center.
