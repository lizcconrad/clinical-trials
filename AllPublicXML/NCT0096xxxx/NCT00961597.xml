  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to determine the clinical outcome of repair of meniscus
      tears located in the &quot;red/white&quot; region using a well-known suture technique combined, when
      indicated, with platelet-rich plasma to enhance healing. The outcome of this operation will
      be determined in a consecutive group of patients with an established, rigorous knee rating
      system a minimum of 2 years postoperatively. Results will be determined by the analysis of
      subjective and functional factors, sports and occupational activity levels, a comprehensive
      physical examination, and a radiographic evaluation using standard plain x-rays and magnetic
      resonance imaging. The investigators hypothesize that meniscus repairs will significantly
      reduce tibiofemoral compartment pain and allow for increased knee function and activity
      levels. The platelet rich plasma adjunct will be used in complex meniscus tears in which a
      portion of the tear extends into the avascular region classified as either longitudinal,
      horizontal, or radial. The investigators hypothesize that the healing rate of these repairs
      will be superior to those previously reported in clinical studies in patients who had the
      suture repair technique alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are many published clinical studies of complex meniscus tears in the red/white region
      with success rates that vary from 57% to 100%. Meniscus repairs that fail in this region
      usually require subsequent removal, which essentially results in loss of the majority of
      meniscal function and risk of future disabling osteoarthritis. This study will determine if
      the addition of platelet rich plasma increases the success rate of complex meniscus repairs
      of longitudinal, horizontal, or radial tears in the red-white region. The investigators have
      over two decades of experience with clinical studies of meniscus repairs in patients whose
      age ranged from 9 to 58 years. Those investigations revealed an average success rate in terms
      of retention of meniscus tissue of 80%. However, meniscus tears classified as horizontal,
      radial, double longitudinal, and complex multiplanar had success rates of 71-73% which
      prompted the need for an adjunct therapeutic measure, such as platelet rich plasma, to
      increase the healing potential in these cases.
