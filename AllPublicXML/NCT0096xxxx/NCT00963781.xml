    <textblock>
      Despite the benefit of drug-eluting stents (DES) to reduce the need for repeat
      revascularization procedures, concerns regarding late stent thrombosis (ST) have led to
      recent guidelines advocating extended prescription of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with
      aspirin and a thienopyridine (clopidogrel or ticlopidine]) beyond that described in the
      product labeling. Specifically, an advisory has recommended at least 1 year DAPT following
      treatment with DES in patients without contraindications. However, this recommendation was
      largely empiric and not based on any trial showing reductions in ST with long-term DAPT, nor
      are potential safety differences between DES considered. Further, no study has examined the
      balance in potential efficacy with long-term DAPT relative to an increased bleeding risk.

      A consistency across clinical trials involving the Endeavor DES has been very low rates of
      late myocardial infarction, cardiac death and ST. Unlike other DES, recent studies indicate
      that the Endeavor stent may permit more rapid and complete healing over stent struts in
      addition to restoring normal blood vessel function. Further, in patients treated with the
      Endeavor stent, long-term safety outcomes are similar through 3 years follow-up irrespective
      of whether patients were adherent to DAPT for durations of ≤ 6 months, 12 months or 24
      months.

      In this study, long-term safety and effectiveness will be examined for patients treated with
      the Endeavor stent and assigned to DAPT for reduced duration of 6 months. If the study
      demonstrates safety and efficacy, it could influence treatment guidelines in favor of an
      abbreviated duration of DAPT for patients treated with the Endeavor stent. This would mean
      that should a bleeding complication or need or surgery arise less than 12 months post-PCI,
      patients treated with the Endeavor stent could stop DAPT after 6 months with reasonable
      estimate of safety. Furthermore, it is possible that patients who are currently denied DES
      due to known need for elective surgery could be treated with the Endeavor stent in cases
      where surgery can be temporarily delayed. Finally, it could be an additional option for
      patients who forgo treatment with DES in favor of bare metal stent (BMS) out of fear of
      possible bleeding with long-term DAPT.

      Finally, it is recognized that not all patients respond the same way to anti-platelet
      therapy. Recent studies have indicated that inherited genetic variations in the way the body
      metabolizes anti-platelet medications may be important determinants of responsiveness to
      thienopyridine therapy, and that such differences may also confer a higher likelihood of
      adverse outcome. Patients agreeing to the additional genetic sub-study will have a DNA sample
      taken at baseline to test for the presence of such genes related to antiplatelet therapy
      metabolism and effectiveness. The results of these tests could help the medical community to
      better understand individual variation in response to anti-platelet therapy and the role that
      genetics may play in determining the response. It is possible that the information gained
      could help physicians tailor DAPT on a patient by patient basis.

    <description>The study population was to consist of 900 consecutive, eligible patients with ischemic heart disease scheduled to undergo elective percutaneous coronary revascularization and amenable to treatment with an Endeavor drug-eluting stent with reference vessel diameter between 2.5 and 4.0 mm. Patients will be assigned to 6 month duration of post-procedure thienopyridine treatment with indefinite aspirin (minimum 81 mg daily) according to protocol. Recruitment was terminated early due to difficulty recruiting patients and difficulty achieving patient compliance with the six month anti-platelet protocol.</description>
