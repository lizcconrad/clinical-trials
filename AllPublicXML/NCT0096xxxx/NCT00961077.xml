  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stomach cancer is the most common malignant disease and the second most common cause of
      cancer-related deaths in the Korea. The elderly are primarily affected by the disease with
      most gastric cancer-related deaths occuring in patients aged 65 years or older. Systemic
      chemotherapy improves the quantity and quality of life in patients with gastric cancer when
      compared with best supportive care. However, elderly cancer patients often present with
      concomitant co-morbidities and age-associated physiologic problems that make the selection of
      optimal treatment difficult. There is also uncertainty about the use of systemic palliative
      chemotherapy in elderly patients because of under representation of this age group in
      clinical trials. Therefore, this phase II trial was planned to investigate efficacy and
      toxicities of combination chemotherapy with attenuated dose of S-1 and oxaliplatin
      (attenuated SOX)in patients with elderly AGC

      Each cycle is repeated every 3 weeks

      Response evaluation will be performed every 2 cycles

      Repeated cycles of treatment will be given for this study unless there is confirmed disease
