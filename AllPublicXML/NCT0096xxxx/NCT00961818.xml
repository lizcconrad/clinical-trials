      The objective of this clinical and experimental study was to verify the immediate effect of
      vocal techniques: vibration, nasal sound and articulation in women without vocal complaints.

      Vocal techniques have been used, but few studies had as their aim to effectively verify its
      use and effect produced in voice and the larynx. The objective of this clinical and
      experimental study was to verify the immediate effect of vocal techniques: vibration, nasal
      sound and articulation. Material and method: 32 female subjects with normal to mild dysphonia
      participated in the research, with ages from 20 to 45 years. All subjects were submitted to
      realization of vocal techniques of vibration of the lips, articulation and nasal sounds for
      twenty minutes. The subjects were submitted to record the voice and laryngostroboscopic exams
      for perceptual analysis and laryngostroboscopic exams before and after the use of vocal
      techniques.
