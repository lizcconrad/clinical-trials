      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of CS-1008 in combination with
      irinotecan compared to irinotecan alone on Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in subjects with
      metastatic or advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) who have failed oxaliplatin-based first-line
      treatment.
