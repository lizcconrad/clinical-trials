    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic
      properties of an oral solution and enteric-coated tablet (ECT) formulations of MLN8237 in
      patients with advanced solid tumors. This study will be conducted in 3 parts, A, B, and C.

    <description>Prior to initiation of Part A, an accelerated dose escalation cohort will be evaluated. The first cohort will be administered a single 15-mg dose of the oral solution administered on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Once the safety and tolerability of study drug is established in this cohort, Part A will commence as described below.
Part A: patients will receive either a single 25 mg dose of MLN8237 (oral solution) or a 50 mg powder in capsule (PIC) dose of MLN8237 on Day 1 of Cycle 1, followed by administration of a single dose of the respective alternate formulation on Day 1 of Cycle 2. Dosing at 50 mg twice a day of the PIC formulation for 7 days (Days 3-9) will then be resumed after the single-dose administration of the oral solution or PIC for both Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 followed by a 14 day rest period. Beginning with Cycle 3, MLN8237 will be administered at 50 mg PIC twice a day for 7 days followed by a 14 day rest period in 21-day cycles.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive a single dose of MLN8237 (oral solution) with or without a standard high fat breakfast on Day 1 of Cycle 1, followed by administration under the respective alternate food intake condition (fasted to fed, or fed to fasted; N = 7 per sequence) on Day 1 in Cycle 2. The dose of MLN8237 (oral solution) to be administered in this food effect assessment will be determined from the relative bioavailability estimate in Part A. Dosing at X mg twice/day MLN8237 (oral solution) for 7 days will be resumed after the single dose administration of the oral solution for both Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 followed by a 14-day rest period. Beginning with Cycle 3, MLN8237 will be administered at the 50 mg twice/day PIC formulation with 7 days of dosing followed by a 14 day rest period in 21-day cycles.</description>

Dosing at 40 mg twice/day MLN8237 ECT for 7 days will be resumed after the single dose administration of ECT for Cycle 1, followed by a 14-day rest period. In Cycle 2, MLN8237 ECT will be administered as a single dose of 50 mg on Day 1, followed by either 40 or 50 mg twice/day for Day 3 through the morning dose of Day 9 and followed by a 14-day rest period. Beginning with Cycle 3, MLN8237 ECT will be administered twice a day for 7 days followed by a 14 day rest period in 21-day cycles.</description>
