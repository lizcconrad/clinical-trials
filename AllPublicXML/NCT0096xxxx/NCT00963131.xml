  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is the serous neurosensory detachment that usually
      involves the macular area. It is common in patients between 30-50 years old and effects male
      more often than female with the ratio of 5-10. The common risk factors are psychologic
      stress, type A personality, systemic steroid use, hypertension and pregnancy. The treatment
      is usually observation especially in the first three-months. The laser or photodynamic
      therapy should be considered when the condition does not improve after that time.
      Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of CSC is still not well understood but the study from
      indocyanine green angiography showed the choroidal vascular hyperpermeability and abnormal
      leakage. The causes of this abnormality are supposed to be from nitric oxide, prostaglandins
      or even free oxidative radicals. From this hypothesis, the oxidative process might be
      involved in the pathogenesis of the disease especially in the early stage. This study is to
      determine the effect of antioxidants drugs in the acute stage of CSC and to determine whether
      they can improve the outcomes of the disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. patients with acute central serous chorioretinopathy within 6 weeks of onset

          2. age between 30-50 years

          3. new or recurrent attack (the symptom-free period should longer than 6 months)

          4. fluorescein angiography (FA) confirmed the diagnosis with the inkblot or smoke-stack
             leakage and the optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed definite subretinal fluid

          5. patients' ability for proper follow up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. chronic central serous chorioretinopathy(longer than 6 weeks)

          2. complicated central serous chorioretinopathy such as secondary choroidal
             neovascularization (CNV) that detected from FA

          3. pregnancy, steroid user and patients that contraindicated for high dose antioxidants
             therapy such as heavy smokers, lung cancer, thyrotoxicosis, renal stone and anemia
             (hematocrit less than 30%).
