    <textblock>
      Poor adherence to appropriate asthma medications is an important risk factor contributing to
      high asthma morbidity and mortality in urban African American adolescents. As part of the
      ADEPT (Adolescent Disease Empowerment and Persistency Technology) for Asthma Pilot 2 study, a
      focus group was developed specifically to explore existing barriers to adherence among inner
      city African American adolescent asthmatics.
