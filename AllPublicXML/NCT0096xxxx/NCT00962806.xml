  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and type 2 diabetes are occurring at epidemic rates in the United States and
      worldwide. The global burden of diabetes is estimated to double over the next 25 years. Obese
      children are at risk for the development of insulin resistance, relative insulin deficiency
      and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The prevention of type 2 DM is hindered by the lack of a
      non-invasive predictive test, knowledge as to individual risk and effective preventative
      measures. There is increasing evidence that alterations in mitochondria contribute to the
      development of diabetes in humans. Therefore, it is important to explore mitochondrial
      dysfunction as a potential predictor of diabetes in children and a potential target for
      prevention. The aims of the proposed protocol are to determine whether an intensive exercise
      intervention can improve mitochondrial function in children identified as having
      mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance. The use of a non-invasive imaging technique
      will allow for a functional in vivo assessment of mitochondrial activity. The investigators
      propose the investigation of an intensive exercise protocol designed to improve mitochondrial
      function in children who are insulin resistant and have documented mitochondrial dysfunction
      by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The study is designed to investigate the plasticity of
      abnormal mitochondrial function in high risk children. In summary, the proposed projects will
      investigate mitochondrial function as a non-invasive predictive marker for the development of
      insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and attempt to modify
      mitochondrial function with an intensive exercise intervention. The study of mitochondrial
      dysfunction in children may both identify those at risk for disease and provide a molecular
      therapeutic target for prevention and treatment.

      The investigators hypothesize that children with insulin resistance and mitochondrial
      dysfunction who are randomized to intensive exercise versus standard lifestyle advice will
      show improvement in mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity.
