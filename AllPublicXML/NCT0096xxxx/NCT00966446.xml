      The overall goal of this project is to elucidate the epidemiology of MRSA transmission in the
      community and test an intervention to prevent MRSA transmission in this setting.

      The overall goals of this project are to:

        1. to investigate the determinants of and evaluate potential interventions to reduce the
           spread of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in community
           settings in order to reduce the burden of this illness in the State of Pennsylvania.
           This objective has the following specific aims:

             -  to identify host, microbiological and environmental risk factors for prolonged MRSA
                colonization, MRSA transmission and clinical MRSA infection among patients with
                MRSA skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) and their household contacts and to
                use stochastic agent-based modeling methods to quantify secondary spread of CO-MRSA
                in households.

             -  to evaluate the impact of a decolonization intervention on MRSA infections in the
                household.

             -  to identify immunological mechanisms underlying the ability of Streptococcus
                pneumoniae colonization to inhibit MRSA colonization, transmission and infection in
                order to identify potential future immunological targets for interventions.

        2. to foster multi-disciplinary and cross-institutional collaborations and develop the
           infrastructure for a Center of Excellence focused on antimicrobial drug resistance
           research, with the capacity for activities linking basic science, epidemiological and
           clinical intervention studies

        3. to enhance opportunities for basic and clinical research training for undergraduate and
           graduate students, particularly from underrepresented minorities, in order to increase
           the pipeline of future biomedical scientists and clinical investigators

          <description>This group was randomized to the following decolonization protocol: 1) 2% mupirocin ointment applied inside both nares twice daily for seven days 2) a 4% chlorhexidine gluconate (Hibiclens, Mo¨lnlycke Health Care, Norcross, Georgia) body wash, including entire skin surface, excluding face and hair, with particular attention to axillae, inguinal region, and perirectal areas, performed on both the first and the last day of mupirocin use. Subjects were asked to record performance of each step of the decolonization protocol in a journal, which was returned at the end of the period of medication use, along with any unused portion of the mupirocin and chlorhexidine gluconate body wash containers. The subjects randomized to unsupervised decolonization were instructed on the decolonization protocol during the initial interview, along with the educational instruction as described in the &quot;no intervention&quot; group.</description>

The intervention includes applying Mupirocin ointment twice daily for the first 7 days of study enrollment as well as using Hibliclens body wash twice total (on day 1 and day 7 of study enrollment) according to the instructions provided.
Unsupervised Decolonization: Households will undergo decolonization for MRSA with Mupirocin nasal ointment and Hibiclens body wash. This means that the intervention includes applying Mupirocin ointment twice daily in each nostril for the first 7 days of study enrollment as well as using Hibliclens body wash twice total (on day 1 and day 7 of study enrollment) according to the instructions provided. Households are given detailed, written instructions and are asked to fill out logs tracking compliance for each household member.</description>
