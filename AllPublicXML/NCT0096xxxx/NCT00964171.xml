      RATIONALE: Efavirenz may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well efavirenz works as second-line therapy in
      treating patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of efavirenz as second-line monotherapy, in terms of
           non-morphological progression at 2 months, in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of
           the pancreas.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate non-morphological progression in these patients at 4 months.

        -  Evaluate non-biological progression in these patients at 2 and 4 months.

        -  Evaluate the quality of life of these patients at 2 and 4 months.

        -  Evaluate the overall, progression-free, and event-free survival of these patients.

        -  Evaluate the tolerability and safety profile of efavirenz in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral efavirenz once daily in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaires using the QLQ-C30 at baseline and at 2 and 4
      months.

      After completion of study therapy patients are followed up every 2 months.
