             cigarettes smoked during the course of the study.

          -  Having had no febrile or infectious illness for at least seven days prior to the first
             administration of the investigational product.

          -  Women practicing one or a combination of the following methods of birth control:
             hormonal contraceptives, condoms, sponge, foams, jelly, diaphragm, or intrauterine
             device, or women who are surgically sterilized.

          -  Subjects having normal skin without excessive hair growth on tested areas and baseline
             score in skin reaction assessment of &quot;0&quot; on tested areas.

          -  Skin type I, II, or III according to Fitzpatrick.

          -  Evaluable MED (the lowest dose to produce mild erythema with visible borders) to UVB.

          -  Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subjects have been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial.

          -  Subjects who are willing to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan and other
             trial procedures.

             trial.

          -  History of dermatological disease or medical conditions (in particular, any
             immunosuppression) which could, in the opinion of the investigator, preclude topical
             application of the investigational products and/or interfere with the evaluation of
             the test site reaction.

          -  History of clinically relevant psoriasis, chronic dermatitis or urticaria.

          -  Clinically relevant abnormal findings from the physical examination.

             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, neurological, endocrinological (including
             pheochromocytoma), immunological, psychiatric or cardiovascular disease, myopathies,
             epileptic seizures and bleeding tendency.

          -  Recent myocardial infarct (within last 3 months), unstable or deteriorating angina
             pectoris, coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), serious cardiac

          -  History of myopathies or epileptic seizures.

          -  Use of any medication within four weeks prior to the first treatment or during the
             trial, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may influence the trial results or
             the safety of the subjects.

          -  Use of systemic or topical analgesics or antihistamines within 72 hours prior to trial
             enrollment (except paracetamol) or systemic or topical corticosteroids within three
             weeks of trial enrollment.

          -  Subjects having used nicotine products other than cigarettes within the three months
             preceding the trial.

          -  Participation in the treatment phase of a clinical trial within 30 days prior to the
             treatment phase of this trial, or within 10 times the respective elimination half-life
             of the investigational drug.

          -  Subjects who cannot avoid, throughout the duration of the trial, any swimming, any
             washing of the lower back (i.e., the areas which to be patched and/or irradiated
             during this study), usage of sauna or any intense physical activity that might result
             in excessive sweating.

          -  Any history of drug hypersensitivity, asthma, urticaria, or other severe allergic
             diathesis as well as current hay fever.

          -  Known sensitivity to adhesive tape.
