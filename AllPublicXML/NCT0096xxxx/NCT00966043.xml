      CYPTAM-BRUT 3 is a prospective, multicentric study in Belgium within the CYPTAM study of the
      Leiden University Medical Center (NTR1509) including postmenopausal women receiving tamoxifen
      for estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer in the adjuvant setting. The primary endpoint is
      the difference in uterine changes between women with a normal versus low TAS after 3 months
      of tamoxifen use. Secondary endpoints are serum metabolite concentrations, serum
      follicle-stimulating hormone level, serum sex hormone-binding globulin level and menopausal
      symptoms. These patients are registered in the Leiden protocol with time to breast cancer
      event as primary endpoint.

      We will study the impact of the 'tamoxifen activity score' - based on functional genetic
      polymorphisms for tamoxifen metabolism and the use of drugs that interfere with
      tamoxifen-against tamoxifen related endpoints like uterine changes and subjective menopausal
      symptoms.

      The prevalence of genetic polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 and other genes and differences in
      usage of drugs interacting with tamoxifen metabolism will be compared between women with and
      those without endometrial thickening on one hand and between women with and those without hot
      flashes on the other hand. Tamoxifen use in adjuvant setting.

        -  &quot;Tamoxifen activity score&quot; (23): The endpoints will be correlated with a predefined
           'tamoxifen activity score' which is based on the presence of single nucleotide
           polymorphisms (SNP) in relevant genes combined with the effect of well known drugs that
           interfere with the metabolism of tamoxifen. The 'tamoxifen activity score' has been
           associated with tamoxifen compliance by a group in the US (23). The score will be
           adapted to the Belgian situation based on the prevalence of these SNPs in a Belgian
           population of volunteers for blood donation and consecutive breast cancer patients.

        -  The study setting are postmenopausal women with an early ER- positive breast cancer and
           not previously treated with an endocrine agent or hormone replacement therapy, with an
           intact uterus and clearly measurable thin endometrium/uterus. N =250
