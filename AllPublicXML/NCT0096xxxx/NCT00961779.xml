      To obtain evidence of the safety of NNZ-2566 in healthy female volunteers, compared to
      placebo when administered as a 10 minute intravenous (i.v.) bolus infusion, and when
      administered as a 10-minute bolus infusion immediately followed by a continuous 72-hour
      maintenance infusion.

      To determine the blood pharmacokinetics (PK) of an intravenous dose of NNZ-2566 in healthy

          -  BMI of 18 to 30 kg/m2.

          -  General Health: Healthy, determined by a medical history with particular attention to:

               -  a drug history identifying any known drug allergies and the presence of drug
                  abuse;

               -  any chronic use of medication; and

               -  a thorough review of body systems. This will also be determined by having no
                  clinically significant abnormal findings on physical examination, which includes
                  an electrocardiogram (ECG), which in the opinion of the Investigator would
                  jeopardize the safety of the subject or impact on the validity of the study
                  results.

          -  Venous Access: Volunteers with adequate venous access in their left and right arm to
             allow collection of blood samples and drug administration.

          -  Language: Fluent in the English language.

          -  Informed Consent: Have voluntarily given written informed consent to participate in
             this study.

             discretion of the Investigator).

          -  Difficulty in abstaining from food and/or beverages that contain caffeine or other
             xanthines, (e.g., coffee, tea, cola and chocolate) during the 24 hours prior to dose
             administration and whilst confined at the clinical study facility.

             failure, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome).
