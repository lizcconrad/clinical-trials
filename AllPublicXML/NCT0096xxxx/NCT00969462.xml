    <textblock>
      In previous studies, the investigators found that in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL)
      treated with ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and decarbazine) the absence of
      alopecia may predict for a poor response to treatment [complete remission (CR) rate 79%
      versus 31%, P &lt; 0.0005, respectively]. Also, patients without alopecia had fewer episodes of
      either leucopenia, neutropenia, deferral of treatment courses or number of courses with dose
      reduction [88% vs. 62.5%, P=0.05, for the presence of at least one of them].

      One of the explanations for this phenomenon is related to a lower systemic exposure of
      chemotherapeutic drugs in patients who retain their hair. There is a wide interpatient
      variability in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of doxorubicin systemic
      exposure and the degree of myelosuppression.

      In a pilot study on 18 patients the investigators could not find the previous association
      between alopecia, response to chemotherapy and bone marrow depression. However, when
      analyzing doxorubicin pharmacokinetics, patients who had no remission had 2 fold lower AUC
      (area under the curve) and 3 fold lower peaks (p=0.06). The investigators' lack to approve
      the previous findings might be explained by the small study group.

      Aim of the study:

      To evaluate the association between response to chemotherapy, the degree of myelosuppression
      and the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients.

      Methods:

      Study protocol:

        1. At diagnosis

           Demographic and clinical parameters be collected (Appendix 1)

        2. At course 2:

      1. Doxorubicin will be given by 5-7 minutes infusion before the other medications
      (Doxorubicin doses will be collected (Appendix 1))

      2. Blood will be sampled in course 2, at:

      0 minutes 30 minutes 120 minutes 24 hours

      Two 2ml EDT tubes will be drawn at each time The tubes will be centrifuged at 3000 RPM for 15
      min. Plasma samples will be stored in - 700C

      3. At the end of chemotherapy courses the following data will be collected (Appendix 2):

        1. Episodes of bone marrow depression (leucopenia, neutropenia) Treatment delays Dose
           reductions Neutropenic fever

        2. Remission status

      [Complete remission (CR) - disappearance of clinical signs and symptoms of NHL along with
      normal laboratory and radiological findings].

      4. At the end of one year of CR

      Remission status

      Number of patients: 30
