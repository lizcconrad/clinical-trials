      The primary aim is to examine how reduction in sedentary behaviors influences physical
      activity and energy intake.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many youth find television, videos and computer games to be very reinforcing, and they choose
      to be sedentary rather than physically active. Sedentary behaviors can influence energy
      balance and body weight by reducing physical activity and increasing energy intake. Research
      from our laboratory has shown that reducing sedentary behavior can increase physical activity
      and decrease energy intake, but there is substantial variability in the response of youth to
      reductions in sedentary behavior. The present proposal is designed to extend our research and
      explore theoretical models that may help understand why youth vary in their response to
      increase physical activity when targeted sedentary behaviors are reduced. We hypothesize that
      the increase in physical activity when sedentary behaviors are reduced is related to the
      relative reinforcing value (RRV) of physical activity to sedentary behaviors. The RRV of
      physical activity is a measure of the motivation to be active in youth, and overweight youth
      who are inactive find physical activity relatively less reinforcing than less overweight
      youth. We predict that RRV of physical activity will be positively related to the
      substitution of total physical activity and physical activity in the moderate to vigorous
      intensity range for sedentary behaviors when targeted sedentary behaviors are reduced. To
      test this hypothesis, we will study 60 overweight and at risk for overweight 8-12 year-old
      youth who differ in the RRV of physical activity to sedentary behavior, with equal numbers of
      boys and girls, in 3 phases: baseline, and reduce television watching from baseline by 25
      percent and 50 percent. Each phase will be implemented for three weeks. Order of experimental
      phases will be counterbalanced across subjects. It is also predicted that reducing sedentary
      behavior will reduce energy intake and dietary fat intake, and the reduction in energy intake
      will be greatest for youth with stronger association between eating with television watching
      and other targeted sedentary behaviors. Liking and outcome expectancy of physical activity
      will be studied as additional predictors of substitution of physical activity for reductions
      in sedentary behaviors. Developing a better understanding of why obese youth increase
      physical activity or decrease energy intake when sedentary behaviors are reduced is important
      for the treatment of pediatric obesity.

    <description>Actigraph activity monitors were used to record physical activity over 3 days, in addition to a weekly physical activity diary. Acti-graph counts were used to estimate energy expenditure during waking hours. Counts per minute describes the average rate of counts, with 0 being at rest and higher numbers indicating more vigorous physical activity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Energy Intake</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Resting metabolic rate was calculated using the activity data from accelerometer (Actigraph) collection. Resting metabolic rate was used to calculate estimated daily energy expenditure. Daily energy expenditure and weight change over the study period was used to estimate energy intake. If weight was stable of the nine weeks, assume energy intake = energy expenditure. A gain of a pound was estimated as equivalent to a positive balance of 3500 calories and a loss of a pound was estimated as equivalent to a negative balance of 3500 calories.</description>

    <description>The initial 3 weeks of the study, children were asked to maintain their usual targeted sedentary behaviors (TV, video game, computer use) measured by a television reduction device (TV Allowance). The following 3 weeks children were asked to reduce their targeted sedentary behaviors (TV, video game, computer use) by 25% from the usual sedentary condition using a television reduction device (TV Allowance). The final 3 weeks of the study, children were asked to reduce their targeted sedentary behaviors (TV, video game, computer use) by 50% from the usual sedentary condition using a television reduction device (TV Allowance)</description>

      <recruitment_details>Families were recruited from the Buffalo NY area. 460 families were interested in screening for the study with 271 ineligible families, 4 families who were no longer interested and 28 families who withdrew from phone screen, for a total of 157 families eligible for an orientation appointment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Prior to enrolling in the protocol, families completed an orientation, at which eligibility and interest were assessed. Families who enrolled, first completed three weeks of monitoring on the Television reduction device to determine eligibility (at least 18 hours/week of screen use) and compliance with physical activity accelerometer use.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Actigraph activity monitors were used to record physical activity over 3 days, in addition to a weekly physical activity diary. Acti-graph counts were used to estimate energy expenditure during waking hours. Counts per minute describes the average rate of counts, with 0 being at rest and higher numbers indicating more vigorous physical activity.</description>

        <title>Energy Intake</title>
        <description>Resting metabolic rate was calculated using the activity data from accelerometer (Actigraph) collection. Resting metabolic rate was used to calculate estimated daily energy expenditure. Daily energy expenditure and weight change over the study period was used to estimate energy intake. If weight was stable of the nine weeks, assume energy intake = energy expenditure. A gain of a pound was estimated as equivalent to a positive balance of 3500 calories and a loss of a pound was estimated as equivalent to a negative balance of 3500 calories.</description>
