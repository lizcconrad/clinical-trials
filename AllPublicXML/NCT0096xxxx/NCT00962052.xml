  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' long-term objective is to research and develop innovative new tests which
      diagnostic laboratories can use to 1) detect methylated DNA targets, 2) tumor specific
      antigens, and 3) markers of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) treatment in patient urine
      samples. The investigators plan to detect methylated DNA targets and control targets by
      methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (msPCR) on DNA isolated from urine samples
      from bladder cancer positive and negative patients to determine its sensitivity and
      specificity in detecting bladder cancer. The investigators plan to use patient sera as a tool
      to detect tumor specific antigens expressed by bladder cancer cell lines. Once a bladder
      tumor specific protein is identified, the investigators will assess its presence in the urine
      of bladder cancer patients and absence in healthy patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay (ELISA). The investigators plan to use both in vitro models and patient clinical
      samples to elucidate the role of bladder epithelial cells in mediating BCG immunotherapy and
      identify biomarkers of treatment effectiveness. Once a biomarker is identified, the
      investigators will assess its presence in the urine of bladder cancer and absence in healthy
      patients.

      Once the investigators determine the feasibility of these tests, the investigators will
      further perform an extensive clinical study, comparing the tests to existing diagnostic
      methods. This study will provide the foundation for FDA approval, which is required for tests
      to become widely accepted tools for clinicians to use in bladder cancer diagnosis. The
      investigators' tests will improve early detection of bladder cancer, thereby improving
      patient health and decrease cancer deaths, a key mission of the National Institutes of
      Health.
