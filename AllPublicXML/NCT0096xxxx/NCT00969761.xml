  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BI
      6727 therapy in terms of drug-related adverse events when combined with a platinum therapy
      (cisplatin or carboplatin).

      Secondary objectives are the collection of overall safety and antitumour efficacy data and
      the determination of the pharmacokinetic profile of BI 6727 combination treatment with
      cisplatin and carboplatin.
