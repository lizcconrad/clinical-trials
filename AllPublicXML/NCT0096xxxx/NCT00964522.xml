      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a nurse education and care program
      for patients with breast cancer, in terms of use of the health services, quality of life,
      satisfaction and security.

      Hypothesis:

      Nurse education and care program will reduce the use of health resources and will improve the
      toxicity, quality of life and satisfaction of the patients with breast cancer who initiate
      chemotherapy.

      Design: randomized controlled clinical trial with non-pharmacologic intervention. Subjects
      and setting of study: patients with breast cancer who initiate adjuvant, neoadjuvant or
      palliative chemotherapy, in the Day Unit of a University Hospital. Interventions: random
      allocation of the patients in two arms according to the nursing cares. The arm A is the one
      of standard education and care. They consist of receiving programmed oral and written
      information by the specialist in Medical Oncology before initiating the chemotherapy
      treatment and before each cycle of treatment. Also, the patients will be able to ask for
      information to the nurses when they need it. Arm B is the one of experimental education and
      care. They consist of receiving oral and written information by the specialist before
      initiating the chemotherapy treatment and before each cycle. In addition, the patients
      assigned to arm B will receive programmed education and care about the chemotherapy by a
      nurse of the Medical Oncology service before the beginning of the treatment and in each
      cycle, in a specific nurse consultation. Determinations: use of health resources (not
      programmed attendance in Primary, Specialist and Emergency care or hospitalisation). Toxicity
      caused by the chemotherapy. Patients who leave the chemotherapy by serious toxicity. Quality
      of life measured by means of the EORTC QOL-C30 questionnaire. Satisfaction with the received
      medical assistance.
