  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of intravitreal injections
      of bevacizumab in High Myopia´s choroidal neovascularization versus the standard treatment of
      Photodynamic therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bad response in choroidal neovascularization in High myopia to Photodynamic therapy, which is
      the current approved treatment for that pathology, and the high incidence of this pathology
      in these patients, together with the great functional impact in their vision has fostered the
      search for new therapeutic strategies.

      Intravitreal bevacizumab has already been tested in small series of patients with choroidal
      neovascularization associated to high myopia, whether as first treatment option or after the
      failure of photodynamic therapy with good results. In the published series an improvement of
      visual acuity is described after 1-2 injections, with a reduction in the macular edema and a
      good safety profile.

      The lack of published trials that describe the efficacy of frequency of treatment in this
      pathology is the main reason for this trial.
