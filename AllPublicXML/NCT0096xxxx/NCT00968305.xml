  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a very common childhood chronic illness and is generally more severe in African
      Americans. The investigators attempted to determine whether a specific immune marker is
      associated with lung function and asthma severity.

      This study examined the relationship between Interleukin (IL)-13 from
      phytohemagglutinin-activated polymorphonuclear blood cells and asthma severity, lung function
      (measured as FEV1%), and total serum IgE levels in African American children with clinically
      diagnosed asthma
