      Purple Sweet Potato juice (PSP-juice) is a juice based on purple-fleshed sweet potato
      concentrate, containing a high level of anthocyanins. Purple-fleshed sweet potatoes have
      attracted attention to industry and scientists due to multiple physiological functions such
      as radical-scavenging, ACE-inhibitory and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities in vitro, and
      also hepato-protective, antihypertensive and antihyperglycemic effects in vivo. Previous
      studies in Japanese subjects showed potential beneficial effects of PSP beverages on liver
      function and blood pressure in volunteers with impaired hepatic function and/or hypertension.

      The main objective of this study is to examine the effect of PSP-juice on liver enzymes and
      blood pressure. The secondary objective is to examine the effects of PSP-juice juice on
      insulin resistance.

      Study design: The study is designed as a randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind study.

      Study population: 40 healthy adult female and/or male subjects, 40-70 yr old with a BMI 25-35
      kg/m2, mildly elevated serum liver enzymes, and high normal blood pressure or mild
      hypertension.

      Intervention: Daily oral intake of 3x 125 ml of PSP-juice or control juice for a period of 8
      weeks.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Liver enzymes (GGT, ALAT, ASAT), blood pressure, glucose,
      insulin, haematology and serum clinical chemical profile
