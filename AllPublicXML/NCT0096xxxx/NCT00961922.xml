      Introduction:

      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of neurofeedback (NFB) to improve
      attention, memory and processing speed in children treated for a Brain Tumour (BT). In the
      Netherlands every year approximately 100 children are diagnosed with a BT. Nowadays over 65%
      of these children have a 5-year survival. Treatment for a BT consists of neurosurgery and /
      or local or craniospinal radiation and / or adjuvant chemotherapy. Neurotoxicity caused by
      radiotherapy and / or chemotherapy (especially methotrexate) is a major cause of
      neurocognitive decline in Childhood Brain Tumour Survivors (CBTS).

      Approach:

      Studies have shown that NFB has the capacity to improve the brain systems mediating selective
      attention and response inhibition in children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactive Disorder
      (ADHD). The effectiveness is reported as comparable to methylphenidate (Ritalin) without side
      effects of medication. CBTS exhibit symptoms comparable to those of children with ADHD and
      positive response to methylphenidate has been found in CBTS. However, NFB has not been used
      as an intervention in CBTS yet. The effectiveness of NFB in children treated for a BT will be
      investigated in a randomized controlled trial. The intervention group of 30 patients will
      receive approximately 30 sessions of NFB; the control group will receive 30 session of
      placebo neurofeedback. Neuropsychological tests will be used to evaluate pre- and post-NFB
      intervention as well as at a 6-month follow-up.

      Relevance:

      If NFB proofs to be effective for CBTS this will be a great improvement for their (neuro-)
      psychological functioning and quality of life, without the disadvantage of the side effects
      of medication. The implementation of this intervention might increase cognitive and social
      functioning and thus facilitate integration of these children in society during childhood and
      school carrier as well as in adult life.
