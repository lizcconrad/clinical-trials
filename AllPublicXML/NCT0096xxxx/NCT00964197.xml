  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FemmeJock is a pelvic floor support system developed by pelvic floor physiotherapists for
      patients with pelvic organ prolapse in order to ameliorate symptoms of pelvic floor pressure
      and discomfort. The device is a girdle to be worn on the outside of underwear. The device is
      machine washable and there are no documented risks with wearing it. This product is currently
      being used by pelvic floor physiotherapists and has been subjectively reported by individual
      accounts as being successful in improving pelvic floor symptoms. The efficacy of this product
      has not been previously studied in women with pelvic organ prolapse. The investigators are
      proposing a pilot study with the following specific aims:

        1. to assess patient satisfaction and continuation of use of the FemmeJock support system
           after 3 months of treatment.

        2. to describe, if any, the reasons for discontinuation associated with the use of this
           product, and

        3. to assess whether women experience improvement of pelvic floor symptoms after using this
           product.

      This will be a prospective pilot study in order to determine the efficacy and tolerability of
      FemmeJock in patients with pelvic organ prolapse. We plan to enroll 30 patients who will be
      recruited from the OU Health Science Center. We will offer study participation to patients
      who meet the inclusion criteria listed below, and who are: (1) awaiting surgical management
      and desire a temporary nonsurgical option, (2) seeking permanent nonsurgical treatment, or
      (3) who have a contraindication to surgical management.

    <description>The participant will be fitted with the girdle. The participant will use the girdle for the next 3 months. The girdle is only to be worn during the daytime during times of physical activity. The length of time you choose to wear it during the day is the patients choice. In two weeks the participant will be asked to fill out a 5 question survey in a follow up visit. The participant will be asked to return 3 months after wearing the FemmeJock girdle and to fill out a 5 question survey, as well as to complete a 20 question survey.</description>
