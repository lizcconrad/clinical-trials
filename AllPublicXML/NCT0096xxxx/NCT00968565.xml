      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of citrate to provide
      anticoagulation of an ECMO circuit without patient anticoagulation. The standard method of
      providing ECMO circuit anticoagulation is the use of heparin which also anticoagulates the
      patient and increases the risk of patient bleeding.

      Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a form of extended heart/lung bypass support
      that has been used to treat more than 650 patients over 20 years at Vanderbilt. Over 29,000
      patients have been treated worldwide. Bleeding is the most common complication during ECMO
      because of systemic anticoagulation with heparin. It is most commonly seen in patients
      following surgery either preceding or while on ECMO support. Regional citrate anticoagulation
      for hemodialysis was first introduced in 1961. It is the ideal alternative to heparin in
      patients who are at increased risk for bleeding. It permits effective anticoagulation across
      the extracorporeal circuit without impacting the patient's systemic coagulation. Citrate
      functions by binding free calcium, thereby inhibiting coagulation in both the intrinsic and
      extrinsic coagulation pathways. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of citrate
      as a regional anticoagulant in the ECMO circuit in high risk infants less than one year of
      age.
