    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized controlled trial set in an outpatient clinic, involving
      patients with major depressive disorder, who will be treated with antidepressant therapy,
      which will be individually agreed upon by the subject and his or her physician. Patients will
      be randomized to receive either placebo or fish oil capsules containing eicosapentaenoic acid
      (EHA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in addition to their antidepressant medication. Subjects
      will complete a brief dietary and exercise habits survey at the beginning of the trial to
      take into account lifestyle factors that may be significant in symptom resolution. Their
      progress will be monitored over a period of twelve weeks, with standardized rating scales
      completed by subjects and treating physicians. At the end of the study, scores will be
      compared between groups to look for differences in timing and degree of symptom improvement
      to analyze whether improvement occurred faster in the group receiving essential fatty acids
      (EFAs) than in the one receiving placebo. The primary hypothesis is that supplementation of
      antidepressant therapy with omega-3 fatty acids will decrease the lag period between the
      start of therapy and the time of clinically significant symptom improvement. A secondary
      hypothesis is that the results of this study will be consistent with numerous previous
      studies showing improvement in symptom control in major depressive disorder when
      antidepressants are supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids.
