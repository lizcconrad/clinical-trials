      The purpose of the study is to examine if alpha lipoic acid is an effective treatment for
      chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a progressive disease leading to
      paralysis. CIDP is an immune-mediated disorder resulting from a synergistic interaction of T
      cell-mediated and B cell-mediated immune responses directed against peripheral nerve
      antigens. These immune mediated responses in turn increase the production of reactive oxygen
      intermediate and cause oxidative damage of the peripheral nerve system. Although
      corticosteroids, plasma exchange, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) reduce impairment
      caused by CIDP at least temporarily and can be used as a first-line treatments, they are not
      ideal for long-term treatment because of serious side effects and cost. Alpha lipoic acid
      (LA) is an antioxidant that also possesses anti-immune activity. It is effective in treating
      diabetic neuropathy. It is also promising in treating patients with multiple sclerosis.
