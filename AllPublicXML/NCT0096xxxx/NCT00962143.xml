        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A transverse, full thickness, acute mid-substance Achilles tendon tear that requires
             surgical repair

          -  Achilles tendon tear is repairable by surgery using primary means as determined by
             intra-operative assessment

          -  Achilles tendon rupture with viable ends of the tendon that are suitable for primary
             repair

          -  Isolated Achilles tendon rupture without poly trauma

          -  Patient must be 18 to 70 years of age

          -  Life expectancy greater than or equal to 12 months

          -  Patient is able to provide voluntary informed consent

          -  Patient is willing and able to return for all follow-up visits and study related exams

          -  Patient is willing to comply with prescribed physical therapy regimen

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Emergency, poly trauma patients

          -  Previous Achilles tendon surgical procedure on that tendon

          -  Deficit in the contralateral extremity that prevents a comparison with the treated
             extremity

          -  Repair requires tendon lengthening, gap filling or tendon transfer

          -  BMI greater than 40

          -  Peripheral arterial disease

          -  Uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitis

          -  Systemic collagen disease

          -  Neurological disease

          -  Active infection - systemic or at the intended surgical site

          -  Acute use of immunosuppressive agents

          -  Rupture resulting from fluoroquinolone induced tendinopathy

          -  Alcohol or drug abuse

          -  Participant in another investigational drug or device trial

          -  Pathologic soft tissue conditions that would prevent secure surgical fixation

          -  Patients who are unwilling or unable to return for follow-up visits and study related
             exams

          -  Pregnant women

          -  Cancer patients

          -  Decisionally impaired patients
