    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to 48 Weeks Endpoint in the Conners' Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-Investigator Rated: Screening Version-Japanese (CAARS-Inv:SV-J)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CAARS-Inv:SV-J is a 30-item scale containing 3 subscales: inattention (9 items), hyperactivity/impulsivity (9 items), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Index (12 items). Each item is scored 0-3 (0=not at all/never; 1=just a little/once in a while; 2=pretty much/often; 3=very much/very frequently). Total ADHD symptoms score=sum of the inattention subscales (scores range from 0-27) and hyperactivity/impulsivity subscales (scores range from 0-27) with a total score range of 0-54. The ADHD Index scores range from 0-36. Higher scores indicate greater impairment.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to 48 Weeks Endpoint in the Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Quality of Life (AAQoL)-29 Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>AAQoL is a 29 items participant completed questionnaire rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (Not at all/ Never) to 5 (Extremely/Very Often). AAQoL total (all 29 items) and 4 subscale scores: Life Productivity (11 items); Psychological Health (6 items); Life Outlook (7 items); Relationships (5 items). Total score is computed by (1) reversing scores for all items except the 7 items in the Life Outlook subscale; (2) transforming scores to 0-100 scale (1=0; 2=25; 3=50; 4=75; 5=100); (3) summing item scores and dividing by the item count. Higher total scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 75-item standardized self-reported measure comprised of 3 subscales. Each item is rated on a 3-point Likert scale: 1 (behavior never observed) to 3 (behavior often observed). Global executive composite (GEC) subscale rates participant's GEC in everyday environment (75- 225 total score). Behavioral regulation subscale measures participant's control over behavior (30-90 total score). Metacognition subscale assesses systematic problem-solving ability while sustaining these task-completion efforts in active working memory (40-120 total score). Higher subscale ratings indicate greater perceived impairment.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HAMA-14 instrument consists of 14 items that provide an overall measure of general anxiety, including psychic anxiety and somatic anxiety. This instrument is completed by the clinician based on his or her assessment of the participant. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale of 0 (absent) to 4 (very severe). Total score is the sum of the 14 items and ranges from 0 (normal) to 56 (severe). Higher scores indicate greater anxiety.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HAMD-17 instrument consists of 17 items used to assess the severity of depression and its improvement during the course of therapy. This instrument is completed by the clinician based on his or her assessment of the participant. Each item was evaluated and scored using either a 5-point scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (very severe) or a 3-point scale of 0 (not present) to 2 (marked). The total score is the sum of the scores from HAMD-17 Items 1 through 17 and ranges from 0 (not at all depressed) to 52 (severely depressed). Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity.</description>

        <description>CAARS-Inv:SV-J is a 30-item scale containing 3 subscales: inattention (9 items), hyperactivity/impulsivity (9 items), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Index (12 items). Each item is scored 0-3 (0=not at all/never; 1=just a little/once in a while; 2=pretty much/often; 3=very much/very frequently). Total ADHD symptoms score=sum of the inattention subscales (scores range from 0-27) and hyperactivity/impulsivity subscales (scores range from 0-27) with a total score range of 0-54. The ADHD Index scores range from 0-36. Higher scores indicate greater impairment.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to 48 Weeks Endpoint in the Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Quality of Life (AAQoL)-29 Scores</title>
        <description>AAQoL is a 29 items participant completed questionnaire rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (Not at all/ Never) to 5 (Extremely/Very Often). AAQoL total (all 29 items) and 4 subscale scores: Life Productivity (11 items); Psychological Health (6 items); Life Outlook (7 items); Relationships (5 items). Total score is computed by (1) reversing scores for all items except the 7 items in the Life Outlook subscale; (2) transforming scores to 0-100 scale (1=0; 2=25; 3=50; 4=75; 5=100); (3) summing item scores and dividing by the item count. Higher total scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

        <description>A 75-item standardized self-reported measure comprised of 3 subscales. Each item is rated on a 3-point Likert scale: 1 (behavior never observed) to 3 (behavior often observed). Global executive composite (GEC) subscale rates participant’s GEC in everyday environment (75- 225 total score). Behavioral regulation subscale measures participant’s control over behavior (30-90 total score). Metacognition subscale assesses systematic problem-solving ability while sustaining these task-completion efforts in active working memory (40-120 total score). Higher subscale ratings indicate greater perceived impairment.</description>

        <description>The HAMA-14 instrument consists of 14 items that provide an overall measure of general anxiety, including psychic anxiety and somatic anxiety. This instrument is completed by the clinician based on his or her assessment of the participant. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale of 0 (absent) to 4 (very severe). Total score is the sum of the 14 items and ranges from 0 (normal) to 56 (severe). Higher scores indicate greater anxiety.</description>

        <description>The HAMD-17 instrument consists of 17 items used to assess the severity of depression and its improvement during the course of therapy. This instrument is completed by the clinician based on his or her assessment of the participant. Each item was evaluated and scored using either a 5-point scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (very severe) or a 3-point scale of 0 (not present) to 2 (marked). The total score is the sum of the scores from HAMD-17 Items 1 through 17 and ranges from 0 (not at all depressed) to 52 (severely depressed). Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity.</description>
