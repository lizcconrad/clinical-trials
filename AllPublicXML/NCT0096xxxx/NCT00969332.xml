  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate if intravenous fish oil, commercially available as
      Omegaven, safely and effectively reverses parenteral nutrition associated cholestasis in
      children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants dependent on parenteral nutrition for greater than 1 year who develop Parenteral
      Nutrition Associated Cholestasis will universally face mortality unless they receive a timely
      liver and/or small bowel transplant. Although transplant survival has improved in recent
      years, survival is not guaranteed, and transplant care remains costly. Alternative
      nutritional and pharmacological strategies are imperative to improve the clinical outcomes of
      infants with intestinal failure and parenteral nutrition associated cholestasis. In both
      animal and human studies, intravenous fish oil, a lipid emulsion rich in omega-3 fatty acids
      and lacking phytosterols, has been shown to ameliorate parenteral nutrition associated
      cholestasis and improve morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this pilot study is to
      investigate if Omegaven, a commercially available intravenous fish oil, at 1 g/kg/d, will
      safely reverse liver disease in 80 subjects with parenteral nutrition associated cholestasis.
      Subjects can initially receive a maximum of 6 months (24 weeks) of intravenous fish oil. If
      the subject re-develops liver disease and still satisfies inclusion/exclusion criteria, the
      intervention can be restarted up to two times for an additional 6 months (24 weeks) each
      time. Study subjects will be compared to a historical cohort of children with Short Bowel
      Syndrome and parenteral nutrition associated cholestasis who have been receiving standard
      intravenous soybean oil for &gt; 60 days. The fish oil cohort will be followed for a total of 5
      years to determine if transplant-free mortality is reduced.
