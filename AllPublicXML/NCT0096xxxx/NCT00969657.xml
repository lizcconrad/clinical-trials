      Background of the study:

      Prediction of rectal tumor response after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) might be helpful in
      individualizing treatment strategies, i.e., selecting patients who need less invasive surgery
      or another radiotherapy strategy instead of resection. For rectal cancer it is known that
      10-30% of the patients will respond with a pathologic complete response (pCR) after CRT. From
      a retrospective study with multivariate analysis of both clinical and 2-[18F]
      fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) data, it was found that
      adding FDG-PET data collected before and after CRT leads to a more predictive model compared
      to evaluating only pretreatment clinical data. To validate this model, this registration
      study is proposed. Furthermore, it has been found that FDG-PET during treatment is very
      predictive for response and a more favorable time point to adapt treatment. Also, there are
      indications that adding blood biomarkers to the data, results in higher accuracy for response
      prediction compared to clinical and imaging data alone. Therefore, FDG-PET during treatment
      and blood sampling are included in the protocol to improve the accuracy of the prediction
      models.

      Objective of the study:

      The long-term research objective is to be able to select rectum cancer patients who could
      receive a less invasive treatment. If prediction of response is possible, surgery may be
      avoided when complete response after chemoradiotherapy is expected or performed with smaller
      incisions if stage reduction is significant. This support decision system helps to
      individualize patient treatment and can improve the quality of life for the patient.

      Study design:

      28x radiotherapy. On day 15 of radiotherapy en 8 weeks after radiotherapy: 1 PET-CT scan
      Before radiotherapy, on day 15 and 8 weeks after radiotherapy: blood sample taken.

      General objective

      The long-term research objective is to be able to select rectum cancer patients who could
      receive a less invasive treatment. If prediction of response is possible, surgery may be
      avoided when complete response after chemoradiotherapy is expected or performed with smaller
      incisions if stage reduction is significant. This support decision system helps to
      individualize patient treatment and can improve the quality of life for the patient.

      Aim of the study

      The main aim is to validate a predictive model for pathologic complete response (ypT0N0) in
      rectal cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy by multi-centric prospective data
      collection. The second aim is to collect extra data for improvement of the accuracy of the
      prediction models with new variables. This new model will be validated later in the model
      development process.

      Hypothesis

      General hypothesis:

      The validated accuracy of predictive models for pathologic complete response after
      chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer patients is high enough to tailor treatment
      (surgery/non-surgery and/or administer extra radiation boosts) in clinical practice.

      Specific hypotheses:

        1. The performance of the developed models on the validation data is at least equal to the
           performance achieved during the model development process.

        2. The performance of a new model based on the addition of variables performs better than
           the previous model
