  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral Lenalidomide is initiated on day 1 of cycle 1 at the dose of 20 mg daily for 21 days
      with 7 days rest (28 day cycle) for a total of 4 cycles. Rituximab is administered on day 1
      and day 21 of each cycle at the dose of 375 mg/m2 for a total of 4 cycles.

      After this induction phase, the CR, PR and SD will continue Lenalidomide with the same
      schedule for other 8 months.

             subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds
             the ability to interpret data from the study.

          -  Use of any other experimental drug or therapy within 28 days of baseline.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to thalidomide.

          -  The development of erythema nodosum if characterized by a desquamating rash while
             taking thalidomide or similar drugs.

          -  Any prior use of lenalidomide.

          -  Concurrent use of other anti-cancer agents or treatments.
