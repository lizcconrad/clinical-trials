  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/1B, non-randomized, open-label, dose-escalation study of robatumumab (SCH
      717454, MK-7454) administered in combination with chemotherapy in pediatric participants with
      solid tumors, to be conducted in conformance with Good Clinical Practices. This study will
      evaluate the safety, tolerability and dose-finding of robatumumab when administered in
      combination with temozolomide and irinotecan (Arm A); or cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and
      vincristine (Arm B), or ifosfamide and etoposide (Arm C).

      The primary study hypothesis is that robatumumab can be safely administered in combination
      with chemotherapy regimens in pediatric participants with solid tumors.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to ~30 days after last dose of study drug (Up to ~10.3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Dose-limiting toxicity was defined by the following adverse events (AEs) that were considered possibly or probably related to either robatumumab or to its interaction with the chemotherapy regimen assigned: neutropenia (Grade 4 for &gt;1 week that did not resolve prior to Day 1 of the next cycle; Grade 3-4 neutropenia with Grade ≥2 fever lasting 3 days; neutropenic infection; failure to recover to study entry/eligibility criteria laboratory requirement levels that resulted in a delay of 14 days between treatment cycles), thrombocytopenia (Grade 4 for &gt;1 week that did not resolve prior to Day 1 of the next cycle; Grade 3-4 requiring a platelet transfusion on 2 separate days within a cycle) or all other AEs (Grade ≥3 [any duration] not ameliorable by supportive or symptomatic measures). The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE version 4.0) was to be used to grade AEs.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Best Overall Response Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, every 6 weeks and at ~30 days after last dose of study drug (Up to ~10.3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs were to be identified as target lesions. Data were to be collected at Screening, every 6 weeks and at 30 days after the final dose of robatumumab or the standard treatment assigned (whichever was last). The best overall response was to be the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR): &gt;30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD): &gt;20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions or the appearance of one or more new lesions; or Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.</description>

    <measure>Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) of Robatumumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycles 1 &amp; 2: pre- and post-infusion, and at 3, 6, 24, 48, 168, 336, and 504 hours post start of infusion; then pre-and post-dose in odd-numbered cycles, and Post Study Visits 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax was defined as the maximum observed serum concentration of robatumumab when administered in combination with other treatments. Blood samples for analysis of robatumumab pharmacokinetics (PK) were to be obtained at Cycles 1 and 2 at the following time points: predose, immediately post-infusion, and at 3, 6, 24, 48, 168, 336, and 504 hours post the start time of infusion. For all odd-numbered cycles (Cycle 3 and on) samples were to be obtained at each of the following two time points: predose and immediately postdose of robatumumab. Additionally, PK samples were to be obtained at the Post Study Visits 1 (30 days after last dose of robatumumab or standard treatment and 2 (approximately 4 months after last dose of robatumumab or standard treatment).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma Level of Insulin-like Growth Factor-I (IGF-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>On Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 3 and 5, and ~30 days after last dose of study drug (Up to~10.3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>IGF-I is produced largely by the liver in response to growth hormone from the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The IGF ligands can promote neoplastic events (cancer growth) through a number of different mechanisms. Robatumumab inhibits IGF ligand binding, IGF-stimulated receptor phosphorylation and human tumor cell proliferation. Plasma levels of IGF-I were to be analyzed on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, 5, and approximately 30 days after the final dose of robatumumab or the standard treatment assigned (whichever was last).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Developed Anti-robatumumab Antibodies</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to 1st and 8th doses of robatumumab, ~30 days after last dose of study drug, and 4 months after last dose of study drug (Up to ~13.3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of anti-robatumumab antibodies was to be assessed. Only participants who had a negative pre-treatment sample and a post-treatment sample were considered to be evaluable. If a participant had a single sample considered positive in the anti-robatumumab antibody assay (with the exception of pre-treatment positive participants), then they would be counted as positive in the immunogenicity assessment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Maximum Observed Concentration (Tmax) of Robatumumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycles 1 &amp; 2: pre- and post-infusion, and at 3, 6, 24, 48, 168, 336, and 504 hours post start of infusion; then pre-and post-dose in odd-numbered cycles, and Post Study Visits 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>Tmax was defined as time of Cmax of robatumumab when administered in combination with other treatments. Blood samples for analysis of robatumumab PK were to be obtained at Cycles 1 and 2 at the following time points: predose, immediately post-infusion, and at 3, 6, 24, 48, 168, 336, and 504 hours post the start time of infusion. For all odd-numbered cycles (Cycle 3 and on) samples were to be obtained at each of the following two time points: predose and immediately postdose of robatumumab. Additionally, PK samples were to be obtained at the Post Study Visits 1 (30 days after last dose of robatumumab or standard treatment and 2 (approximately 4 months after last dose of robatumumab or standard treatment).</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Curve at the Time of Final Quantifiable Sample (AUCtf) for Robatumumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycles 1 &amp; 2: pre- and post-infusion, and at 3, 6, 24, 48, 168, 336, and 504 hours post start of infusion; then pre-and post-dose in odd-numbered cycles, and Post Study Visits 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>AUCtf for robatumumab was defined as the area under the curve at the time of the final quantifiable sample of robatumumab. Blood samples for analysis of robatumumab PK were to be obtained at Cycles 1 and 2 at the following time points: predose, immediately post-infusion, and at 3, 6, 24, 48, 168, 336, and 504 hours post the start time of infusion. For all odd-numbered cycles (Cycle 3 and on) samples were to be obtained at each of the following two time points: predose and immediately postdose of robatumumab. Additionally, PK samples were to be obtained at the Post Study Visits 1 (30 days after last dose of robatumumab or standard treatment and 2 (approximately 4 months after last dose of robatumumab or standard treatment).</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Curve During a Dosing Interval τ (AUCτ) for Robatumumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycles 1 &amp; 2: pre- and post-infusion, and at 3, 6, 24, 48, 168, 336, and 504 hours post start of infusion; then pre-and post-dose in odd-numbered cycles, and Post Study Visits 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>AUCτ was defined as the area under the plasma concentration-time curve during a dosage interval (τ). Blood samples for analysis of robatumumab PK were to be obtained at Cycles 1 and 2 at the following time points: predose, immediately post-infusion, and at 3, 6, 24, 48, 168, 336, and 504 hours post the start time of infusion. For all odd-numbered cycles (Cycle 3 and on) samples were to be obtained at each of the following two time points: predose and immediately postdose of robatumumab.

    <measure>Plasma Level of Insulin-like Growth Factor-2 (IGF-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>On Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 3 and 5, and ~30 days after last dose of study drug (Up to~10.3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>IGF-II is generally produced locally in response to growth hormone from the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The IGF ligands can promote neoplastic events (cancer growth) through a number of different mechanisms. Robatumumab inhibits IGF ligand binding, IGF-stimulated receptor phosphorylation and human tumor cell proliferation.

    <time_frame>On Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 3 and 5, and ~30 days after last dose of study drug (Up to~10.3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The IGFBP-2 protein is secreted into the bloodstream where it binds to IGF-I and IGF-II. High expression levels of this protein promote the growth of several types of tumors and may be predictive of the chances of recovery of the participant. Robatumumab inhibits expression of this protein. Plasma levels of IGFBP-2 were to be analyzed on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, 5, and approximately 30 days after the final dose of robatumumab or the standard treatment assigned (whichever was last).</description>

        <description>All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs were to be identified as target lesions. Data were to be collected at Screening, every 6 weeks and at 30 days after the final dose of robatumumab or the standard treatment assigned (whichever was last). The best overall response was to be the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR): &gt;30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD): &gt;20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions or the appearance of one or more new lesions; or Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.</description>

For all odd-numbered cycles (Cycle 3 and on) samples were to be obtained at each of the following two time points: predose and immediately postdose of robatumumab. Additionally, PK samples were to be obtained at the Post Study Visits 1 (30 days after last dose of robatumumab or standard treatment and 2 (approximately 4 months after last dose of robatumumab or standard treatment).</description>

        <description>IGF-I is produced largely by the liver in response to growth hormone from the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The IGF ligands can promote neoplastic events (cancer growth) through a number of different mechanisms. Robatumumab inhibits IGF ligand binding, IGF-stimulated receptor phosphorylation and human tumor cell proliferation. Plasma levels of IGF-I were to be analyzed on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, 5, and approximately 30 days after the final dose of robatumumab or the standard treatment assigned (whichever was last).</description>

Robatumumab inhibits IGF ligand binding, IGF-stimulated receptor phosphorylation and human tumor cell proliferation. Plasma levels of IGF-II were to be analyzed on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, 5, and approximately 30 days after the final dose of robatumumab or the standard treatment assigned (whichever was last).</description>
