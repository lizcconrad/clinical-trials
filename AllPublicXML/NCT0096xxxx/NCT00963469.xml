    <time_frame>Baseline and first 2 Weeks of treatment period (from randomization through the end of Week 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline in Daytime Nasal Symptoms Score.
Patients were asked to rate each nasal symptom of Congestion, Rhinorrhea, Itching, and Sneezing daily on a 4- point scale [Score 0 (best) to 3 (worse)]. The average of the 4 individual nasal symptoms scores was reported as the Daytime Nasal Symptoms Score.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and first 2 Weeks of treatment period (from randomization through the end of Week 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline in Nighttime Symptoms Score.
Patients were asked to rate each symptom daily on a 4-point scale [Score 0 (best) to 3 (worse)], and the combined score of Nasal Congestion Upon Awakening, Difficulty Going to Sleep, and Nighttime Awakenings was reported as the Nighttime Symptoms Score.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and first 2 Weeks of treatment period (from randomization through the end of Week 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Composite Symptoms Scores were computed as the average of Daytime Nasal Scores [Score 0 (best) to 3 (worst)] and Nighttime Symptoms Scores [Score 0 (best) to 3 (worst)].</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Daytime Eye Symptoms Score Over First 2 Weeks of Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and first 2 Weeks of treatment period (from randomization through the end of Week 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline in Daytime Eye Symptoms scores.
Patients were asked to rate each of the 4 eye symptom of tearing, itchy, red, and puffy eyes daily on a 4-point scale [Score 0 (best) to 3 (worst)]. The average of the 4 individual eye symptoms scores was reported as the Daytime Eye Symptoms Score.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality-of-Life Score After First 2 Weeks of Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and first 2 Weeks of treatment period (from randomization through the end of Week 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients completed a Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-28 questions on a 7-point scale [0(best) to 6(worst)] across 7 domains: activity,sleep,non-nose/eye symptoms,practical problems,nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotions. The scores for each domain were averaged, then scores for the 7 domains were averaged for an overall score.</description>
