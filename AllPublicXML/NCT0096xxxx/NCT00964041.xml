  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial examining the cognitive effects at weeks
      1, 4, &amp; 8 of once-weekly oral D-cycloserine 50 mg added to a stable dose of antipsychotic for
      8 weeks in adult outpatients with schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a previous placebo-controlled trial, investigators demonstrated significant improvement of
      negative symptoms with once-weekly D-cycloserine treatment. In addition, investigators found
      significant improvement of memory consolidation following the first dose; however, the effect
      on memory consolidation was lost after several weeks. The &quot;practice effect&quot; of weekly
      measurement of memory consolidation using repeated administration of the Logical Memory Test
      may have resulted in a &quot;ceiling effect&quot; which would obscure drug/placebo differences. In the
      current study, investigators propose to administer the Logical Memory Test at four-week
      intervals (weeks 1, 4 and 8) to avoid the ceiling effect. Additionally a measurement will be
      added of negative symptoms at week 4 to better characterize the time course of negative
      symptom improvement.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Assess the effects of a single dose of D-cycloserine 50 mg on memory consolidation as
           measured by the Logical Memory Test compared to placebo.

        2. Assess the persistence of once-weekly D-cycloserine effects on memory consolidation
           measured at weeks 4 &amp; 8.

        3. Assess the effects of repeated weekly dosing of D-cycloserine on performance on a
           standard cognitive battery at week 8 compared to placebo.

        4. Assess effects of weekly D-cycloserine dosing on negative symptoms at weeks 4 &amp; 8
           compared to placebo.

        5. Assess tolerability and side effects of weekly D-cycloserine compared to placebo.
