      1. Radical surgery. It is supposed to improve prognosis of colon cancer. A surrogate
           measure of achievement of radical surgery is the number of lymph nodes removed with the
           specimen.

        2. Markers. There may be variables that may make patient assessment more sound. The project
           is including investigation of such markers (genes, old age, comorbidity, and others).

        3. Laparoscopic resections. This is being used more and more in cancer surgery but the
           feasibility of this approach remains to be proven compared with conventional open
           surgery. The project compares these according to 1) and 2).

        4. Morbidity and mortality must be surveilled to keep at a minimum. Many patients have
           comorbidity and are old to make this factor extra important, including perioperative
           care.

        5. Proper treatment of colon metastases may prolong life. Treatment of lung-metastases will
           be studied in particular.

      1. Radical surgery. A detailed description of procedures for each location of tumor in the
           large intestine is used. By following a given procedure for each location in the large
           intestine, the number of lymph nodes can be analyzed for each location to find out if
           this differs and if prognosis is affected by lymph node numbers according to tumor site.

        2. Markers. Different variables are examined for use in clinical judgment to make treatment
           better as well as genetic experimental analyses for comparison with clinical outcome to
           better understanding of clinical behavior.

        3. Laparoscopic resections. The technical challenge of laparoscopic approach has been
           compared with conventional surgery without any difference being observed in trials.
           However, it should be compared with radical open surgery to compare best achievements by
           using number of lymph nodes as well as outcome measures in the short and long term
           (mortality).

        4. Comorbidity, old age itself, type of surgery and perioperative care according to the so
           called fast track surgery may all play a part in reducing perioperative morbidity and
           mortality. A maximum 3% mortality should be aimed for.

        5. Colon cancer usually metastasize to the liver and lungs. Surgical treatment of liver
           metastases has been extensively studied and the prognosis has improved. Lung metastases
           has not been given similar attention but the prognosis of those operated may be good and
           equal that after liver surgery. The need for pulmonary resection and factors associated
           with metastases and lung metastases in particular will be studied.
