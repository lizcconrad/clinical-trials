      Rationale: Due to advanced technologies in the last decade, increasingly more treatment
      options are available for head and neck cancer (HNC). As a consequence decision-making with
      regard to choosing the best available treatment option is becoming increasingly relevant.
      Quality of life weights (utility scores) are an important outcome measure in this
      decision-making process. Utility scores can be combined with life expectancy, resulting in
      the Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY). If in economic evaluation the outcomes are expressed
      in QALYs gained, it is possible to compare the efficiency of different interventions for
      different indications. However, limited evidence on utility scores after treatment for HNC is
      available.

      Objective: The investigators' main objective is to examine quality of life (QoL), both
      utility scores and disease specific quality of life, for different treatment modalities in
      HNC. Secondary objectives are to examine whether QoL differs across health states, and which
      factors influence QoL. As extensive data are available on disease-specific quality of life,
      another objective is to examine whether utility scores can be derived from a commonly used
      disease-specific questionnaire, the EORTC QLQ-C30/QLQ-H&amp;N35. If this would be possible, this
      would limit patient burden in future clinical trials. Finally, by means of measuring
      patients' ability to perform their work, diet and dental consequences the investigators aim
      to measure the impact of HNC and its treatment.

      Study design: The investigators' study design is a cross-sectional survey.

      Study population: The study population consists of patients with HNC who are treated at least
      six months ago for curative radiotherapy and/or surgery with or without chemotherapy.

      Intervention/method: Patients are asked to fill out a single set of questionnaires
      (once-only). The set of questionnaires consists of three validated questionnaires, concerning
      health state utility (EuroQol-5D), disease-specific quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30/QLQ-H&amp;N35)
      and productivity losses (PRODISQ). In addition, two questions inquiring about patients' diet
      and three questions considering the dental status of these patients are added to the
      questionnaires. To classify patients into certain health states, physicians are asked to
      score adverse events in patients during follow-up visits (according to the RTOG
      classification).

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter is QoL (both disease specific
      quality of life and utility scores) in a certain health state. These utility scores can be
      used in future cost-effectiveness studies to identify the best available treatment option.
      Other important study parameters are the factors influencing QoL, and the relationship
      between utility score and disease-specific quality of life.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: As the study involves a once only set of questionnaires, the burden is only
      minimal. No risks are expected to be associated with participation. It is important to gain
      insight into QoL, patients' ability to perform their work, diet and dental consequences in
      long-term follow-up of HNC patients, to allow for evidence-based decision-making regarding
      treatment options for HNC.
