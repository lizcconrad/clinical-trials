  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous catheters are placed in nearly every hospitalized patient. These catheters, since
      they are breaks in skin integrity, are potential sources of infection that occur in the
      bloodstream. Bloodstream infections can result in higher rates of death and lengths of
      hospital stay, as well as increase healthcare costs. Blood is drawn or medications delivered
      through a catheter access device attached to the catheter. In looking at new ways to decrease
      infections associated with healthcare, the investigators plan to test whether the use of a
      silver-coated catheter access device (VLINK) compared to the standard, non-coated device
      (CLEARLINK) can reduce infection rates. These devices are identical in design other than the
      silver coating of the VLINK, that imparts a brown color to the device. Silver can prevent the
      growth of bacteria inside the device (biofilm formation) in the laboratory, but this has
      never been proven in patients.

      The investigators propose to do a crossover study in two Emory-owned hospitals (Emory
      University Hospital and Emory University Hospital at Midtown), anticipated to last 10 months.
      Currently, both types of devices, (standard and silver-coated) are FDA approved for clinical
      use and are in use at both hospitals. The investigators plan to have each hospital use only
      one type of catheter access device for a period of time (approximately 5 months), and then
      switch (&quot;crossover&quot;) to other type of device for the rest of the study. All patients admitted
      to either hospital (excluding newborns and patients with infections attributed to
      hemodialysis catheters) will be enrolled since both devices meet the standard of care. During
      the study, the infection prevention department, as a continuing part of their regular duties
      will measure infection rates. A small subset of catheters that are removed during routine
      clinical care (none will be taken out solely for the study) will be sent to CDC to determine
      the amount of bacteria inside catheters and catheter access devices (look for biofilm).
      Finally, the microbiology lab, again as part of its routine function will determine the rate
      at which blood cultures are falsely positive. All of these measures will be compared using
      statistical methods to see if there is a difference between the standard and silver-coated
      catheter access devices.

      In undertaking this study, the investigators will be using a type of vascular access device
      (valve, not positive pressure) already in use in both hospitals and not changing the delivery
      of care to patients while, in a rigorous, systematic manner, obtaining samples and data for
      analysis.

        Nearly all hospitalized patients require some form of indwelling IV catheter as part of
        routine care, and approximately 20% of patient-days include central lines. All adult
        patients admitted to 2 Emory affiliated hospitals (Emory University Hospital and Emory
        University Hospital Midtown) during the study period will be included in the study
        population.
