  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children and adults frequently need a 'breathing tube' when having anesthesia for surgery.
      The breathing tube is usually inserted after the anesthesia doctor puts a patient to sleep
      with medicine, so they do not feel the breathing tube. In children, there is often a leak of
      air between the tube and the windpipe, as the tube is not an exact fit. Anesthesia doctors
      usually listen for this leak around the tube by listening to the chest with a stethoscope
      while gently filling the lungs with oxygen from the anesthesia machine. The leak tells them
      if the tube is the correct size, or too small, or too tight. If it is too small, or too
      tight, they usually change the tube for a better fit.

      The purpose of this study is to see what happens to this leak in the 30 minutes after the
      tube is placed. No one really knows if the leak gets bigger, smaller, or stays the same.
      Knowing what happens to the leak will help anesthesia doctors to decide whether to change the
      breathing tube or not. This is important, as a tube that is too tight can lead to breathing
      difficulty after removing the tube at the end of surgery, and a tube that is too small may
      make it difficult for the breathing machine to work effectively for the patient as a result
      of a large leak of air or oxygen.
