      This Phase 1, single-site, dose-escalation study is being conducted to determine the MTD of
      RAD001 as part of a specified combination regimen. The combination regimen will be standard
      field whole pelvic RT in combination with cisplatin at 40mg/m2 weekly with RAD001 at dose
      escalation daily starting at 5 mg qod, then 5 mg qd, then 10 mg qd during the period of whole
      pelvic radiation therapy.
