  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how well Rituximab works in early stages of disease
      and the effects it has on an inflamed joint and blood cells.

      This will allow the investigators to get a better understanding of how this treatment affects
      the inflamed joints of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
