      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from dendritic cells may help the body build an effective immune
      response to kill cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy and to see how
      well it works in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia in complete remission.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the tolerability of autologous dendritic cell vaccine in patients with acute
           myelogenous leukemia in complete remission.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the emergence of an immune response.

        -  Determine the relapse rate.

        -  Assess the occurrence of residual disease.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive increasing doses of blastic cells transformed in vitro by
      autologous dendritic cells (1/3 subcutaneously and 2/3 IV) every 3 weeks for up to 5 doses.
