      This study aimed to explore the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of low dose sertraline
      with [11C] sertraline positron emission tomography (PET) study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open, one arm, single sequence, 3-period, dose escalating study for healthy volunteers are
      investigated. Ten subjects may be enrolled.

      Subjects receive baseline [11C] sertraline PET.

      Period 1 Subjects receive 5 mg of sertraline every day. After 6 day of medication,
      pharmacokinetic and PET studies are performed.

      Period 2 Subjects receive 25 mg of sertraline every day. After 6 day of medication,
      pharmacokinetic and PET studies are performed.

      Period 3 Subjects receive 50 mg of sertraline every day. After 6 day of medication,
      pharmacokinetic and PET studies are performed.
