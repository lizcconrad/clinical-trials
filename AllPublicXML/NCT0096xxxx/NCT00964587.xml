  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if patient education and problem-solving training,
      delivered in self-study, group, and individual intervention modalities, will produce
      substantial improvements in CVD risk profile via improved self management in urban African
      Americans with type 2 diabetes and a high CVD risk profile.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      African Americans with type 2 diabetes suffer excess disease burden, but cardiovascular
      disease (CVD) risk factors such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia are
      modifiable with medical management and lifestyle modification. Patient diabetes education and
      counseling for behavior change are recommended standards of practice to facilitate effective
      self-management of these risk factors. However, for patients with low literacy or health
      literacy, accessibility and impact of educational and behavioral interventions are limited.
      Pilot research suggests that: a) literacy demand and behavioral activation characteristics of
      patient education modules can be adapted to facilitate learning in urban patients with low
      literacy, and b) combining literacy-adapted education with problem-solving training
      facilitates understanding and use of health information for performing self-management in the
      context of daily life (functional health literacy). Optimal modalities for delivery of a
      combined patient diabetes education and problem-solving training, and cost-effectiveness of
      this intervention model, however, are not known. The proposed study will address these needs
      by testing effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of literacy-adapted diabetes and CVD
      education and problem-solving training interventions in urban African Americans with type 2
      diabetes and high CVD risk profile (suboptimal blood sugar, blood pressure, and/or lipids).
      The specific aims of the study are: a) to complete development of a package of
      literacy-adapted diabetes and CVD patient education materials by developing two video/DVDs
      addressing self-management recommendations appropriate to the needs, resources, and
      environment of the population; b) to randomize urban African-American adults with type 2
      diabetes and a high CVD risk profile into one of four study arms: Usual Care (Arm 1),
      Literacy-Adapted Education and Problem-Solving Training Self-Study (Arm 2), Literacy-Adapted
      Education and Group Problem-Solving Training (Arm 3), and Literacy-Adapted Education and
      Individual Problem-Solving Training (Arm 4); c) to conduct baseline, 3-month
      post-intervention, and 6-month post-intervention assessment visits to analyze and compare
      effectiveness of the literacy-adapted education and problem-solving interventions, as
      compared to Usual Care, in improving the skills of knowledge, problem-solving and health
      literacy, behaviors of patient activation and diabetes self-management, and clinical outcomes
      of A1C, blood pressure and lipids; and d) to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of each
      intervention arm as compared to Usual Care. If proven effective, this research will yield low
      literacy diabetes and CVD patient education and self-management intervention tools for
      dissemination to high-risk urban minority populations. Moreover, the cost-effectiveness
      analysis will provide evidence to support decision-making regarding implementation of the
      models to achieve cardiovascular disease patient self-management goals in clinical practice.
