  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Timely identification, referral and treatment of children who are clinically deteriorating
      while admitted to hospital wards is a fundamental element of inpatient care. In community
      hospitals, advantages including greater continuity of inpatient-outpatient care, improved
      geographic access for families, and lower healthcare system costs, may be undermined if
      children with evolving critical illness are not recognized and transferred in a timely
      manner. The Bedside Paediatric Early Warning System (Bedside PEWS) is a system of care
      designed to augment existing expertise and to provide a safety net for children who are
      clinically deteriorating while admitted to hospital wards. The Bedside PEWS is comprised of 4
      components; [1] an expert derived, multi-centre validated severity of illness score, [2] an
      inter-professionally developed documentation record into which the severity of illness score
      is embedded, [3] a series of score-matched care recommendations based on the opinions of over
      280 paediatric health care professionals, and [4] an educator-developed
      education-implementation program.

      We will be performing a prospective observational study of care outcomes, physician workload
      and frontline staff perceptions before and after the implementation of Bedside PEWS in a
      community paediatric hospital. We plan to evaluate the outcomes of patients who were admitted
      to the 22-bed paediatric inpatient unit and were less than 18 years of age at hospital
      admission, and the healthcare professionals caring for them during their inpatient stay.
