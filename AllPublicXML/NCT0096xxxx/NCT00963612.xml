  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver resection and liver transplantation are the acceptable treatment of Hepatocellular
      Carcinoma (HCC). But the long-term survival is unsatisfactory as a result of high rate of
      intra and extra hepatic recurrences. Microvascular invasion (MVI) is the most significant
      risk factor affecting recurrence-free survival in patients following liver resection and
      liver transplantation. Tumor hypoxia (lack of adequate blood supply) is the single most
      important factor that predict MVI and post surgical prognosis.

      Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) MRI is a non-invasive diagnostic method of assessing
      tumor hypoxia by detecting signal changes secondary to changes in blood flow and oxygenation.
      BOLD MRI assessment of tumor hypoxia in HCC has never been correlated with pathological
      confirmation of MVI, the gold standard to assess MVI in HCC. In this study, the investigators
      propose to assess the ability of BOLD MRI to provide a discriminating quantitative threshold
      of intratumoral oxygenation predictive of MVI.
