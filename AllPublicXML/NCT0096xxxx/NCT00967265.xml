  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient participation is a central concept in Norwegian health policy. It is mandatory in
      hospitals and emphasised as one of the most prioritised areas by the Government. Studies from
      Norway have repeatedly found that patients who seek help in community mental health centres
      (&quot;DPS&quot;) are dissatisfied with the information they receive and about their possibility for
      real influence in their treatment.

      One way to improve individual patient participation might be to give patients information
      before they start their treatment. This can be done as group based patient education to
      reduce the resources needed. Furthermore, as there are waiting lists for treatment, such
      introduction seminars could be held while patients are waiting to use this time in a
      meaningful way.

      The present study therefore aims at testing the effect of an introduction seminar for
      patients on waiting list in a community mental health centre.

    <description>The seminar will be held over two half days, each lasting 2.5 hours. Up to 30 patients can participate in each seminar. The details of the content of the program will be developed based on study one. The preliminarily plans are to give general information about the community mental health centre, the available treatment options and patients rights by presentations from health personnel and user representatives. At the end of each day, the patients will be divided into small groups mentored by health personnel were they can discuss the presentations and ask questions. In the breaks, literature and other type of information for patients will be on display. All participants will get a folder with details of the program and leaflets from patient organisations and governmental agencies.</description>
