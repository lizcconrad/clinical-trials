  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to identify baseline and early predictors of favorable
      and unfavorable response to lifestyle intervention. As a secondary objective, the
      investigators would like to validate our questionnaire or other identified predictors as
      clinical tools to guide us in selection of the most suitable candidates for lifestyle
      intervention programs. Assuming the same capacity of our questionnaire to predict an absence
      of weight loss (≥5%) or a loss to follow-up (likelihood ratio for a positive test, LR+ =
      9.9), 70 subjects need to be included in this study in order to find a lower limit of the 95%
      confidence interval above 2.0 for this LR+, which is the limit of an acceptable test. The
      investigators will enroll participants with pre-diabetes and BMI 27-40 in our program and
      administer to them at baseline and at 3 months the designed questionnaire, as well as other
      already well validated questionnaires assessing state of change and readiness to implement
      diet or exercise modifications.

    <description>Patients meet individually every six weeks, a nurse or kinesiologist, and a dietitian (as well as a psychologist, if needed) and every three months an endocrinologist. A unique patient chart is shared by members of the interdisciplinary team, allowing sharing of the information and avoiding repetitions. Individualized behavioural intervention is proposed and focuses on attainable goals and progressive but sustained small changes in nutrition and physical activity. In addition, the participants have access to 24 weekly group seminars, on different aspects of excess weight and modification of lifestyle, to reinforce behaviour and commitment to lifestyle changes. Our approach meets all criteria suggested for clinical intervention in the 2006 Canadian clinical practice guidelines on the management and prevention of obesity in adults and children.</description>
