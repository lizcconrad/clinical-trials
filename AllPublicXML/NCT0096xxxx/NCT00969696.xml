  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate galantamine's effects on cognitive performance in marijuana users. Galantamine,
      an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor, is approved for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
      Current marijuana users show impaired cognitive functioning, which predicts poor treatment
      response to behavioral treatments in this population. Whether cognitive impairment in
      marijuana users will improve with medication treatment has not been evaluated. We hypothesize
      that galantamine, compared to placebo, will improve cognitive performance in marijuana
      users.Galantamine, compared to placebo, will improve working memory, verbal learning/memory
      and response inhibition functions in marijuana users.

    <textblock>
      To summarize, marijuana users show impaired cognitive functioning, especially in working
      memory and verbal learning and memory functions. Impaired cognitive functioning predicts poor
      treatment response in marijuana users. Whether the cognitive impairments in marijuana users
      improve with cholinergic enhancers has not been evaluated. In this double-blind,
      parallel-group study, we are proposing to evaluate galantamine's effects on cognitive
      performance in marijuana users. Thirty subjects will first have an adaptation session to
      familiarize them with the study procedures including cognitive assessment. The adaptation
      session will be followed by a 10-day treatment period, in which subjects will be randomized
      to galantamine (8 mg/day) or placebo. On Day 4 or 5 and Day 9 or10 of each treatment phase
      subjects will have test sessions, where a battery of cognitive tests will be administered.
      The cognitive test that will be administered will include the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test
      (HVLT) modules from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB): the
      Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVIP) and the Stop Signal Test (SST).

      Currently this study is in data analysis with 30 completers. (April 2011)

             period;

          -  Current marijuana use, indicated by positive urine toxicology for marijuana;

          -  No current medical problems and normal ECG;

          -  For women, neither pregnant as determined by pregnancy screening nor breast feeding,
