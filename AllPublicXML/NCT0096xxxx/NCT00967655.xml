      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine and irinotecan hydrochloride,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as panitumumab, can block tumor
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others
      find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Radiation
      therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody
      therapy, and radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the
      amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving capecitabine and
      panitumumab together with radiation therapy with or without irinotecan hydrochloride and to
      see how well it works in treating patients undergoing surgery for localized rectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the pathological tumor response rate in patients with localized rectal cancer
           treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy comprising capecitabine, panitumumab, and
           radiotherapy with or without irinotecan hydrochloride.

        -  To assess the incidence of grade 3/4 toxicity during neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the disease-free survival.

        -  To assess the time to treatment failure.

        -  To assess the1-year and 2-year survival rates.

        -  To assess local recurrence, defined as recurrence in pelvis at the site of previous
           disease.

        -  To assess the safety and toxicity grade using NCI CTCAE v3.0 criteria.

        -  To assess the number and percentage of patients who undergo down staging of their
           disease as determined before initiating neoadjuvant therapy and at the time of surgery.

        -  To assess the number and percentage of patients where permanent colostomy can be avoided
           as determined by the surgeon before initiating neoadjuvant therapy and at the time
           actual surgery is performed.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Phase A: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week and receive oral
           capecitabine twice daily 5 days a week for 5½ weeks. Patients also receive panitumumab
           IV over 1 hour on days 1, 15, and 29 during radiotherapy in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Phase B: Patients undergo radiotherapy and receive capecitabine and panitumumab as in
           Phase A. Patients also receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV on days 1, 8, 22, and 29 in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo surgery 6-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy,

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months thereafter.
