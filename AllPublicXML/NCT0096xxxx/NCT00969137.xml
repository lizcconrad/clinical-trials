  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if the mu opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) A118G polymorphism moderates the
      subjective-rewarding effects of intravenous (IV) nicotine in male and female smokers. The
      subjective effects of nicotine will be measured with a Drug Effects Questionnaire, including
      the ratings of &quot;good effects&quot; and &quot;drug liking&quot;. We hypothesize that smokers with the AG/GG
      genotype for the OPRM1 A118G will have attenuated subjective-rewarding effects from IV
      nicotine when compared to those with AA genotype.

      Increasing evidence suggest that MOR contribute to nicotine's rewarding effect. Further, the
      functional OPRM1 A118G variant has been linked to rewarding effects of alcohol in alcohol
      users and to nicotine in female smokers. Since no previous studies examined the influence of
      the A118G variation on pure nicotine responses, the next logical step is to evaluate how this
      genetic polymorphism affects nicotine's rewarding, cognitive, and physiological effects using
      IV nicotine administration in male and female smokers. In addition, the association of the
      G398A polymorphism of the CHRNA5 gene (rs16969968) with maximal response to nicotinic
      agonists justifies examination of this SNP as a moderator of IV nicotine sensitivity in
      humans (Bierut et al. 2008). This SNP will be examined in an exploratory fashion since it is
      not feasible to fully stratify the study sample for multiple SNPs. The frequency of
      rs16969968 SNP ranges from 35%-42% among those of European ancestry, making it feasible to
      examine this variation in our subject sample.

      Currently this study is active and enrollment is continuing. Currently there are 205
      completers and on going.(June 2014)
