          -  Patients with two-vessel coronary disease, may have undergone successful treatment
             (&lt;20% diameter stenosis by visual estimate) of the non-target vessel with approved
             devices up to and including the index procedure but must be prior to the index target
             vessel treatment. Any non-target vessel or lesion intended to be treated during the
             index procedure, cannot be an unprotected left main, ostial lesion, chronic total
             occlusion (CTO), heavily calcified, bifurcation, vein grafts, have angiographic

             coverage including at least 3 mm of healthy vessel is recommended). The lesion length
             should be measured after pre-dilation procedure;

          -  Reference vessel diameter must be ≥2.5 to ≤ 3.5 mm by visual estimate. The vessel

             nitroglycerin if spasm is suspected;

          -  Target lesion ≥50% and &lt;100% stenosed by visual estimate.

          -  Target lesion involving bifurcation with a side branch ≥2.0 mm in diameter (either
             stenosis of both main vessel and major side branch or stenosis of just major side
             branch) that would require intervention of diseased side branch;
