    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim is to compare changes in blood sugar and the
      number of periods where carbohydrate supplementation is needed to treat low blood sugar,
      during two different treatments with NN1250 (insulin degludec), a soluble insulin basal
      analogue (SIBA) in subjects with type 1 diabetes.
