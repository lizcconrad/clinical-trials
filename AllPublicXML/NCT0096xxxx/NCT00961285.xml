    <textblock>
      Identification of alterations potentially involved in the complex mechanisms of
      leukemogenesis and at the identification and validation of novel biological factors which may
      serve as predictors of drug-response and drug-resistance or which may be suitable for
      targeted therapy.

      The investigators will use several approach to identify common genetic variations:
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genomic insertions and deletions, and genetic copy
      number variations (CNVs), interchromosomal translocations, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and
      uniparental disomy (UPD), Epigenetic changes, such as silencing of gene expression via DNA
      hypermethylation, that can also influence drug effects, and aberrant methylation of CpG
      islands is a common feature of cancer cells. Over the years, methods of cytogenetic analysis
      evolved and became part of routine laboratory testing, providing valuable diagnostic and
      prognostic information in hematologic disorders. The recently developed single nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP) arrays offer the ability to define simultaneously the copy number changes
      and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events occurring in a tumor, at high resolution and
      throughout the genome. In addition to information on copy number changes, SNP arrays allow us
      to investigate the impact of a high number of SNPs on drug response and toxicity This
      molecular integrated approach will lead to the identification of alterations potentially
      involved in the complex mechanisms of leukemogenesis and at the identification and validation
      of novel biological factors which may serve as predictors of drug-response and
      drug-resistance or which may be suitable for targeted therapy.
