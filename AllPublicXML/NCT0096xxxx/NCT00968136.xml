        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients, who have recalcitrant infantile spasms and undertake the ketogenic diet at
             Severance Hospital and Sanggye Paik Hospital from 2005 to 2008.

          2. Clinical and electroencephalography findings are compatible with infantile spasms

          3. Spasms are intractable to the initial combination of vigabatrin (150 mg/kg) and
             topiramate (10 mg/kg) and/or additional indicated anti-epileptic drugs including
             prednisolone (2 mg/kg for 2 weeks and an additional 2 weeks for tapering).

          4. Study entry requires magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the absence of a
             progressive cerebral lesion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have a history of hyperlipidaemia and underlying metabolic diseases
             including acute intermittent porphyria, pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, and fatty
             acid oxidation defects.

          2. Patients who have a history of nephrolithiasis.
