      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory
      may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related
      to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at blood and tissue samples from patients with
      prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To identify the molecular and pathophysiological changes which occur during the early
           stages of androgen deprivation (AD) and during emerging castration-resistant prostate
           cancer.

        -  To test functional imaging as a non-invasive tool to measure treatment response and
           validate this using biological endpoints.

        -  To develop clinical models to predict how tumors will respond to AD and identify new
           targets once AD fails.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Group A: Patients likely to receive androgen deprivation (AD) as first-line therapy
           undergo blood and prostate biopsy sample collection before and after treatment on days 0
           and 14 or 90. Patients receive an androgen receptor inhibitor followed by maintenance
           with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue beginning on day 0. Patients also undergo
           diffusion-weighted MRI, MR spectroscopic imagining, quantitative T1W mapping, and T1W
           perfusion sequence.

        -  Group B: Patients already receiving AD undergo blood and prostate biopsy sample
           collection within 4 weeks of diagnosis of castration-resistant prostate cancer and
           before initiating any second-line therapy.

      Blood and tissue samples are assessed via DNA and RNA genetic analysis, gene expression
      studies, and comparative genomic hybridization to identify novel markers of androgen response
      and resistance.
