      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at blood and tissue samples from patients with larynx
      cancer, pharynx cancer, or oral cavity cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Characterize, morphologically and molecularly, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx,
           pharynx, or oral cavity in patients without high-risk factors, such as alcohol
           consumption, smoking, or occupation.

      Secondary

        -  Study the impact parameters of morphology, molecular characteristics, and genomics on
           disease-free survival and overall survival of these patients.

        -  Study the impact parameters of morphological, molecular, and genomic control in the
           tumor.

        -  Assess, in advanced tumors, the risk of heterogeneity of morphological, molecular, and
           genomic control in the tumor.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Blood, tumor tissue, and healthy tissue samples are collected before treatment begins.

      Patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years (additional biopsies may be collected).
