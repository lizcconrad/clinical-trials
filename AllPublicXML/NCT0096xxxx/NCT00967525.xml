  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial the investigators seek to determine if injecting cord blood cells directly into
      the bone marrow (intraosseous injection), rather than infusing them intravenously, can
      improve engraftment. The rational for doing this is that most hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)
      infused intravenously never reach the bone marrow, getting trapped by other organs, such as
      the lungs, instead. The potential advantage of intraosseous infusion is suggested by studies
      in rodents that have demonstrated that in HSC transplants where the cell dose is limiting
      intraosseous injection is a more effective route of administration. The safety of
      intraosseous injections, in general, is underscored by the vast experience using intraosseous
      injections for resuscitation of critically ill children. The safety of injecting HSCs
      intraosseously has been demonstrated in a clinical trial of transplanting bone marrow cells.

      To safeguard against problems that might result, if intraosseous infusion fails to improve
      engraftment in this trial, the investigators will integrate a recently introduced strategy
      proven to improve engraftment-the transplantation of two cord blood units. Transplanting two
      unrelated cord blood units by intravenous infusion has been shown to improve engraftment
      (although there is still room for improvement). In this trial one unit will be injected
      intraosseously and the other unit will be infused intravenously.

      This study is being conducted as a forerunner to a larger, multi-center trial. The
      investigators intend to enroll five patients over 1-2 years.

      Hematopoietic (blood forming) stem cells (HSCs) reside primarily in the bone marrow.
      Traditionally, HSCs have been obtained directly from the bone marrow. Transplants using cells
      obtained this way are referred to as bone marrow transplants. HSCs also circulate in the
      blood. Transplants using cells obtained from the blood of children and adults are referred to
      as peripheral blood stem cell transplants. The blood of fetuses is especially rich in HSCs
      and these cells can be easily collected at birth from the placenta. Transplants using these
      cells are called cord blood transplants. Although HSCs can be collected from various sites,
      all HSC transplants, regardless of the source, are given to recipients by intravenous
      infusion. The transplanted HSCs then migrate to the bone marrow.

      Over the past ten years unrelated cord blood transplantation has become an accepted
      alternative to bone marrow transplantation. African-Americans and other minorities, who are
      underrepresented in the National Marrow Donor Program, have benefited particularly from this.
      In infants and young children cord blood transplantation appears to be as effective as bone
      marrow transplantation. In older children, adolescents and adults, however, cord blood
      transplantation has not been as effective, primarily because most cord blood units provide an
      insufficient number of cells to ensure prompt and reliable engraftment (&quot;taking&quot; of the
      transplanted cells in the recipient's bone marrow).
