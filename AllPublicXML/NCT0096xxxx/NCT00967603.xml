      RATIONALE: Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      tyrosine kinases needed for angiogenesis and cell growth. It is not yet known whether
      sunitinib malate is effective as maintenance therapy in delaying tumor progression in
      patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who are progression-free after 6 months of
      induction chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying sunitinib malate as maintenance therapy
      to see how well it works compared with observation in avoiding tumor progression after
      induction chemotherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the 6-month progression-free survival of patients with metastatic pancreatic
           cancer without progression after 6 months of induction chemotherapy treated with
           sunitinib malate as maintenance therapy vs observation.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms:

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily for up to 6 months in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation only.
