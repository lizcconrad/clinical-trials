      This study aims to examine the efficacy of an Integrative approach utilizing Chiropractic as
      an add-on therapy for the treatment back and neck pain in an emergency department setting

      Chiropractic is well established as an effective treatment for back pain. The investigators
      cumulative experience in Asaf Harofeh Medical Center has shown Chiropractic to be an
      effective therapy for simple back and neck pain in an emergency room (ER) setting.

      This study will examine weather Chiropractic can decrease pain, increase range of motion and
      decrease anxiety in patients admitted to the Emergency Room with simple back and neck pain
      without neurological findings. Chiropractic will be performed as an add on therapy on top of
      analgesic therapy.
