  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, single-blind
      trial of three different doses of etonogestrel releasing medicated intrauterine systems
      (ENG-MIUS) in healthy parous women in need for contraception.

      The primary trial objective is to explore safety and acceptability of three doses of an
      ENG-releasing medicated intrauterine system (ENG-MIUS) as compared to Multiload-cu 375®.
