    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Reported Pain Relief at 120 Minutes Post-Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>120 minutes post-treatment (Randomization through Final Visit [Week 6])</time_frame>
    <description>Pain relief was defined as at least a 2-grade reduction in pain intensity on a 5-grade scale in participants who had not used headache rescue medication before assessment. A pain intensity score of 5 was assigned for all subsequent assessments if a participant took rescue medication (a single oral dose for the treatment of migraine pain or associated symptoms). The 5-grade scale is a participant's self-rating scale to assess the pain intensity of a migraine with the following scores: 1 = none, 2 = mild, 3 = mild to moderate, 4 = moderate to severe, and 5 = severe.</description>

    <description>Vomiting is one of the associated symptoms of a migraine. A participant was assessed as being free of vomiting when the symptom was recorded as &quot;absent&quot; at each time point in his or her patient diary.

        <description>Pain relief was defined as at least a 2-grade reduction in pain intensity on a 5-grade scale in participants who had not used headache rescue medication before assessment. A pain intensity score of 5 was assigned for all subsequent assessments if a participant took rescue medication (a single oral dose for the treatment of migraine pain or associated symptoms). The 5-grade scale is a participant's self-rating scale to assess the pain intensity of a migraine with the following scores: 1 = none, 2 = mild, 3 = mild to moderate, 4 = moderate to severe, and 5 = severe.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Were Pain Free at 30, 60, 120, and 240 Minutes Post-Treatment</title>
        <description>Pain free was defined as a post-treatment pain intensity score of 1 on a 5-grade scale in participants who had not used headache rescue medication before assessment. A pain intensity score of 5 was assigned for all subsequent assessments if a participant took a rescue medication. The 5-grade scale is a participant's self-rating scale to assess the pain intensity of a migraine with the following scores: 1 = none, 2 =mild, 3=mild to moderate, 4=moderate to severe, and 5=severe.</description>
