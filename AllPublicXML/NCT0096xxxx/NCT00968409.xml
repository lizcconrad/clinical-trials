  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging with a
      radioactive form of the hormone progesterone called FFNP will give the same results as
      hormone receptor testing already performed on tissue used to diagnose breast cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients 18 years of age or older

          -  Biopsy-proven breast cancer

          -  Tumor estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor status already determined or
             scheduled to be determined at time of surgery without intervening therapy.

          -  Primary lesion size ≥ 1.5 cm as determined by imaging studies (ultrasonography,
             mammography, CT or MRI) or physical examination

          -  Able to give informed consent

          -  Not currently pregnant or nursing: Subject must be surgically sterile (has had a
             documented bilateral oophorectomy and / or documented hysterectomy), post menopausal
             (cessation of menses for more than 1 year), non lactating, or of childbearing
             potential for whom a urine pregnancy test (with the test performed within the 24 hour
             period immediately prior to administration of FFNP) is negative.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No previous history of hormone therapy; NOTE - subjects who were treated with hormone
             therapy for reasons other than breast cancer or breast cancer prevention may be
             allowed to participate after review of history by the primary investigator

          -  Patients with other invasive malignancies, with the exception of non-melanoma skin
             cancer, who had (or have) any evidence of the other cancer present within the last 5
             years

          -  Unable to tolerate 60-90 minutes of PET imaging per imaging session
