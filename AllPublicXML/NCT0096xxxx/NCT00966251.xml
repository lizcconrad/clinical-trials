        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects aged 18 years and above, both genders.

          2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed Primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)

          3. No fibrolamellar subtype HCC

          4. Not eligible for any other systemic anti-neoplastic treatment approved for HCC

          5. Not eligible for Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE ).

          6. No more than 1 prior systemic therapy. Previous TACE or Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)
             that were used for HCC, are permitted.

          7. Not a candidate for curative surgical resection or liver transplantation

          8. Measurable disease defined by the identification at least 1 measurable lesion by MRI
             using RECIST criteria. Tumor in area of TACE or RFA must be enlarging post-procedure
             to be considered measurable disease.

          9. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN)

         10. Child's Pugh classification A

         11. ECOG performance status 0-1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients progressing to liver failure.

          2. No core biopsy within the past 7 days

          3. Patients who are eligible for Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE)

          4. Patients on concurrent anti-neoplastic therapy (including interferon)

          5. Patients who have received any systemic anti-neoplastic therapy not approved for the
             treatment of HCC.

          6. Patients on concurrent steroids, other than those allowed for routine antiemetics, or
             inhaled steroids

          7. Presence of metastasis.
