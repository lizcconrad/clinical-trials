      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an individualized approach to diagnosing and/or
      treating atherosclerosis. This will be done by combining genetic information, lifestyle
      information, participant education, and imaging tests to track diagnoses, therapies, and
      treatment on two groups: 1) Standard Management Group (diagnosed and/or treated according to
      standard of care) and 2) Individualized Management Group (standard of care plus genetic
      testing and coronary artery calcium scans).

      The purpose of this proposal is to create a large, community-based demonstration project to
      evaluate the value of a highly individualized approach to atherosclerosis risk reduction. In
      this project we set out to compare the delivery of appropriate therapies and resource
      utilization using current national guidelines for the management of atherosclerosis and will
      compare this to using a highly individualized approach for atherosclerosis risk reduction,
      based on the evaluation of specific features in individuals and tailoring management based on
      this evaluation. We plan to show that utilizing the iCARE Program, more patients will receive
      appropriate diagnoses and subsequent therapies in a more efficient manner.
