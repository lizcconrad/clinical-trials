      RATIONALE: Studying immune response to flu vaccine in patients who have undergone a stem cell
      transplant may help doctors plan the best treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying flu vaccine to see how well it works in preventing
      infection in patients who have undergone a stem cell transplant and in healthy volunteers.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Examine the humoral and cellular memory immune responses to influenza immunization in
           patients who have undergone autologous or allogeneic hematologic stem cell
           transplantation.

        -  Examine the impact of graft-vs-host disease on immune reconstitution and vaccine
           response in these patients.

        -  Examine the impact of age ≥ 60 years on immune reconstitution after vaccination in these
           patients.

        -  Examine and compare the cellular memory immune response to influenza immunization in
           healthy volunteers versus the response in these patients.

        -  Examine the differences between CD8, CD4, and antibody response to circulating flu
           strains compared to immune response to flu vaccination in immunized vs non-immunized
           patients who were transplanted at a similar time and from the same transplant source.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to transplantation
      type and response (allogeneic HCT with no acute or chronic GVHD vs allogeneic HCT with acute
      or chronic GVHD vs autologous HCT) and patient age (≥ 60 years vs &lt; 60 years).

      Beginning 100-364 days post-transplantation patients receive vaccine to immunize against
      influenza A serotypes specific for influenza seasons 2006-2008, and/or vaccine to immunize
      against influenza A and B serotypes specific for influenza seasons 2009-2011. Healthy
      participants receive vaccine to immunize against influenza A serotypes specific for influenza
      season 2007-2008.

      Blood samples from patients and healthy participants are collected at baseline and at days
      30, 90, 180, and 360 post-vaccination for humoral immunity and antibody analysis by ELISA and
      hemagglutination-inhibition test (HAI) testing.
