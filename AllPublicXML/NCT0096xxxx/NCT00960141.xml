    <time_frame>Week 2 (or upon discontinuation)</time_frame>
    <description>An evaluation by the patient, administered at the last visit (or upon discontinuation) using a 7-point scale, in answer to a single question regarding the change in symptoms as compared to the beginning of the study. Responses were assigned numerical values from 0 (very much better) to 6 (very much worse).</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality-of-Life Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Patients completed a validated, self-administered questionnaire, which included 28 questions on a 7-point scale [score 0 (best) to 6 (worst)] across 7 domains: activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotional. The scores for each domain were averaged, then the scores for the 7 domains were averaged for the overall score.</description>

          <description>Patients were asked to rate each of 4 nasal symptoms (Congestion, Rhinorrhea, Itching, and Sneezing) daily in the evening on a 4-point scale [0(best) to 3(worst)]. The Daytime Nasal Symptoms Score is the average of these 4 symptoms . Baseline is computed as average of daily values during the prerandomization run-in period (includes the 3 to 5 days prior to Visit 3).</description>

          <title>Physician's Global Evaluation of Allergic Rhinitis</title>
          <description>An evaluation by the physician, administered at the last visit (or upon discontinuation) using a 7-point scale, of the change in symptoms as compared to the beginning of the study. Responses were assigned numerical values from 0 (very much better) to 6 (very much worse).</description>
          <population>The primary efficacy analyses were based on the intention-to-treat. Since only 1 measurement was obtained during the treatment period, no missing values were imputed.</population>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality-of-Life Score</title>
        <description>Patients completed a validated, self-administered questionnaire, which included 28 questions on a 7-point scale [score 0 (best) to 6 (worst)] across 7 domains: activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotional. The scores for each domain were averaged, then the scores for the 7 domains were averaged for the overall score.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 2</time_frame>
        <population>The primary efficacy analyses were based on the intention-to-treat (all-patients-treated) principle, i.e., all patients who had a baseline and at least one posttreatment measurement were included. No missing values were imputed.</population>
