      The Purpose of this study is to report a new single portal endoscopic release technique and
      the sequence of the first 50 patients who underwent this release.

      This will be a chart review of the demographics, outcomes, and complications of a sequential
      series of patients undergoing a Seg-Way Endoscopic carpal tunnel release (ECTR).
