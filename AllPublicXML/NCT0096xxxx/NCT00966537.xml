      The aim of this study is 1) to study the clinical application of 3D/4D ultrasound for fetal
      scanning during pregnancy; 2) ) to study the clinical application of 3D/4D ultrasound for
      pelvic scanning; 3) to demonstrate how to optimally display the different organs. 4) to
      correlate our findings with other diagnostic tools like MRI, CT; 5) to correlate our findings
      with clinical outcome.

      A prospective studies of patients that coming to the ultrasound (US) unit in Sheba Medical
      Center from November 2007 for diagnostic US examination.

      Patients will receive information of the study (printed and oral) and will ask to sign
      informed consent to act as a research subject and permission to use personal heath
      information for research.

      Studies is performed using commercially available ultrasound equipment (Voluson 730 Expert,
      General Electric Healthcare, Kretztechnik, Zipf, Austria) with volumetric abdominal RAB 4-8
      MHz and volumetric transvaginal RIC 5-9 MHz transducer probes.

      During the examination of the patient pictures and 3D/4D volumes will acquired either by
      static 3D or 4D Volume or STIC (Spacio Temporal Image Corelation), Contrast Imaging in plane
      C (VCI-C) with and without Doppler (Color, Power and High Definition) and with B-flow. Image
      quality will be assessed in various modes. For optimizing the image volumes manipulations
      will be performed by positioning of the
