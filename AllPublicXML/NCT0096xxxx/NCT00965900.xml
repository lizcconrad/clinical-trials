      This study is performed to compare the efficacy and safety of EBL, propranolol, and EBL
      combined with propranolol in patients with medium or large varices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current guidelines recommend prophylactic treatment with propranolol or endoscopic band
      ligation (EBL) to prevent variceal bleeding in patients with medium or large varices.
      However, it is unclear which treatment is more useful in regard to prevention of variceal
      bleeding as well as safety. In addition, the efficacy and safety of the combination of EBL
      and propranolol is not still defined. This study is performed to compare the efficacy and
      safety of EBL, propranolol, and EBL combined with propranolol in patients with medium or
      large varices.
