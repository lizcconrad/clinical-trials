      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue and blood from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to
      treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tumor and blood samples from postmenopausal women
      with primary breast cancer enrolled on clinical trial CAN-NCIC-MA27.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To identify genetic variation, as measured by single nucleotide polymorphisms, that is
           associated with musculoskeletal adverse events in specimens from postmenopausal women
           with hormone receptor-positive primary breast cancer receiving adjuvant aromatase
           inhibitors and enrolled on clinical trial CAN-NCIC-MA27.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      DNA from tumor tissue and blood specimens that have been previously collected from patients
      are analyzed for single nucleotide polymorphisms.
