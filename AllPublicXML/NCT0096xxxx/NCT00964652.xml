      Background: Studies about the effects of walking training with additional body load in
      Parkinson's disease (PD) are lacking. There is evidence that the increase of body load during
      treadmill walking improves reflex activity and leg extensor muscle activity, which are
      impaired in subjects with PD.

      Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of treadmill walking training
      with additional body load on the ground reaction forces, spatiotemporal, and kinematic
      variables of the gait of subjects with moderate PD.

      Design: This study was an A1-B-A2 single-case. Setting: The evaluation and the training were
      conducted in a movement analysis laboratory, and at the rehabilitation unit of the
      University, respectively.

      Participants: Nine patients with PD (Hoehn and Yahr 2 through 3) and gait disturbances.

      Interventions: Phases A1 and A2 included 6 weeks of gait training on a treadmill with 10%
      increase of normal body mass. Phase B included 6 weeks of conventional physical therapy.

      Measurements: Measures included the ground reaction forces, spatiotemporal, and kinematic
      variables during overground walking, at baseline and after each phase.

    <description>The training program was divided into three phases (A1-B-A2):
treadmill training with additional body load (A1), control condition (conventional physical therapy) (B). and treadmill training with additional body load again (A2). Each phase lasted six weeks, totaling 18 weeks. Both evaluations and training were performed during on-phase of the medication cycle.</description>
