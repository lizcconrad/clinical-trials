  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2-arm randomized trial assessed the incremental effect of providing a lecture on
      Internet use followed by participation in an Internet-based peer support group following a
      week-long rehabilitation program, over and above any possible general effect of participation
      in the rehabilitation program.

      Primary outcome measures are adjustment to cancer and mood disturbance.

    <description>The Internet peer-support groups provided a self-guided space for communication, including an Internet discussion forum, a live chat room and a personal message system. No therapeutic content or information services were offered within the groups.
All Internet groups were run in a browser-based software platform with access through the website of the Danish Cancer Society (http://www.cancer.dk). All discussions were protected by a password and communication was encrypted.
The Internet groups in this study were all closed peer-support groups, accessible only by an invitation received by e-mail after registration for the study. The groups were open to access 24 h a day for 13 months from their individual starting date.</description>

        A total of 66 scheduled rehabilitation course weeks were screened for eligibility between
        19 April 2004 and 31 December 2005 from the Rehabilitation Centre Dallund in Denmark. All
        58 eligible courses including 921 individuals were enrolled and randomized as 27 case weeks
        (n = 416 persons) and 31 control weeks (n = 505 persons). Baseline assessments were
        obtained from 799 individuals. Data from 10 individuals (5 from each treatment group) were
        subsequently excluded, as they did not attend a rehabilitation course week as planned,
        leaving final study population of 794 individuals analyzed by 'intention-to-treat' (case: n
        = 361/794; control: n = 433/794). Participants were followed up for 12 months in accordance
        with their dates of attendance of the rehabilitation course from 19 April 2004 till 31
        December 2006.
