    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility and efficacy of an exercise
      intervention for the prevention of postpartum depression. If efficacious, our intervention
      could be disseminated in &quot;real world settings&quot; in an effort to prevent postpartum depression.

    <textblock>
      Recent estimates indicate that approximately 10-15% of women giving birth experience
      depression during the postpartum period (Dietz et al., 2007; Gaven et al., 2005). Research
      indicates that psychological interventions are efficacious for treating postpartum depression
      (Dennis &amp; Hodnett, 2007). However, it is important to also focus on the prevention of
      postpartum depression given many women do not seek treatment (Dennis &amp; Chung-Lee, 2006) and
      those who do seek treatment may have already experienced negative consequences related to
      depression including cessation of breastfeeding and poor maternal-child bonding (Dennis &amp;
      McQueen, 2007; Murray et al., 1999). Unfortunately, research indicates that psychological
      interventions are not efficacious in the prevention of postpartum depression among women at
      risk for postpartum depression (for a review see Dennis &amp; Creedy, 2004). Consequently, there
      is a need to test new and innovative interventions for the prevention of postpartum
      depression. Exercise interventions have been shown to be effective for the treatment of
      depression among adults and therefore, this intervention may be efficacious in the prevention
      of postpartum depression. The purpose of the present pilot study is to examine the
      feasibility of recruiting and retaining participants at risk for postpartum depression for a
      randomized trial examining an exercise intervention for the prevention of postpartum
      depression. We will also examine the preliminary efficacy of the exercise intervention on the
      prevention of postpartum depression. Specifically, 120 sedentary, healthy pregnant women who
      have a history of at least one depressive episode and/or have a maternal family history of
      depression will be recruited from various ObGyn clinics, psychiatry clinics, and via
      advertisements. Once the potential participants receive healthcare provider consent to
      exercise (approximately two weeks following a vaginal delivery and four weeks following a
      c-section), participants will then be randomly assigned to either an exercise intervention or
      a health and wellness contact control condition. The exercise condition will consist of
      telephone-based counseling sessions designed to motivate postpartum women to become
      physically active. This theory-based intervention will be based on interventions shown to be
      effective in previous studies. The contact control condition will consist of scheduled
      telephone sessions with a health educator on issues related to health and wellness (e.g.,
      stress reduction, sleep, nutrition). The specific aims of the study will be 1) to determine
      the feasibility of recruiting and retaining pregnant and postpartum women for an exercise
      intervention trial and 2) to determine the effect of a home-based behavioral exercise
      intervention on depression (as measured by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis
      I Disorders; SCID-I and the PHQ-9) among postpartum women. Physical activity adherence will
      be assessed using the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall Interview (Blair et al., 1985) and
      accelerometers (i.e., an objective assessment of physical activity).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  We will recruit healthy, sedentary (defined as exercising 60 minutes or less per week)
             women who are at least 18 years of age and at least 28 weeks pregnant or less than one
             month postpartum (n=120). Participants will be required to obtain written consent from
             their healthcare provider to participate. This written consent will be obtained
             following delivery of the newborn. Participants will complete a telephone screening
             interview to assess eligibility. Current depressive episode will be assessed using the
             PHQ-9 (cut-off will be 10 or higher). As we have done in previous trials, we will have
             a protocol in place that deals with participants expressing suicidal ideation ranging
             from referring them to their healthcare provider and/or calling emergency assistance,
             depending on intent. To be included, participants must be willing to be randomly
             assigned to either of the two study arms. Additionally, participants will read and
             sign a consent form approved by the University of Minnesota and have all of their
             questions will be answered prior to participating.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No healthcare provider consent to participate

          -  Pre-existing hypertension or diabetes

          -  Current participation in exercise (defined as exercising 60 or more minutes per week)

          -  Currently enrolled in another exercise or weight management study

          -  Less than 18 years of age

          -  Another member of household participating in the study

          -  Unable to speak, comprehend, read, or write fluently in the English language

          -  Unable to walk for 30 minutes continuously

          -  Musculoskeletal problems such as arthritis, gout, osteoporosis, or back, hip or knee
             pain that may interfere with exercising

          -  Exercise-induced asthma

          -  Any condition that would make exercise unsafe or unwise

          -  Taking medication that interferes with heart rate response to exercise such as beta
             blockers

          -  Hospitalization for a psychiatric disorder in the past six months

          -  Current depressive episode and/or currently receiving antidepressant medication or
             psychotherapy for depression (those who are depressed and who are not in treatment
             will be referred to their physician or psychiatrist for follow-up care)

        In addition to the initial exclusion criteria listed above, we will withdraw the exercise
        intervention and instruct the participant to contact their healthcare provider if the
        participant develops a medical issue in which exercise would be unsafe.
