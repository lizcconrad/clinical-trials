    <textblock>
      Oxidative stress is an unavoidable event during cardiac surgery. Isoprostanes have been
      demonstrated to be a reliable biomarker for the evaluation of oxidative stress in vivo.The
      aims of this study are(1)to develop an accurate liquid chromatography-tandem mass
      spectrometry methods for the detection of urinary isoprostane isomers in samples collected
      from healthy volunteers(for method quality control) and patients receiving a cardiac surgery
      (2)to investigate the change of isoprostanes after cardiopulmonary bypass(CPB) (3)to
      investigate the effect of different anesthetics on isoprostanes.

      Enhanced production of oxygen free radicals can lead to the generation of oxidative stress,
      which is harmful to human tissue and organs. Reactive oxygen species are released abruptly
      during some surgical procedures, and they are the major causes of ischemia-reperfusion
      injuries.Isoprostanes have been demonstrated to be a reliable biomarker for the evaluation of
      oxidative stress in vivo. Therefore, accurately monitoring and avoiding the occurrence of
      oxidative stress during surgery is an important clinical issue.

      Isoprostanes are a series of prostaglandin-like compounds produced by non-enzymatic
      peroxidation of arachidonic acid.The aims of this study are(1)to develop an accurate liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods for the detection of urinary isoprostane
      isomers in samples collected from patients receiving a cardiac surgery (2)to investigate the
      change of isoprostanes after cardiopulmonary bypass (3)to investigate the effect of different
      anesthetics on isoprostanes during surgery.

      thirty milliliters of urine was collected from urine bag of patients at the following times:
      baseline before anesthesia, 30 minutes before cardiopulmonary bypass, during cardiopulmonary
      bypass, after the end of cardiopulmonary bypass.
