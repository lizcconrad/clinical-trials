  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and debilitating anxiety disorder which is widespread in
      every social level and is very prevalent in outpatient and inpatient settings.

      A recent open-label study showed that the synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist Nabilone had
      beneficial effects abolishing or greatly reducing nightmares that persisted in spite of
      treatment with conventional PTSD medications. Furthermore, a big number of patients suffering
      from chronic PTSD report using smoked marijuana because its tranquilizing effect and sleep
      quality improvement. According to clinical and epidemiological data different derivates from
      the cannabis plant are illegally and pervasively consumed by PTSD patients in order to reduce
      distress.

      The aim of the proposed study is to broaden the previous observations and to measure the
      extent to which Δ 9-THC will bring to significant improvement on the full spectrum of PTSD
      symptoms.
