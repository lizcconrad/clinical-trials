  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to learn what the needs are in relation to the family members. Some
      family members seek counseling; others do not. The institution wants to try to understand why
      and wants to see if they can improve our support services for family members.

        Patients whose family caregivers may be eligible for this study will be identified by a
        member of the patient's treatment team, the protocol investigator, or research team at
        Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) or Queens Cancer Center (QCC).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary family caregiver identified by a patient who is approximately within 4 to 6
             weeks of a new visit to a thoracic clinic and receiving cancer care at Memorial
             Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center or Queens Cancer Center

          -  Caregiver is at least 18 years of age.

          -  Caregiver has adequate English fluency for completion of data collection. The surveys
             were designed and validated in English and are not currently available in other
             languages. Translation of questionnaires into other languages would require
             reestablishing the reliability and validity of these measures. Therefore, participants
             must be able to communicate in English to complete the surveys.

          -  Clinically meaningful distress defined as a score of 8 or greater on the Anxiety or
             Depression subscale of the HADS (see Bjelland et al., 2002; Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 1983).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients or caregivers exhibiting significant psychiatric or cognitive impairment
             (dementia/delirium, retardation, active psychosis) that in the judgment of the
             investigators would preclude providing informed consent and study participation

          -  Patient has lung cancer recurrence

          -  Currently participating in a psychosocial intervention trial
