  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dendritic cell therapy is a promising strategy for adjuvant cancer therapy in the setting of
      minimal residual disease (MRD) to fight off cancer relapse and/or progression. The
      investigators already performed a phase I safety study in leukemia patients that were in
      complete remission demonstrating the absence of side effects and feasibility of the therapy.
      Here, the investigators want to extend on this strategy by studying the clinical efficacy of
      autologous DC vaccination in patients with acute and chronic myeloid leukemia and myeloma
      patients. Effects of DC therapy on the immune reactivity towards leukemia cells as well as
      clinical parameters such molecular MRD monitoring, time to relapse (TTR), progression-free
      survival (PFS) and overall survival(OS) will be studied in vaccinated and non-vaccinated
      (control) patients. Patients will be vaccinated using their own dendritic cells
      electroporated with mRNA coding for the full-length Wilms' tumor antigen WT1.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML): all FAB subtypes except M3. Extent of disease:

               -  clinical remission after at least one course of polychemotherapy

               -  high risk of relapse due to age (&gt; 60 years) or poor risk cytogenetic/molecular
                  markers or hyperleukocytosis at presentation or previous relapse

          -  Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML): patients in chronic phase under therapy with
             tyrosinase kinase inhibitors who have sub-optimal response or failure and who are not
             eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

          -  Multiple Myeloma (MM): symptomatic with active disease, independent of earlier and/or
             concomitant treatment:

               -  Presence of serum/urine M protein (&gt; 3 g/dl)

               -  Bone marrow plasmacytosis (&gt;10-30%)

               -  Anemia, renal failure, hypercalcemia, and/or lytic bone lesions

          -  Overexpression of WT1 RNA in peripheral blood and or bone marrow as assessed by
             quantitative RT-PCR at the time of presentation.For CML: residual molecular disease as
             demonstrated by BCR-ABL RT-PCR

          -  Prior treatments: Patients must have received at least one prior antileukemic
             chemotherapeutic regimen and must be more than 1 month past the last treatment.

          -  Age: ≥ 18 years

          -  Performance status: WHO PS grade 0-1 (Appendix B)

          -  Objectively assessable parameters of life expectancy: more than 3 months

          -  Prior and concomitant associated diseases allowed with the exception of underlying
             autoimmune disease and positive serology for HIV/HBV/HCV

          -  No concomitant use of immunosuppressive drugs

          -  adequate renal and liver function, i.e. creatinin and bilirubin = 1.2 times the upper
             limit of normal

          -  absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those
             conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial

          -  Women of child-bearing potential should use adequate contraception prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation
