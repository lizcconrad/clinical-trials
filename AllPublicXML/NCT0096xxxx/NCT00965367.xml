  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) remain a significant challenge in the investigators
      practice. However, pharmaceutical prophylaxis can imply unpleasant adverse effects. It would
      therefore be appropriate to consider the use of non-pharmacological methods in preventing
      PONV. Acupuncture and acupressure are reported to be effective preventive treatment for PONV,
      and the adverse effects are minimal.

      Consequently, the investigators will investigate if acupuncture and acupressure can be
      implemented as a supplementary to the ordinary treatment in children undergoing surgery for
      tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. The study will also focus on the feasibility for
      acupuncture and acupressure in the operation theatre. The study and inclusion/exclusion
      decisions are conducted after the &quot;intention-to-treat&quot; principle. 126 patients are included,
      divided into two groups:

        1. Treatment Group - standard treatment and acupuncture performed after induction of
           anaesthesia, acupressure administered before awakening

        2. Control Group - standard treatment

      The primarily endpoints in this study are nausea, retching and vomiting. The effect of
      acupuncture/acupressure will be studied with regard to any association with possible factors
      of predisposition to PONV, as well as with other factors registered during the study. Adverse
      effects from the acupuncture site and wristband will be registered.
