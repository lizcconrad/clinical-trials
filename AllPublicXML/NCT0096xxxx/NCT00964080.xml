  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ongoing study is a Phase II, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy of MBP-426 at a
      dose of 170 mg/m2 in combination therapy in patients with second line metastatic gastric,
      gastro-esophageal junction or esophageal adenocarcinoma.

      This study will start with a Phase Ib portion, at a dose of 226 mg/m2, a dose in which good
      tolerability was demonstrated in the Phase I trial. A cohort may be enrolled at 301 mg/m2, if
      226 mg/m2 is well tolerated. The dose determined from the Phase Ib portion of the study will
      then be evaluated in the Phase II portion.

      This design will permit evaluation of a true positive or negative response while limiting
      over exposure of patients to the study drug. If this regimen does offer a positive response,
      its reduced toxicity and potentially greater efficacy may yield better outcomes for patients
      requiring second-line therapy for UGI cancer.

      Following completion of the Phase Ib part of the present trial, the dose recommended for use
      in the Phase II part is 170 mg/m2 MBP-426.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Phase Ib:

          1. Advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancy that is refractory to STD therapy, or
             that has relapsed after STD therapy, or for which conventional therapy is not reliably
             effective, or no effective therapy is available.

          2. Measurable disease as defined by RECIST. If recurrence is documented following
             radiation therapy, the recurrence must have occurred outside the radiation field.
             Lesions which are located within a previously irradiated field are not considered
             measurable.
