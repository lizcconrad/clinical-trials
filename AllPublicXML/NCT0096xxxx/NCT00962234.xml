    <textblock>
      The causes of failing nutrition status in advanced cancer are not well known. The way fat is
      moved, stored, burned or changed into other compounds may be affected and will be followed in
      patients using a tracer and other blood tests. The investigators hypothesize that fat loss
      and wasting results from low essential fatty acid availability in the body. Changes may occur
      in the liver that limits distribution and availability of fat to the body as an energy source
      or for other essential functions.

    <textblock>
      Weight loss in cancer is the result of breakdown of fat (lipid) and muscle protein reserves.
      This research will explore how people with cancer use fat in their body through the use of
      tracers and measures in the blood. A stable isotope of hydrogen called 'deuterium' is used to
      trace the production of different fats by the liver. Other methods will determine how much
      and what types of fat are transported around the body. Body composition will be determined by
      CT scan and related to fat measures.

    <description>Metabolic rate testing is a painless, non-invasive test that takes about 1h. A metabolic cart is used, which detects the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide the body uses. Patients will lie down on a bed for 30 minutes with lights dimmed and soft music to help them relax. After 30 minutes, a canopy will be placed over the patient's head and shoulders for 30 minutes for the analysis of breath samples. This test will be performed only once for this study.</description>
