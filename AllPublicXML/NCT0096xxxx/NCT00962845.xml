      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood, tumor tissue, and skin in the laboratory from patients
      with melanoma receiving hydroxychloroquine may help doctors understand the effect of
      hydroxychloroquine on biomarkers.

      PURPOSE: This early phase I trial is studying hydroxychloroquine in patients with stage III
      or stage IV melanoma that can be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To characterize the effects of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on the modulation of markers of
           autophagy, as measured by p62, Beclin1, LC3, and GRp170 expression, in pre- and
           post-treatment tumor biopsy samples, skin samples, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell
           samples from patients with stage III or IV melanoma undergoing palliative or curative
           surgery.

      Secondary

        -  To determine whether the steady-state plasma concentration of HCQ correlates with
           observed trends in induced markers of autophagy.

        -  To determine the potential mechanisms of antitumor effect of HCQ, as measured by a
           reduction in tumor cell proliferation (Ki-67 and mitotic rate) or an increase in
           apoptosis (activated caspase-3 and TUNEL assays) in melanoma specimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral hydroxychloroquine twice daily for 14 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo surgery.

      Blood, tumor tissue, and skin samples are collected for pharmacokinetic and correlative
      laboratory studies. Expression of p62, Beclin1, LC3, and GRp170 (autophagy markers) is
      analyzed.

    <description>Patients must have tumor accessible for pre-treatment biopsy (see 5.1.2). Patients will be enrolled on the trial, undergo biopsy of their tumors if no banked tumor is available, and then begin an oral dose of HCQ at the dose of 200 mg twice daily. At the end of two weeks the patients will undergo resection of their tumors. HCQ will be given to the patients up to the day of the operation but not resumed postoperatively.</description>

    <description>200 mg twice daily in the first ten patients. If the first ten patients tolerate this dosage schedule (200 mg bid) without significant side effects (Grade 3 or greater gastrointestinal upset, skin toxicity, myopathy or any visual disturbances whatsoever), the second ten patients will be enrolled at a dose of 400 mg bid</description>
