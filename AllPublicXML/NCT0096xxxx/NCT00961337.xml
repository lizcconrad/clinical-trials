  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether inactivated influenza vaccines are
      effective to protect school children and their households from getting influenza infection
      and further prevent student's absenteeism.

      School children were found to be the possible spreaders of the influenza. The successful
      prevention measure on school children was crucial for controlling the epidemic. In Taiwan,
      the national influenza immunization program on the grade 1-2 students started in winter,
      2007. In this intervention study, the two study townships with 27 schools were included as
      our study population. The three time questionnaires were issued for collecting the health
      status of the children during the influenza season. The information on the vaccines' safety
      was also collected after the vaccination. The community collaborative clinics were
      responsible for taking the specimens.
