  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of treatment with bevacizumab +
      cisplatin + cetuximab + IMRT. The doctor wishes to monitor patients for 2 years after the
      completion of study treatment to determine if they are cancer-free during that time. They
      also want to evaluate the side effects that patients experience with this treatment regimen.

    <description>This is a single-institution, non-randomized, phase II study. The primary endpoint is to determine 2-year progression-free survival for patients with locally or regionally advanced HNSCC treated with concurrent intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) + cisplatin + bevacizumab + cetuximab.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in once-daily fractions. A total dose of 70Gy is planned for the primary tumor site over approximately 33 treatment days. Day 1 will refer to the first day of radiation therapy. Concurrent with radiation therapy, patients will receive cisplatin (50 mg/m2 IV on Days 1, 2 and 22, 23) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg IV on Days 1 and 22). Cetuximab will be administered according to the Bonner regimen (4),with a loading dose approximately 7 days prior to the start of radiation therapy (400 mg/m2 IV once, on approximately Day minus 7), followed by weekly cetuximab infusions (250 mg/m2 IV weekly X 7 infusions) until the completion of radiation therapy.</description>

             carcinoma of the hypopharynx will also be eligible

          -  Adequate renal function, with serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL. Patients with serum
             creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL may be eligible if calculated creatinine clearance &gt; or = to 55
             ml/min by Cockcroft and Gault equation (or 24-hour urine collection).

          -  Age &gt; or = to 18 years.

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt; or = to 70%

          -  Adequate bone marrow function: absolute neutrophil count &gt; or = to 1,500/ platelets &gt;
             or = to 100,000/ul, hemoglobin &gt; or = to 9 gm/dl

          -  Adequate hepatic function: Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN (patients with Gilbert's
             syndrome as the cause of hyperbilirubinemia may be eligible if total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 X
             ULN), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 X ULN, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤
             2.5 X ULN, alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 X ULN.

          -  Men and women of childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective
             contraception while on treatment and for at least 3 months thereafter.

          -  Patients must have ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior radiation therapy for HNSCC

          -  Prior treatment of HNSCC with bevacizumab or other agents specifically targeting VEGF

             cancer within the no current biochemical (PSA) or radiologic evidence of disease may
             enroll.

             a clinically significant way with activities of daily living).

          -  Patients with multifocal peripheral sensory alterations or paresthesias (including
             tingling) interfering with function, per patient report (example: activities of daily
             living).

          -  Urine protein: creatinine (UPC) ratio &gt; or = to 1.0 at screening. A random urine
             sample is collected. Total protein (mg/dL) and spot creatinine (mg/dL) are ordered for
             this sample. The UPC ratio is calculated from the results of these tests.

          -  International normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 1.5 or activated partial thromboplastin time
             (aPTT) &gt; 1.5 X upper limits of normal (ULN)

          -  Current use of warfarin, current use of heparin or low-molecular weight heparin,

             eligible, at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Anatomic lesion that increases the risk of serious hemorrhage, such as encasement or
             invasion of major blood vessels by primary tumor and/or by involved lymph nodes

          -  Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease

          -  History of bleeding diathesis or hemorrhagic disorder, or coagulopathy.

          -  Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to
             treatment with bevacizumab

          -  Core biopsy within 7 days prior to treatment with bevacizumab.
