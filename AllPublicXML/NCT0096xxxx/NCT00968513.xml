  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a three group additive design, this randomized clinical trial (N=1100) aims to evaluate
      tobacco cessation treatments of varying intensities initiated in the acute psychiatric
      inpatient setting. The three groups are:

        1. Usual Care (N=150) consisting of brief cessation advice, a quit smoking guide, and
           nicotine replacement provided during hospitalization;

        2. Brief Treatment (N=475) adds a stage-based manual, computer-delivered stage-tailored
           individualized feedback and brief cessation counseling sessions during hospitalization
           and repeated at months 3 and 6, and access to 12 weeks of nicotine replacement following
           hospitalization;

        3. Extended Treatment (N=475) builds upon our current brief treatment and provides 12
           additional weeks of nicotine replacement (24 weeks total) with individualized,
           counselor-delivered motivational and manualized cognitive behavioral cessation
           treatment.

      This study seeks to determine: (i) whether the initial successes seen in an academic-based
      psychiatric hospital can be replicated in a larger and more diverse patient population; and
      (ii) if more extended and intensive treatment combining nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)
      with individualized, counselor-delivered motivational and manualized cessation-focused
      cognitive behavioral counseling (CBT) can outperform our current best practices. Ultimately,
      this research could lead to a model smoking cessation intervention for smokers with severe
      mental illness and, more generally, may provide a useful model for understanding the nature
      and complexity of intervening on comorbidities.

      We hypothesize that the extended treatment will outperform the brief treatment, and that both
      treatment groups will be more effective than usual care in producing quit attempts and
      ultimately abstinence from cigarettes. Secondary specific aims will model the
      cost-effectiveness and budgetary impacts of the treatment conditions; examine moderators and
      mediators of treatment outcomes; and prospectively examine the relation between changes in
      smoking, mental health functioning, and use of other substances over time.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants (N=1100) will be men and women 18 years of age and older, recruited from
             four acute inpatient psychiatry units at the Alta Bates Summit Medical Center -
             Herrick Campus, located in Berkeley, CA, one acute inpatient psychiatry unit at
             Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute, located in San Francisco, CA, and two acute
             inpatient psychiatry units at Stanford Hospital, located in Stanford, CA. Inclusion
             criteria are: smoking 5 or more cigarettes per day and at least 100 cigarettes in
             one's lifetime, no plan to relocate outside of the greater Bay Area in the next 18
             months, and telephone access for scheduling follow-up assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Study exclusion criteria are: dementia or other brain injury precluding ability to
             participate; non-English speaking; complete homelessness; pregnancy or breastfeeding,
             and active ulcer disease (PUD). The relationship between nicotine and ulcers is a
             theoretical concern and our approach to now exclude patients with active ulcer disease
             is conservative. There is no data to show NRT causes/worsens ulcers. Recruitment of
             acutely psychotic, manic, or hostile patients will be delayed until there is
             significant reduction of these symptoms and patients are able to consent to study
             participation. Threats of violence in particular are taken seriously, and patients
             will not be recruited if they may be a threat to study staff in the outpatient
             setting. At this point, non-English measurement and intervention materials are not
             available. Pregnant smokers will be referred out for more specialized behavioral
             treatments. Exclusionary criteria are purposefully minimal in order to maximize
             information about treating tobacco dependence in smokers in inpatient psychiatry. The
             study sample is anticipated to be diverse with respect to gender and ethnicity,
             educational and socioeconomic level, and psychiatric diagnoses.
