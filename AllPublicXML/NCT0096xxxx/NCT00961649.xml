      The purpose of this study was to compare the safety and intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering
      efficacy of a new fixed combination of brinzolamide/brimonidine (Brinz/Brim) to:

        -  its individual components (Brinz and Brim), and

        -  the concomitant administration of Brinz and Brim (Brinz+Brim).

      This study consisted of 5 visits conducted during 2 sequential phases: the
      screening/eligibility phase, which included a screening visit and 2 eligibility visits, and
      the treatment phase, which included 2 on-therapy visits conducted at Week 2 and Week 6 (or
      early exit). A washout period based on previous ocular medication preceded Eligibility Visit
      1. Subjects who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria at both eligibility visits were
      randomized to 1 of 4 study drug groups for 6 weeks. Study drug instillation began the morning
      after the second eligibility visit. The study was terminated by the sponsor out of caution
      due to microgel formation in the Brinz/Brim formulation. 13 remaining active subjects were
      discontinued. Further analysis revealed that neither the drop size nor the concentration of
      the active ingredients was affected.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Intraocular Pressure (IOP) From Baseline to Each of the Assessment Time Points (8 AM, + 2 Hrs, + 7 Hrs, and + 9 Hrs) at Week 6 - Brinz/Brim, Brinz, Brim</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The study drug was instilled at 8 AM and +7 hours relative to the 8 AM dosing (approximately 15 minutes after conducting the IOP measurements). Intraocular pressure was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry. One eye from each patient was chosen as the study eye and only data for the study eye were used for the efficacy analysis. A higher IOP can be a greater risk factor for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage). Intent-to-Treat (ITT) analysis data set was pre-specified for the comparison of Brinz/Brim to its individual components (Brinz and Brim).</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Intraocular Pressure (IOP) From Baseline to Each of the Assessment Time Points (8 AM, + 2 Hrs, + 7 Hrs, and + 9 Hrs) at Week 6 - Brinz/Brim, Brinz, Brim</title>
        <description>The study drug was instilled at 8 AM and +7 hours relative to the 8 AM dosing (approximately 15 minutes after conducting the IOP measurements). Intraocular pressure was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry. One eye from each patient was chosen as the study eye and only data for the study eye were used for the efficacy analysis. A higher IOP can be a greater risk factor for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage). Intent-to-Treat (ITT) analysis data set was pre-specified for the comparison of Brinz/Brim to its individual components (Brinz and Brim).</description>
