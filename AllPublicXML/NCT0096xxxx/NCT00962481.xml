        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to produce sputum with normal sputum neutrophil levels at screening (&lt; 65% of
             non-epithelial cells).

          -  Ozone responsive, defined as ≥ 20% relative increase in sputum neutrophils cell count
             after 3 h ozone challenge.

          -  At screening FEV1 at least 80% of predicted.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Smokers (use of tobacco products in the previous 3 months). Urine cotinine levels will
             be measured during screening for all subjects. Smokers will be defined as any subject
             who reports of a recent tobacco use and/or who has a urine cotinine ≥ 500 ng/mL.

          -  Significant illness within two weeks prior to dosing (e.g., infection).

          -  Recent (within the last three years) and/or recurrent history of acute or chronic
             bronchospastic disease (including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
             treated or not treated).
