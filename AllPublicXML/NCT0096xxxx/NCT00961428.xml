      The purpose of this research study is to determine the importance and level of physical
      activity in people with Anorexia Nervosa.

      A laboratory paradigm that uses a progressive ratio computerized work task will be used to
      determine the reinforcing value of exercise in hospitalized patients with AN, both before and
      after weight gain. In addition, we will examine the relationship between the reinforcing
      value of exercise and free-living physical activity in this population. We will also examine
      the relationship between the reinforcing value of exercise and measures of depression,
      anxiety, and cortisol, which we have found in previous studies to be associated with other
      measures of physical activity and exercise motivation. In order to determine whether physical
      activity in women with AN differs from that of non-eating disordered women, we will extend
      studies of physical activity to free-living control participants. All adult patients and
      controls will undergo body composition assessment once to measure the association between
      physical activity and percent body fat. Finally, to determine the impact of exercise
      reinforcement and physical activity on outcome in women with AN, we will conduct follow-up
      assessments in all patient participants for one year after discharge from the inpatient
      treatment unit.&quot;
