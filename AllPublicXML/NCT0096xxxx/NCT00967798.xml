    <textblock>
      Acute systemic hyperglycemia causes oxidative stress and a pro-inflammatory response. The
      pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by hyperglycemia are toxic to islet insulin producing
      cells, and thus worsen glucose intolerance. Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have a high
      prevalence of CF related diabetes (CFRD) and up to 40% of CF adults develop CFRD. During the
      prediabetic phase in CF, there is progression from normal glucose homeostasis to high risk
      prediabetes characterized by episodes of acute hyperglycemia after meals and during
      respiratory exacerbations. The mild hyperglycemia seen in CF patients with high risk
      prediabetes following a meal would be expected to induce a degree of systemic inflammation
      and oxidative stress. These repetitive episodes, if left unchecked, could lead to progression
      of glucose impairment, worsening severity of oxidative stress and inflammation, and
      ultimately the development of CFRD, all via hyperglycemia-induced toxicity to beta cells.
      Furthermore, this process may be accelerated in CF because lung disease and resultant
      respiratory exacerbations are associated with oxidative stress and inflammation and this will
      further contribute to beta cell damage.

      Sitagliptin is a recently approved agent for type 2 diabetes and markedly enhances insulin
      secretion in the presence of hyperglycemia and has been shown to be effective in preventing
      postprandial hyperglycemia. The hypothesis to be tested in this project is that sitagliptin
      will prevent the development of CFRD in CF subjects with high risk prediabetes by blocking
      postprandial hyperglycemia. The investigators propose a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, multicenter, 15-month longitudinal study in 118 CF subjects with high
      risk prediabetes to test this hypothesis. Specifically, the investigators aim to show that
      chronic treatment with sitagliptin: prevents the conversion to diabetes; results in
      preservation of beta cell function; reduces systemic measures of oxidative stress and
      inflammation; and slows the rate of progression of lung disease.

    <textblock>
      This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study intending to enroll 118 CF
      subjects aged 13 years of age or older who have high risk prediabetes. High risk prediabetes
      was defined during the screening visit by performing an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)
      and finding that the fasting plasma glucose level is between 110-125 mg/dl and/or the 2-hour
      plasma glucose level is between 140 and 199 mg/dl. Upon enrollment, subjects were randomized
      to receive either sitagliptin or placebo. Each subject was to be followed for 15 months to
      determine if sitagliptin prevented the conversion to frank diabetes.

      The following was to be done at enrollment and every 6 months: an OGTT with collection of
      blood at 0, 1/2, and 2 hours for measurement of glucose and insulin in order to determine
      progression of glucose intolerance; collection of blood at time 0 and 2 hours during the OGTT
      and measurement of systemic redox status, oxidative stress, and degree of inflammation to
      determine the degree of basal oxidative stress and inflammation as well as the degree of
      hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress and inflammation; collection of exhaled breath
      condensate in a subset of subjects at selected sites at time 0 and 2 hours during the OGTT
      and measurement of airway redox status, degree of inflammation, and glucose levels to
      determine basal respiratory tract redox status and inflammation, the degree of
      hyperglycemia-induced changes in redox status and inflammation, and correlation between
      plasma and airway glucose levels; collection of blood to determine safety of the study
      medication (liver and renal function, complete blood count, electrolyte concentrations); and
      determination of progression of lung disease as defined by the number of respiratory
      exacerbations severe enough to require hospitalization and the rate of decline in lung
      function.

      The results of two OGTTs performed at least one week apart was used to determine whether the
      subject had converted from high risk prediabetes to frank diabetes (primary objective).
      Conversion to CFRD was defined when both OGTTs were abnormal (abnormal is defined as a
      fasting plasma glucose level greater than 125 mg/dl and/or a 2 hour glucose level greater
      than 199 mg/dl). The results of measures of redox balance, oxidant stress and inflammation
      (secondary objectives) would provide biologic plausibility to our concept on the mechanism of
      action of sitagliptin in preventing the development of CF diabetes.

      Hemoglobin-specific A1c fraction (HbA1c) was to be measured half-way between the 6-monthly
      visits and a rise of more than 0.5% from the enrollment value would result in two OGTT tests
      done at least one week apart to determine if diabetes has developed. At these interval study
      visits, blood was also collected to assess the safety of the study drug and, if the subject
      was female, to determine if pregnancy had occurred.

      In the event that diabetes did develop, the study drug (or placebo) was to be stopped and the
      subject would have completed the study.

      In summary, this was a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine whether
      sitagliptin prevents the conversion of CF subjects with high-risk prediabetes to frank
      diabetes. If successful, this would be the first treatment modality available to prevent the
      development of CFRD, a serious and life shortening complication of CF. Unfortunately, the
      study sites were unable to achieve enrollment targets and the study was prematurely
      terminated March 31, 2017 because of low enrollment. For those subjects enrolled in the
      study, there was no safety concerns. Data are currently being analyzed for the subjects that
      were enrolled.
