      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography,
      may help find and diagnose cancer. It is not yet known whether standard diagnostic procedures
      are more effective when given with or without fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission
      tomography in finding cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission
      tomography given together with standard diagnostic procedures to see how well it works
      compared with standard diagnostic procedures alone in finding cancer in patients with a blood
      clot in a vein.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Demonstrate the efficacy, in terms of increased numbers of cancer diagnoses, of PET-CT
           with 18-FDG in patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the risk of cancer detected at 1 year.

        -  Assess whether PET allows earlier detection of cancer.

        -  Evaluate survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      All patients undergo standard (clinical and biological) diagnostic tests for cancer. Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 diagnostic arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo diagnostic fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET in addition to standard
           methods.

        -  Arm II: Patients only undergo standard diagnostic methods. Patients are followed up for
           2 years.
