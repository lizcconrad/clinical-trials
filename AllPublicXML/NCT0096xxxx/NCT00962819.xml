    <textblock>
      This study will lay the foundation for determining the underlying reasons for lack of
      immunity to mumps that led to the 2006 mumps outbreak on college campuses in the Mid West,
      and it will assess the potential for similar outbreaks of measles and rubella. A total of 70
      to 80 college students (age 18 to 22) on the Emory campus (or nearby college campuses or the
      community) will be assessed for antibodies to measles, mumps or rubella by drawing a one-time
      blood sample. Their medical records will be verified for documentation of immunization with
      MMR vaccine prior to enrollment in the study. If a study volunteer is found to not have MMR
      immunity, they will be offered an MMR-II vaccine. For this group, additional blood specimens
      will be obtained.
