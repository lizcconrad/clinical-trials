      The purpose of this study is to see if women presenting for emergency contraception (EC) and
      choose the copper intrauterine device (IUD) will have fewer unplanned pregnancies in the next
      year compared to women who choose oral levonorgestrel for EC. The study will also compare use
      of an effective method of contraception in the year after they received EC.

      All women presenting to 2 Planned Parenthood Association of Utah clinics in Salt Lake City
      will be offered participation in this study. Women will select either the copper IUD or oral
      levonorgestrel for EC. The primary outcome is unplanned pregnancy in the year following
      presentation for EC.

      Secondary outcomes include use of an effective method of contraception over the next year,
      abortions, repeat use of EC, number of days to first bleeding episode and duration of that
      bleeding episode, use of a barrier method to prevent sexually transmitted infections, patient
      satisfaction with the chosen method of EC and contraception. Participants selecting the IUD
      will be assessed for IUD expulsion, perforation, and removal.
