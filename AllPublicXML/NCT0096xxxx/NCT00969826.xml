      This study is a four arm, parallel study.

      Ten were administered a single subcutaneous administration of 30, 100 and 300 μg/kg of GCPGC
      or placebo for each group (active:placebo=8:2). Eight were administered a single subcutaneous
      administration of 100 μg/kg of Neulasta (an active comparator).

      Eligibility for participation of this study was determined from demographic information,
      medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests
      within 3 weeks before study drug administration. Subjects suitable for this study were
      admitted to the Clinical Trials Center, Seoul National University Hospital on the day before
      dosing, and they were overnight-fasted from 10 p.m. of Day -1. Subjects were dosed study drug
      via subcutaneous around at 9 a.m. of Day 1. Subjects performed scheduled procedures including
      clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      samplings. Subjects were discharged on Day 8, and visited Clinical Trials Center on Day 9,
      Day 11 and Day 14. Study participation was terminated on post-study visit (Day 20 - 22).
