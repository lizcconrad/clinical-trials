      This study prospectively selects the patients to examine the effectiveness of the
      investigators' current standard of prophylaxis prior to vascular surgery and to compare the
      effectiveness of vancomycin and daptomycin plus cefazolin in reducing infections in vascular
      surgical patients.

    <textblock>
      According to Medqic.org (site for the Surgical Care Improvement Project) the current
      recommended drug of choice for prophylaxis prior to vascular surgery is Cefazolin (Ancef).
      The exception would be to allow the use of Vancomycin as an acceptable antibiotic for
      patients undergoing cardiac, vascular or orthopedic surgery due to the increasing risk of
      MRSA. The significance of the study is to demonstrate that MRSA coverage is needed in
      vascular surgery with prosthetic graft placement in areas of the body that is at high risk
      for infection. By decreasing post surgical site and prosthetic infections, we could
      significantly reduce vascular surgery mortality and morbidity. Cost and amputation rates we
      feel could also be reduced. patients will be randomized in three groups such as
      cefazolin,vancomycin and cefazolin, daptomycin and cefazolin and then patients will be
      monitored per usual post-operative course (30 days and 90 days follow-up) with wound and
      incision evaluation. Outcome measures include hospital length of stay, the presence of a
      graft infection, skin infection at incision site, vascular procedure failure secondary to
      infection, cost, thirty day readmits, amputation, and mortality.
