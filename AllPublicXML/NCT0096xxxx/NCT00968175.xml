    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine endoscopic ultrasound guided celiac plexus neurolysis
      (CPN) with analgesic therapy in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer as it applies to
      decreasing the severity of abdominal pain when compared to analgesic therapy alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of EUS-CPN + analgesic
      therapy (Group 1) in pain relief of patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer when
      compared with analgesic therapy (Group 2). The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the
      changes in reported pain severity between those who receive EUS-CPN in addition to analgesic
      therapy as compared to analgesic therapy alone.

      The secondary aims of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of EUS-CPN + analgesic therapy
      in improvement of quality of life (QOL) of patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer when
      compared to when compared with analgesic therapy alone, compare pain medication usage between
      Group 1 when compared to Group 2, and compare the referral for rescue block during the course
      of the study between Group 1 and Group 2
