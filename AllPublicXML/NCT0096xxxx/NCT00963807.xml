      This study is being done to compare a special type of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan
      with CT scan in patients with surgically removable lung cancer to see which method is more
      useful in measuring a response to treatment. A PET scan uses small amounts of radioactive
      material injected into the blood to show the internal workings of the body. In this study, we
      will use two radioactive materials: 18F-FLT (referred to as FLT) and 18F-FDG (referred to as
      FDG). FDG is used routinely in the staging of lung cancer and is approved by the FDA for that
      purpose. FLT is used in the special type of PET scan being assessed by this study. In
      addition the study will assess the effects of the combination of docetaxel and cisplatin
      (chemotherapeutic drugs) on certain pathological characteristics of the tumor. The
      combination of docetaxel and cisplatin is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      for the treatment of advanced/metastatic NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer). It is not
      approved for use in patients who have surgically removable NSCLC. In such cases cisplatin is
      used as a single drug therapy before surgery. The FDA is allowing the use of docetaxel along
      with cisplatin in this research study.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if the absolute decrease measured in primary tumor 18
      F-F-3'-fluoro-3'-deoxy-L-thymidine (FLT) uptake (standard uptake value [SUV] and influx
      constant [Ki]) between pre-treatment imaging and imaging after the first cycle of therapy
      differs in patients categorized as responders or non-responders based on Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) measured with computed tomography (CT) after the second
      cycle of therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if the absolute decrease measured in primary tumor FDG uptake (SUV) between
      pre-treatment imaging and imaging after the first cycle of therapy differs in patients
      categorized as responders or non-responders based on RECIST measured with CT after the second
      cycle of therapy.

      II. To assess the effects of the combination of docetaxel and cisplatin on fractional tumor
      viability and proliferative fraction pre and post treatment and to correlate these with the
      PET SUV data for both tracers.

      III. To assess the methylation status of the checkpoint with forkhead and ring finger domains
      gene (CHFR) gene from pre-treatment tumor biopsies and correlate methylation status post
      treatment with clinical and pathologic response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) and cisplatin IV on day 1 and dexamethasone
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo FDG PET/CT, FLT PET/CT, and
      thoracic CT at baseline and the end of courses 1 and 2 and then undergo surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4-6 weeks.

          <description>Patients receive docetaxel IV and cisplatin IV on day 1 and dexamethasone PO BID. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo FDG PET/CT, FLT PET/CT, and thoracic CT at baseline and the end of courses 1 and 2 and then undergo surgery.
