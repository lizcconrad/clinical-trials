  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will test the following hypotheses:

        1. Bedrest will blunt the anabolic response to a mixed nutrient meal, facilitating a loss
           of muscle mass and functional capacity that is only partially restored during
           rehabilitation.

        2. Enriching daily meals with leucine will promote protein synthesis and maintain the
           anabolic response to mixed nutrient meal ingestion. This will preserve lean muscle mass
           and function during bedrest and facilitate the recovery of functional and metabolic
           capacity during rehabilitation.

      Our long-term goal is to identify, prevent and remedy defects in the metabolic pathway that
      contribute to the loss of muscle mass and function during exposure to microgravity.
      Demographic data indicate that the average age of shuttle crew members has increased from
      40.7 yrs in 1995 to 46.7 yrs in 2007 with an increasing number of astronauts over 50 yrs of
      age. We contend that the loss of muscle mass and function during spaceflight is facilitated
      by an age-associated, progressive impairment in the ability to mount an anabolic response to
      standard mixed nutrient meals. We propose that enriching daily meals with a low-volume
      leucine supplement will reduce the deleterious effects of microgravity on skeletal muscle and
      facilitate recovery during rehabilitation.

      We will employ our established 14 day bed rest protocol to model the skeletal muscle
      unloading that occurs during microgravity. We will also examine recovery of muscle mass and
      functional capacity during a 7 day rehabilitation period. We will study 2 groups: CON
      (Bedrest/Recovery + Placebo; n=15), LEU (Bedrest/Recovery + Leucine; n=15). We will assess a)
      markers of translation initiation, b) muscle protein synthesis, c) muscle mass and body
      composition and d) strength and aerobic capacity.
