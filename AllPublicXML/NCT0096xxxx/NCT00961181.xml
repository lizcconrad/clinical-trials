  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the paclitaxel
      releasing balloon in patients with in-stent restenosis in a coronary artery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients are treated with the paclitaxel releasing balloon Pantera Lux. The indication is
      in-stent restenosis in either bare metal stent (BMS) or drug eluting stent (DES).

      Clinical follow up visits at 1, 6 and 12 months. Angiographic follow up visit at 6 months.

        <title>Binary In-segment Restenosis</title>
        <description>In-segment is defined as from proximal shoulder to distal shoulder of the dilated Pantera Lux balloon plus 5 mm proximal and 5 mm distal.
Binary restenosis was defined as a ≥ 50% diameter stenosis at follow-up as evaluated by offline quantitative coronary angiography (QCA).
Diameter stenosis is defined as the difference between reference vessel diameter and minimal lumen diameter divided by reference vessel diameter x100%.
Offline quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) analysis was performed by an independent core laboratory (Ulrich Dietz, MD, Deutsche Klinik für Diagnostik, Wiesbaden, Germany).</description>
