  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is mainly known as a disease of young to middle adulthood but
      approximately 5% of all MS cases worldwide involve children that are younger than 16 years.

      The aim of care of children with Multiple Sclerosis is to prevent or at least to delay any
      neurological and cognitive impairment as well as progression of the disease as far as
      possible. Therefore, it is very crucial to diagnose the disease at an early stage as
      immunomodulatory treatments are available that can delay the progression of Multiple
      SclerosisTreatment with the immunomodulatory agent Betaferon速 in children diagnosed with RRMS
      and being 12 years or older has been approved by the health authorities. The aim of this
      observational study is to obtain further data on the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness
      of Betaferon速 under daily living conditions.

      As this is a non-interventional observational study, routine clinical practice is observed.
      The application of diagnostic measures and medications as well as physician visits follow the
      normal routine and is decided upon by the treating physician under recognition of the package
      insert.
