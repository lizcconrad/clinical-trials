  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adjuvant N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-enhancing agents, such as GlyT-1 inhibitors and
      NMDA-glycine site agonists have been demonstrated to be beneficial for chronic schizophrenia
      patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of add-on treatment of
      an inhibitor of D-amino acid oxidase (DAAOI), DAAOI-1, in chronically stable schizophrenia
      patients who have been stabilized with antipsychotics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The etiology of schizophrenia remains unclear. Schizophrenia patients reveal positive
      symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive impairments. In addition to dopamine system
      hyperactivity, hypofunction of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor plays a role in the
      pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Consequently, enhancing NMDA receptor neurotransmission has
      been regarded as a novel treatment approach. To date, several reported trials on adjuvant
      NMDA-enhancing agents, including glycine, D-amino acids (D-serine, D-alanine), and sarcosine
      (a glycine transporter I inhibitor), revealed beneficial but limited efficacy for positive
      and negative symptoms.

      DAAOI-1 is a D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) inhibitor which can elevate synaptic concentration
      of D-amino acids. The aim of this project is to examine the efficacy and safety of add-on
      treatment of DAAOI-1 in chronically stable schizophrenia patients who have been stabilized
      with antipsychotics.

      In the study, 60 schizophrenic patients are recruited into the 6-week trial and randomly
      assigned into the two groups (1 gm/dDAAOI-1, or placebo) with a double-blind manner. Positive
      and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Scales for the Assessment of Negative symptoms (SANS),
      Global Assessment of Function (GAF), quality of life (QOL), Hamilton Depression rating scale
      17(HAM-D 17), Clinical Global Impression(CGI)and side effects are evaluated every two weeks
      during the trial. Cognitive function (&quot;7 domains of Measurement and Treatment Research to
      Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia&quot; [MATRICS])are assessed at weeks 0 and 6. The efficacies
      of two groups are compared.
