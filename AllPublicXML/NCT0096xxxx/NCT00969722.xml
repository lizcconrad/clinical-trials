    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label study. Patients meeting
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized (1:1) to receive two cycles of MAb-3F8 plus
      GM-CSF or RA plus GM-CSF. Patients who do not respond to their assigned treatment after two
      cycles may cross-over to receive the alternate treatment. Disease response and safety will be
      assessed in all patients after cycle 2 and after cycle 4.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a diagnosis of stage 4 neuroblastoma diagnosed in accordance with the
             International Neuroblastoma Staging System: either (a) histologic confirmation which
             may involve immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and/or cytogenetic studies, or (b)
             elevated urinary catecholamines plus tumor cells/clumps in the bone marrow.

          -  Have evaluable disease or biopsy-proven stable disease in BM by histology or MIBG scan
             with MIBG-positive disease confined to the bone or bone marrow, plus urine
             catecholamine results, documented &gt;3 weeks after conventional chemotherapy or &gt;6 weeks
             after stem-cell transplantation. CT, MRI, or bone scan (if necessary) can be done at
             2-3 weeks after conventional chemotherapy confirming that the chemotherapy,
             radiotherapy, and ABMT are not realistic curative options.

          -  Be between 18 months to 13 years old at diagnosis.

          -  Have recovered to grade 2 or better toxicities since their prior therapy.

          -  Must, if female of childbearing potential, be willing to use two forms of medically
             acceptable contraception (at least one barrier method) and have a negative pregnancy
             test at screening and monthly thereafter through the first four cycles of treatment.

          -  Have a performance score of at least 60 from Lansky Play Performance Scale if aged up
             to 16 years or at least 60 from Karnofsky Scale if aged more than 16 years.

          -  Have voluntarily agreed to participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have measurable disease â‰¥ 1 cm assessed by CT or MRI.

          -  Have progressive disease (any new lesion; increase of any measurable lesion by &gt;25%;
             or previous negative marrow positive for tumor).

          -  Have disease detectable in CNS (confirmed by CT or MRI of the brain at screening or
             within 8 weeks of randomization).

          -  Be receiving alternative therapy for the treatment of neuroblastoma, e.g. radiotherapy
             or chemotherapy within 3 weeks of randomization.

          -  Require additional therapy (such as radiotherapy) during the first two treatment
             cycles.

          -  Have detectable human anti-mouse antibody titers at screening.

          -  Have received prior anti-GD2 investigational therapies.

          -  Have a history of allergies to mouse proteins.

          -  Have an active infection requiring IV infusion of antibiotics.

          -  Be currently receiving long-term chronic treatment with immunosuppressive drugs such
             as cyclosporine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), or systemic corticosteroids.
