      This study was terminated on 11 Nov 2010 following a US FDA clinical hold for tanezumab
      osteoarthritis clinical studies which halted dosing and enrollment of patients on 23 June
      2010 for potential safety issues.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must consent in writing to participate in the study.

          -  Patients must be willing to comply with study visit schedule and study requirements,
             including, for women of child-bearing potential or male patients with female partners
             of child-bearing potential, the use of 2 forms of birth control, one of which is a
             barrier method.

          -  Patients must have participated in the A4091026 study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Withdrawn from the A4091026 study for an adverse event or serious adverse event.

          -  Pregnant women, lactating mothers, women suspected of being pregnant, and women who
             wish to be pregnant during the course of clinical study.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for entry into this study.
