    <measure>Knee Society Score improvement at post-surgery visits</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 1, 2, 5, 7, 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee Society Clinical Rating System is comprised of two distinct sub-scores: one for pain, ROM and joint stability, and one for functional parameters. Sub-scores range from a potential minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 100 points. Although the specific scores are not distinguished as &quot;excellent,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; &quot;fair,&quot; or &quot;poor,&quot; a higher value represents a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Lower Extremity Activity Scale Improvement at Post-surgery visits</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 1, 2, 5, 7, 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The LEAS is completed by the participant to assess activity level. Activity levels were ordered in terms of intensity from 1 to 18, with 18 indicating the highest activity level.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activity Questionnaire Improvement at Post-surgery Visits</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 1, 2, 5, 7, 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>This Activity Questionnaire consists of open-ended entries where the patient can note the recreational/sport activities they are participating in at that point in time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 1, 2, 5, 7, 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>KOOS consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and knee related Quality of life (QOL). The last week is taken into consideration when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question gets a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SF-12 Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 1, 2, 5, 7, 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 Health Survey is a 12-item patient completed questionnaire to measure general health and well-being. It includes a physical and mental status component score; each ranging from 0-100. Low values represent a poor health state and high values represent a good health state.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiographic Data</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 1, 2, 5, 7, 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Parameters for radiographic failures will follow the guidelines that have been set by the Knee Society, but will be modified due to the patella not being replaced. The scoring system for each of the three components is determined by measuring the width of the radiolucent lines for each of the zones in millimeters for each of the three components. The total widths are added for each zone for each of the three prostheses. The total produces a numerical score for each component. Failure is defined as a score of 10 or greater, regardless of symptoms.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is a male or non-pregnant female 21-75 years of age at the time of
             enrollment.

          -  The subject requires a primary cemented unicompartmental knee replacement.

          -  The subject has a diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA) or posttraumatic arthritis (TA).

          -  The subject has clinically intact cruciate and collateral ligaments and no ligamentous
             instability is present.

          -  The subject has less than 10 degrees of flexion contracture and greater than 90
             degrees of flexion.

          -  The subject's preoperative mechanical alignment is less than 10 degrees of varus and
             10 degrees of valgus.

          -  The subject has signed the IRB approved study specific Informed Patient Consent Form.

          -  The subject is willing and able to comply with postoperative scheduled clinical and
             radiographic evaluations and rehabilitation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has inflammatory arthritis or avascular necrosis(AVN).

          -  The subject is obese, BMI &gt; 35.

          -  The subject has a history of total or unicompartmental (contralateral compartment
             and/or patellofemoral joint) reconstruction of the affected joint.

          -  The subject has a history of ACL reconstruction.

          -  The subject has had a high distal femoral, or proximal tibial osteotomy.

          -  The subject has a mental, neuromuscular or neurosensory disorder, which would create
             an unacceptable risk of prosthesis instability, prosthesis fixation failure, or
             complications in post-operative care and/or limit the ability to assess the
             performance of the device.

          -  The subject has a systemic or metabolic disorder leading to progressive bone
             deterioration that the surgeon feels would affect the overall outcome of the study.

          -  The subject is immunologically suppressed, or is receiving chronic steroids (&gt;30 days
             duration).

          -  The subject has a known sensitivity to device materials.

          -  The subject's bone stock is compromised by disease and/or infection which cannot
             provide adequate support and/or fixation to the prosthesis.

          -  The subject's bone stock is compromised by a prior implantation which cannot provide
             adequate support and/or fixation to the prosthesis.

          -  The subject has an active or suspected latent infection in or about the knee joint.

          -  The subject is a prisoner.
