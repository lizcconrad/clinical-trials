      This single arm, open-label study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Herceptin in
      combination with Avastin and sequential Xeloda in patients with locally recurrent or
      metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer after early relapse on adjuvant Herceptin therapy.
      Patients will receive Herceptin at a loading dose of 8mg/kg iv followed by 6mg/kg iv every
      three weeks, and Avastin 15mg/kg every 3 weeks. At first sign of disease progression Xeloda
      1000mg/m2 bid po will be added on days 1-14 of each cycle, or docetaxel (100mg/m2 iv every 3
      weeks) if Xeloda is not indicated for a patient. Anticipated time on study treatment is until
      disease-progression on second line treatment and target sample size is &lt;100.
