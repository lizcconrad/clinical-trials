  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will implement an interactive school-based telemedicine education program
      for rural low-income, minority children with asthma, their caregivers, and school nurses in
      the Delta region of Arkansas.

      Specific aims:

        1. The investigators will examine changes in asthma symptoms control and other health
           outcomes such as activity levels and family/child emotional health in the intervention
           group compared to a usual care group.

        2. The investigators will examine changes in asthma knowledge, self-efficacy, and quality
           of life in the intervention participants and their caregivers compared to a usual care
           group.

               -  take asthma medication more than two days a week;

               -  have been treated in a hospital or emergency department two or more times in the
                  last two years for asthma symptoms;

               -  have been treated in a hospital or emergency department two or more times in the
                  last two years for asthma symptoms have episodes of asthma-like symptoms when
                  playing/exercising.

          -  Potentially eligible participants will be screened using an asthma screener to confirm
             eligibility.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with significant underlying respiratory disease other than asthma (such as
             cystic fibrosis) or significant co-morbid conditions (such as severe developmental
             delay or cerebral palsy) will be excluded from the study.

          -  The primary caregiver and child will be asked questions via telephone interview about
             how asthma affects the child every day. Children with no telephone number or contact
             telephone number will be excluded.
