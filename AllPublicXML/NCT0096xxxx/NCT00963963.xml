      This study is developing and testing an innovative, parent education intervention, Preparing
      Our Sons and Daughters for Healthy Futures. This intervention aims to reduce HIV risk among
      African American and other Black youth living in high-poverty urban neighborhoods.
      Investigators, working with a community advisory board and focus groups of youth and parents,
      will develop a multi-year set of audio-CDs to promote positive parenting practices that
      support young adolescents in establishing healthy patterns of behavior. This parent education
      intervention will be tested in a field trial with families of 6th graders recruited from
      multiple schools in New York City. Baseline and annual follow up surveys will be conducted
      until youth enter high school. Families receiving the intervention will be compared to those
      assigned to either an attention-controlled print materials condition or a non-attention
      controlled condition. It is hypothesized that youth whose parents receive the intervention
      will delay sexual initiation and report fewer sexual risks, and that their parents will
      report more positive parenting practices.
