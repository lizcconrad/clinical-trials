        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to follow instructions and willing to attend required study visits.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of ocular hypertension, primary open-angle, or pigment dispersion
             glaucoma in at least one eye (qualifying eye).

          -  Intra-ocular pressure (IOP) considered to be safe in both eyes in such a way that
             should assure clinical stability of vision and the optic nerve throughout the trial.

          -  Must have best corrected visual acuity of 6/60 (6/60 Snellen, 1.0 LogMAR) or better in
             each eye.

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of other primary or secondary glaucomas not listed in inclusion criterion.

          -  Presence of corneal dystrophies.

          -  Concurrent infectious/noninfectious conjunctivitis, keratitis or uveitis in either
             eye.

          -  Intraocular conventional surgery or laser surgery in qualifying eye(s) less than three
             months prior to Visit 1.

          -  Risk of visual field or visual acuity worsening as a consequence of participation in
             the trial, in the investigator's best judgment.

          -  Women of childbearing potential not using reliable means of birth control.

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Participation in any other investigational study within 30 days prior to Visit 1.

          -  Current or anticipated use of systemic corticosteroids, by any route except inhaled,
             for greater than two weeks during the trial.
