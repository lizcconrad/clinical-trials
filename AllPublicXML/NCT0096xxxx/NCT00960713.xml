  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to describe by a prospective observational study the
      serious adverse events occurring in patients treated off-label by rituximab for various
      auto-immune diseases.

      Every patient treated by rituximab off -label for auto-immune diseases in the public
      hospitals of the Midi-Pyrénées County (France) is eligible for the study, whatever the dose
      and the number of planned infusions. The enrollment is definitive at the time the first
      rituximab infusion begins. Follow-up visits are planned at months 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 after
      the first infusion. At each visit, the investigators will record the adverse events that have
      occurred since the last visit. Serious or unexpected adverse events will be systematically
      monitored and declared to the Pharmacovigilance. Imputability will be quoted according to the
      French method. A biological collection will be constituted to allow pharmaco- immunological
      studies.

    <description>Every patient treated by rituximab off-label for auto-immune diseases in the public hospitals of the Midi-Pyrénées County (South of France) is eligible for the study, whatever the dose and planned infusions number. The enrolment is definitive when the first rituximab infusion begins. Follow-up visits are planned at months 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 after the first infusion. At each visit, the investigators will record the adverse events that have occurred since the last visit. Serious or unexpected adverse events will be systematically monitored and declared to the Department of Pharmacology Pharmacovigilance unit and to Health Authorities (AFSSAPS). Imputability will be quoted according to the French method. A biological collection will be constituted to allow pharmaco-immunological studies.</description>
