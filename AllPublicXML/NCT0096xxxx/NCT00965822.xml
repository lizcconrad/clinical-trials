    <textblock>
      Parents with children aged 3-11 will participate in this study. About 500 children will take
      part in the study. We expect about half of those children will develop symptoms of a
      respiratory infection. Active participation in this study will last 14 days after a parent
      reports symptoms of a respiratory infection in a participant. Those children who do meet the
      study criteria of symptoms will then be randomly placed (like a flip of a coin) into one of 2
      groups to take either COLD-FX® or placebo for 3 days. A placebo will look exactly like
      COLD-FX® but contains no active ingredients. The participant has an equal chance of being
      placed in either of the above groups. The study is double-blind, so neither the participant
      nor the study staff will know which study group the participant was placed in until the study
      is completed. If this information is needed in an emergency at any time throughout the study,
      it is quickly available from the sponsor.

      Participation in the study will be for 14 days after symptoms of a respiratory infection are
      reported to study staff. Your child will take the study product for 3 days, you will complete
      a daily diary, receive 4 phone calls and be seen for a final study visit to review the diary
      and complete a final health check of your child.

      The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of acute dosing of CVT-E002 in reducing the
      duration of URTI symptoms in children 3-11 years of age.

      The secondary objectives are to asses the efficacy of acute dosing of CVT-E002 in reducing:
      (1) symptom severity; (2) peak CARIFS scores and; (3) absenteeism for participant and/or
      parent/guardian. The ease of administration and the safety of acute dosing of CVT-E002 in
      children 3-11 years of age will also be assessed.
