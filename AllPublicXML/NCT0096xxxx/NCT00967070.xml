             condition)

          -  Clinically relevant abnormal findings on the physical examination

          -  A baseline score in skin reaction assessments other than &quot;0&quot; on the areas to be

             safety of the subjects.

          -  Use of systemic or topical analgesics or antihistamines within 72 hours prior to trial
             enrollment (except paracetamol) or systemic or topical corticosteroids within 3 weeks
             of trial enrollment.

          -  Subjects having used nicotine products other than cigarettes within the 3 months
