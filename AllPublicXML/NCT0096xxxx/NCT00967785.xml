      Background:

        -  WHIMS (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infection, and myelokathexis syndrome) is caused by
           various genetic changes that increase the activity of the CXCR4 gene. Excessive function
           of this gene causes mature neutrophils (part of white blood cells) to be retained within
           the bone marrow rather than being released to the general blood circulation, and is one
           of the causes of severe inherited neutropenia (low white blood counts). In neutropenia,
           the body is less able to fight off infection. Patients with WHIMS usually are at risk
           for skin, soft tissue, sinus, and lung infections, which can result in loss of hearing,
           teeth, and lung function.

        -  Current treatment for WHIMS consists of regular injections of a white blood cell growth
           stimulating medication called granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and monthly
           infusions of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). These therapies are expensive,
           nonspecific, have significant side effects and toxicities, and do not fully correct all
           problems, especially warts and cancers related to human papillomavirus (HPV).

        -  A drug called Mozobil has been approved for use in combination with G-CSF to increase
           the number of stem cells that can be collected prior to bone marrow transplantation.
           Mozobil may offer a specific and well-tolerated new treatment for WHIMS and other
           syndromes characterized by neutropenia.

      Objectives:

        -  To evaluate whether Mozobil is safe and effective to treat neutropenia (low white blood
           cell count) in patients with WHIMS.

        -  To determine an appropriate treatment dose of Mozobil, within currently approved dosage
           levels.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 75 years of age who have been diagnosed with WHIMS and have a
      history of severe infections.

      Design:

        -  Potential participants will undergo a screening study, with a medical history, physical
           examination, questionnaire, heart and lung function scans, and blood and urine samples.
           Tests will also be done for hepatitis B and C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus
           (HIV) that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), as well as to check
           neutrophil function.

        -  Patients who are being treated with G-CSF will stop injections for 5 days before being
           admitted to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center. While off the
           medication, patients will keep a diary to report information about their general
           well-being while off the medications and will bring it to NIH when admitted.

        -  Patients will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center inpatient until 2 days before
           starting the treatment and will stay for approximately 10 days. Before the treatment,
           patients will have blood samples taken regularly.

        -  Patients will receive increasing doses of Mozobil over 5 days of treatment until their
           white blood cell count improves sufficiently or the maximum approved dose is reached.
           Blood samples will be taken regularly throughout the treatment process. Patients will
           then receive an additional dose of Mozobil at the maximum approved dose or the dose
           sufficient to cause improvement, before restarting the G-CSF injections.

        -  Between 4 and 6 weeks after the treatment phase, patients will return to the NIH for an
           outpatient study completion and evaluation visit.

      Mozobil (TM) (plerixafor injection, Genzyme Corp.) is a Food and Drug Administration approved
      medication to mobilize CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells prior to apheresis and use in
      autologous transplantation in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma when used in
      conjunction with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). The drug s mechanism of
      action is the specific and reversible inhibition of the chemokine receptor, CXCR4, expressed
      on CD34+ cells and other leukocytes. This inhibition interferes with the binding of stromal
      cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1), which is constitutively expressed on bone marrow stromal cells
      and appears to cause direct and indirect cellular adhesive interactions. Severe congenital
      neutropenia is a rare inherited disorder in which the affected individuals develop chronic or
      cyclical neutropenia with circulating counts below 500 cells/microliter blood. This disorder
      may result from a variety of genetic defects in progenitor- or neutrophil-expressed genes
      such as elastase, CXCR4, G6PC3, etc. Myelokathexis is the abnormal retention of mature
      leukocytes in the bone marrow and is seen in some types of severe chronic neutropenia such as
      warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis syndrome (WHIMS). WHIMS is a rare
      primary immunodeficiency, which is known to be caused by mutations that enhance CXCR4
      signaling. Our hypothesis is that Mozobil(TM) can be used safely to partially block CXCR4 and
      treat neutropenia resulting from myelokathexis at doses considerably lower than that being
      used for CD34+ cell mobilization. This new treatment could also improve other aspects of the
      disease such as frequent infections, warts, and hypogammaglobulinemia. To test this
      hypothesis, we propose this trial of Mozobil (TM) in adults with WHIMS, examining safety and
      absolute neutrophil count as the primary endpoint.
