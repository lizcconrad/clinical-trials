      The AIMM Young study is a collaboration between Children's National Medical Center (CNMC) and
      colleges/universities nationwide--currently including Howard University (HU), East Carolina
      University (ECU), and University of Massachusetts, Amherst (U Mass). This study obtains a
      variety of baseline measures (such as serum biomarkers related to metabolic syndrome,
      anthropometrics, muscle strength, and fitness testing) along with genetic information from
      healthy college-age (18-35 years) young adults in efforts to identify phenotype-genotype
      associations that may predispose individuals to developing metabolic syndrome, type 2
      diabetes, and/or related diseases such as obesity.

      We hypothesized that certain genetic variations will be protective against metabolic
      syndrome, while others will show a strong correlation with specific components of metabolic
      syndrome disease. We expect that the study of &quot;pre-symptomatic,&quot; young individuals will
      facilitate the identification of genetic risk loci for metabolic syndrome and type 2
      diabetes. Younger populations typically have less confounding variables, and this facilitates
      normalizing of metabolic syndrome features and environment/lifestyle. Additionally, young
      subjects can provide more robust longitudinal data, and be recruited into subsequent
      interventions to reverse the trend towards metabolic syndrome, rather than the more difficult
      task of reversing type 2 diabetes in older populations. The data collected will be stratified
      according to gender, age, ethnicity, genotype, and other phenotypic measures to determine how
      these factors influence disease risk.
