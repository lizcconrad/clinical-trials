  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, controlled, repeat dose, single center
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a repeat application of RT001 compared to
      placebo gel in at least 36 subjects with moderate to severe lateral canthal lines (LCL).
      Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio (active versus
      placebo). At least 36 adult volunteers who have provided informed consent and have met the
      study eligibility criteria will be enrolled. There will be 18 subjects in each treatment
      group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female or male, 30 to 60 years of age

          -  Bilateral lateral canthal lines rated as moderate or severe

          -  Willing to refrain from receiving facial fillers, laser treatments, use of any product
             that affects skin remodeling or a product that may cause an active dermal response in
             the treatment area beginning at Screening and through End of Study

          -  Women of childbearing potential must be practicing and willing to continue to use an
             effective method of birth control during the course of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any neurological condition that may place the subject at increased risk with exposure
             to Botulinum Toxin Type A, including peripheral motor neuropathic diseases such as
             amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and motor neuropathy, and neuromuscular junctional
             disorders

          -  Muscle weakness or paralysis in the area receiving study treatment

          -  Active skin disease or irritation at the treatment areas

          -  Eyelid ptosis, excessive dermatochalasis, deep dermal scarring or inability to
             substantially lessen the lateral canthal lines to be treated by physically spreading
             them apart

          -  Use of prescription retinoid products during the past 3 months prior to Screening

          -  Chemical peel (medium depth or deeper) during the past 9 months prior to Screening

          -  Undergone any procedures that may affect the lateral canthal region such as:
             periorbital surgery, brow lift or related procedures, laser skin resurfacing or soft
             tissue augmentation (upper half of face) during the past 12 months prior to Screening

          -  Previous treatment with Botulinum Toxin Type A in the face area

          -  Previous treatment with greater than 200 U Botulinum Toxin Type A anywhere else in the
             body within the last 6 months prior to Screening

          -  Concurrent use of aminoglycoside antibiotics, or other agents that might interfere
             with neuromuscular transmission starting at Screening

          -  Use of a topical steroid on either of the treatment areas or use of medications that
