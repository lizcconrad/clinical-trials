It described whether a mean was above or below the standard and how unusual the measurement is with range from -3 to +3; 0 =same mean, &gt;0 a greater mean, and &lt;0 a lesser mean than the standard. Growth parameters were compared to a standard defined by Centers for Disease Control's growth charts.</description>

        <description>CHAQ: parent-administered, valid assessment of functional disability, discomfort in pediatrics with rheumatic diseases. Parents report participants’s ability to perform activities in 8 domains: dressing, arising, eating, walking,hygiene, each,grip,common activities distributed in total of 30 items.Each item is scored on 4-point Likert scale: 0=no difficulty;1=some difficulty;2=much difficulty;3=unable to do. Highest score reported for domain is score for that domain.Overall score = sum of domain scores divided by number of domains answered. Total score: 0=no difficulty to 3=extreme difficulty.</description>

        <description>Modified Schober’s Test: A mark was placed in the midpoint of a line that joined the posterior superior iliac spines. Another mark was placed 10 centimeter (cm) above the first. The participant then bent maximally forward with the knees fully extended. The distance between the two marks was then re-measured. The full measurement between the two lines was recorded to the nearest tenth of a centimeter.</description>

          <description>Modified Schober’s Test: A mark was placed in the midpoint of a line that joined the posterior superior iliac spines. Another mark was placed 10 centimeter (cm) above the first. The participant then bent maximally forward with the knees fully extended. The distance between the two marks was then re-measured. The full measurement between the two lines was recorded to the nearest tenth of a centimeter.</description>

        <title>Height z-Score by Age Group for eoJIA Sub-population</title>
        <description>Standing height was taken as a mean of 3 consecutive measurements using a wall mounted stadiometer. Z-Score was a statistical measure to evaluate how a single data point compares to a standard. It described whether a mean was above or below the standard and how unusual the measurement is with range from -3 to +3; 0 =same mean, &gt;0 a greater mean, and &lt;0 a lesser mean than the standard. Growth parameters were compared to a standard defined by Centers for Disease Control's growth charts.</description>

        <title>Height z-Score by Age Group for PsA Sub-population</title>
        <description>Standing height was taken as a mean of 3 consecutive measurements using a wall mounted stadiometer. Z-Score was a statistical measure to evaluate how a single data point compares to a standard. It described whether a mean was above or below the standard and how unusual the measurement is with range from -3 to +3; 0 =same mean, &gt;0 a greater mean, and &lt;0 a lesser mean than the standard. Growth parameters were compared to a standard defined by Centers for Disease Control's growth charts.</description>

        <description>Weight was taken as a mean of 3 consecutive measurements using a medical electronic scale. Z-Score was a statistical measure to evaluate how a single data point compares to a standard. It described whether a mean was above or below the standard and how unusual the measurement is with range from -3 to +3; 0 =same mean, &gt;0 a greater mean, and &lt;0 a lesser mean than the standard. Growth parameters were compared to a standard defined by Centers for Disease Control's growth charts.</description>

        <title>Body Mass Index (BMI) z-Score by Age Group</title>
        <description>BMI was used to measure body fat based on height and weight. It was calculated by body weight (kg)/height (m) squared. Z-Score was a statistical measure to evaluate how a single data point compares to a standard. It described whether a mean was above or below the standard and how unusual the measurement is with range from -3 to +3; 0 =same mean, &gt;0 a greater mean, and &lt;0 a lesser mean than the standard. Growth parameters were compared to a standard defined by Centers for Disease Control's growth charts.</description>

        <title>Body Mass Index (BMI) z-Score by Age Group for ERA Sub-population</title>
        <description>BMI was used to measure body fat based on height and weight. It was calculated by body weight (kg)/height (m) squared. Z-Score was a statistical measure to evaluate how a single data point compares to a standard. It described whether a mean was above or below the standard and how unusual the measurement is with range from -3 to +3; 0 =same mean, &gt;0 a greater mean, and &lt;0 a lesser mean than the standard. Growth parameters were compared to a standard defined by Centers for Disease Control's growth charts.</description>
