  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 20 COPD patients will undergo a high-resolution/multi slice CT scan and lung
      function tests to obtain patient specific geometries of the central and peripheral small
      airways and patient specific boundary conditions.

      With Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), the investigators will be able to reconstruct the
      geometry and measure the resistance of the peripheral airways.

      In a later stage, CFD will be used to simulate the reaction of the airways on various
      inhalation medications.

          2. Patients who are pregnant or are breast-feeding.

          3. A respiratory infection or exacerbation of COPD in the four weeks prior to screening.

          4. BMI &gt; 35 kg/m².

          5. Patients treated with BiPAP or CPAP.
