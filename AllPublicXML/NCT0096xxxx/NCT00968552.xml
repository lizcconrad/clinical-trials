    <textblock>
      The investigators' believe that it is important to medical practice to obtain information on
      how expandable metal stents work in a large group of patients who have metal stents placed in
      the gastrointestinal system. The purpose of this research study is to collect information on
      the stent placement in our facility and how the patients responded to the stent placement.
