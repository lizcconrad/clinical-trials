  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the feasibility and efficacy of an individually tailored, child-centered,
      Internet-based behavioral intervention with that of general Internet-based health information
      for improving health behaviors and relative weight in Chinese-American children during a
      6-month period. A total of 60 children (age 10-14) and their families will be randomized to
      either the intervention group or control group. The intervention is based on the Social
      Cognitive Theory and Transtheoretical Model.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will use a randomized experimental design to examine the effects of an
      individually tailored, Internet-based behavioral intervention program on improving health
      behavior (dietary intake and physical activity) and anthropometrics of Chinese-American
      children. A total of 60 children and their families will be recruited. The intervention will
      include a weekly Internet session tailored to each individual child for eight weeks and three
      Internet sessions for parents. Children and their parents in the control group will receive
      general health information on healthy eating, active lifestyles, dental care, smoking
      cessation, and risk taking issues via the Internet. The content of the sessions is described
      later. After informed consent is obtained from parents and verbal assent from the children,
      baseline data (T0) will be collected before assigning the children and parents to the
      intervention group or control group. Follow-up data for both groups will be collected at 2
      months (T1), 4 months (T2) and 6 months (T3) after baseline.
