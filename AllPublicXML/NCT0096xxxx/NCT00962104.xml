      The treatment will be initiated at the lowest dosage 40 milligrams per day (mg/day), and it
      will be titrated up to 80 mg/day. Patients who are unable to tolerate a dose of at least 80
      mg/day through the end of this study will be discontinued. The dosage will be titrated up to
      a maximum of 120 mg/day.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Conners' Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-Investigator Rated: Screening Version (CAARS-Inv:SV) 18-Item Total Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Symptom Score up to 10 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CAARS-Inv:SV is a scale that assesses symptom severity over past week. Total ADHD symptom score consisted of 18 items (sum of inattention [9 items, range: 0-27] and hyperactivity-impulsivity [9 items, range: 0-27] subscales) using a 4-point scale (0=not at all/never to 3=very much/very frequently) for total score range of 0 to 54. Higher scores indicate greater impairment.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Quality of Life-29 (AAQoL) Scores up to 10 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participant-reported outcome measure used to examine disease-specific functional impairments and QoL for adults with ADHD. The domains include work functioning, family relationships, social functioning, activities of daily living (that is, driving, managing finances), and psychological adaptation (that is, life satisfaction and self-esteem). Individual items scored on a 5-point scale from 1 (not at all/never) to 5 (extremely/very often). Range of scores for this subscale is 0 to 100. Consistent with the majority of existing QoL measures, higher scores on AAQoL-29 indicate better functioning.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. Overall health state score is self-reported using a visual analogue scale marked on a scale of 0 to 100 with 0 representing worst imaginable health state and 100 representing best imaginable health state.</description>

    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CAARS-Inv:SV assesses symptom severity over past week. Total ADHD symptom score comprises 18 items (sum of inattention [9 items, range: 0-27] and hyperactivity-impulsivity [9 items, range: 0-27] subscales) using a 4-point scale (0=not at all/never to 3=very much/very frequently). Total score range: 0 to 54. Higher scores=greater impairment. Least Squares Mean Value based on mixed model repeated measures analysis with term for baseline, country, visit, treatment, and treatment*visit. Baseline included as a covariate; thus, treatment difference in observed value is same as change from baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 75-item standardized self-reported measure comprised of 3 subscales. Each item is rated on a 3-point Likert scale (1=behavior never observed to 3=behavior often observed). Behavioral regulation subscale measures one's control over behavior (30-90 total score). Metacognition subscale assesses systematic problem-solving ability while sustaining these task-completion efforts in active working memory (40-120 total score). Global executive composite (GEC) subscale rates participant's GEC in everyday environment (75- 225 total score). Higher subscale ratings=greater perceived impairment.</description>

    <description>The CGI-ADHD-S is a single-item clinician rating of the clinician's assessment of the overall severity of the participant's ADHD symptoms in relation to the clinician's total experience with ADHD participants. Measures severity of the participant's overall severity of ADHD symptoms (1=normal, not at all ill to 7=among the most extremely ill participants).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale-14 Items (HAMA-14) up to 10 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinician-administered rating scale that assesses severity of anxiety and its improvement (or change) during course of treatment (Hamilton 1959; Riskind et al. 1987). Scale consists of 14 items that provide an overall measure of general anxiety, including psychic anxiety and somatic anxiety. Investigator talked to participant about participant's symptoms over previous week before study visit. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale of 0 (absent) to 4 (very severe). Total score=sum of 14 items and ranges from 0 (normal) to 56 (severe). Higher scores indicate a greater degree of symptom severity.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 Items (HAMD-17 Total) up to 10 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HAMD-17 was used to assess the severity of depression and its improvement during the course of therapy. Each item was evaluated and scored using either a 5-point scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (very severe) or a 3-point scale of 0 (not present) to 2 (marked). Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity. The total score is the sum of the scores from HAMD-17 Items 1 through 17. The total score may range from 0 (not at all depressed) to 52 (severely depressed). Higher scores indicate a greater degree of symptom severity.</description>

The domains include work functioning, family relationships, social functioning, activities of daily living (that is, driving, managing finances), and psychological adaptation (that is, life satisfaction and self-esteem). Individual items scored on a 5-point scale from 1 (not at all/never) to 5 (extremely/very often). Range of scores for this subscale is 0 to 100. Consistent with the majority of existing QoL measures, higher scores on AAQoL-29 indicate better functioning.</description>

        <description>A 75-item standardized self-reported measure comprised of 3 subscales. Each item is rated on a 3-point Likert scale (1=behavior never observed to 3=behavior often observed). Behavioral regulation subscale measures one’s control over behavior (30-90 total score). Metacognition subscale assesses systematic problem-solving ability while sustaining these task-completion efforts in active working memory (40-120 total score). Global executive composite (GEC) subscale rates participant’s GEC in everyday environment (75- 225 total score). Higher subscale ratings=greater perceived impairment.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Clinical Global Impression-Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder-Severity Scale (CGI-ADHD-S) up to 10 Weeks</title>
          <description>The CGI-ADHD-S is a single-item clinician rating of the clinician’s assessment of the overall severity of the participant’s ADHD symptoms in relation to the clinician’s total experience with ADHD participants. Measures severity of the participant's overall severity of ADHD symptoms (1=normal, not at all ill to 7=among the most extremely ill participants).</description>
          <population>All randomized participants with a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline CGI-ADHD-S result within each treatment group, last observation carried forward (LOCF) were included in the analysis.</population>

        <description>Clinician-administered rating scale that assesses severity of anxiety and its improvement (or change) during course of treatment (Hamilton 1959; Riskind et al. 1987). Scale consists of 14 items that provide an overall measure of general anxiety, including psychic anxiety and somatic anxiety. Investigator talked to participant about participant's symptoms over previous week before study visit. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale of 0 (absent) to 4 (very severe). Total score=sum of 14 items and ranges from 0 (normal) to 56 (severe). Higher scores indicate a greater degree of symptom severity.</description>
