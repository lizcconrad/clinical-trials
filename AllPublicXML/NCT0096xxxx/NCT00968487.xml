      A single-site, single-blind study of ascending doses of Lyophilized Plasma in normal healthy
      volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This &quot;first-in-human&quot; Phase I, single-center, dose escalation study (using 3 dose levels) is
      proposed to assess the safety of infusing reconstituted lyophilized human plasma (LyP). The
      study design incorporates plasmapheresis-derived autologous plasma (FFP) for infusion(s) to
      eliminate variables and events known to be related to allogenic transfusion. Subjects will be
      enrolled at a blood center and provide autologous FFP that will be shipped to the sponsor
      site and used as the starting material to manufacture LyP. Once manufacturing is complete,
      the LyP (autologous) will be returned to the blood center for reconstitution and infusion
      into subjects. Maximum dosage within this study will approach &quot;massive transfusion&quot; (1 liter
      in Cohort 3) to obtain a preliminary assessment of safety. One half of the FFP obtained from
      subjects in Cohort 3 (only) will be shipped to the sponsor and returned to the site (but not
      manufactured into LyP) to serve as the control (autologous FFP).

    <description>Lyophilized Plasma is serves as a source of plasma proteins for subjects who are deficient in plasma proteins. The donor and recipient are the same person, therefore the process is autologous. HemCon's lyophilized plasma originates from FFP from screened individual donors to significantly reduce the risk of bloodborne disease transmission and undesired transfusion-associated reactions. Each single-donor unit is tested (per required of the blood supply) to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious agents and hence, maximize subject safety.</description>
