    <description>FACIT-Fatigue Scale (FS):13-item questionnaire, participant scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as 4 minus the participant's response. The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-FS for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score).

Work Loss Index (WLI), which represented percentage of lost work over time period relative to a normative population, was derived (total score: 0 [no loss] to 100 [complete loss of work]).</description>

Total score range: 0-9.4, higher score=more disease activity. DAS28-4 (ESR) &lt;= 3.2 implied low disease activity and &gt;3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate to high disease activity, and DAS28-4 (ESR) &lt;2.6 = remission.</description>

        <population>FAS included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study treatment and had at least 1 post-baseline measurement. Here 'N' (Number of Participants Analyzed) signifies participants who were evaluable for this measure.</population>

          <description>Participant-rated 12-item questionnaire to assess constructs of sleep over past week; 7 subscales:sleep disturbance,snoring,awakened short of breath,sleep adequacy,somnolence (range:0-100);sleep quantity (range:0-24),optimal sleep(yes/no), and 9 item index measures of sleep disturbance provide composite scores:sleep problem summary,overall sleep problem.Except adequacy,optimal sleep and quantity,higher scores=more impairment.Scores transformed(actual raw score[RS] minus lowest possible score divided by possible RS range*100);total score range:0-100;higher score=more intensity of attribute.</description>
          <population>FAS included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study treatment and had at least 1 post-baseline measurement. Here 'N' (Number of Participants Analyzed) signifies participants who were evaluable for this measure and ‘n’ signifies participants who were evaluable at specified time points for each arm group, respectively.</population>

It included 7 subscales: sleep disturbance, snoring, awakened short of breath, sleep adequacy, somnolence, sleep quantity and optimal sleep. Participants responded whether their sleep was optimal or not optimal by choosing yes or no. Number of participants with optimal sleep is reported.</description>

The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as 4 minus the participant's response. The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-FS for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score).

        <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (confined to bed). Scoring formula developed by EuroQoL Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

          <title>Euro Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)- Health State Profile Utility Score at Baseline, Month 1 and 3</title>
          <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (confined to bed). Scoring formula developed by EuroQoL Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>
          <population>FAS included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study treatment and had at least 1 post-baseline measurement. Here 'N' (Number of Participants Analyzed) signifies participants who were evaluable for this measure and ‘n’ signifies participants who were evaluable at specified time points for each arm group, respectively.</population>

Indirect costs associated with functional disability:employment status,willingness to work,work disability due to RA,sick leave,part time work,ability to perform chores,chores done by family/friends/housekeeper.

        <title>Work Productivity and Healthcare Resource Utilization (HCRU) at Month 6</title>
        <description>RA-HCRU assessed healthcare usage during last 3 months for direct, indirect medical cost domains. Direct cost: visit to doctor, non-medical practitioner, nursing home, hospital, surgery, emergency room(ER) treatment, diagnostic tests, over-night stay, home healthcare services, aids/devices used. Indirect costs associated with functional disability: employment status, willingness to work, work disability due to RA, sick leave, part time work, ability to perform chores, chores done by family/friends/housekeeper. Assessment was based on 0 to 2-point scale; higher score=higher medical cost.</description>

        <description>WLQ: participant-reported 25-item scale to evaluate degree to which health problems interfere with an ability to perform job roles along 4 dimensions: Time Management scale (TMS)(5-items); Physical Demands scale (PDS) (6-item); Mental-Interpersonal Demands Scale (MIDS) (9-items); Output Demands Scale (ODS) (5-items). All the scales ranged from 0 (limited none of the time) to 100 (limited all of the time). Work Loss Index (WLI), which represented percentage of lost work over time period relative to a normative population, was derived (total score: 0 [no loss] to 100 [complete loss of work]).</description>
        <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
        <population>FAS included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study treatment and had at least 1 post-baseline measurement. Here 'N' (Number of Participants Analyzed) signifies participants who were evaluable for this measure.</population>

        <description>DAS28-3 (CRP) was calculated from the SJC and TJC using the 28 joints count and CRP (mg/L). Total score range: 0-9.4, higher score=more disease activity. DAS28-3 (CRP) &lt;=3.2 implied low disease activity and &gt;3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate to high disease activity, and DAS28-3 (CRP) &lt;2.6 = remission.</description>

        <population>FAS included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study treatment and had at least 1 post-baseline measurement. Here 'N' (Number of Participants Analyzed) signifies participants who were evaluable for this measure.</population>
