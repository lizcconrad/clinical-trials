      A pilot study to evaluate the ability of photobiomodulation to alter cerebral blood flow in
      the frontal poles and to affect the emotional status of patients with major depression.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We wish to study whether photobiomodulation (PBM) with near infrared (NIR) light emitting
      diodes (LED), a non-ionizing phototherapy, in patients with major depression, can acutely
      alter frontal brain blood flow measured by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).

      Secondarily, we will examine whether PBM can improve emotional state immediately and over the
      following month.

      We see this as a pilot study to gather preliminary data that will guide future studies.

    <description>The treatment will consist of applying PBM in the form of a super-luminous LED with an output of 250 mW/cm2 at a wavelength of 815 nm with a full width half maximum of 40 nm when applied at 4 mm from the skin. The treatment will consist of the exposure to the light for 4 minutes (total delivered fluence per spot of 60 J/cm2) at each of 4 sites on the forehead that correspond to the 10-20 EEG sites, F3, and F4.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must be right handed, between the ages of 18 and 60, and meet criterion
             for depression on a Structured Clinical Diagnostic Interview

          -  Enrollment will be made without regard to gender or ethnicity

          -  Patients who are receiving treatment for depression, either psychological or
             pharmacological, may continue their treatment during the time of the study, but will
             be asked to try not to alter their treatment from one month prior to the onset of the
             experiment until its conclusion. If they must alter their treatment, the patient will
             continue in the study for observation, but will be excluded from any follow-up
             statistical comparisons

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Past history of psychotic disorder (including schizophrenia or schizoaffective
             disorder

          -  Bipolar disorder

          -  Obsessive compulsive disorder)

          -  Substance abuse disorder that has been active with the past 6 months,

          -  A history of violent behavior

          -  A history of a past suicide gesture or attempt

          -  A history of current suicidal ideation

          -  A history of a neurological condition (e.g. epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, stroke)

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Current acute or chronic medical condition requiring a medications that has
             psychological side-effects

          -  Any person whom we judge to have an impaired decision-making capacity
