  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Samples of sputum from asthmatic children, between 5-17 years, will be collected during two
      years of the study period to perform tests Particle Size Distribution (PSD) and Shape
      Analysis (SA) of the particulate matter in the sputum and a biochemical reaction to evaluate
      the activity of Heme Oxygenase-1 protein in sputum cell supernatants.

      Each child will perform Pulmonary Function Testing (PFT) and Induced Sputum (IS) as a routine
      part of diagnosis of asthma.

      Parents will be asked to complete a questionnaire including questions on their child's
      respiratory symptoms in the last 12 months as well as socioeconomic factors. Parents will be
      asked to give informed written consent for their child's participation in the study.
