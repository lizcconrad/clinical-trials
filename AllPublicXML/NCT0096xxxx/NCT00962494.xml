      Cancer: Surviving and Thriving is a 6-week workshop for cancer survivors. The overall goal of
      the study is to determine whether an online cancer survivor education and support workshop
      can have lasting beneficial effects in helping survivors improve their self-management of
      health skills and quality of life.

      This workshop is aimed at helping you better manage your own health and the demands placed on
      you because of your cancer diagnosis. It is hoped that the workshop will give you the skills
      needed to reduce stress and improve your quality of life. If successful, the workshop can be
      made available to other cancer survivors.

      Each workshop is 6 weeks with new lessons each week. You will be asked to log on at your
      convenience 2-3 times each week for a total of 1-2 hours, to read the lessons, complete
      assignments, and share your ideas and experiences with your classmates. There are no
      requirements that participants log in at the same time.

      With the moderators and other workshop participants, you will discuss:

        -  Healthy eating

        -  Managing fatigue

        -  Managing stress

        -  Starting and maintaining an appropriate physical activity program

        -  Getting a good night's sleep

        -  Dealing with difficult emotions

        -  Solving the problems caused by having had cancer

        -  Communicating better with your health care professionals

        -  Communicating better with your friends, family and coworkers
