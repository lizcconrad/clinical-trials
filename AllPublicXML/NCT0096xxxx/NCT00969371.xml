      The purpose of the following clinical protocol is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      the Lenstec Tetraflex Accommodating Posterior Chamber Intraocular Lens (IOL) for the protocol
      inclusion/exclusion criteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Lenstec TetraFlex Accommodating Posterior Chamber Intraocular Lens (IOL) is an
      ultraviolet absorbing optical implant designed for the replacement of the human crystalline
      lens following phacoemulsification cataract removal. The TetraFlex Accommodating Posterior
      Chamber IOL is designed for treatment of aphakia. The lens is indicated for primary
      implantation when a cataractous lens has been removed by phacoemulsification with circular
      tear capsulotomy and the posterior capsule intact. The intended benefit of the TetraFlex
      Accommodating Posterior Chamber IOL is to provide enhanced distance and near vision with an
      increased independence from corrective lens wear.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or Female

          -  Any race

          -  Patients age at time of surgery to be 18 years or older.

          -  Presence of bilateral cataract requiring cataract extraction. If only one eye is being
             implanted with the study lens, the other eye may have had cataract extraction with IOL
             implantation.

          -  Clear intraocular media other than cataract.

          -  Patients with BSCVA &lt; 20/40 or cataract with glare acuity worse than 20/30

          -  Corneal Astigmatism less than 1 Diopter.

          -  Good Visual Potential: Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) projected by PAM or Pinhole
             20/25 or better if other pathology is suspected.

          -  Patient is able and willing to comply with follow-up.

          -  Able to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are monocular.

          -  Presence of an ocular infection.

          -  Greater than or equal to 1 Diopter of pre-operative corneal astigmatism.

          -  Patients who are on anti-psychotic and antidepressant medication that could
             potentially effect accommodation

          -  Patients who chronically take any medication that may affect accommodation, including
             first generation antihistamines, and anticholinergic agents.

          -  Previous intraocular surgery in either eye.

          -  Previous serious corneal disease.

          -  Diagnosis of any of the following ocular conditions: active scleral disease, glaucoma,
             retinal disease potentially affecting central vision, macular disease or uveitis,
             severe dry eyes and dysthyroid eye disease

          -  Subjects who may be expected to require retinal laser treatment.

          -  Subjects with diagnosed degenerative visual disorders (e.g. macular degeneration or
             other retinal disorders) that are predicted to cause future acuity losses to a level
             of 20/30 or worse).

          -  Patients requiring administration of topical ophthalmic medications other than the
             study medications. Use of systemic corticosteroids or anti-metabolites or other
             medications that could affect wound healing is specifically contraindicated.

          -  Allergy to anesthetics or other postoperative medications.

          -  Presence of any uncontrolled systemic disease (e.g. diabetes, hypertension,
             cardiovascular disease).

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Persons who, in the determination of the investigator, are not competent to understand
             the procedure, the actions asked of them as research subjects, or capable of
             completing the patient satisfaction questionnaire.

          -  Participation in a previous clinical trial within the 30 days prior to the start of
             the study.

          -  Persons who may not be able to complete the requirements of returning to the
             investigator's clinic over the period of the study, or who may be difficult to locate
             or contact on short notice. This does not preclude vacations or travel.
