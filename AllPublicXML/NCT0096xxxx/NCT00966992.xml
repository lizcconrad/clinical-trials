  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of cervical cancer with chemotherapy and radiation will make women post
      menopausal (no estrogen from the ovaries), if a woman is not already in menopause. Estrogen
      plays a key role in maintaining bone health. Therefore, these women are at higher risk of
      getting osteoporosis (decrease minerals in the bone) and bone fractures. The overall purpose
      of this research is to look at the effects of zoledronic acid (Zometa) on preventing bone
      loss. Studies have also shown that zoledronic acid may prevent metastasis to the bone which
      can occur in women with cervical cancer. Zometa is investigational (not approved by the Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA)) in this study to prevent metastasis to the bone in women with
      cervical cancer. Therefore, the goal of this study is to also look at the effects of
      zoledronic acid (Zometa) on circulating tumor cells in the bone marrow and blood. This study
      is being done to find a way to prevent bone loss and metastasis to the bone in women
      undergoing chemotherapy and radiation for cervical cancer. An additional component of the
      study is to assess the importance of stress on immune markers in blood during standard
      treatment.

      OBJECTIVES

        -  To determine the incidence of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in bone marrow and
           circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood of women with cervical cancer at diagnosis
           and 3 to 9 months after chemotherapy and pelvic radiation with and without Zometa.

        -  To determine the change in biochemical markers of bone turnover from diagnosis to 9
           months after radiation in women receiving chemoradiation for cervical cancer with and
           without Zometa.

        -  To determine change in bone mineral density from diagnosis to 9 month after
           chemoradiation with and without Zometa.

        -  To determine if depressed and anxious mood are associated with greater impairment of
           adaptive immunity (ratio of Th1/Th2) and higher levels of angiogenesis (VEGF) in
           peripheral blood of cervical cancer patients.

        -  To examine the relationship of standardized uptake values (SUV)Max and metabolic
           heterogeneity in the primary tumor and evidence of persistent/recurrent disease on the 3
           and 9 month Fludeoxyglucose (FDG)-Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans with DTCs and
           CTCs.
