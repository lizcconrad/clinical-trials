  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine whether citalopram is a useful, well-tolerated, and safe
      treatment for children and adolescents ages 7 to 18 years with functional abdominal pain. The
      study hypothesis is that citalopram will be better than placebo in producing clinical
      improvement and reductions in abdominal pain. It is also hypothesized that citalopram and
      placebo will not differ in terms of safety and tolerability.

      This study aims to determine the relative efficacy, tolerability, and safety of the
      citalopram in the treatment of pediatric functional recurrent abdominal pain (FAP) in
      children and adolescents ages 7 to 18 years, inclusive. The goal is to recruit and randomize
      100 subjects to citalopram or placebo. Secondary aims include to determine if citalopram is
      superior to placebo in reducing comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms in children and
      adolescents with FAP, to explore potential mediators (i.e., anxiety, depression) and
      moderators (e.g., age, gender, referral from primary or specialty care) of treatment
      response, and to explore the durability and tolerability of citalopram treatment 18 weeks
      following completion of the double-blind treatment phase with the goal of generating data
      useful to the development of future studies. The study is novel in conducting recruitment,
      assessment, and treatment in traditional medical settings. Limited exclusion criteria and the
      delivery of study assessments and interventions within routine practice settings provide for
      considerably greater external validity than the typical efficacy study.

      Study hypotheses:

        1. Citalopram will be superior to placebo in producing clinical improvement and reductions
           in abdominal pain.

        2. Citalopram and placebo will not differ in tolerability or safety.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 3 episodes of abdominal pain during the previous 3 months associated with
             functional impairment in the absence of explanatory physical disease following
             clinically appropriate medical assessment.

          -  Age 7 years 0 months to 18 years 11 months, inclusive, at initial evaluation.

          -  Significant global functional impairment as reflected by a score less than 70 on the
             Children's Global Assessment Scale

          -  Residing with a primary caretaker (i.e., parent, legal guardian, relative functioning
             as a parent, or foster parent) who has known the child well for at least 6 months
             prior to study entry and has legal authority to consent to participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Physical disease sufficient to explain the subjective distress and functional
             impairment suffered by the subject.
