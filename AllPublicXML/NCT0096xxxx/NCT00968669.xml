    <measure>Change at Day 92 From Baseline in Mean Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) Scores (Intent-toTreat Analysis)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 92</time_frame>
    <description>Change at Day 92 from baseline (Day 1, prior to dosing) in mean ACQ scores in pariticpants receiving 30, 100, or 300 mg MEDI-528 versus placebo (Intent-to-Treat Analysis). The 6-item ACQ is a participant-reported questionnaire assessing asthma symptoms (night-time waking, symptoms on waking, activity limitation, shortness of breath, wheezing) and daily rescue bronchodilator use. Participants were asked to recall how their asthma had been during the previous week. Questions were weighted equally and scored from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). The mean ACQ score is the mean of the responses. Mean scores of ≤ 0.75 indicate well-controlled asthma, scores between 0.76 and &lt; 1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, and a score ≥ 1.5 indicates uncontrolled asthma. Individual changes of at least 0.5 are considered to be clinically meaningful.</description>

An exacerbation was defined as a progressive increase of asthma symptoms AND a reduction of 20% or more in peak expiratory flow (PEF) or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) from baseline (Day 1, prior to dosing) or best previously measured value prior to the current event that did not resolve after the initiation of rescue medications; and results in a prescription for/or administration of systemic corticosteroid burst therapy by the investigator or health care provider. An exacerbation event was considered resolved when the subject's asthma symptoms diminished and PEF or FEV1 return to greater than 80% of baseline for 7 or more days after completion of systemic corticosteroid burst therapy.</description>

         12. At least one asthma exacerbation in the 12 months before screening that required
             intake of systemic corticosteroids after an unscheduled medical encounter or as agreed
             with a physician based on an asthma action plan that defines when oral steroids can be
             taken by the subject

         13. Ability and willingness to complete the follow-up period through Day 323 as required
             by the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria

        <description>Change at Day 92 from baseline (Day 1, prior to dosing) in mean ACQ scores in pariticpants receiving 30, 100, or 300 mg MEDI-528 versus placebo (Intent-to-Treat Analysis). The 6-item ACQ is a participant-reported questionnaire assessing asthma symptoms (night-time waking, symptoms on waking, activity limitation, shortness of breath, wheezing) and daily rescue bronchodilator use. Participants were asked to recall how their asthma had been during the previous week. Questions were weighted equally and scored from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). The mean ACQ score is the mean of the responses. Mean scores of ≤ 0.75 indicate well-controlled asthma, scores between 0.76 and &lt; 1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, and a score ≥ 1.5 indicates uncontrolled asthma. Individual changes of at least 0.5 are considered to be clinically meaningful.</description>

        <description>Weighted asthma exacerbation rate (total number of exacerbation rate in each group per total duration of participant-year follow-up in each group) between Day 1 and Day 92 in pariticpants receiving 30, 100, or 300 mg MEDI-528 versus placebo (Intent-to-Treat Analysis). An exacerbation was defined as a progressive increase of asthma symptoms AND a reduction of 20% or more in peak expiratory flow (PEF) or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) from baseline (Day 1, prior to dosing) or best previously measured value prior to the current event that did not resolve after the initiation of rescue medications; and results in a prescription for/or administration of systemic corticosteroid burst therapy by the investigator or health care provider. An exacerbation event was considered resolved when the subject’s asthma symptoms diminished and PEF or FEV1 return to greater than 80% of baseline for 7 or more days after completion of systemic corticosteroid burst therapy.</description>

        <title>Weighted Asthma Exacerbation Rate Through Day 176 (Intent-to-Treat Analysis)</title>
        <description>Weighted asthma exacerbation rate (total number of exacerbation rate in each group per total duration of participant-year follow-up in each group) between Day 1 and Day 176 in pariticpants receiving 30, 100, or 300 mg MEDI-528 versus placebo (Intent-to-Treat Analysis). An exacerbation was defined as a progressive increase of asthma symptoms AND a reduction of 20% or more in peak expiratory flow (PEF) or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) from baseline (Day 1, prior to dosing) or best previously measured value prior to the current event that did not resolve after the initiation of rescue medications; and results in a prescription for/or administration of systemic corticosteroid burst therapy by the investigator or health care provider. An exacerbation event was considered resolved when the subject’s asthma symptoms diminished and PEF or FEV1 return to greater than 80% of baseline for 7 or more days after completion of systemic corticosteroid burst therapy.</description>

An exacerbation was defined as a progressive increase of asthma symptoms AND a reduction of 20% or more in peak expiratory flow (PEF) or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) from baseline (Day 1, prior to dosing) or best previously measured value prior to the current event that did not resolve after the initiation of rescue medications; and results in a prescription for/or administration of systemic corticosteroid burst therapy by the investigator or health care provider. An exacerbation event was considered resolved when the subject’s asthma symptoms diminished and PEF or FEV1 return to greater than 80% of baseline for 7 or more days after completion of systemic corticosteroid burst therapy.</description>

The 6-item ACQ is a participant-reported questionnaire assessing asthma symptoms (night-time waking, symptoms on waking, activity limitation, shortness of breath, wheezing) and daily rescue bronchodilator use. Participants were asked to recall how their asthma had been during the previous week. Questions were weighted equally and scored from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). The mean ACQ score is the mean of the responses. Mean scores of ≤ 0.75 indicate well-controlled asthma, scores between 0.76 and &lt; 1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, and a score ≥ 1.5 indicates uncontrolled asthma. Individual changes of at least 0.5 are considered to be clinically meaningful.</description>

        <description>Effect of MEDI-528 (30, 100, or 300 mg) versus placebo on the time to first observed mean ACQ change from baseline (Day 1, prior to dosing) &gt; or = 1.5 Through Day 176 (Intent-to-Treat Analysis). The 6-item ACQ is a participant-reported questionnaire assessing asthma symptoms (night-time waking, symptoms on waking, activity limitation, shortness of breath, wheezing) and daily rescue bronchodilator use. Participants were asked to recall how their asthma had been during the previous week. Questions were weighted equally and scored from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). The mean ACQ score is the mean of the responses. Mean scores of ≤ 0.75 indicate well-controlled asthma, scores between 0.76 and &lt; 1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, and a score ≥ 1.5 indicates uncontrolled asthma. Individual changes of at least 0.5 are considered to be clinically meaningful.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Participants Who Had a Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire - Standard (AQLQ[S]) Assessment Response at Day 85 (Intent-to-Treat Analysis)</title>
        <description>Effect of MEDI-528 (30, 100, or 300 mg) versus placebo on the proportion of participants who had an AQLQ(S) assessment response (defined as an improvement of at least 0.5 score in AQLQ[S]) at Day 85 (Intent-to-Treat Analysis). The AQLQ(S) is a 32-item questionnaire that measures the health related quality of life experienced by asthma patients. In the study, participants were asked to recall their experiences during the previous 2 weeks and to score each of the 32 questions on a 7-point scale ranging from 7 (no impairment) to 1 (severe impairment). The overall score is calculated as the mean response to all questions. Individual improvement in the overall score of 0.5 has been identified as the minimally important difference, with score changes &gt; 1.5 identified to be large meaningful differences.</description>
