      The purpose of this study is; to determine the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of ICA-105665
      using the intradermal (ID) capsaicin model in healthy male subjects, and to investigate the
      effect of ICA-105665 on inflammatory hyperalgesia using the ultraviolet B (UV-B) model in
      healthy male subjects.
