        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and female subjects between 18 to 55 years of age inclusive with a Body
             Mass Index (BMI) of approximately 18 to 30 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110
             lbs)

          -  Results of screening and clinical laboratory tests are within normal range or
             considered not clinically significant by the Principal Investigator or Sponsor

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must be using a medically acceptable form of
             birth control for at least 1 month prior to screening (3 months on oral
             contraceptives), e.g., oral or patch contraceptives, intrauterine device,
             Depo-Provera®, or a double barrier and have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and
             Day 0 for each Dosing Period. Female subjects of non-childbearing potential must be
             amenorrheic for at least 2 years or had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy

          -  Be willing to participate in all scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests
             and other trial procedures according to the clinical protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of hypersensitivity to aspirin (ASA), naproxen sodium, or acetaminophen, and
             similar pharmacological agents or components of the products

          -  Females who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Loss of blood in excess of 500 ml within 56 days of the first dose of trial treatment
             (e.g., donation, plasmapheresis or injury)

          -  History of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, related to previous NSAID
             therapy. Active, or history of recurrent peptic ulcer/hemorrhage (two or more distinct
             episodes of proven ulceration or bleeding)

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic diseases
             or malignancies

          -  Positive alcohol or drug test at Screening and on Day 0 of each Dosing Period

          -  Have taken any medications (except acceptable forms of birth control) within 10 days
             prior to dosing or throughout the trial, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and
             the Sponsor, the medication will not interfere with the trial procedures, data
             integrity, or compromise the safety of the subject

          -  Have taken ASA, ASA-containing products, acetaminophen (acetyl-para-amino-phenol or
             APAP) or any NSAID (OTC or prescription) 7 days prior to dosing or during the
             treatment period, other than trial treatment
