      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single administration
      of RT001 compared to placebo gel for the treatment of moderate to severe lateral canthal
      lines.

    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, controlled, multi-center study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single administration of RT001 compared to placebo
      applied as a bilateral application in at least 72 subjects with moderate to severe Lateral
      Canthal Lines. Subjects will be randomized within each site to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a
      1:1 ratio. The efficacy and safety of RT001 compared to placebo will be evaluated. Study
      follow-up visits will occur at Weeks 2, 4 and 6.

          -  Willing to refrain from receiving facial fillers, laser treatments, use of any product
             that affects skin remodeling or a product that may cause an active dermal response in
             the treatment area beginning at Screening and through End of Study (Week 6)

          -  Women of childbearing potential must be practicing and willing to continue to use an
             effective method of birth control during the course of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any neurological condition that may place the subject at increased risk with exposure
             to Botulinum Toxin Type A, including peripheral motor neuropathic diseases such as
             amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and motor neuropathy, and euromuscular junctional
             disorders
