  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adaptive support ventilation (ASV) is a closed loop ventilation mode that can act both as
      pressure support (PSV) and pressure controlled (PCV) ventilation. Weaning with ASV shows
      promising results mainly in post-cardiac surgery patients. The aim of this randomized
      controlled study was to test the hypothesis that weaning with ASV could reduce the weaning
      duration in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) when compared with
      PSV.
