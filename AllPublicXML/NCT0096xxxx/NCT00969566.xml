  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well established that inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV reduces glucose
      levels in both fasting and postprandial states and preserves pancreatic beta cell function in
      patients with type 2 diabetes. Their mechanism of action is derived from increased incretin
      (GLP-1) levels, which stimulate insulin secretion as well as insulin biosynthesis and inhibit
      glucagon secretion from pancreas. Recent studies reported that combination therapy with
      DPP-IV inhibitors and metformin have additive or synergistic effects in lowering glycose
      level, preserving beta-cell mass and function as well as enhancing insulin sensitivity.
      However, there have been few studies about the difference of glucose lowering effect of
      combination therapy of DPP-IV inhibitors and metformin according to the secretory capacity of
      pancreas.

      The researchers hypothesized that combination therapy with DPP-IV inhibitor and metformin may
      have more favorable glucose lowering effect in type 2 diabetic patients who have preserved
      pancreatic secretory function. The researchers plan to investigate the difference of glucose
      lowering effect of 24 weeks treatment with sitagliptin (DPP-IV inhibitor) in combination with
      metformin according to basal c-peptide and glucagon level in type 2 diabetic patients.
