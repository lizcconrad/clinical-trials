    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the highest safe dose of XL184 administered orally
      in combination with temozolomide (TMZ, Temodar®) and radiation therapy (RT). XL184 is a new
      chemical entity that inhibits VEGFR2, MET, and RET, kinases implicated in tumor formation,
      growth and migration. Temozolomide (TMZ, Temodar®) is an orally administered alkylating
      agent. It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of newly
      diagnosed glioblastoma (GB) patients when given in combination with radiation therapy (RT)
      followed by maintenance treatment. First-line treatment for patients with GB consists of a
      concurrent phase (6-7 weeks in duration) during which TMZ is given with RT, followed by a
      rest phase (4 weeks in duration; to allow for recovery from delayed toxicity, if present),
      and a maintenance phase, during which patients receive TMZ for approximately twelve 28-day
      cycles. To determine the highest safe dose, subjects will receive different amounts of XL184
      at different times according to the phase of TMZ and radiation therapy. The first group of
      subjects will receive the lowest dose of XL184. As long as no medically unacceptable side
      effects are noted, the dose will be increased for the next group. If the dose is not
      well-tolerated by the first group of subjects, the dose will be lowered for the next group.
