  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide follow-up information and care of patients who have undergone
      autologous intracoronary bone marrow cell administration at our institution. Patients are
      monitored for their response to treatment, progression of heart failure and coronary artery
      disease, and potential later occurring effects of the administered bone marrow cells.

      Patients are eligible for this follow-up study if they have received their first
      intracoronary bone marrow cell administration for the treatment of cardiac disease at our
      institution from 2001 ongoing.

      Participants are generally seen in the clinic at 12 months and 5 years after cell
      administration, in the meantime regular yearly telephone contacts are performed until 10
      years after cell transplantation.

      The detailed description contains the planned procedures that are performed during the
      clinical visits and, if necessary, at additional contacts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In detail, the following procedures are performed during the clinical visits and, if
      necessary, at additional contacts:

        -  periodic physical examination and blood tests

        -  non-invasive imaging studies may include echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging

        -  electrocardiogram at rest and during treadmill testing (may include spiroergometry
           testing)

        -  interrogation of implanted defibrillators / pacemakers for monitoring of arrhythmias
