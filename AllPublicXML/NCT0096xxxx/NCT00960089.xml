  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a major clinical need for an inexpensive topically-applied product that can inhibit
      the growth of the dermatophytes that cause nail fungus. Chesson Labs has developed LIQUICURE
      with a longer drying/curing time that will allow better nail penetration or adsorption.
      Though the product may have inherent antimicrobial activity, the product does not contain a
      drug or antimicrobial agent.

      Consistent use of LIQUICURE as described will clear fungal nail infection. Clearing of nail
      fungal infection is defined by negative dermatophyte culture and visual improvement in nail
      characteristics within six months, with few, if any product-related adverse events.
