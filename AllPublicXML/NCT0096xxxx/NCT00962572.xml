      A study to see if coordinated aggressive patient management will improve patient treatment
      outcomes and is cost effective.

    <textblock>
      This is an observational study of the effects of aggressive patient management. The records
      of 50 patients treated under the aggressive management plan will be matched with the records
      of 50 previous patients and attempts made to assess the improvement, if any, found.
      Statistical analysis will compare the outcomes of the study group and the matched control
      group for initial completion of planned therapy as per prescription, weight loss during
      therapy, intercurrent illness, and intercurrent hospitalizations. Long term analysis will
      compare the study group's outcomes (compared to expected outcomes) compared to the matched
      control group.

    <description>Aggressive patient management will be implemented by a corps of &quot;patient manager&quot; volunteers backed by a transportation, nutrition, and social services network. The social services professionals will work with the volunteers to establish the support needed for each patient. The volunteer managers will in turn constantly monitor that such support is addressing the patient's ability to be treated. Access to sponsored housing will be coordinated. Nutritional support will be coordinated by the Dietary department and will consist of counseling, and supplements when necessary. Provision of supplemental feeding for housed patients will be arranged.</description>
