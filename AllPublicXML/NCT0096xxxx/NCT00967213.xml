      The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in preferential hyperacuity perimeter (PHP)
      and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) in patients with neovascular age-related macular
      degeneration receiving combination of ranibizumab (LucentisTM) and verteporfin (Visudyne®)

After 4 weeks from third injection, a session of verteporfin PDT (week 12) and fourth injection of Lucentis® (week 16) will be added at intervals of 4 weeks. Two more combined treatment with verteporfin PDT and Lucentis® injection 4 weeks apart can be added at the treating physician's discretion in 3-month intervals (week 28, week 40).</description>
