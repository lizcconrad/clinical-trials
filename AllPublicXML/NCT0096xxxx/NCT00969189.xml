  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Once a child has been anaesthetised and is fully asleep, a special airway tube called a
      laryngeal mask is often inserted into their mouth to help with their breathing. This tube is
      removed just before the child wakes up.

      A new type of airway tube, called an i-gel airway, has been developed for children, which is
      hoped will be easier to insert, safer once in position, and will be less likely to cause a
      sore throat after the anaesthetic than a standard laryngeal mask. The adult i-gel airway has
      been available for adults since 2007, and early trials have shown very encouraging results.
