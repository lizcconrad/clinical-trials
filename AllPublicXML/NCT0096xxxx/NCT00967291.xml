      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as mitomycin C and ifosfamide, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving mitomycin C together with ifosfamide
      works in treating patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To assess the therapeutic activity of a mitomycin C and ifosfamide combination, in terms
           of progression-free survival rate at 6 months, in patients with metastatic stage IV
           adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive mitomycin C IV on day 1 and ifosfamide IV on days 1-3. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
