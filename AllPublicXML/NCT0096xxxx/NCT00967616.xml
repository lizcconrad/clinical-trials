      This phase 2, randomized, active-controlled, open-label, parallel group, multicenter study
      will be conducted at up to 18 study centers in the US, Central America, and South America.
      Adult subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who failed first-line chemotherapy
      will participate in the study, which will be conducted on an outpatient basis. It is
      anticipated that 100 subjects will be enrolled to obtain approximately 90 evaluable subjects.

             thereafter. Men who are the partner of a woman of childbearing potential must be
             willing to consent to using effective contraception (e.g., vasectomy or barrier with

          -  All female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test
             (serum or urine) result before initiating study treatment.

          -  Subjects must be fully informed about their illness and the investigational nature of
             the study protocol (including foreseeable risks and possible side effects) and must

             or requiring therapy with steroids or anticonvulsants to control associated symptoms);
             uncontrolled seizure disorder; spinal cord compression; or carcinomatous meningitis.
             Subjects with treated brain metastasis will be included in the study if they have
             recovered from the acute, toxic effects of RT. A minimum of 15 days must have elapsed
             between the end of RT and enrollment into the study.

          -  History of malignancy other than CRC, unless there is an expectation that the
