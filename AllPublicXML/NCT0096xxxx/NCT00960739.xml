      RATIONALE: Radioactive drugs, such as iodobenzylguanidine meta-I131, may carry radiation
      directly to tumor cells and not harm normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      topotecan hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. A stem cell transplant may be able to
      replace the cells that were destroyed by iodobenzylguanidine meta-i131 and topotecan
      hydrochloride.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of iodobenzylguanidine meta-I131
      given together with topotecan hydrochloride and to see how well it works in treating young
      patients with refractory or relapsed metastatic neuroblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of iodobenzylguanidine meta-I131 (^131I-MIBG) and
           topotecan in young patients with refractory or relapsed metastatic neuroblastoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the hematological and extra-hematological toxicities of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      During the 21 days before treatment begins, autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are
      collected.

      Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes daily on days 1-5 and
      iodobenzylguanidine meta-^131I IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
      2 courses. Patients also undergo total-body irradiation.

      On day 10 of the second course, autologous PBSC are reinfused.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 6 and 12 months.

    <description>The topotecan hydrochloride is administered intravenously over five days to dose of 0.7 mg/ m²/day from day 1 to day 5 (first cycle), then from day 21 to day 25 (second cycle). *
Iobenguane I 131: 444 MBq / kg of 131-iodine MIBG is administered on day 1 with activity up to 11,100 MBq per injection. *
A dosimetry is performed during hospitalization.
A second dose of 131-iodine MIBG (maximum 11 100 MBq) is administered to D21 so as to obtain a total body irradiation of 4 Gy. *
Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation : Hematopoietic stem cells are reinjected 10 days after the second injection of 131-iodine MIBG.
If the dose of total-body irradiation of 4 Gy is reached during the first cycle, the second cycle is canceled.</description>
