  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a newly developed patient education
      document concerning colorectal cancer screening will be better understood and have greater
      effects on patient knowledge of and motivation for screening than a standard educational
      document.

    <description>The newly developed educational document was created accounting for health behavioral models (such as the Expanded Health Behavior Model, Social Cognitive Theory, and the Transtheoretical Model) and related research studies indicating the factors that most strongly and positively influence patients' cognitions regarding colorectal cancer screening and are, in turn, predictive of actual colorectal cancer screening behavior.</description>
