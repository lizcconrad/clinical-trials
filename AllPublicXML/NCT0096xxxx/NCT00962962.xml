      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of different amounts and intensities of
      aerobic exercise training programs, with and without weight loss, in people who are at risk
      for diabetes. An additional purpose of the study is to evaluate the factors in the blood and
      in exercising muscles that contribute to the improvement in those risk factors. This
      information will be used to improve exercise training guidelines for improving cardiovascular
      and metabolic health in people with abnormal fasting glucose, also known as prediabetes.
