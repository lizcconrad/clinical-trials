      The purpose of this study is to develop small molecule radio-labeled probes of beta-amyloid,
      to be used with positron emission tomography (PET) for early detection and treatment
      monitoring of Alzheimer disease (AD). The study hypothesis is that PET imaging of small
      molecule probes, in the form of novel fluorescent dyes with radioactive labels, will
      demonstrate cerebral patterns in patients with AD that are distinct from those of age-matched
      persons who are cognitively intact.

      This is a naturalistic study in which clinical evaluations and brain scans will be performed
      on 20 people with Down syndrome (DS) as well as 20 healthy controls across a range of ages.
      Participants will receive comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological assessments. PET and
      MRI scans will be performed at baseline and after two years of follow up. All participants
      will have blood drawn for APOE genotyping during their baseline evaluations. The intellectual
      range of participants with DS will be restricted to IQ scores of 45 to 60 (moderate range) to
      reduce variability, particularly due to extreme low levels of intellectual ability.
