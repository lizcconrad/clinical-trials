  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a short motivational patient-centered
      intervention for non-adherent patients is more successful in improving beliefs about
      medication (and adherence) compared to a usual care control group of non-adherent patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) reduce disease activity and radiological
      progression and improve long term functional outcome in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis
      (RA). However, adherence is a prerequisite for a drug to be effective. A previous study
      showed that 33% of the RA-patients using DMARDs are non-adherent. Non-adherence can not be
      attributed to a single cause, but is the result of a complex and individual decision process.
      An intervention should not only consider practical barriers, such as forgetfulness, but also
      cognitive and other psychological variables that might impact medication adherence.
      Therefore, an intervention was developed focusing primarily on the non-adherent patient's
      individual beliefs and barriers to adherence.

      The effectiveness of this intervention will be evaluated in a randomized clinical trial.
      Primary outcome measure is beliefs about medication assessed with the Beliefs about Medicines
      Questionnaire (BMQ). Additionally, adherence and adherence-related variables will be measured
      with questionnaires.

    <description>In short, the intervention consists of two group sessions moderated by a pharmacist. During these sessions, patients' self-perceived needs to take medication ('necessity beliefs'), concerns about taking medication ('concern beliefs'), and practical barriers are discussed. To explore a patient's individual ambivalence regarding his/her beliefs and barriers, the pharmacist uses Motivational Interviewing techniques. In between the sessions, participants make a homework assignment about their own beliefs and barriers, and eight weeks after the second session, a follow-up call to the individual patients is made by the pharmacist.
Patients in the experimental arm also receive a brochure about the DMARDs they currently use (see: control arm)</description>

    <description>Session 1: Group discussion about the personal barriers for medication adherence. Supervisor: Pharmacist. Duration: 90 minutes. Goal: After this session the patient is aware of the benefits and barriers of adherence. The individual barriers to adherence (concerns and practical problems) and necessity beliefs about medication are identified and discussed.
Session 2: Group based education on benefits of medication and discussing personal concerns about medication, practical barriers and beliefs about the necessity of medication. Supervisor: Pharmacist and rheumatologist. Duration: 90 minutes. Goal: Improving realistic beliefs about medication, stimulating an equal relationship between patient and health professional and motivating patients to be adherent.</description>
