  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the presentation of various foods produces
      an increase or decrease in responses on a motivational computer task. In addition, the study
      determines if energy intake or motivation to obtain food is related to the dopamine receptor
      genotype.

      One of the most important research areas in obesity is developing a better understanding of
      individual differences in factors that influence excess energy intake and positive energy
      balance. One key to understanding these individual differences is determining what factors
      underlie the motivation to eat. We have demonstrated in a series of studies that obese adults
      and children are more motivated to work for palatable, favorite foods than leaner peers and
      that those high in food reinforcement consume more food in an ad libitum eating task than
      those who do not find food as reinforcing. Dopamine (DA) is one of the major
      neurotransmitters involved in establishing the reinforcing value of food, and low levels of
      dopamine activity and a reduction in the number of DA receptors is associated with obesity.
      The general aim of the proposed research is to build upon this research to examine
      relationships between food reinforcement, obesity, and polymorphisms of genes within the
      dopaminergic system.
