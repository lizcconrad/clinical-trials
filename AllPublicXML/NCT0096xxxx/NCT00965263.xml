      Clinical data demonstrate that a cocaine vaccine (TA-CD: Celtic Pharmaceutical) produces
      selective anti-cocaine antibodies, yet the impact of these antibodies on cocaine's direct
      effects is unknown. The objective of this human laboratory study was to measure the
      relationship between antibody titers and the effects of smoked cocaine on ratings of
      intoxication, craving and cardiovascular effects.

      Cocaine-dependent volunteers not seeking drug treatment spend 2 nights per week for 13 weeks
      inpatient where the effects of cocaine (0, 25, 50 mg) are determined prior to vaccination and
      at weekly intervals thereafter. Vaccinations occur at weeks 1, 3, 5 and 9.

          <description>Plasma cocaine levels in Week 3 and Week 13 as a function of cocaine dose in High and Low AB groups. Participants (n=10) were evenly divided into High Antibody (AB) and Low Antibody (AB) groups based on their peak antibody levels at Week 13. Higher numbers indicate higher plasma levels of cocaine.</description>
          <population>Peak plasma antibody levels were highly variable. Thus, participants (n=10) were evenly divided into High Antibody (AB) and Low Antibody (AB) groups for analysis, based on their peak antibody levels at Week 13, rather than by the dose of vaccine received.</population>
