    <textblock>
      This study is about the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment on dry eye syndrome. Study
      hypothesis is that a standardized acupuncture would be more effective than a sham acupuncture
      in dry eye syndrome patients. This is a randomized, patients-assessor blinded, sham
      acupuncture controlled study. Additionally, the investigators will assess the safety of
      acupuncture treatment.

    <time_frame>Visit 11 (after 3 weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The OSDI is a questionnaire that consists of 12 questions about ocular irritation and the effect of dry eye on vision. For every question, participants checked at a score between 0 and 4, where 0 equals &quot;none of the time&quot; and 4 equals &quot;all of the time&quot;. OSDI scores will be calculated according to the following formula: OSDI = [(sum of scores for all questions answered)*100] / [(total number of questions answered)*4]. The possible range of the OSDI score is 0 to 100. Mean difference of the OSDI scores was calculated from the OSDI scores between Visit 11 and baseline.</description>

        <title>Ocular Surface Disease Index : OSDI</title>
        <description>The OSDI is a questionnaire that consists of 12 questions about ocular irritation and the effect of dry eye on vision. For every question, participants checked at a score between 0 and 4, where 0 equals “none of the time” and 4 equals “all of the time”. OSDI scores will be calculated according to the following formula: OSDI = [(sum of scores for all questions answered)*100] / [(total number of questions answered)*4]. The possible range of the OSDI score is 0 to 100. Mean difference of the OSDI scores was calculated from the OSDI scores between Visit 11 and baseline.</description>
        <time_frame>Visit 11 (after 3 weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
        <population>Statistical analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis (ITT analysis, significance p&lt;0.05). According to the last observation carried forward method (LOCF method), the last observed missing values were used to complete missing values from drop-out participants.</population>

            <title>Standardized Acupuncture Group</title>
            <description>Acupuncture treatement was conducted by licensed oriental medicine doctore. total nine acupuncture treatment sessions (three times per week for three weeks)were offered in treatment group. According to Korean traditional theory, 17 acupuncture points were selected for acupuncture (GV23; bilateral BL2, GB14, TE23, Ex1, ST1 and GB20; and unilateral SP3, LU9, LU10 and HT8, on the left for men and right for women), and acupunctures were retained for 20 minutes after “de qi” manipulation for the verum acupuncture group.</description>

            <description>17 sham points were selected and acupunctures were also retained for 20 minutes after shallow penetration of the skin without any other manipulation for total 9 sessions. The sham points were as follows: both points 2 cm lateral to ST4, 2 cm below ST7, at the parietal eminence of the head, 2 cm internal to ST9, 10 cm internal to BL57, 1.5 cm internal to ST36, single points at the left middle point of the biceps brachii muscle belly, points at 2 cm, 4 cm and 6 cm from the Lt. wrist fold, and one point located between the Lt. 3rd and 4th metatarsophalangeal joints.</description>
