  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore how knowing genes that individuals inherit from their
      parents can make warfarin dosing more safe and effective. This study is being done to
      determine whether providing doctors with data on the genes their patients inherited and
      warfarin dosing recommendations based on those genes affects the costs and outcomes of care
      and after hospitalization for patients from different ethnic/racial backgrounds, and how
      physicians use this information in decision making.

      The overall goal of this project is to develop and assess the effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of strategies that use genetic testing in the management of
      anticoagulation among racially diverse hospitalized patients. The project has four specific
      aims.

      Aim 1: To contribute patients initiating therapy at the University of Chicago Medical Center
      (UCMC) and affiliated hospitals to a genetic registry of a racially diverse set of patients
      undergoing warfarin therapy.

      Aim 2: To perform a randomized trial to determine the efficacy, costs and cost-effectiveness
      of existing pharmacogenetic algorithms for the management of warfarin therapy among
      hospitalized patients of all races.

      Aim 3: To develop clinical pharmacogenetic algorithms for the management of warfarin therapy
      among hospitalized African American patients.

      Aim 4: To perform a randomized trial to determine and compare the efficacy, costs and
      cost-effectiveness of existing clinical and non-racially tailored pharmacogenetic algorithms
      to racially tailored pharmacogenetic algorithms for the management of warfarin therapy among
      hospitalized African American patients.
