      The purpose of the current study is to analyze and compare the lower-limb joint motions and
      muscle activation patterns during activities of daily living as well as self reported health
      related functional outcomes for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee undergoing one of
      two types of knee replacements: the Evolution Medial Pivot knee (Wright Medical) or the
      Triathlon Posterior Stabilized (PS) knee (Stryker Orthopaedics).

      Inclusion:

      40 patients between the ages of 50 and 75 yrs undergoing unilateral total knee replacement
      for non-inflammatory degenerative osteoarthritis will participate, as well as 10 control
      participants will be recruited from the general population for the present study matching to
      experimental groups for age, gender and BMI.

      Patients who do not meet any exclusion criteria.

      Exclusion:

      Potential participants for the control group will be asked if they have had degenerative
      osteoarthritis of lower-limb joints (hip, knee and ankle) and if they have they will be
      excluded.

      Exclusion for patient group

        1. Patients suffering from any other lower-limb joint disorders other than the one for
           which total knee arthroplasty.

        2. Patients with any other joint replacement in the ipsilateral and contralateral limb.

        3. Patients with evidence of active infection.

        4. Patients with neurologic or musculoskeletal disease that may adversely affect gait,
           weight-bearing or quadriceps function.

        5. Patients with neuropathic joints.

        6. Patients requiring structural bone grafts.

        7. Patients with a documented allergy to cobalt chromium molybdenum.

        8. Patient with a BMI larger than 30 kg/m2.
