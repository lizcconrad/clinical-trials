  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the ability of oral montelukast/loratadine to improve the signs and
      symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis compared with loratadine alone, montelukast alone and
      placebo.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Daytime Nasal Symptoms Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline in Daytime Nasal Symptoms score. Patients were asked to rate each of the 4 nasal symptoms of Congestion, Rhinorrhea, Itching, and Sneezing daily on a 4-point scale (0 (best) to 3 (worst)). The average of the 4 individual nasal symptoms scores was reported as the Daytime Nasal Symptoms Score.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Nighttime Symptoms Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline in Nighttime Symptoms Score. Patients were asked to rate each symptom daily on a 4-point scale (0 (best) to 3 (worst)), and the combined score of Nasal Congestion Upon Awakening, Difficulty Going to Sleep, and Nighttime Awakenings was reported as the Nighttime Symptoms Score.</description>

    <measure>Patient's Global Evaluation of Allergic Rhinitis</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>An evaluation by the patient, administered at the last visit (or upon discontinuation) using a 7-point scale, of the change in symptoms as compared to the beginning of the study.

    <description>Patients completed a Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality-of-Life Questionnaire, 28 questions on a 7-point scale [0(best) to 6(worst)] across 7 domains: activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, emotional. Scores per domain were averaged, then scores for the 7 domains were averaged for an overall score.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality-of-Life Score</title>
        <description>Patients completed a Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality-of-Life Questionnaire, 28 questions on a 7-point scale [0(best) to 6(worst)] across 7 domains: activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, emotional. Scores per domain were averaged, then scores for the 7 domains were averaged for an overall score.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 2</time_frame>
        <population>The primary efficacy analyses were based on the intention-to-treat (all-patients-treated) principle, i.e., all patients who had a baseline and at least one posttreatment measurement were included. No missing values were imputed.</population>
