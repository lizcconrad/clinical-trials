      This study consists in the the design, implementation, and evaluation of the first web-based
      computer tailored intervention program aimed at the prevention of binge drinking in Spanish
      adolescents (Alerta Alcohol). A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial is conducted to test the
      effectiveness of Alerta Alcohol in students aged 16 to 18 years across 16 high schools from
      Andalusia (southern Spain), which are randomized either to the experimental or the control
      condition (EC and CC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Binge-drinking in adolescents is a highly prevalent healthcare problem that associates
      physical and mental health complications and community implications.

      The &quot;Alerta Alcohol&quot; program is based on the I-Change Model. Focus and Delphi groups are used
      to obtain further information on items included in the program. A pilot study is conducted to
      identify strengths and weaknesses. A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial is carried out. The
      schools from Andalusia are randomized either to the experimental or the control condition (EC
      and CC). The EC receives the Alerta Alcohol intervention, which consists of four sessions at
      school: baseline questionnaire and two sessions where adolescents are provided with answers
      related to their views to provide highly specific feedback regarding their knowledge, risk
      perception, self-esteem, attitude, social influence, and self-efficacy. In addition, two
      booster sessions are given at home to reinforce the contents. The CC just completes the
      baseline and the evaluation questionnaires and then they are allowed to receive the
      intervention as well (as a waiting list control condition). Evaluation takes place after four
      months. The primary endpoint is binge drinking within 30 days prior to evaluation and alcohol
      use in the previous week. It is expected that Alerta Alcohol reduces the prevalence of binge
      drinking by 10%. Follow up analyses are carried out to determine the differences in
      effectiveness according to the compliance of the program (quality of the implementation).

    <description>Intervention Group: The Experimental Group receives the Alerta Alcohol intervention, which consists of four sessions at school (baseline questionnaire, two sessions in three scenarios: at home, celebrations, and public places, and a final evaluation). The adolescents are provided with answers related to their views of each scenario; this information is used to provide highly specific feedback regarding their knowledge, risk perception, self-esteem, attitude, social influence (modelling, norms and social pressure), self-efficacy and action plans. In addition, two booster sessions are given at home to reinforce the contents of the three scenarios. Evaluation takes place after four months.</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of preventive messages about the benefits of not consuming alcohol, reducing the positive attitudes and encouraging the negative attitudes towards alcohol drinking and binge drinking, as well as social influence and self-efficacy, by personalized feedback. Skills and action plans are encouraged to help the student to reject binge drinking. This information is presented through different tailored messages. Moreover, four avatars (two males and two females), which can be chosen as part of the story development. This story consists of a short story about the alcohol consumption by adolescents.The stories take place in three different scenarios (at home, at celebrations and in public places).</description>
