  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective is to evaluate the impact of a basic training programme in motivational
      interviewing (MI) for medical students, by comparing the ability of students to promote
      behavioural changes through relationship skills and to conduct a motivational interview
      before and after training.

      Design: A pilot pre-post study in 20 students by comparing students' performance before and
      after MI training session.

      Setting: Bicêtre Hospital, Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de Paris, France.

      Interventions: Students received three four-hour sessions of a basic MI training over a one
      week period. The students interviewed for 15 minutes a caregiver playing the role of a
      patient, six weeks before and three weeks after the training.

      Main outcome measures: Global scores by two independent raters who used the Motivational
      Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) 3.1.1 code, perception of student's empathy by the
      caregivers (CARE questionnaire), self-efficacy of students to engage in a patient-centred
      relationship (SEPCQ score), and student's satisfaction with the odds of achieving the target
      goal.

    <description>The students received three four-hour sessions of basic motivationnal interviewing training :
Viewing and commenting on video clips illustrating motivational and non-motivational doctor-patient interactions.
Lectures and the distribution of memory aids.
Practical exercises: making &quot;reflections&quot;, asking open questions; exploring ambivalence; dealing with resistance; expressing empathy, summarising.
Role-playing, based on several situations, each involving two students. The investigators deliberately chose a non-medical situation (conflict between a mother and a student asking her for pocket money to go out for fun, the day before a university examination) for the first situation. All the other situations concerned changes to healthier behaviour in a medical setting, but with a goal different from that used for the first or the second simulated interview before motivationnal interviewing training.</description>
