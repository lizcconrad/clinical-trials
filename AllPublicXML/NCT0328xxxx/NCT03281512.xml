  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) intake in the development of total death,
      cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and overweight are in great controversy but
      evidence from large population in China is scant.The investigators aim to use the data from
      the China Health and Nutrition Survey to assess the long-term association of SFAs intake with
      total mortality, diabetes, hypertension and overweight.

      The role of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) intake in the development of total death, diabetes,
      hypertension and overweight are in great controversy but evidence from large population in
      China is lacking.The investigators aim to utilize the data from the China Health and
      Nutrition Survey. The investigators will calculate the cumulative average intake of SFAs
      based on 3 consecutive 24-h dietary recalls in each round.Sex-specific Cox regression models
      will be used to estimate the relative risk.Results from our work will be used to provide
      epidemiological evidence for improving recommendation on SFAs intake for Chinese in dietary
      guidelines.

        CHNS is an ongoing, large-scale, household-based cohort starting in 1989. The survey used a
        multi-stage, random cluster process to draw a sample of 9 provinces and municipal cities,
        which take up about half of Chinese population.
