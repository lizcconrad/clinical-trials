  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to determine if Neo40, a nitric oxide generating lozenge,
      when consumed twice daily by subjects with HFpEF, will increase exercise tolerance, decrease
      symptoms and improve quality of life for patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is the most common principal diagnosis for hospital admission in patients
      over 65 years old. There are two types of HF, those with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)
      and those with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Approximately half of patients with the
      clinical syndrome of HF have preserved systolic function. HEpEF is becoming more prevalent
      with aging of the population and obesity. There are only two class I recommendations for the
      treatment of HFpEF, which are controlling blood pressure and the use of diuretics to relieve
      symptoms. Exercise training is another approach to improving symptoms, however it may be
      poorly tolerated.

      Nitrate supplement in the form of concentrated beetroot juice was recently shown to improve
      exercise tolerance in patients with HFpEF. (1) Beetroot juice contains high concentration of
      NO3. This is metabolized to NO2. It enters the blood stream, where it is further reduced to
      NO resulting in intense vasodlitation.

      Patients with diastolic dysfunction are often asymptomatic at rest but complain of dyspnea
      with exertion. Increase in heart rate with exercise causes reduced diastolic filling time and
      increases left sided filling pressure. Borloug, et al demonstrated this with right heart
      catheterization and supine exercise in patients with diastolic dysfunction. Infusion of NO2
      resulted in decreased filling pressures and increased cardiac output. (2)

      Neo40 is a new product made from concentrated beetroot juice in the form of a lozenge
      designed to dissolve on the tongue. NO3 supplement causes vasodilatation only in the setting
      of hypoxia and acidocis resulting in targeted vasodilatation.
