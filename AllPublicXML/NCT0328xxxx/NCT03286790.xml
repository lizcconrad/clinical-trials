  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present proposal, we hypothesize that specifically targeting pneumonia events with
      preventive interventions in the French EHPAD (Etablissements d'Hébergement pour Personnes
      Agées Dépendantes) setting (thus, improving the health status and quality of life of
      patients) may simultaneously produce relevant reductions in the healthcare costs. In fact,
      although the number of pneumonia cases may be numerically limited, the consequences of each
      event are potentially catastrophic for both the patient and the healthcare system.
      Unfortunately, to date, information about the incidence and economical effects of pneumonia
      in the older population living in the French EHPAD are extremely scare. To adequately
      evaluate whether there is room to implement preventive interventions aimed at reducing the
      onset of pneumonia in a cost-effective fashion on a large scale, preliminary data from this
      specific population are needed. This first step is crucial towards the appropriate design and
      conduction of possible future large-scale intervention trials in the EHPAD setting.
