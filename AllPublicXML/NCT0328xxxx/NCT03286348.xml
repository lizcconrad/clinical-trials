  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the effectiveness of close and intense monitoring on nutritional status of
      gastrointestinal cancer patients during chemoradiotherapy (CRT), 500 CRT patients diagnosed
      with gastrointestinal system are going to be recruited into this prospective study.
      Patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA) scale and nutrition risk screening
      (NRS-2002) are used for nutritional assessment at the beginning and the end of CRT; Beside
      the nutritional parameters, Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and gastric
      cancer module (QLQ-STO22) are used to measure quality of life in patients with gastric cancer
      while EORTC QLQ-C30 and Colorectal Cancer-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-CR38)
      give assessment in colorectal cancer. The acute and late radiation toxicities were evaluated
      based on Conmon terminology criteria (CTC V3.0) and the toxicity criteria of RTOG/EORTC,
      respectively. Follow-ups every 3-6 months until three years after chemoradiotherapy are
      involved. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines are used for
      response assessment. The primary endpoints are 3-year local control, disease-free survival,
      distant metastasis and overall survival rate.
