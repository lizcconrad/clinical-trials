    <textblock>
      Pregnant participants will be recruited at the obstetrics outpatient clinic during their
      visits 4 weeks before the due date. They are randomized into two groups. The first group will
      be educated to do digital perineal massage. They will be also educated to do pelvic floor
      muscle exercises and will receive the usual education program for strengthening the pelvic
      floor. The second group will receive the usual education program for strengthening the pelvic
      floor. Occurrence of perineal laceration will be reported at time of delivery.
