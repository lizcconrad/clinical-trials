  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal seeks to build upon studies, including ours, on the favorable effects of
      California strawberries on vascular health. Freeze dried strawberry powder (FDSP) contains a
      number of nutrients that may have beneficial effects on plasma lipids and vascular function,
      as well as on the composition of the gut microbiota; changes in the gut microbiota can in
      turn have secondary positive effects on the vascular system as well as on other physiological
      functions that are important determinants of health and disease. The proposed project will
      seek to determine the influence of short-term FDSP intake on the gut microbiota composition,
      and select microbial-derived metabolites from stool, serum and urine, and their relationship
      to microvascular function. Secondary outcomes will include the influence of the FDSP on
      circulating levels of nitrate and nitrite and trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) as markers of
      vascular health that are influenced by both dietary intake and the oral and gut microflora,
      with blood pressure as an additional vascular outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, controlled crossover design will compare the short-term (two and
      four week) response to FDSP intake compared to an isocaloric control powder in overweight and
      obese adults. Twenty overweight or obese male or postmenopausal females (40-65 years of age)
      will be randomized to consume 39 g of FDSP or a control powder for four weeks in a crossover
      design with a four week washout period. Changes in stool microbial communities and microbial
      metabolites will be assessed, and examined for their potential influence on microvascular
      function.
