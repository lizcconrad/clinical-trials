  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 150,000 babies became infected with HIV in 2015 alone. When HIV drugs are started
      before or early in pregnancy, HIV positive women can give birth to HIV negative baby. This is
      possible because HIV drugs can reduce the amount of the virus in the body to the extent that
      they become undetectable by the time of delivery and during the breastfeeding period.
      However, some women do not start taking these drugs on time because they become infected
      during pregnancy or lactation. This leads to detectable virus at the time of delivery and
      puts the baby at risk of becoming infected. Also, the amounts of HIV drugs in the body have
      to be at certain levels for them to work effectively. But findings from some research have
      recently showed that pregnancy increases the rate at which the body removes some HIV drugs
      used to prevent the transfer of HIV from mother to child. While this may not cause any
      problem in women with no detectable virus before pregnancy, it may affect the rate at which
      the HIV virus is removed from the body in those starting treatment late and may put the baby
      at risk. This project will investigate whether the changes in drug exposure caused by
      pregnancy or other factors have any effect on the rate at which the HIV virus is removed from
      the body. HIV positive pregnant women and those who recently delivered will be recruited from
      different hospitals and follow up will be until breastfeeding ends. The investigators will
      not be involved in treatment decisions and the primary care provider will be responsible for
      prescribing antiretroviral regimen based on current guidelines. Samples will be collected to
      measure levels of the virus and the drugs in three fluids that transfer the virus to the
      baby: blood, genital fluid, and breastmilk. The HIV status of the babies will be monitored
      until they stop breastfeeding.

        This is cohort study of HIV positive pregnant or recently postpartum women receiving WHO
        recommended first-line ART regimen. Pregnant women and nursing mothers initiating ART &lt; 4
        months before delivery (n = 45) and &lt; 6 weeks postpartum (n = 45), respectively, and a
        comparison group of pregnant women who initiated ART ≥ 4 months before delivery (n = 90)
        will be recruited from four hospitals providing PMTCT services in Nigeria.
