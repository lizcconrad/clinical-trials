    <textblock>
      The investigators' central hypotheses predict that the handheld spirometry device will be
      feasible for inpatient and at-home use, and is equally efficacious at determining lung
      function when compared to traditional, bedside spirometry measurements. To test these
      hypotheses, the investigators propose the following specific aims:

      Specific Aim 1: Determine the correlation of SpiroPD handheld spirometry measurements with
      bedside Koko spirometry lung function.

      Hypothesis: Correlation between the two lung function tests will be substantial for both
      hospitalized and ambulatory patients.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the feasibility, adherence, and preliminary management efficacy
      of home SpiroPD testing.

      Hypotheses: (1) Patients will demonstrate substantial adherence to daily home spirometry
      testing; (2) medication adherence will increase significantly in patients who are adherent to
      daily home spirometry testing; (3) acute care utilization will decrease significant in
      adherent patients.

    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) results in nearly 750,000 hospitalizations
      annually and is the third leading cause of &quot;early&quot; (within 30-day) hospital readmissions in
      the United States. Curbing preventable early readmissions for acute exacerbations of COPD
      (AECOPD) has become a national priority, as demonstrated by the Medicare Hospital
      Readmissions Reduction financial penalty program. One critical barrier in assessing
      readmission risk is the lack of an easily-measured 'vital sign' for COPD: accurate, timely
      measurements of lung function. Unlike other medical problems that have validated,
      easily-obtained measurements of organ function, COPD evaluation often defaults to patient
      report and physician evaluation without critical physiologic data. This lack of objective
      pulmonary function data during AECOPD in turn leads to critical errors in disease severity
      assessment. However, the required, repeated measurements by spirometry that can demonstrate
      responses to therapy can be time-consuming and expensive to perform in a laboratory, and both
      equipment and staffing infrastructure for bedside testing is cumbersome and often not
      prioritized. For these reasons, spirometry frequently is not done for patients with AECOPD.

      To monitor patient responses to therapy and to assess risks based on objective measures, the
      investigators propose to the study the use of a portable, patient-driven device (&quot;SpiroPD&quot;)
      that can be used in both in-patient and outpatient settings, and that reports (via the
      internet) values collected in real time. While the device has been used in the lung
      transplant community and for patients with cystic fibrosis, no studies have been done to
      validate its use in COPD. This protocol involves in-hospital patient training with the device
      followed by serial measurements at home in the first 30 days post hospital-discharge.

      Demonstration in a pilot, single-center trial of the usefulness of real-time, repeated
      hand-held spirometry to provide objective measurements of lung function in AECOPD will have a
      substantial impact on both patient health outcomes and on health care utilization and will
      set the stage for appropriate next-step studies and NIH grant applications. It is unknown
      whether this specific technology will be acceptable in the target population, though previous
      research suggests that older patients may be more willing to use home monitoring technology.
      This multi-disciplinary research team includes providers from the Department of Medicine and
      the UCM COPD Readmissions Program team.

    <time_frame>30 days from patient enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will use the handheld spirometry device every day for 30 days. After use, the device will store spirometry measurements for each patient each day and the data will be synced over wifi to each individual's associated online account. Daily measurements from the SpiroPD device will be collected over the course of 30 days. These measurements will then be compared against spirometry measurements collected using the bedside KoKo machine during baseline and 30-day follow-up visits.</description>

    <measure>Adherence to using the SpiroPD device at home on a daily basis</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days from patient enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Daily use of the SpiroPD will be measured by way of captured spirometry measurements. IF there is no recorded spirometry measurement in the SpiroPD device for certain days, those days will be considered when discussing non-adherence to daily use of the SpiroPD.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of Patients to use the SpiroPD device at home consistently</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days from patient enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility, or ease of use, will be measured by tracking the number of inquiries received on the designated SpiroPD help line. Each inquiry will be measured and tracked using an inquiry intake form. The type of inquiry or issue the patient is having and the possible solutions to the issue will be recorded. The patient's study ID and the date and time of their call will be recorded. These metrics along with adherence measurements will be factored in when discussing the feasibility of the SpiroPD device.</description>
