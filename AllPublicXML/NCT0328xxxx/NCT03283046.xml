      This study has 2 parts: a Dose Escalation Part and a Dose Expansion Part.

      The goal of the Dose Escalation Part of this clinical research study is to find the highest
      tolerable dose of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and the standard of care
      (lenalidomide and dexamethasone) that can be given to patients with multiple myeloma (MM).

      The goal of the Dose Expansion Part of this clinical research study is to continue to study
      the safety of the highest tolerable dose found in Phase 1 of the study.

      Study Groups:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be
      assigned to a study group based on when participant joins this study. Up to 2 groups of up to
      6 participants each will be enrolled in the Dose Escalation Part of the study, and up to 24
      participants will be enrolled in the Dose Expansion Part.

      If participant is enrolled in the Dose Escalation Part, the dose of nivolumab participant
      receives will depend on when participant joins this study. The first group of participants
      will receive the lowest dose level of nivolumab. A second group will then receive a higher
      dose of nivolumab than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.

      If participant is enrolled in the Dose Expansion Part, participant will receive nivolumab at
      the highest dose that was tolerated in the Dose Escalation Part.

      All participants will receive the same dose levels of ipilimumab, dexamethasone, and
      lenalidomide.

      Study Drug Administration:

      The first 4 study cycles will be 21 days long, and all remaining cycles will be 28 days long.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-4, participant will receive nivolumab by vein over 60 minutes. Thirty
      (30) minutes after participant receives nivolumab, participant will receive ipilimumab by
      vein over 90 minutes. On Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 5 and beyond, participant will receive
      nivolumab by vein over 60 minutes.

      Participant will take tablets of lenalidomide on Days 1-14 of Cycles 1-4 and on Days 1-21 of
      Cycles 5 and beyond. Participant will take tablets of dexamethasone on Days 1, 8, and 15 of
      Cycles 1-4, and on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycles 5 and beyond.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1- 4 (+/- 7 days):

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, biomarker testing, and to
           check the status of the disease. If participant can become pregnant, this routine
           testing will also include a pregnancy test.

        -  Urine will be collected over 24 hours for routine tests and to check the status of the
           disease.

        -  During Cycle 3 only, participant will have 2 bone marrow biopsies/aspirations to check
           the status of the disease and for biomarker testing, including genetic biomarkers.

        -  During Cycle 3 only, urine will be collected for biomarker testing.

      At the end of Cycle 4, participant will have an ECHO and pulmonary function test to check the
      status of participant's lungs and heart.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 5 and beyond:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check
           the status of the disease. If participant can become pregnant, this routine testing will
           also include a pregnancy test.

        -  Urine will be collected over 24 hours for routine tests and to check the status of the
           disease.

        -  Some participants will have a stem cell transplant after Cycle 4. If participant does
           not have a stem cell transplant, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for tests of
           the immune system every cycle. If participant does have a stem cell transplant, this
           will only be done every 3 cycles.

        -  If participant does not have a stem cell transplant, on Day 1 of Cycles 5 and every 3
           cycles after that, urine will be collected for biomarker testing.

      On Day 15 of Cycles 5 and beyond, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      If at any point participant does have a stem cell transplant, participant will have 2 bone
      marrow biopsies or aspirations to check the status of the disease and for biomarker testing
      after the transplant.

      End-of-Treatment Visits:

      When participant stops taking the study drug:

        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests, to check
           the status of the disease, and to learn how the study drugs work in participant's body.
           If participant can become pregnant, part of this blood will be used for a pregnancy
           test.

        -  Participant will have 2 bone marrow biopsies/aspirations to check the status of the
           disease and for biomarker testing, including genetic biomarkers.

      If at any point the disease gets worse:

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check
           the status of the disease.

        -  Urine will be collected over 24 hours for routine tests and to check the status of the
           disease.

        -  Participant will have a bone survey to check the status of the disease.

        -  Participant will have a bone marrow biopsy or aspiration to check the status of the
           disease and for biomarker testing, including genetic biomarkers.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for genetic testing to learn if there is a
           relationship between participant's genes and the disease

      Follow-Up:

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant may have the following tests. The schedule for
      these tests will depend on what participant's doctor thinks is in participant's best
      interest.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check
           the status of the disease. If participant can become pregnant, this routine testing will
           also include a pregnancy test.

        -  Urine will be collected over 24 hours for routine tests and to check the status of the
           disease.

        -  Participant will have bone marrow biopsies or aspirations to check the status of the
           disease and for biomarker testing, including genetic biomarkers.

        -  Participant will have a bone survey to check the status of the disease.

      This is an investigational study. Nivolumab and ipilimumab are FDA approved for the treatment
      of certain types of melanoma. Their use in patients with MM is investigational. Lenalidomide
      in combination with dexamethasone is FDA approved for the treatment for multiple myeloma. The
      study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 36 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

             days plus the time required for nivolumab/ipilimumab to undergo five half-lives) after
             the last dose of investigational drug. Women of childbearing potential must have a
             negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent
             units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of nivolumab/ipilimumab. Additionally
             WOCBP must use adequate methods of contraception for the duration of the study
             consistent with the standard requirements for lenalidomide.

         10. WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone
             surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not

             failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men receiving nivolumab/ipilimumab and who are
             sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period
             of 31 weeks after the last dose of investigational product. Women who are not of
             childbearing potential (i.e. who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as
             azoospermic men do not require contraception)

         12. Patients must be newly diagnosed and must not have received prior treatment directed
             to multiple myeloma.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have known central nervous system involvement with multiple myeloma will
             be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they
             often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of
             neurologic and other adverse events.

          2. Patients with a known history of allergic reactions attributed to any compounds of
             similar chemical or biologic composition to be used on this study.

          3. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection requiring intravenous antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements, in the opinion of the Principal
             Investigator.

          4. Pregnant or lactating women.

          5. Patients with known active hepatitis A, B, and/or C infection are excluded. This is
             due to the difficulty that would be faced in assessing the attribution of any events
             of hepatic toxicity while on therapy.

          6. Ongoing graft-versus-host (GVHD) due to prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
             transplantation. Patients with prior history of acute GVHD or extensive chronic GVHD
             requiring a minimum of 6 months or longer treatment since allogeneic hematopoietic
             stem cell transplantation are also excluded.

          7. Patients should be excluded if they have an active, known or suspected autoimmune
             disease. Subjects are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes
             mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone
             replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to
             recur in the absence of an external trigger.

          8. Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents
             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Additionally, patients will
             be excluded if they have required therapy for control of GVHD within 4 weeks of study
             treatment.

          9. Patients should be excluded if they have had prior systemic treatment with an
             anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug
