  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies how well circuit, interval-based aerobic and
      resistance exercise works in targeting metabolic dysregulation in stage I-III breast or
      prostate cancer survivors. Circuit, interval-based aerobic and resistance exercise may help
      to improve cardiovascular fitness, weight loss, healthy lifestyle behaviors, and muscle
      strength in breast or prostate cancer survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of a 4-month circuit, interval-based aerobic and resistance
      exercise (CARE) intervention on metabolic dysregulation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of a 4-month CARE intervention on sarcopenic obesity.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of a 4-month CARE intervention on skeletal muscle strength,
      physical fitness, and quality of life (QOL).

      II. To determine the effects of a 4-month CARE intervention on vascular function.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      Arm I: Patients undergo supervised exercise sessions comprised of CARE over 50 minutes 3 days
      weekly for 16 weeks. Patients receive a Polar heart rate monitor to monitor heart rate during
      the CARE sessions.

      Arm II: Patients undergo a standard stretching program 3 days weekly for 16 weeks. After 16
      weeks, patients may undergo supervised exercise sessions comprised of CARE as in Arm I.

      After completion of study, patients undergoing CARE are followed up for 4 months.
