  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is a consequence of the research chair project studying the same phenomenon in
      adult volleyball players. The project will make use of and be part of the routine medical
      screening that is taken by the young players of the first degree of the Leuven Volleyball
      School, Belgium. All young players must undergo a routine medical investigation and movement
      screening. This is obliged by the law. The current project will use these data. Outcome
      parameters will be used to advice the trainer staff of the school to adjust their training
      interventions. This is normal routine too as the involved medical department has been
      advising the school for many years. Players will be followed up for 6 weeks. After those 6
      weeks, the movement screening will be repeated to evaluate the change in the different
      outcome parameters. This last screening is not part of a normal routine as players normally
      are investigated more in a subjective way. The medical team and school want to change that
      routine.

      Data will be used to further improve training modalities and sports performance and reduce
      injury risk in these young athletes.

    <description>Based on the baseline screening, which is part of the normal prevention routine within the school, all athletes are given individual advice with regard to points of attention within training. For example: those athletes with reduced balance, will get more balance training.
Intervention is individual as said and will be guided and supervised by the physical trainer and medical staff of the school.</description>
