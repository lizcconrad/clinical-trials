  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate early-phase interventions for refugee wellness
      promotion and build evidence for dissemination of the intervention model and curricula
      through refugee resettlement programs, local and national.

      This study will examine the main effects of trauma-informed case management (TICM) and
      trauma-informed cultural orientation (TICO) interventions, respectively, in reducing
      resettlement distress and increasing coping capacity, which will improve emotional wellness
      and social adaptation and thus resettlement outcomes. This project will also test the
      interaction effects of two-tiered intervention model, discerning effective and ineffective
      components of the intervention model. Differences in effects across intervention conditions
      may inform how improvement in what outcomes or which phase can affect refugees' wellness and
      adjustment over time.

    <description>The TICM will be designed to include the seven domains of trauma-informed care articulated by SAMHSA (2014): 1) early screening and comprehensive assessment; 2) consumer driven care and services; 3) trauma-informed, responsive and educated workforce; 4) emerging and evidence-informed best practices; 5) safe and secure environments; 6) trauma-informed community partnerships; and 7) a performance monitoring system. The trained agency case managers and staff will provide the TICM to 50 newly resettled refugees during their regular R&amp;P service period (i.e., 60 days).</description>

    <description>The community-based TICO will be based on the Im's CHW that comprises 8 sessions (2 hour per session), co-facilitated by trained refugee peer mentors and community service providers. The TICO sessions will include interactive sessions on healthy eating, healthy body and healthy mind, acculturation &amp; resettlement stress, understanding trauma and stress, healthy coping, helping others, and community building.</description>
