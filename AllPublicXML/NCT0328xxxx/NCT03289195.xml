  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the ability of a breast MRI biopsy to accurately
      diagnose a complete tumor response to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) that the patient
      just finished. Numerous studies have shown that MRI has the highest accuracy for diagnosing a
      complete tumor response. The investigator wants to see if in a certain group of women who's
      breast cancer is no longer visible on the post-treatment MRI that the biopsy specimens from a
      MRI guided biopsy will accurately diagnose a complete tumor response to treatment which may
      in the future make breast surgery unnecessary in some women.

    <description>In this context NPV is defined as the number of true negatives (biopsy negative, i.e., no disease found on the percutaneous biopsy and pCR) divided by the number of all biopsy negatives. While NPV is of primary interest we will also estimate positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity of the biopsy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women age 18 years or older

          -  Confirmed histologic diagnosis of operable HER2 overexpressing (ER&lt;10%, PR&lt;10%, and
             HER2 2+ or FISH amplified) OR triple negative (ER&lt;10%, PR&lt;10%, and HER2 0/1+ or
             2+/FISH not amplified) OR ER positive invasive ductal breast cancer, including MSKCC
             pathology confirmation

          -  Operable breast cancer treated with NAC undergoing either breast conservation or total
             Mastectomy who have had a post-NAC clinical bilateral breast MRI demonstrating a
             complete imaging response, which is defined as no residual tumor enhancement.

          -  No indication of distant metastases (M0)

          -  Tumor site amenable to MRI guided biopsy as determined by the radiologist

          -  Definitive surgery being performed at MSKCC within within 0-60 days of completing NAC

          -  ECOG performance status score of 0 to â‰¤ 2

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must not be pregnant.

          -  Women must not be breastfeeding

          -  Willing and able to provide informed consent and adhere to the study visit schedule
             and plan as specified in this protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical history and concurrent disease:

               -  Prior history of treated breast cancer

               -  Any underlying medical or psychiatric conditions, which in the opinion of the
                  investigator, will make performing the study intervention hazardous or obscure
                  the interpretation of the results

          -  Prohibited Treatments and/or Therapies:

               -  Prior history of breast cancer surgery and/or radiotherapy.
