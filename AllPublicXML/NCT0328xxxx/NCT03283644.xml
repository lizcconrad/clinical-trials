      This study investigates the chronic long-term health condition of obesity and its effect on
      neutrophil function and the inflammatory response

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation is a central component of the immune response. In its acute form it aids the
      transition from disease to health via the activation of numerous immune cells, enabling them
      to reach the site of infection/injury and orchestrate themselves to combat pathogens,
      facilitating resolution and repair to restore the host to health. However, chronic
      inflammation is deleterious to the host and differs from the &quot;classical&quot; acute inflammatory
      process in that the inflammation is not necessarily so readily obvious and is not
      self-limiting; rather, the immune system is in a constant state of low-grade activation and
      when challenged by pathogenic or sterile injury the response is heightened, resulting in
      prolonged tissue damage and a failure of efficient resolution mechanisms.

      Neutrophils are important mediators of acquired innate immune responses but may also
      contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. Neutrophils are heavily
      involved in antimicrobial defence; their primary role is the localisation and elimination of
      pathogenic microorganisms. This, combined with their relatively short lifespan, has resulted
      in a traditional view of them as limited &quot;kamikaze&quot; cells. However, as detailed here,
      neutrophils have been shown to act with complexity and sophistication, orchestrating the
      immune/inflammatory response but also inadvertently contributing to tissue damage in
      different disease states. This study investigates the chronic long-term health condition of
      obesity and its effect on neutrophil function and the inflammatory response
