      The goal of this study is to get a better understanding of the skin condition, Hidradenitis
      Suppurativa, and to find out how the disease affects quality of life. Through internet groups
      and the American Academy of Dermatology, the investigators propose to enroll greater than 200
      enrollees in the first two years of this project. The investigatorswill utilize a compilation
      of validated questionnaires including the Beck Depression Inventory form, Dermatology Life
      Quality Index (DLQI), Skindex, SF-36 health survey, the Quality of Life Enjoyment and
      Satisfaction Questionnaire- short form (Q-LES-Q-SF) and the Employment/Productivity Health
      Economic Questionnaire as well as other relevant clinical data. The investigators will
      additionally collect a modified Hidradenitis Suppurativa Lesion, Area, and Severity Index
      (HS-LASI) (or other appropriate disease severity score as determined by the team) from the
      physician of each enrollee. The investigatorshope this information will help improve
      treatment for this skin condition.
