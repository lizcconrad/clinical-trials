    <textblock>
      Current guideline directed medical therapies (GDMT) for hypertension (HTN) endorse a trial
      and error approach based on drug class. This pilot study will evaluate the efficacy of a
      Clinical Decision Support (CDS) program to assist providers with delivering a more
      personalized approach using individual renin-aldosterone levels and the mechanism of action
      of medications included in GDMT recommendations. The overarching goal is to achieve HTN
      control rates above the 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey reported rate
      of 53% in a timely fashion, by individualizing medication management, thereby reducing the
      patient risk of stroke, heart and renal disease, and other devastating HTN-related outcomes.

      Current guideline directed medical therapies (GDMT) for hypertension (HTN) endorse a trial
      and error approach based on drug class. This pilot study will evaluate the efficacy of a
      Clinical Decision Support (CDS) program to assist providers with delivering a more
      personalized approach using individual renin-aldosterone levels and the mechanism of action
      of medications included in GDMT recommendations. Current research suggests underlying
      mechanisms of HTN can be categorized by renin and aldosterone levels into approximately 50
      categories and sub-categories. Timely identification of a patients' category is challenging
      for clinicians and possibly a contributing factor to the low rates of HTN control reported in
      the 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of 53%. The overarching
      goal of this study is to achieve HTN control rates above the 2014 NANES rate in a timely,
      cost-effective manner by individualizing medication management, thereby reducing the patient
      risk of stroke, heart and renal disease, and other devastating HTN-related outcomes. Specific
      aims are: 1) evaluate the efficacy of the CDS software program to assist providers in
      identifying and matching the underlying mechanisms of HTN with the mechanism of action of
      antihypertensive medications to achieve better HTN control rates than the 53% reported in the
      2014 NHANES data, 2) assess the efficacy of the CDS program across prescribing provider
      levels (MD/DO, residents, and APRN/PA), and 3) Determine the impact of the CDS program on: a)
      medication costs, b) provider management time, c), provider and patient satisfaction with and
      perception of usability and efficacy of the CDS program to manage their blood pressure. This
      2-phase, prospective, within-subjects, repeated measures pilot study will enroll up to 20
      multi-level providers with prescriptive authority and 160 military beneficiaries with
      uncontrolled HTN in the Northwest to evaluate the efficacy, feasibility, and usability of a
      CDS program to improve blood pressure control over a six-month period.
