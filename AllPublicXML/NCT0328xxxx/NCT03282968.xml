  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will include 20 patients after troke, randomly assigned to the experimental and
      control group (10 each). In both groups, the program with last for five days; walking and
      balance will be assessed before and after the program. Both groups will receive regular
      neurophysiotherapy; in addition, the experimental group will exercise each day by playing
      REWIRE games, while the control group will perform standing balance exercises.

      Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are specified in the appropriate section. Both
      groups will perform the additional exercises for 15 minutes daily. In addition to the outcome
      measurement, informal feedback will be obtained from the patients and the therapists on the
      feasibility of the REWIRE system.

    <description>First, the patient will play the Fruit Catcher (weight transfer) game on the 3rd level for 3 minutes, followed by 3 minutes of rest. Next, the patient will play the Horse Runner (squats) on the 3rd level for 3 minutes, followed by 3 minutes of rest. In the end, the patient will play the Animal Hurdler (standing on one leg) on the 3rd level for 3 minutes. During the games, the patient will be standing on the Wii Balance Board, holding to a firm support if necessary. During the rest periods, the patients will be sitting. A physiotherapist will be present throughout the exercise for safety and help if requested.</description>

    <description>The patient will first practice balance transfer for 3 minutes (standing by a ladder, holding position on each leg for 3 seconds), followed by 3 minutes of rest. Next, the patient will be performing squats for 3 minutes, followed by 3 minutes of rest. In the end, the patient will practice alternatively lifting lower limbs (like stepping on a footstool) for 3 minutes. During the rest periods, the patients will be sitting. A physiotherapist will be present throughout the exercise for safety and help if requested.</description>
