  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed amplicon sequencing and genotyping study is to assess vaccine
      efficacy against clinical and asymptomatic malaria infection using ultra-sensitive molecular
      amplification and sequencing methodology to detect Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum)
      parasites from serial blood samples to be collected from children immunized with the primary
      and yearly booster immunizations of the RTS,S/AS01E vaccine as part of their participation in
      Protocol MALARIA-094 (parent clinical study protocol). Genomic analysis will be performed on
      parasites from blood spot samples collected from children aged 5 17 months immunized with
      RTS,S/AS01E on different dosage and schedule regimens under the parent clinical study
      protocol.

      This genotyping study of malaria parasites collected from serial blood samples following
      RTS,S/AS01E immunization will assess vaccine efficacy using molecular genetic data to
      identify first infections following vaccination, and to distinguish new from existing
      infections, using an amplicon sequencing-based strategy: deep sequencing of small, highly
      variable regions of the parasite genome to allow for both:

        1. Highly sensitive detection of parasitemia (analogous to conventional polymerase chain
           reaction [PCR]-based detection), and

        2. Identification of genetically distinct parasite populations within or between affected
           individuals.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will
             comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g. return for follow-up visits).

          -  Signed or thumb-printed and witnessed informed consent obtained from the
             parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject prior to performance of any study specific procedure.
             Where parent(s)/LAR(s) are illiterate, the consent form will be countersigned by an
             independent witness.

          -  A male or female between, and including, five and 17 months of age at the time of the
             first vaccination.

          -  History of any, or documented, serious adverse reaction to rabies vaccination.

          -  Contraindication to rabies vaccination (Rabipur is contraindicated in subjects with an
             history of a severe hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in the vaccine. Note
             that the vaccine contains polygeline and residues of chicken proteins, and may contain
             traces of neomycin, chlortetracycline and amphotericin B).

          -  Major congenital defects.
