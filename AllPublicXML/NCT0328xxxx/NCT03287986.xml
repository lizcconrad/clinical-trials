    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to show MRI functional and structural differences between
      depressed elderly patients with a history of attempted suicide compared to depressed elderly
      patients with no history of attempted suicide and to elderly subjects with no personal
      history of depression or attempted suicide (healthy controls).
