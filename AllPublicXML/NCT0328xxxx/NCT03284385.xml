  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well adavosertib works in treating patients with
      SETD2-deficient solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body. Adavosertib may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) 1.1 criteria of adavosertib (AZD1775) in advanced solid tumor malignancies other
      than clear cell renal cell carcinoma with evidence of biallelic loss of SETD2 using
      next-generation sequencing panel.

      II. To determine the objective response rate by RECIST 1.1 criteria of AZD1775 in clear cell
      renal cell carcinoma with evidence of loss of SETD2 using next-generation sequencing panel.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical benefit rate and duration of response of AZD1775 in
      SETD2-deficient tumors other than clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

      II. To determine the clinical benefit rate and duration of response of AZD1775 in
      SETD2-deficient clear cell renal cell carcinoma subgroup.

      III. To characterize the safety profile of AZD1775. IV. To determine whether H3K36me3
      expression by immunohistochemical assay is associated with clinical outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive adavosertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and 8-12. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
