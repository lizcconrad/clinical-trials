      During an ISUOG basic training course, participants will be randomly assigned to 30 minutes
      of simulator training during which time they will practice the 2nd trimester US scan. A total
      of four different simulators are being used for training. After completing the practical
      basic training session, they shift the type of simulator that they trained on to one of the
      remaining three simulators. On this simulator, they are required to perform selected planes
      for the 2nd-trimester scan. The planes produced are recorded and evaluated by fetal medicine
      specialists using the ISUOG 20 planes checklist. The performances of participants coming from
      each of the four simulators are examined and the role of 1) type of simulator interaction
      (physical mannequin vs. virtual abdomen vs. fixed-point scan) and 2) the type of image
      acquisition (real US images vs. computer-generated images) are examined.
