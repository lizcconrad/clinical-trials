  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to estimate the efficacy of Penguin cold caps in preventing or
      reducing hair loss in patients receiving (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy (one of four common
      regimens) for early stage breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a phase II prospective, open label, non-randomized study conducted to determine
      the safety and efficacy of Penguin TM cold cap system in preventing or reducing
      chemotherapy-induced alopecia in patients with early stage breast cancer undergoing
      chemotherapy.

      Eligible subjects will be enrolled to one of 4 study arms (Table 5) determined by type of
      chemotherapy. Subjects will have early stage breast cancer of any receptor subtype, for which
      standard of care includes chemotherapy. Eligible subjects will be enrolled at Providence
      Portland Medical Center (PPMC) and Providence St. Vincent Medical Center (PSVMC).

      The PenguinTM cold cap therapy will be administered to all enrolled subjects according to the
      dosing schedule specified by the study arms. PenguinTM cold caps is a portable scalp cooling
      system which uses gel-filled cold caps that are cooled on dry ice and exchanged every 30
      minutes in order to maintain optimum temperature. Its unique crylon gel formula is
      specifically created to maintain cold temperatures for much longer periods of time than other
      conventional cooling gels and foams. No scalp preparation is required before use.

             of the subject.
