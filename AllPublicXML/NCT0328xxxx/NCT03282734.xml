  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A lot of patients suffer the balance and gait disorders after stroke. Many rehabilitation
      therapies have been provided to improve the balance and gait function in stroke patients.
      However, most rehabilitation therapies are performed in only hospitals, in spite of the
      difficulty of moving from home to hospitals for stroke patients. Home-based smart
      rehabilitation system (Uincare速, D-gate Co.) can provide the specific rehabilitation training
      program to stroke patients in their home. This study aims to investigate the effects of the
      home-based exercise program with smart rehabilitation system on balance and gait functions in
      stroke patients.

  <detailed_description>

      The total 100 patients with stroke will be divided into each the intervention group and the
      control group. The intervention group will be provided the home-based smart rehabilitation
      system for 4 weeks, and the control group will be educated the conventional home
      rehabilitation exercise at once. The immediate effects of the home-based smart rehabilitation
      system on the balance and gait function will be assessed at 4 weeks after exercise and the
      long-term carry-over effects will be also assesed at 4 weeks after cessation of exercise.
