      This multi-site study assesses the impact of text message reminders on the receipt of the
      second dose of influenza vaccine, and takes place in practices from the American Academy of
      Pediatrics (AAP) Pediatric Research in Office Settings (PROS) network.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is to be conducted over the 1st season (September 2017-April 2018) as an
      effectiveness trial and the 2nd (September 2018-April 2019) as a replication study. Each
      season is to be evaluated separately. This approach tests that the intervention effects can
      be replicated across seasons, during which the severity and incidence of influenza disease
      may vary. In the first season, 2017-2018, this study will include a sample of 1600 parents.
      Eligible parents will have a child who received his/her first vaccine dose and is in need of
      2 doses that season. Current recommendations require 2 doses for certain children 6 months
      through 8 years old. Within each practice site, parents will be randomized to receive either:
      1) text message reminders embedded with influenza vaccine health-literacy promoting
      information, or 2) usual care. Randomization is to be stratified by practice site, age (6-23
      months, 2-8 years) and language (Spanish, English).
