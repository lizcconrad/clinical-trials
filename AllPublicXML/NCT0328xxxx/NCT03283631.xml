  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant primary brain tumors account for more human deaths than melanoma or cancer of the
      bladder or kidney. The non-specific nature of conventional therapy for brain tumors often
      results in incapacitating damage to surrounding normal brain and systemic tissue. Thus, in
      order to reduce off-site effects and be more effective, therapeutic strategies will have to
      target tumor cells precisely while minimizing collateral damage to the neighboring cerebral
      cortex. The goal of this protocol is to transfer autologous peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMCs) transduced with genes encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that
      recognizes epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) tumor-specific antigen
      into patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) following stereotactic
      radiosurgery (SRS). The CAR used will be targeted to a tumor-specific mutation of the
      epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFRvIII, which is expressed on a subset of patients.
      Normal PBMCs derived from patients with GBM will be genetically engineered with a viral
      vector encoding the CAR and infused directly into the patient's tumor with the aim of
      mediating regression of their tumors. Despite our CAR being targeted to a tumor specific
      antigen, given the prior toxicity using CARs that were not targeted to tumor-specific
      antigens, the investigators have elected to begin with very low doses of cells.

      Patients with evidence of radiographic recurrence who expressed EGFRvIII on their original
      tumor diagnosis will have autologous PBMCs harvested by leukapheresis prior to any other
      intervention to treat recurrence. These autologous PBMCs will be transduced with a retrovirus
      containing the sequences for the EGFRvIII CAR and sent to the Duke Radiopharmacy for
      radiolabeling with 111Indium (111In). Within 2-3 weeks of leukapheresis, on Day -3 to -1,
      patients will have a BrainLab MRI to prepare for biopsy and catheter placement. On Day 0, the
      patient will undergo standard of care (SOC) stereotactic biopsy under local anesthesia to
      confirm tumor recurrence. At the time of biopsy, prior to catheter insertion and
      administration of study drug, the presence of recurrent tumor must be confirmed by
      histopathology. If tumor recurrence is confirmed, a catheter will be placed intratumorally
      for delivery of EGFRvIII-CARs by Convection Enhanced Delivery (CED).

      After biopsy, on the same day, a planning MRI will be performed in the Department of
      Radiation Oncology for SRS planning and a CT scan will be done for SRS masking. SRS will take
      place on Day 1 (+1 day) and 111In-labeled EGFRvIII-CARs will be infused on the same day over
      a 6 to 6.5 hour period immediately after SRS.

      On days 1 and 2 after 111In-labeled EGFRvIII-CAR infusion, Single-Photon Emission Computed
      Tomography (SPECT) Computed Tomography (CT) imaging will assess the intracerebral and
      systemic localization of the 111In-labeled EGFRvIII-CARs that describes the distribution of
      EGFRvIII-CARs within the brain and systemically.

      This protocol is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a novel,
      tumor-specific treatment with autologous EGFRvIII-CARs. The proposed starting dose will be
      2.5 x 108 of 111In-labeled cells in 3 milliliter (mL). Doses will be escalated in successive
      cohorts. The infusion flow rate will be fixed at 0.5 mL/hr. Infusions of this volume and flow
      rate have been previously used by us for other therapeutics and have been shown to be safe.
      EGFRvIII-CARs dose escalation will be accomplished by increasing cell concentration allowing
      flow rate and infusion volume to remain unchanged. Cell dose will be increased in successive
      cohorts so long as dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are not observed as described below.

      In the rare event that a sufficient amount of CAR-specific T cells cannot be generated for a
      patient's intended dose within the dose-escalation portion of this study, the patient will be
      treated with all cells if within 15% of the intended dose. If the cell number is not within
      15% of the intended dose, the patient will be treated at a lower pre-defined dose level using
      available CAR-specific T cells. If the situation of an insufficient number of CAR-specific T
      cells occurs within the expanded cohort, all available cells will be administered. If the
      number of CAR-specific T cells is not within 15% of the intended dose, an additional patient
      will be treated in the expanded cohort.
