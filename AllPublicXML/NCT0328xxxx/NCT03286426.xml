  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the vision and posterior segment of eyes in children
      and young adults less than 22 years of age with risk, suspicion, or past medical history
      significant for elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Patients will have visual acuity and
      color vision tested. Assessment of the posterior segment will involve using a non-invasive
      (non-contact) imaging technique (i.e. a portable fundus camera in clinic and hospital
      settings).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The need for non-invasive evaluation of ICP is an active area of study. The current gold
      standard is intraventricular or intraparenchymal catheters but these are invasive, expensive,
      and require sedation; and thus the need for an effective non-invasive screening tool. The
      utility of funduscopy in identifying processes affecting ICP has long been recognized, i.e.
      papilledema, ocular venous engorgement, blurring of the optic disk. Studies have demonstrated
      that funduscopy may have a role in the qualitative assessment of increased ICP as a highly
      sensitive test. However, conventional bedside funduscopy does not allow for image capture and
      may necessitate pupillary dilation. Portable fundus cameras address these issues, allowing
      image capture and storage and the potential for non-mydriatic imaging, i.e. imaging without
      dilation of eyes. And as demonstrated in a recent study, portable fundus cameras are
      efficient (median exam time was 3 minutes and 24 seconds in a pediatric Emergency
      Department).

      Additionally, ICP screening in asymptomatic patients remains limited. Patients being treated
      with medications for acne, specifically tetracyclines (e.g. minocycline and doxycycline),
      retinol, and isotretinol, are at particular risk for increased ICP but often are not
      identified until they are symptomatic (i.e. headaches, visual loss, papilledema). Symptom
      onset has been documented from 2 weeks up to 1 year from drug initiation. The percentage of
      patients with subclinical asymptomatic disease is unclear. This study would allow us to
      describe the presence of subclinical disease in our population and the role/utility of
      routine non-invasive screening methods.
