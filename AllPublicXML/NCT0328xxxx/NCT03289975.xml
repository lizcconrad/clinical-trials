  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today there are few studies in the literature involving patients in an ICU following major
      visceral surgery. There are thus few results about the prognostic value of pulmonary
      extravascular water in this population of patients, but also the prognostic value of
      pulmonary extravascular water measured at the bedside using pulmonary ultrasound.

      In addition, pulmonary ultrasound will be combined with echocardiography to measure left
      ventricular function (LVEF) and to study the profile of the mitral valve to assess filling
      pressure in patients with immediate post-operative ventilation. This will make it possible to
      distinguish between increases in pulmonary extravascular water associated with high filling
      pressure and increased pulmonary water associated with low filling pressure: characteristic
      of lesional oedema.

      The aim of this study is to determine the prognostic value of extravascular pulmonary water
      (PEVW) diagnosed using pulmonary ultrasound in patients admitted to an ICU following
      scheduled or emergency visceral surgery in the onset of acute respiratory distress requiring
      invasive mechanical ventilation, or prolonged post-operative intubation, or non-invasive.
