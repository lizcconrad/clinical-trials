  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) frequently undergo endoscopic examination and
      may suffer from diagnostic procedures. Independent from IBD patients, colonoscopy is usually
      performed using air insufflation, however recent data indicates a superior role of carbon
      dioxide (CO2) as an insufflation gas during colonoscopy. Using CO2 leads to a lower degree of
      patient's discomfort. The role of CO2 as an insufflation gas for colonoscopy in IBD patients
      remains undetermined, wherefore this study aims to address this issue.

    <textblock>
      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suffer from a chronic inflammatory course of
      disease. To stage the course of disease endoscopic procedures including colonoscopy may be
      required and especially IBD patients with their inflamed gut may suffer from repetitive
      endoscopic examinations including colonoscopy. Independent from IBD patients, colonoscopy is
      usually performed using air insufflation, however recent data indicates a superior role of
      carbon dioxide (CO2) as an insufflation gas during colonoscopy. Using CO2 leads to a lower
      degree of patient's discomfort which has been mainly demonstrated in groups of patients
      undergoing cancer surveillance colonoscopies and who do not suffer from IBD. Therefore the
      role of CO2 as an insufflation gas for colonoscopy in IBD patients remains undetermined and
      this study aims to address this issue. For pain assessment a visual analogue scale will be
      used. As the primary outcome measure, the investigators will compare the differences in pain
      level 1h after colonoscopy (comparison of carbon dioxide to air insufflation). For the
      secondary outcome measure the investigators will compare the differences in pain level 3h, 6h
      and 24h after colonoscopy (comparison of carbon dioxide to air insufflation).
