  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monocenter study to determine and evaluate the optimal amount of humidification doses
      delivered by the On-Demand humidification system in neuromuscular patients requiring home
      mechanical ventilation. The patient's perception will be monitored with subjective as well as
      with objective measurements of the optimum comfortable on-demand humidification doses.

    <description>The on demand humidification humidifier is set up to alternate between periods of humidification and no humidification totaling 6 periods of 30 minutes duration each. Thus, the test will consist of 3 cycles of disabled humidification and enabled humidification. Each cycle will be with a different humidification setting to assess which setting is most comfortable. In the second phase, the patient will be treated with the dose they had the best experience with in the first test.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &gt; 18 of age; &lt; 85 years of age

          2. Participants with a neuromuscular disorder who:

               1. Require 24 hour mechanical ventilation in some form through tracheostomy, mask or
                  mouth piece

               2. Can be ambulatory for at least a few hours during the day while using a heat and
                  moisture exchange device (HME) or no humidification

               3. Can part of the day use a heated pass-over humidification system while on their
                  ventilator (overnight, for example).

          3. Able to provide feedback/articulate via some form of communication

          4. Patients using a Trilogy ventilator

          5. Invasively ventilated patients that are willing to use a HME device on their way to
             participate in the study (from home to hospital).

          6. Patients that are willing to participate and are able to consent and sign the informed
             consent form. (Patients with the functional capacity for medical decision-making).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically unstable, i.e.,

               1. Acute respiratory failure

               2. Participants with refractory hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure less
                  than 90 mm Hg despite inotropic agents)

               3. Uncontrolled cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias

               4. Any participant determined as inappropriate for the study by the Principal
                  Investigator

          2. Patients suffering from metastatic or terminal cancer

          3. Patients lacking the functional capacity for medical decision-making.
