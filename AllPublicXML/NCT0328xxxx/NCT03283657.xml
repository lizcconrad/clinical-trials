  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large body of research has demonstrated that intensive lifestyle interventions and
      metformin are effective treatments to prevent or delay diabetes among high-risk adults, yet
      neither treatment is routinely used in practice. This pilot study will develop and evaluate
      the Diabetes Risk Education and Communication Trial (DiRECT) intervention, which communicates
      information about diabetes risk and treatment options for preventing diabetes among primary
      care patients with prediabetes. Given that 38% of U.S. adults have prediabetes, this project
      has large potential to impact public health by developing a scalable intervention to promote
      the use of evidence-based treatments that lower diabetes risk in this population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Landmark clinical trials have found that intensive lifestyle interventions (ILI) and
      metformin are safe and effective treatment options for preventing diabetes among adults with
      prediabetes and overweight/obesity. Despite being included in expert clinical guidelines,
      these treatments are rarely used in practice and little existing research has focused on
      approaches for promoting their use.

      This novel intervention, delivered by medical assistants before patients' routinely scheduled
      office visits, consists of the following 3 components intended to promote initiation of ILI
      and metformin: 1) a prediabetes decision aid focused on diabetes risk and treatment options
      for preventing diabetes; 2) a &quot;think aloud&quot; exercise; and 3) formulating a preliminary
      treatment plan. Previous studies report that medical assistants can improve uptake of some
      preventive health services in primary care, which may also be true for ILI and metformin.

    <description>The number of participants that initiate ILI, Metformin, or both treatments at follow-up is the primary outcome of the pilot trial, which will be assessed in the following ways. Because initiation of metformin requires a provider prescription, this will be assessed pragmatically using the electronic health record (EHR) and confirmed by participant self-report of taking at least 1 dose. Attendance logs will be used to confirm whether participants attended at least 1 ILI session. Those who received a prescription for metformin but do not take any doses will not be considered to have initiated treatment. Similarly, those who are referred to ILI but do not attend any sessions will not be classified as initiating treatment. Receiving a provider's prescription for metformin or referral for ILI without initiating treatment will be an exploratory outcome.</description>

    <description>DiRECT consists of the following components that will be delivered by medical assistants before patients' routinely scheduled office visits: 1) a prediabetes decision aid focused on type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk and treatment options for preventing T2D; 2) a 'think aloud' exercise; and 3) formulating a preliminary treatment plan for T2D prevention.</description>
