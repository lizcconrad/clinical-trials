      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of preoperative liver stiffness measurement(LSM) by
      FibroScan in predicting the progress of liver fibrosis and prognosis after transcatheter
      arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

      Background: Progress of liver fibrosis and liver failure and related poor prognosis after
      TACE which are not completely predictable by current method including Child-Pugh
      Classification. LSM is used to calculate the degree of liver fibrosis and is affected by
      several liver injury, e.g. elevated Alanine aminotransferase（ALT）, Aspartate
      transaminase(AST) and Bilirubin et al. The investigators assume that LSM could be use to
      predict progress of liver fibrosis and adverse effects after TACE in HCC.

      Methods: At least 200 patients will be recruited in this prospective observational study with
      preoperative LSM, demographic, laboratory, radiological and other treatment-related factors.
      Participants will be followed up till death or to the end of study no matter the liver
      failure occurs or not. Data will be analyzed to build a mathematical predicting model.

      Research hypothesis：TACE is related to progress of liver fibrosis and a mathematical model
      with LSM is able to predict the risk of liver failure and prognosis in HCC.
