    <textblock>
      Low Anterior Resection (LAR) surgery can be done using various techniques. The traditional
      technique for performing the surgery is through one or multiple incision(s) in the muscular
      wall of the abdomen. This will allow the surgeon to gain access to inside the belly
      (Abdominal cavity). The surgeon will start from above and go down until reaching the rectum
      located low in the pelvis. The surgeon will then cut out the rectum along with some of the
      tissue surrounding it and reconnect the bowel.

      An alternative new approach to perform Low Anterior Resection is called the Trans-anal
      approach. In this technique, a tube containing special surgical tools is introduced through
      the anus (back passage), while the patient is asleep. These tools are used to free the rectum
      up from its surroundings so that it can be removed.

      Taking out the rectum via the opening of the anus (Trans-anal) is a relatively new surgical
      approach. This new technique enables the surgeon to better see deep in the pelvis which makes
      it easier to remove the rectum and its surrounding outer tissues while protecting other
      important nerves and organs located in the pelvis. However, it also involves inserting a tube
      through the opening of the anus to perform the rectal dissection. The alternative traditional
      way of doing the operation does not involve inserting such a tube because the access to the
      pelvis and rectum is gained from above through incision(s) in the abdominal wall.

      The anal sphincter is the medical name for the muscle layers surrounding the opening of the
      anus. The anal sphincter functions as a seal that can be opened to discharge body waste and
      allow the passage of stool. A damage to the anal sphincter can result in inability to fully
      control bowel movements, causing stool (feces) to leak unexpectedly. Because the Trans-anal
      approach involves inserting a tube through the opening of the anus for the duration of the
      surgery, this can lead to a certain degree of stretch and damage to the anal sphincter
      muscles.

      The main aim of this study is to compare the effect of the these two possible approaches to
      perform &quot;Low Anterior Resection&quot; operation on the muscles of the anal sphincter and whether
      they are associated with stool seepage from the anus after the operation.

      Primary Objective To evaluate effect of TaTME on anal sphincter via anorectal functional
      studies and anorectal ultrasound administered post- and preoperatively.

      Secondary Objective(s) To evaluate the effect of TaTME on fecal incontinence, quality of
      life, and LARS utilizing validated questionnaires administered to patients preoperatively and
      during postoperative follow-up.

      Study Design This is a prospective two-arm cohort study. The study will include patients
      undergoing low anterior resection (LAR) for middle to low rectal cancers. Low anterior
      resection of the rectum entails a sharp dissection circumferentially around the mesorectum in
      an avascular plane between the visceral and parietal layers of the endopelvic fascia in what
      is known as Total Mesorectal Excision (TME). This dissection can be achieved transanally
      starting down in the pelvis and going up in what is known as Transanal Total Mesorectal
      Excision- (TaTME). It can also be done via an up-to-down approach beginning high in the
      abdomen and going low in the pelvis to achieve dissection around the mesorectum. Access in
      the latter is achieved via laparoscopic or open abdominal incisions with minimal anal
      sphincter dilation. In addition, the level of coloanal anastomosis performed is potentially
      higher from the anal sphincter in comparison to TaTME. TaTME on the other hand, involves
      introducing a special port (gelpoint path) transanally to perform the TME dissection. In
      order to better evaluate the effect of TaTME on anal sphincter, it is quintessential to
      include a control group with minimal anal sphincter manipulation, thus the conventional
      abdominal (open or laparoscopic) TME group will serve as a control.

    <description>Total Mesorectal Excision involves resecting the rectum along with its surrounding Mesorectal plane. If the anal sphincter is spared, this surgery is named Low Anterior resection (LAR) for rectal cancer. Traditionally, TME dissection in LAR is performed through open or laparoscopic incisions(s) made in the abdominal wall. Mobilization of the splenic flexure along with sigmoid dissection follows. Lastly, the rectum is dissected in accordance with TME principles from above. This &quot;up-to-down&quot; approach is known as abdominal TME.</description>
