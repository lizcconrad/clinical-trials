  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to compare the standard bulb aspirator with that of a nasal oral
      aspirator. The hypothesis is that use of a nasal oral aspirator is more effective at removing
      nasal secretions in the treatment of bronchiolitis as measured by a predicted 50% decrease in
      the rate of unscheduled bronchiolitis return visits. The primary endpoint will be the number
      of unscheduled bronchiolitis return visits; secondary endpoints will include measurements of
      oral intake, respiratory relief, parental device preference and adverse events.

      This study will be a single center, single blind, randomized controlled trial in the
      pediatric emergency department (ED) at Dell Children's Medical Center of Central Texas
      (DCMC). An ED discharge diagnosis of bronchiolitis will trigger patients to be randomized to
      receive a bulb aspirator or nasal oral aspirator for home secretion management use. Prior to
      dispensing the randomized aspirator, a pre-distribution questionnaire will be administered.
      Additionally, patients will receive a diary to complete for 3 days post ED discharge.
      Research personnel will call families on day 4 as a reminder to return the diary and again on
      day 14 to obtain a verbal post-study questionnaire. Research personnel will perform chart
      review on all patients looking for unscheduled patient return visits for bronchiolitis.
