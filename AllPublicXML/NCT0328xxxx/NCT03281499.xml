  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS) to
      identify small oropharyngeal carcinomas. Findings from this study will be used to better
      determine which patients may be suitable for more targeted radiotherapy that would lead to a
      reduction in the total amount of radiotherapy needed as part of their treatment. Reducing the
      amount of radiotherapy received has been found to reduce the risk of late complications and
      toxicity to the patient.The pathologic findings will then be used to determine patients who
      may be candidates for de-intensification of radiotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who present with carcinomas of unknown primary site (CUP) of the head and neck
      represent a challenging problem for clinicians both from a diagnostic and therapeutic
      perspective. Traditional techniques for identification of primary tumors involved a Positron
      Emission Tomography scan (PET)/ computerized tomography scan(CT) followed by examination
      under anesthesia with biopsies of the nasopharynx, tongue base, piriform sinuses in
      conjunction with a tonsillectomy may identify as many as 44% of primary tumors, the remaining
      unidentified tumors are treated with mucosal irradiation to all high risk mucosal sites. The
      addition of a lingual tonsillectomy with Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS) may identify almost
      70% of primary tumours that have otherwise escaped initial identification at this timepoint,.
      Historically, for those whose primary would not be discovered at the PET/CT, the discovery
      would have been made later during follow up visits.

      The investigators propose to integrate Transoral Robotic Surgery into the diagnostic
      evaluation of participants presenting with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma to the neck of
      unknown primary origin. The investigators will localize small hidden oropharyngeal
      carcinomas, determine their laterality, and based on the laterality of the tumour, laterality
      of neck nodes, and completeness of resection, will offer reduced radiotherapy to the primary
      site and/or to the neck (de-intensification)to the participant. The investigators hypothesize
      that this approach to unknown primary carcinomas will be both safe and effective.
