  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Late effects of breast cancer treatment are widely reported including deteriorating fitness,
      fatigue, loss of muscle and bone mass, and increased body fat percentage. Exercise
      interventions may ameliorate a number of these effects including fatigue, fitness and improve
      quality of life. However only limited knowledge exists on the potential of novel
      interventions and settings, such as sports outside the hospital setting, to improve late
      effects of breast cancer treatment. The 'Football Fitness After Breast Cancer' (FF ABC) study
      is a randomized trial comparing the effects of a football training intervention with standard
      treatment approaches on fitness, bone mineralization, body composition, muscle strength,
      blood pressure, and patient-reported outcomes in women treated for breast cancer.

    <description>Participants in the intervention group will practice soccer for 52 weeks two times weekly. A soccer instructor will be in charge of all training sessions. The training will consist of 30 min of warm-up exercises (running, dribbling, passing, shooting, balance and muscle strength exercises), followed by 2 x 15 minutes of 4-7 a-side games.
Training will take place on a natural grass pitch. In adverse weather conditions (i.e., &lt; 5°C or heavy rain) training will be performed indoors. Participants will be told to avoid hard tackles and other actions that carry a risk of injury.</description>
