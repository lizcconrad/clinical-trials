  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims at assessing whether cell free DNA genotyping can improve the accuracy of
      early prediction of cure in mature B-cell tumor patients and whether it represents an
      accessible source of tumor DNA for the sensitive identification of genetic biomarkers that
      refine the diagnostic workup, stratify prognosis and identify the emergence of
      drug-resistance mutations during treatment.

      Clinical data and peripheral blood samples (20 ml in EDTA tubes and 20 ml in Cell-Free DNA
      BCT tubes) will be collected during the clinico/laboratory visits that are planned as per
      clinical routine at the time of mature B-cell tumor diagnosis, before treatment, at the time
      of interim PET/CT, at the time of end of treatment PET/CT and at the time of disease relapse.

      Clinical variables, international prognostic index, results of plasma cell free DNA
      genotyping and of PET-CT will be analyzed descriptively.

      The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and
      accuracy of the compiled results of plasma cell free DNA genotyping and interim PET-CT (for
      cHL and DLBCL), or plasma cell free DNA genotyping and baseline international prognostic
      index (for FL and MCL) in identifying patients that are progression free for &gt;24 months after
      first line therapy will be calculated and compared with those obtained by the sole interim
      PET-CT (cHL and DLBCL) or the sole international prognostic index (FL, MCL).
