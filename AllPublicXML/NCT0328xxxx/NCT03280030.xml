             another cancer or disorder

          -  Known hypersensitivity to midostaurin, cytarabine or daunorubicin or to any of the
             excipients of midostaurin/placebo, cytarabine or daunorubicin

          -  Abnormal chest X-ray unless the abnormality represents a non-active, or non-clinically
             significant finding, such as scarring

          -  Known impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that might alter
             significantly the absorption of midostaurin

          -  Cardiac or cardiac repolarization abnormality

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, unless they are using highly effective methods of
             contraception during dosing and for 4 months after stopping medication Other
             protocol-defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.
