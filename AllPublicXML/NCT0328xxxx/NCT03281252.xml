    <textblock>
      Ineffective hemostasis or a paradoxical prothrombotic state of Acute-on-chronic liver disease
      (ACLF) has been well established. However, the minor and major bleeding events has not been
      described yet. We observe the patients' major and minor bleeding events and use 4 criteria,
      which include BARC, ISTH, TIMI, Gusto ,to evaluate the incident rate of bleeding events in
      ACLF patients and pre-ACLF patients.
