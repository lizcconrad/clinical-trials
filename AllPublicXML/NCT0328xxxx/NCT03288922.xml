  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-efficiency post-dilution online hemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) using high-flux dialyzer and
      requiring high blood flow rate (BF ≥400 mL/min) has been reported to enhance protein-bound
      toxin and middle molecular toxin removal and improve patient survival. Unfortunately, the
      majority of patients could not reach that high BF because of vascular access issue. This
      randomized crossover study was conducted to compare these uremic toxin removals between the
      new modality (limited BF OL-HDF with super high-flux dialyzer) and the control
      (high-efficiency OL-HDF). The OL-HDF patients were randomized to undergo either new modality
      or control for 2 weeks before crossover to the other modality for another 2 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elevated protein-bound toxins including p-cresol (pCS) and indoxyl sulfate (IDS) as well as
      middle-molecular toxins such as beta2-microglobulin (B2M) which could not be removed by
      hemodialysis (HD) are obviously correlated with high mortality. High-efficiency post-dilution
      online hemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) using high-flux dialyzer and requiring high blood flow rate
      (BF ≥400 mL/min) has been reported to enhance pCS, IDS, and B2M removal and improve patient
      survival. Unfortunately, the majority of patients could not reach that high BF because of
      vascular access issue. We innovated the OL-HDF modality for this limited BF situation by
      integrating the novel super high-flux membrane dialyzer (SHF; PES-17Dα, Nipro Corporation,
      Japan) into pre-dilution OL-HDF. This randomized crossover study was conducted to compare the
      uremic toxin removals between the new modality (limited BF OL-HDF with SHF) and the control
      (high-efficiency OL-HDF). The OL-HDF patients were randomized to undergo either new modality
      or control for 2 weeks before crossover to the other modality for another 2 weeks. Removals
      of pCS and IDS as well as small and middle molecule toxins were compared. The pCS and IDS
      were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. The dialysate albumin loss and
      patient safety were also monitored.

    <description>The new modality &quot;Limited BF OL-HDF with SHF&quot; were performed using Fresenius 5008 hemodiafiltration machine. The prescribed blood flow rate was 300 ml/min and the total dialysis fluid flow rate was 800 ml/min which included pre-filter substitution rate of 150 ml/min. The super high-flux dialyzer was PES-17Dα from Nipro Corporation, Japan which contains 1.7 m2 hollow fiber polyethersulfone membrane (ultrafiltration coefficient 80 ml/h/mmHg; urea clearance 267 ml/min, Qb 300 ml/min and Qd 500ml/min). The patients were received this treatment thrice-a-week for 2 week before entering the wash-out period and crossover to another arm.</description>
