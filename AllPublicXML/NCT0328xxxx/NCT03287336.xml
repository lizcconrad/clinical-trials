  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage is a significant contributor to maternal morbidity and mortality and is
      worldwide. TXA has recently been proven to reduce mortality when given to women in setting of
      diagnosed PPH. US obstetricians and anesthesiologists are hesitant to use TXA in the
      peripartum period especially for prevention of PPH due to uncertainty of an optimal dose and
      safety profile. The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics of TXA when
      given prophylactically at time of delivery. In addition investigators will determine the
      pharmacodynamics of TXA in the peripartum period.

      Conduct a prospective, open-label, dose finding PK study in 30 pregnant 3rd trimester women
      scheduled for non-emergent cesarean section who are at high risk for hemorrhage. Three doses
      of the drug will be administered in an escalating fashion by cohort with the lowest dose
      first. A maximum of 1 gram will be administered. TXA serum levels at several time points
      after delivery will be assayed. A PK model will be constructed for determining the optimal
      TXA dose administered at parturition.
