  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether exposure to short-term high blood glucose levels impairs
      exercise-induced adaptations in glucose tolerance, and whether the pattern of high blood
      glucose levels plays a role.

      Healthy male volunteers will undergo a screening visit and three experimental trials.

      Screening Visit: Having read the participant info sheet, a study investigator will discuss
      the project with the potential participant who will have the chance to ask any questions.
      Informed consent will be sought and a General Health Questionnaire will be completed. Body
      weight, height, and skinfold measurements will be taken. Participants will also complete an
      exercise test to measure V̇O2max test along with heart rate and blood pressure measurements.

      Individuals eligible for inclusion in the study will then return to the lab for 3
      experimental trials, each separated by ~1 week. Trials will be completed using a randomised,
      counter-balanced, cross-over design. Between experimental trials participants will be
      instructed to maintain their normal diet and activity habits. During the 48 hours prior to
      each experimental trial participants will be instructed to refrain from vigorous exercise and
      alcohol. For 3 days prior to each experimental trial participants will record their dietary
      intake, and wear an accelerometer and continuous glucose monitoring devices to measure
      physical activity levels and glucose control.

      Experimental Trials: Participants will come to the lab between 7 and 9 am following an
      overnight fast since 10 pm the previous night. Resting heart rate, blood pressure, blood
      flow, and flow-mediated dilation will be measured and antecubital intravenous lines will be
      placed. Baseline blood samples will be collected. At T=0, 6, 7, and 9 hours, intravenous
      glucose tolerance tests (ivGTTs) will be administered. Participants will complete a
      moderate-intensity exercise bout (45-minutes of cycling at 70% of their V̇O2max) at T=5
      hours. An evening meal will be provided at ~T=10 hours. All 3 experimental trials are
      identical except for the glycemic intervention taking place between T=0 and 6 hours:

      Trial A (control trial): Participants will not undergo any glycemic intervention and will
      remain in a rested state with normal blood glucose levels.

      Trial B (steady-state hyperglycemia): Participants will undergo a square-wave hyperglycemic
      clamp with a variable-rate intravenous glucose infusion so as to establish a steady-state
      blood glucose profile at 5 mM (or 90 mg/dL) above basal (i.e. at 10 mM).

      Trial C (fluctuating hyperglycemia): Participants will receive 0.15 g/kg intravenous glucose
      bolus injections every 30 minutes to cause multiple fluctuations in blood glucose levels.

    <measure>Exercise-induced change in blood glucose control.</measure>
    <time_frame>In all trials, blood glucose control will be determined at baseline (T=0 hours) and at T=6, 7, and 9 hours. The interventions will take place between baseline (T=0 hours) and T=6 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>In all trials, intravenous glucose tolerance tests (ivGTTs) will be administered at baseline (T=0 hours), immediately after a 45-minute exercise bout (T=6 hours), and 1-, 3-, and 18-hours after exercise. The plasma glucose responses to ivGTTs will be measured from which blood glucose control will be determined. The interventions will take place between baseline (T=0 hours) and T=6 hours.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hyperglycemia-induced change in inflammation.</measure>
    <time_frame>In all trials, inflammation will be determined at baseline (T=0 hours) and at T=6 hours. The interventions will take place between baseline (T=0 hours) and T=6 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>In all trials, plasma cytokine levels (IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1ra) will be measured at baseline (T=0 hours) and immediately after each intervention (T=6 hours). The interventions will take place between baseline (T=0 hours) and T=6 hours.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise-induced change in insulin secretory function.</measure>
    <time_frame>In all trials, insulin secretory function will be determined at baseline (T=0 hours) and at T=6, 7, and 9 hours. The interventions will take place between baseline (T=0 hours) and T=6 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>In all trials, intravenous glucose tolerance tests (ivGTTs) will be administered at baseline (T=0 hours), immediately after a 45-minute exercise bout (T=6 hours), and 1-, and 3-hours after exercise. The plasma insulin &amp; C-peptide responses to ivGTTs will be measured from which insulin secretory function will be determined. The interventions will take place between baseline (T=0 hours) and T=6 hours.</description>

    <measure>Hyperglycemia-induced change in cognitive function.</measure>
    <time_frame>In all trials, cognitive function will be determined at baseline (T=0 hours) and at T=5 hours (during the interventions).</time_frame>
    <description>In all trials, cognitive function tests (CANTAB) will be administered at baseline (T=0 hours) and before the exercise bout at T=5 hours (during the interventions), to measure executive functioning and verbal memory.</description>
