      This is an open-label multicenter, long-term extension safety study to evaluate the safety of
      IV CR845 administered after each dialysis session over a Treatment Period of up to 52 weeks.
      This study will consist of a Screening Visit, a 52 week Treatment Period, and a Follow-up
      Visit. Informed consent will be obtained prior to performing any study-specific procedures.
      All patients will have a Screening Visit, which can be performed anytime within 14 days prior
      to the first dose of study drug, to confirm eligibility.

      Clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, adverse events, and
      concomitant medications will be monitored throughout the study. Blood samples for
      inflammatory biomarkers will be collected from all patients prior to dialysis on Day 1 and
      periodically until the End of Treatment or Early Termination Visit. Blood samples will also
      be collected periodically for clinical laboratory tests.

          5. If female:

               1. Is not of childbearing potential (surgically sterile or postmenopausal, as
                  defined in Section 6.5.1.6); or

               2. Has a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and agrees to use acceptable
                  contraceptive measures (as defined in Section 6.5.1.6) from the time of informed
                  consent until the safety Follow-up Visit or 7 days after the last dose of study
                  drug, whichever is later.

          6. If male, agrees not to donate sperm after the first dose of study drug until 7 days
             after the last dose, and agrees to use a condom with spermicide or abstain from
