    <textblock>
      In this study the effectiveness of the use of Cole formula and USG were compared in
      determining the number of the appropriate uncuffed ETT to be used for clinically adequate
      ventilation.

      Aim: The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Cole formula and
      ultrasonography in determining endotracheal tube size for paediatric surgery patients.

      Material and methods: ASA I-II pediatric patients (n=110) in the age range of 2-10 years,
      planned to undergo elective surgeries under general anesthesia with endotracheal entubation,
      were enrolled in this study. Once patients were properly positioned after premedication and
      anesthesia induction, the subglottic diameter was measured using ultrasonography, and
      endotracheal tube (ETT) size was also calculated with the Cole formula. Subsequently patients
      were entubated with uncuffed ETT with sizes based on the patient's age in compliance with
      current clinical guide lines. To ensure adequate ventilation, the tube was replaced with an
      ETT of larger or smaller diameter as needed. The ETT was fastened after the placement ring
      had passed through the vocal cords and breath sounds were confirmed to be equal by
      auscultation. The size of the used ETT was compared with the size estimated from the
      subglottic diameter measured by ultrasonography to the size calculated with the Cole formula
