  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) is characterized by elevated and sustained blood
      pressure levels, related to several risk factors. Modifying lifestyle to combat risk factors
      associated with cardiovascular disease is critical, as such factors are related alteration of
      endothelial vasodilator response leading to progressive loss of its protective function.
      However, endothelial dysfunction related to hypertension is not only related to the decrease
      in the bioavailability of endothelium relaxants, but also to the time of presence of
      hypertension, increased production of vessel contraction factors and oxidative stress related
      to the disease. In this way, physical training presents as a non-drug strategy capable of
      directly and indirectly influencing the pathophysiology of hypertension. In this way the
      objective of the present work will be to evaluate the acute and chronic effect of aerobic
      exercise and strength on blood pressure, blood markers of vasodilation and vascular
      endothelial vasoconstriction, as well as the repercussion on flow-mediated dilatation and
      oxidative stress markers, In middle-aged hypertensive individuals before and after 12 weeks
      of training. Study hypothesis: The expected results of the research are that the endothelial
      response of biochemical markers of vasodilation and vasoconstriction will change positively
      after aerobic and strength training and the responses will be similar when compared between
      groups. There will be an improvement in the antioxidant capacity in both groups and the
      magnitude of the hypotensive effect will be greater in the aerobic group when compared to
      control and strength.

    <description>Participants will be randomized in one of TWO groups: aerobic training group (AT) or strength training group (ST). Each training protocol will last 12 weeks, being the initial two weeks designed to participants' gradual adaptations to respective training protocol, with sessions performed three times per week in non-consecutive days.</description>

    <intervention_name>Strength training group</intervention_name>
    <description>Individuals in the strength training group will perform exercises based on exercises with free weights and equipment, for upper and lower limbs with a weekly frequency of three times for twelve weeks. The periodization will start with 2 sets, 15 - 20 repetitions, passive rest of 120 seconds, exercises performed alternating by segments and the intensity of 50% of maximum repetition. After twelve weeks the periodization will be finished with 3 sets, 8-12 repetitions, passive rest of 120 seconds, exercises performed alternated by segments and the intensity of 70% of maximum repetition.
The following exercises will compose the strength training protocol:
Squatting
Leg press
Knee Extension
Knee Flexion
Supine Challenge
High Pull
Elbow flexion
Extension of elbows
Development
Abdominal</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  It will include men and women between the ages of 30 and 50, with previously diagnosed
             and controlled hypertension level I and II. In addition, volunteers will be recruited
             who have not performed physical exercises systematically in the previous 6 months.
             Finally, individuals must submit a medical certificate, releasing them for intense
             physical exercises and will be categorized by the drug used to treat hypertension.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Those individuals who use some ergogenic or dietary resource will be excluded from the
             sample. Those who present a history of chronic or metabolic disease (diabetes,
             hypercholesterolemia, peripheral vascular disease, coagulopathy, among others) that in
             some way influence endothelial function or make the exercise protocol unfeasible, will
             also be excluded from the study.
