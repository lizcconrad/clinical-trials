  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway had previously been shown to be efficacious in
      the treatment of patients with metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.
      Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) to metastatic lesions causes localized cancer cell
      killing and the release of cancer cell debris, which could stimulate the immune system in the
      presence of immunotherapy. The purpose of this study is to assess the tolerability and
      efficacy of combining Durvalumab (MEDI4736), Tremelimumab and SBRT in controlling cancer
      progression. SBRT will be administered to patients while they are receiving Durvalumab and
      Tremelimumab.
