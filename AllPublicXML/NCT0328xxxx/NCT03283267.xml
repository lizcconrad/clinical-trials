  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, inpatient, open label pharmacodynamic study to determine the effect
      of 5 g and 10 g doses of Sodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate (ZS) administered once daily (qd) for
      4 days on potassium and sodium excretion in healthy Chinese subjects on a standardized, low
      sodium and high potassium diet.

    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted at 1 study centre in Hong Kong. Approximately 22 Subjects will
      be screened to achieve 20 subjects completing the study. Subjects will be randomized to
      receive ZS 5 g or 10 g (1:1) once daily (qd) in conjunction with breakfast and will be
      continued with a standard diet during the ZS treatment period.
