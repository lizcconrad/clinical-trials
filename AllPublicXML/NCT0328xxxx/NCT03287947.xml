  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the disease control rate of subjects with metastatic
      appendiceal cancer for whom initial fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy has failed. Based on
      previous studies, the anticancer activityof nintedanib in lung and ovarian cancer trials,
      along with the similarities between appendiceal and colorectal cancer and potentially ovarian
      cancer, warrant additional investigation for the optimal treatment of metastatic appendiceal
      carcinomas.

      The primary study objective is to evaluate the disease control rate. The secondary study
      objectives are to evaluate safety and toxicity, objective response rate, 6-month progression
      free survival and overall survival. Exploratory study objective include evaluation of serum
      VEGF, ascites VEGF, hypertension and paracentesis frequency in subjects with ascites at study
      entry.
