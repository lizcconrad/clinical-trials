  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with an advanced disease and their families an excellent and compassionate care
      is essential. However, in hospitals optimal end-of-life care is not yet fully realized and
      patient's needs are often not met. Palliative care is able to increase patients' quality of
      life and to carefully meet their and their families' needs.

      To improve the awareness of unmet needs patient-reported outcome measurement has been the
      pivot of latest palliative care research. Besides the improvement of care outcome measurement
      allows the evaluation of the quality of palliative care and comparisons on a national and
      international level.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the quality of palliative care in different
      settings (palliative care unit, inpatient and outpatient consultation teams) using the
      Integrated Palliative Care Outcome Scale (IPOS). The IPOS has been lately developed as
      improved follow-up version of the Palliative Care Outcome Scale (POS) integrating most
      important questions and simultaneously being brief and comprehensive. The study is planned as
      a multi-centric observational study. Primary endpoint is the reduction of symptom burden of
      patients.

      The clinical study hypothesis bases on the assumption that palliative care can change the
      symptom burden, measured by a change in the IPOS overall profile score, and that there might
      be a difference in the size of the effect depending on the caring setting.

      After the enrolment and consent of participation the patient receive a questionnaire
      consisting of three independent assessments: To assess the symptom burden and specific
      palliative care needs the Integrated Palliative Outcome Scale (IPOS) is used. To measure the
      generic health-related quality of life the patient has to answer the EuroQoL Group
      5-Dimension 5-Level Self Report Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L). To get an opinion of the general
      condition the patient is to complete the NCCN Distress Thermometer which includes a visual
      analogue scale (with values from 0 to 10).

      Meanwhile, a professional palliative caregiver completes a questionnaire about the main
      demographic aspects of the patients and assess the palliative care needs and the symptom
      burden using the IPOS.

      After one week both, patient and professional palliative caregiver, will receive the same
      questionnaires again to assess the change from baseline.

    <description>Change from baseline in palliative care needs and specific symptoms (at day 7) assessed with the Integrated Palliative Care Outcome Scale (IPOS). The IPOS includes 10 symptoms and 7 questions on patients and carers emotional situation, spiritual concerns, and provision of information and support. The overall profile score is the sum of the scores from each of the 17 questions.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline in patients' generic health-related quality of life measured with the EuroQoL Group 5-Dimension 5-Level Self Report Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L). The EQ-5D-5L essentially consists of 2 pages - the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The visual analogue scale of the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire ranges from 0 to 100 (with 0 representing the worst health the patient can imagine and 100 representing the best health the patient can imagine).</description>
