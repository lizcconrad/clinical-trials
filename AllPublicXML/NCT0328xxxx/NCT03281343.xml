  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can be very effective at preventing HIV infection among women
      at high-risk for HIV but is underused in this population. Periods of incarceration represent
      an opportunity to identify women at risk and link them to PrEP care as they leave jail or
      prison. This study aims to improve linkage to community-based PrEP care to reduce HIV
      acquisition in a high-need, underserved community.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Incarcerated women engage in high rates of sex- and drug-related behavior that place them at
      risk for HIV. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an efficacious means of reducing HIV
      acquisition. There is a general lack of knowledge regarding PrEP among women at elevated
      risk, and only a small percentage of at-risk women are currently engaged in PrEP care. The
      period of incarceration represents an opportunity to identify at-risk women, initiate PrEP
      during incarceration, and establish linkage to community-based PrEP care upon release from
      incarceration. Further, post-release is a time period that is particularly risky, and there
      are numerous barriers that may impede linkage to community-based care in the absence of
      intervention.

      To date, very little research has been done to improve linkage to PrEP care among US women.
      The proposed study will examine the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of a
      psychoeducation and motivational interviewing intervention to promote PrEP initiation during
      incarceration, followed by a patient navigator intervention to facilitate linkage to
      community-based PrEP care upon release from incarceration. The long-term goal of this line of
      research is to disseminate an efficacious PrEP Care linkage intervention for at-risk women
      post-release from incarceration. The present proposal seeks to develop intervention materials
      and conduct a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the intervention.

    <time_frame>3 Months post-release</time_frame>
    <description>Linkage to community-based care is operationalized as receipt of a prescription for PrEP from a community-based provider within 3 months of release from prison, confirmed through medical record data extraction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PrEP Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months and 6 Months post-release</time_frame>
    <description>PrEP adherence will be determined by drug concentrations in dried blood spot samples collected from participants who have been prescribed PrEP at 3 and 6 months. Presence of emtricitabine/tenofovir will be assessed from the dried blood samples.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PrEP Care Retention</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Month clinical appointments (+/- 1 month)</time_frame>
    <description>PrEP retention in care will be defined as attending 3-month clinical appointments (+/- 1 month) which is in accordance with current CDC guidelines. This will be verified with medical records.</description>

    <measure>Alcohol and Drug Use</measure>

    <description>The specific content, structure, and implementation approach for MI-NAV will be guided by IDIs conducted during Phase 1 and Phase 2. Our initial plan is to deliver MI-NAV in two waves. The first wave will be aimed at promoting uptake of PrEP at the prison, through the use of motivational interviewing. The second wave will be aimed at linking at-risk women to community-based PrEP care upon release from incarceration, by utilizing a patient navigator approach.</description>
