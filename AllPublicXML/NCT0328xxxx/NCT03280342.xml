      Crossover, randomized, double blind: Q12h dosing in both periods; matching placebo for
      evening dosing during XR treatment; target dose: 100mg

      The primary objective is to compare the effect of treatment with an immediate-release
      topiramate (IR-TPM), namely Topamax®, to an extended-release topiramate (XR-TPM), namely
      Trokendi XR®, regimen on cognition in adults with migraine.

      The secondary objective is to determine the factors that explain inter-individual variability
      in cognitive response. Pharmacokinetic and demographic factors will be explored. Variability
      in cognitive response between individuals can be large. A population approach (nonlinear,
      mixed effects) will be used to determine drug exposure response relationships.

    <intervention_model_description>a crossover, randomized, double blind design in conjunction with intensive pharmacokinetic sampling and multiple administrations of a neurocognitive test battery to directly compare the effects on cognition of IR-TPM to XR-TPM in adults with migraine. The dose will begin at 25mg and titrated in 25mg increments to reach target dose of 100mg.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWA)-generative phonemic fluency</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) through Day 52</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is the Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA: phonemic generative fluency). COWA was chosen as the primary endpoint since in previous studies of drug-induced cognitive impairment, this measure was sensitive to the effects of topiramate (Meador et al, 2003; Marino et al, 2012; Marino et al, 2015). The primary endpoint is a change in the COWA score from baseline to each post-dose assessment</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Established history of episodic migraine with or without aura, as assessed by
             International Headache Society criteria, for at least 6 months before screening and
             frequency of 3 or more headache attacks per month during the past 3 months

          2. Male or female, ages 18-65
