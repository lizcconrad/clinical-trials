  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) are malignant lesions that arise from abnormal
      proliferation of placental trophoblast. The pathologic conditions that make up this entity
      include invasive partial and complete hydatidiform mole, choriocarcinoma, placental site
      trophoblastic tumor (PSTT), and epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT). GTN often arises after
      molar pregnancies but can also occur after any gestation including miscarriages and term
      pregnancies. In the United States, hydatidiform moles are observed in approximately 1/600
      therapeutic abortions and 1/1000-2000 pregnancies . Most cases of GTN are diagnosed when the
      serum hCG levels plateau or rise in patients being observed after the diagnosis of
      hydatidiform mole.These malignancies are highly susceptible to chemotherapy and it is often
      possible to achieve cure while preserving the woman's reproductive function

      When reporting GTN data, it is useful to use both the FIGO anatomic staging system and
      prognostic scoring system . A FIGO score of 6 or less indicates low-risk GTN whereas a score
      of 7 or more identifies high-risk disease.

      Table 1- FIGO Anatomical staging of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia:

      Stage I Disease confined to the uterus Stage II Disease extends to the outside of the uterus,
      but is limited to the genital structures Stage III Disease extends to the lungs, with or
      without genital tract involvement Stage IV All other metastatic sites

      Table 2- FIGO Scoring system:

      FIGO SCORING 0 1 2 4 Age (years) Antecedent pregnancy Interval months from end of index
      pregnancy to treatment Pretreatment serum hCG (iu/l) Largest tumour size, including uterus
      Site of metastases Number of metastases Previous failed chemotherapy &lt;40 ≥40 - - mole
      abortion term &lt;4 4-6 7-12 &gt;12 &lt;1000 1000-10000 10000-100000 &gt;100000 &lt;3cm 3-4cm ≥5 - Lung
      spleen&amp;kidney GIT liver&amp;brain

        -  1-4 5-8 &gt;8

        -  - 1 drug 2 or more drugs

      RCOG guidelines (No. 38February 2010 ) recommends the use of rescue regimen of alternating
      methotrexate( MTX) and leucoverin for 8 days (class D). However, several protocols using MTX
      were described. No prospective randomised controlled trials have been done to compare the
      efficacy of resue regimen with the ther protocols. In a retrospective study done showed that
      high dose methotrexate regimen is more effective than the rescue regimen.

      In addition, several concerns have been raised towards the use of leucoverin with
      methotrexate, although reducing the side effects, however, it may increase the resistence to
      the effect of MTX .

      On the other hand, High dose regimen offers a less hospital stay which may be more convenient
      to the patients, together with the same incidence of side effects.

      In our study we are going to compare the efficacy and tolerance of both regimens in patients
      diagnosed to have low risk PGTN.
