  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized clinical trial evaluating the effect of an exercise program
      designed specifically for orchestral musicians on performance-related musculoskeletal
      problems (PRMPs). Professional and conservatory-level orchestral musicians will be recruited.
      Half of the subjects will participate in an 11-week home exercise program and attend three
      group exercise sessions and an educational presentation on injury prevention, while the other
      half of the subjects will receive no intervention, and continue their usual activities.

    <description>An exercise program in the form of home exercise videos will be given to the participants in this group. They will be asked to perform a minimum of two 35-minute exercise sessions per week, over a period of 11 weeks. They will also be required to attend three group exercise sessions, to confirm correct execution of the exercises. A short educational presentation on injury prevention will be offered at the beginning of the study, followed by three informative e-mails over the course of the study.</description>

    <description>The exercise program comprises warm-ups, exercises and cool-downs and aims to improve recruitment, strength and endurance of postural muscle groups that are key to the work of a musician. Basic activation exercises progress to dynamic and resisted exercises as well as functional musical movements. There is a series of six exercises of increasing difficulty for each of the following bodily regions: hips, back, neck, shoulders and abdominals.
Topics to be discussed in the educational presentation and e-mails include healthy practice habits, activity dosage, the importance of physical activity, how the body adapts to workload and physical stressors, and instructions pertaining to the exercise program.</description>
