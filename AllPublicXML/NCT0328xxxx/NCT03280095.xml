        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and female volunteers aged 18-45 (both inclusive), as determined by
             medical history, physical examination, laboratory test values, vital signs and 12-lead
             ECGs at screening.

          -  Non-smokers from at least three months before receiving the first dose of study drug
             and for the duration of the study.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 and ≤ 30 kg/m2.

          -  Able to voluntarily provide written informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Must understand the purposes and risks of the study and agree to follow the
             restrictions and schedule of procedures as defined in the protocol, as confirmed
             during the informed consent process.

          -  Female volunteers of child-bearing potential and less than one year postmenopausal
             must have a negative serum pregnancy test and be non-lactating.

          -  Female volunteers who have been post-menopausal for more than one year and have
             elevated serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) or are treated with hormone
             replacement therapy (HRT) or female volunteers who have been permanently sterilised
             (e.g. tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy).

          -  Male volunteers and female volunteers of child-bearing potential who are sexually
             active must use two highly effective methods of contraception with their partners
             throughout the study and for 30 days after completion of the study (female volunteers)
             or 90 days after completion of the study (male volunteers). Acceptable methods
             include: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/ vault caps) with spermicidal
             foam/ gel/ film/ cream/ suppository; male sterilisation (with the appropriate
             post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate); established
             use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception and placement of
             an intrauterine device or intrauterine system. True abstinence is an acceptable method
             only where this is already established as the volunteer's preferred and usual
             lifestyle.

          -  Male volunteers must not donate sperm during the study and for 90 days after
             completion of the study.

          -  Must be willing to consent to have data entered into The Over Volunteering Prevention
             System (TOPS).

          -  The volunteer's primary care physician has confirmed within the last 12 months that
             there is nothing in their medical history that would preclude their enrolment into a
             clinical study.

          -  Volunteers should be cautioned that codeine may impair mental and/or physical
             abilities, therefore it may affect their ability to drive or operate machinery for up
             to approximately 24 hours post-dose.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Volunteers with history or presence of significant cardiovascular disease, pulmonary,
             hepatic, gallbladder or biliary tract, urogenital (including benign prostatic
             hypertrophy), haematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunological,
             dermatological, neurological, psychiatric disease or current infection.

          -  Laboratory values at screening which are deemed to be clinically significant, unless
             agreed in advance by the Sponsor's Medical Representative and Principal Investigator.

          -  Female volunteers who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or hepatitis C.

          -  Current or history of drug or alcohol abuse or a positive drugs of abuse or alcohol
             test at screening or check-in.

          -  Participation in a clinical drug study during the 90 days preceding the initial dose
             in this study.

          -  Any clinically significant illness within 30 days prior to study drug administration.

          -  Donation of blood or blood products within 90 days prior to study drug administration,
             or at any time during the study, except as required by this protocol.

          -  Volunteers who have a history or presence of any significant drug allergy, including a
             history of hypersensitivity to paracetamol, codeine phosphate hemihydrate, any related
             drugs, or any of the excipients contained in the formulations.

          -  Use of any prescription or over-the-counter medication (including vitamins, herbal and
             mineral supplements) within 14 days prior to study drug administration until the end
             of the study, with the exception of Investigator approved contraceptives and HRT.

          -  Volunteers with inadequate venous access to allow collection of blood samples as
             required by this protocol.

          -  Strenuous exercise, as judged by the Investigator, within 72 hours prior to screening,
             within 72 hours prior to study drug administration and for the duration of the study
             until after the post-study medical.

          -  Weekly alcohol intake exceeding the equivalent of 14 units per week for females or 21
             units per week for males.

          -  Consumption of alcoholic beverages within 48 hours prior to study drug administration
             and during study confinement.

          -  Consumption of caffeine or xanthine-containing products within 24 hours prior to study
             drug administration and during study confinement.

          -  Consumption of grapefruit, grapefruit juice, Seville oranges, Seville orange marmalade
             or other products containing grapefruit or Seville oranges within 7 days prior to
             study drug administration, during study confinement and during the wash-out periods.

          -  Volunteers who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are unsuitable for participation
             in the study.
