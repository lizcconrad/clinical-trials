  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In more than 90% of cases, victims of fall are elderly people over 65. Nearly the third of
      those people fall at least 1 time by year. The incidence substantially increases for people
      over 80 and women are at higher risk than men.

      The value of balance rehabilitation no longer needs to be demonstrated in Gerontology.
      Nevertheless, a more specific therapy based on the aged-related cervical problems seems to be
      essential. Indeed, those problems are numerous (arthrosis-like pains, joint stiffness,
      muscular contractures…) and often lessen vestibular and/or proprioceptive afferents. The
      cervical spine is a link between different systems which regulate balance, as the visual,
      vestibular and cervical systems (muscular, articular afferents…), and this role is key to
      balance control. Indeed, the cervical spine owns an exceptional function thanks to Ruffinian
      corpuscles, muscle and neurotendinal spindles.

      Many studies point up the importance of the relation between balance, cervical spine and
      vestibular system, and others between tissue changes and postural adaptations in elderly
      people. Nevertheless, the take into consideration of all these data and their impacts in
      rehabilitation has not been reported yet.

      This brings us to question the added-value of a cervical mobility management in balance
      rehabilitation in Gerontology.
