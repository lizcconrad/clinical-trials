  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, single-arm, open-label, Simon 2-stage, phase II trial in up to 55
      patients with a potentially resectable, histologically-proven, adenocarcinoma or poorly
      differentiated carcinoma of the stomach, esophagogastric junction (EGJ), or lower third of
      the esophagus.

      Patients will receive neoadjuvant therapy consisting of 4 cycles of avelumab added to the
      modified chemotherapy regimen of docetaxel, cisplatin, 5- fluorouracil. Following surgery,
      pathologic response will be assessed. Patients will then receive adjuvant therapy consisting
      of 4 cycles of mDCF + avelumab. Patients will be followed to assess two-year disease-free
      survival rates.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect on pathologic complete response
      rate (pCR) of adding avelumab to an mDCF regimen. The secondary objectives of this study are
      to determine the safety of adding avelumab to an mDCF regimen and assess its effect on
      two-year disease-free survival.

             imaging studies (detailed below) to clinically stage the tumor and rule out the
             presence of metastatic disease, and includes a preoperative laparoscopic evaluation
             for gastric tumors only;

          5. Stage IB (TlNl only), II, IHA, IIIB;

             (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior; or laboratory
             abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             treatment administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results
             and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for
             entry into this study;

         18. Significant hearing impairment, as judged by the need for or use of a hearing aid. If
             there is any uncertainty regarding the degree of hearing impairment, an audiogram will
             be done. If the audiogram is grossly normal or shows only minor hearing impairment
             (i.e. not requiring hearing aid), the patient may be enrolled;

         19. Unwillingness to undergo investigations and/or treatment as outlined on the study; or

         20. Participation to another trial where an investigational drug is being used.

             include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin treated
             curatively and in-situ cervical cancer.
