      The MPI-PT-Study: Schema Therapy vs. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Patients with Major or
      Persistent Depressive Disorder in an Inpatient and Day Clinic Setting: An outline

      Depressive disorders represent one of the most frequent diseases worldwide. Schema therapy,
      which was originally developed for patients with personality disorders and focuses on emotion
      activating techniques, became popular in the field of psychotherapy in the recent years and
      was also applied on axis-I-disorders such as depression.

      The current study aims to close the gap of increasing popularity of ST and missing empirical
      evidence of its effectiveness. This aim breaks down into three main research questions
      dealing with (1) general effectiveness of ST measured by multiple operationalizations (i.e.
      depressive symptoms, biological markers, relapse prevention, or need for medication), (2)
      specific effectiveness of ST (i.e. interpersonal problems and emotion regulation), and (3)
      the identification of parameters in the sense of an individualized psychotherapy approach in
      order to fit patient needs with certain psychotherapy offers.

      After participants have given informed consent, they undergo a comprehensive baseline
      measurement which covers psychometric measures (such as questionnaires and clinical ratings),
      biological parameters (blood samples, endocrine activity), neuropsychological testing (such
      as word fluency), and actimetry measures (circadian rhythms).

      After finishing the diagnostic procedure, participants will be randomized to three different
      experimental conditions: (1) a schema therapy condition, (2) a cognitive behavioral therapy
      condition, and (3) an individualized supportive therapy condition. After undergoing a
      comprehensive baseline measurement process in study week one, patients participate in an
      intensive seven-week-treatment-program, in addition to the regular pharmacological treatment,
      which is not object of the study. The measures are repeated during the fourth and seventh
      week of psychotherapeutical treatment and on the occasion of a follow-up visit six months
      after discharge from the clinic.

      Additionally, the investigators test among sub-samples the effects of psychotherapeutical
      interventions on psychophysiological outcomes, sleep-patterns, and neuronal substrates in the
      context of emotional regulation and social interaction.

      Thus, the study will give valuables insights in the effectiveness of an innovative
      psychotherapy approach and breaks new ground in the field of individualized psychotherapy and
      its biological implications.
