  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Longitudinal, observational study to assess the short-term (test re-test) and mid-term
      (within the span of 28 days) repeatability of active anterior rhinomanometry (AAR) measures
      on 4 parallel groups of children with different rhinitis phenotypes, and 1 group of control
      (healthy) children.

      Secondary objectives are: i) assessing of association between AAR, exhaled FeNO (eFeNO) and
      nasal FeNO (nFeNO); ii) assessing association between objective measurements (AAR, eFeNO and
      nFeNO) and subjective measurements (Total 5 Symptom score, T5SS).

      The study is intended to obtain useful information for improving rhinitis management.
