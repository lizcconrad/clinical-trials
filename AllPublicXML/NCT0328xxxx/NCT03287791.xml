      The objectives of this study were to compare the safety and efficacy profiles of a generic
      Azelaic Acid Foam, 15% to the reference listed Finacea® (azelaic acid) Foam, 15% and to
      demonstrate therapeutic equivalence and safety of the two active foams in the treatment of
      moderate facial rosacea, and to demonstrate superiority of the Reference and Test products
      over the Vehicle

      Topical azelaic acid is used to treat inflammatory papules and pustules of mild to moderate
      rosacea. Other topical therapies and oral antibiotics are also used to treat rosacea
      symptoms. Finacea® (azelaic acid) Foam, 15% contains azelaic acid, a naturally occurring
      saturated dicarboxylic acid that has proven anti-inflammatory effects, as well as
      anti-keratinizing and antimicrobial actions.
