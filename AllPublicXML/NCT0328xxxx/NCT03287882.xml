    <textblock>
      The primary aims of this study are: 1) To evaluate the impact of supplementation with
      multiple micronutrients (MMN) from preconception and life skills education among women
      15-18.9 years of age at enrolment on the prevalence of anemia in a population setting; and 2)
      To evaluate the impact of supplementation with MMN from preconception and life skills
      education among young women 15-24 years of age on the rate of low birth weight (LBW) in a
      population setting. Infants born to mothers enrolled in the study will be followed for 1
      year. This study aims to enrol 25,400 non-pregnant young women in Matiari district. This
      sample size is anticipated to equate to 1456 births. Participants will be randomized by
      cluster to receive either MMN supplements and life skills education or the standard of care
      at enrolment. Clusters have been defined based on health facility catchment areas. MMN
      supplements will be provided twice weekly during the preconception period, once daily during
      the pregnancy period, and once daily until 6 months after giving birth during the postpartum
      period; and a package of life skills education materials will be provided bi-monthly during
      the preconception period. In addition to the primary outcomes, measurements will include
      micronutrient status, anthropometrics, birth outcomes, dietary intake and feeding practices,
      adherence, and indices of empowerment.
