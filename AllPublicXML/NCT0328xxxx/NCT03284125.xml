    <textblock>
      The facial paralysis is a frequent disease causing important functionals swallowing
      dysfunctions. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the improvement of the swallowing
      disorders after surgery by lengthening temporalis myoplasty (LTM) in the facial paralysis.

      This prospective study has realised on the following of patients affected by facial paralysis
      treated by LTM. Self-administered questionnaires and clinics tests had realized to analyze
      three components oh the oral phase of the swallowing ( drooling, mastication and handicap).
      The evaluations was realized before the surgery and at 3 and 6 months after .

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Drooling Score equals the sum of the Severity and Frequency sub-scores. the severity sub scores contains five items ( 1= never, 2= mild drooling, 3= moderate drool, 4= severe drool, 5= profuse drool) The frequency sub score contains four items ( 1= no drooling, 2= occasionally, 3=frequently, 4= constant drooling)</description>
