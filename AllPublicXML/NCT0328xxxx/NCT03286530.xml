  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug that may help decrease the chances of relapse after
      Allogeneic Stem Cell transplantation for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. The name of the study drug
      involved in this study is:

      • Ruxolitinib

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ruxolitinib for this
      specific disease but it has been approved for other blood diseases.

      In this research study, investigators are trying to discover if ruxolitinib will decrease
      chances of relapse after having an allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

      Ruxolitinib is a medication that blocks certain proteins called tyrosine kinases.
      Specifically, it blocks tyrosine kinases called JAK2. Many cancers have over active &quot;cell
      signaling.&quot; What this means is that certain functions in the cancer cells never turn off and
      this makes them grow in an uncontrolled way. Ruxolitinib, shuts down the pathway that depends
      on the JAK2 tyrosine kinases. The JAK2 pathway is over active with acute myeloid leukemia.
      Ruxolitinib has also been shown to lower the rates of graft versus host disease, a
      complication of transplant. The exact way ruxolitinib does this is not yet clear but it may
      have to do with its ability to block the JAK2 pathway since this pathway can also lead to
      inflammation in the body.
