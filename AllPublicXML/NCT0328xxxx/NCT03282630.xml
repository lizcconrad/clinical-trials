  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG)-acupuncture has been shown to exhibit distinct effects in
      treatment of nasal inflammatory disease. Investigators aimed to assess the effects of SPG
      acupuncture in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. The randomized, double-blind,
      controlled clinical trial enrolled participants with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to either active SPG-acupuncture group or sham-acupuncture group.
      All participants will be provided four times of acupuncture in 4 weeks, and then follow-up of
      4 week.

      Primary trial outcomes are change in symptoms and change in need for medication. The primary
      outcomes will be measured in baseline, week1, week2, week3, week4, week 6 and week 8.
      Secondary outcomes include the changes in nasal patency (nasal airway resistance and nasal
      cavity volume), exhaled nasal nitric oxide.The investigators also evaluate change in
      neuropeptides (substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide,neuropeptide Y) and inflammatory
      cytokines (interleukin(IL)-4, IL-5, IL-8, IL-17a, IL-22, IL-25, interferon-γ, tumor necrosis
      factor-α, transforming growth factor(TGF)-β1, TGF-β2, TGF-β3,Chemokine, Eotaxin) in nasal
      secretions as secondary outcomes. The secondary outcomes will be measured in baseline, week1,
      week4 and week 8.

    <description>The participants will document the four nasal symptoms (nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itching) involved in assigning the total nasal symptom score(TNSS). The symptoms are graded on a four-point scale (0 = no symptoms; 1 = mild symptoms; 2 = moderate symptoms; 3 = severe symptoms). The weekly TNSS will be calculated and compared between the groups.</description>

    <time_frame>The primary outcomes will be measured in baseline, week1, week2, week3, week4, week 6 and week 8.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked not to use drugs as much as possible. If drugs are used to relieve symptoms, Medication need will be measured using rescue medication score (RMS), comprising the weekly sum of daily assessments.</description>

    <description>Acoustic rhinometry was performed to measure the total nasal cavity volume (cm³) and Rhinomanometer was used to measure the total nasal airway resistance (Pa·cm⁻³·s⁻1) .</description>

    <measure>The change of exhaled nasal nitric oxide</measure>
    <time_frame>The outcomes will be measured in baseline, week1, week4 and week 8.</time_frame>
    <description>The change of exhaled nasal nitric oxide assessed by nitric oxide analyser. A nitric oxide analyser was used to measure exhaled nasal nitric oxide (nNO). Briefly, NO-free air was aspirated through the nasal cavity at a flow rate of 50 ml/s. The subject exhaled against the air-resistance, resulting in an intraoral pressure to close the velum and prevent mixture of oral and nasal gas. Nasal gas from this circuit was continuously routed in part directly into the analyser for determination of nNO, and the level of nNO(ppb) was calculated from a plateau lasting for at least 3s.</description>

    <measure>The change of substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide and neuropeptide Y in nasal secretions</measure>
    <time_frame>The outcomes will be measured in baseline, week1, week4 and week 8.</time_frame>
    <description>The change of substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide and neuropeptide Y in nasal secretions were analysed by Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Nasal secretions were obtained by inserting a postoperative sinus pack in the nasal cavity (acupuncture side) for five minutes. The quantity of secretions was determined by comparing the weight of the sponges before and after insertion and 2 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride solution was added to each sponge. The sponges were stored at 4°C for two hours and the nasal secretions were recovered from the sponges by centrifugation at 1500 g for 15 minutes at 4°C. The supernatants were separated and stored in aliquots at -20°C until further analysis. The levels of substance P(pg/ml), vasoactive intestinal peptide (ng/ml) and neuropeptide Y (pg/ml) were analysed.</description>
