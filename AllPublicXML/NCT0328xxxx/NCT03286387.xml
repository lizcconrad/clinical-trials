  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project is dedicated to development of new paradigms to investigate memory and attention
      in the rich and realistic environments. The investigator will use modern interactive digital
      technologies for encoding complex episodes either using mobile phone technology in everyday
      life or using a virtual reality life-like simulation.

      He aims to characterize the role of the medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex during
      recall of naturalistic episodic experiences, using functional neuroimaging (fMRI) in healthy
      participants. The secondary aim is assess how the allocation of attention during memory
      encoding contribute to mechanisms of the subsequent recall. He will achieve this by
      monitoring gaze direction during encoding and by analyzing the retrieval data as a function
      of the elements that participants attended / fixated during encoding.

      The protocol will involve, first, behavioral testing of memory performance with encoding in
      the real-life or in virtual reality, followed by the main hypothesis testing phase when fMRI
      will be used to measure brain activity during retrieval.

    <description>After spatial preprocessing of individual series of EPI fMRI images, normalization and smoothing as suggested for SPM analysis, the successful and failed contextual recall will be modeled and convolved with canonical HRF function. The GLM will be estimated according to the algorithm of SPM, the significance threshold will be p&lt;0.05 FWE within the regions of interest. Our hypothesis will be confirmed by activation of medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex in contextual recall, congruent contextual cueing and recall of episodes when targets were semantically congruent with the context at encoding.</description>

    <description>The gaze direction during both during episodic encoding and recall. We will estimate a correlation between the activation of medial temporal lobe/ prefrontal cortex and the similarity of the gaze fixations during encoding and retrieval. A positive correlation will support our hypothesis about the link between attention and contextual encoding.</description>

    <description>During the fMRI protocol, the subject will perform the retrieval tasks while whole-brain activity will be recorded using Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) that measures the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal (2x2x2 isotropic voxels, Echo Time (TE) = 30 ms, Repetition Time (TR) = 2.5 sec). The functional session will be subdivided into several parts (&quot;Runs&quot;, duration: 10-15 min). Together with the functional data, the protocol will include a structural scan (T1 weighted, 1x1x1 mm voxels; duration 5-7 min) and a field mapping sequence (duration: 1 min).</description>
