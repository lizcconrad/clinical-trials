  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project is a population-based case-only study of
      over 2,000 men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer designed to address racial differences in
      prostate cancer aggressiveness and survival through a comprehensive evaluation of social,
      individual, and tumor level influences on prostate cancer aggressiveness. Project 3
      specifically aims to examine nutritional modulation of prostate cancer aggressiveness using
      dietary assessment and biomarker-based data on dietary factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 2,258 (1,130 African Americans and 1128 European Americans) men newly diagnosed
      with prostate cancer in North Carolina and Louisiana were enrolled into the study between
      2004 and 2009. Participants signed informed consent and were interviewed by a trained nurse
      who collected information on demographics, occupation, family history, health status, health
      care, prostate cancer diagnosis and screening history, medication use, anthropometrics,
      lifestyle factors (e.g., physical activity, smoking), and diet and supplement use. Research
      subjects were asked to recall their diet in the year prior to prostate cancer diagnosis via a
      modified version of the National Cancer Institute Diet History Questionnaire. Vitamin and
      supplement use in the year prior to prostate cancer diagnosis was assessed via a validated
      questionnaire, and current use was assessed by bottle label inventory. Blood, urine, and
      adipose tissue samples were collected.
