  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to develop and validate a prediction score of chronic renal disease occurrence
      within 3 years after ICU discharge in patients who suffered an acute kidney failure during
      ICU stay and recovered normal renal function at 90 days following their discharge.

      The primary study outcome is the incidence of chronic renal disease within the first 3 years
      after ICU discharge, defined by a lower glomerular filtration rate (GFR) under 60
      mL/minute/1.73m2.

      As second objectives, the study aims to:

        -  Evaluate the GFR decline in patients who had an underlying chronic kidney disease.

        -  Evaluate factors associated with a persistent decreased GFR at day-90.

        -  Characterization the clinical and biological phenotype of chronic renal disease in these
           patients.

        -  Evaluate treatments provided to these patients according to CKD occurence.

        -  Evaluate the rate of cardiovascular and thrombo-embolic morbidity-mortality.

        -  Assess the quality of life every year for 3 years.

        -  Evaluate the medico-economic burden of CKD.
