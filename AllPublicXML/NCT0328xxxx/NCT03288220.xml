      Background:

      When people have a stroke, they often have difficulty moving their arms and hands.
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can improve how well people with and without stroke
      can move their arms and hands. But the effects of TMS are minor, and it doesn t work for
      everyone. Researchers want to study how to time brain stimulation so that the effects are
      more consistent.

      Objective:

      To understand how the brain responds to transcranial magnetic stimulation so that treatments
      for people with stroke can be improved.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18 and older who had a stroke at least 6 months ago

      Healthy volunteers ages 18 and older

      Design:

      Participants will have up to 5 visits.

      At visit 1, participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam.
      Participants with stroke will also have TMS and surface electromyography (sEMG).

      For TMS, a brief electrical current will pass through a wire coil on the scalp. Participants
      may hear a click and feel a pull. Muscles may twitch. Participants may be asked to do simple
      movements during TMS.

      For sEMG, small electrodes will be attached to the skin and muscle activity will be recorded.

      At visit 2, participants will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They will lie on a table
      that slides into a metal cylinder in a strong magnetic field. They will get earplugs for the
      loud noise.

      At visit 3, participants will have TMS, sEMG, and electroencephalography (EEG). For EEG,
      small electrodes on the scalp will record brainwaves. Participants will sit still, watch a
      movie, or do TMS.

      Participants may be asked to have 2 extra visits to redo procedures.

      OBJECTIVE: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a potential adjunct therapy for
      post-stroke neurorehabilitation. So far, it has been customarily applied uncoupled from brain
      oscillatory activity (as measured using EEG waveforms), resulting in variability in the
      biological response to each stimulus, small effect sizes and significant inter-individual
      variability. Brain oscillatory activity (i.e., EEG waveform oscillatory activity) in the
      alpha band (8-12 Hz) is linked to cortical inhibition, motor function and cognitive
      processing, and therefore influences brain function. For example, corticospinal excitability
      (as measured with TMS) in healthy humans varies depending on the sensorimotor alpha
      oscillatory phase during which TMS is delivered: corticospinal excitability is higher when
      TMS is delivered during sensorimotor alpha oscillation troughs (i.e., maximum surface
      negativity) and lower when TMS is delivered during sensorimotor alpha oscillation peaks
      (i.e., maximum surface positivity). Here, we will first attempt replication of this result
      using closed-loop TMS in young healthy adults (Experiment 1). Subsequently, we aim to extend
      these findings to two new populations: healthy older adults (Experiment 2), and patients with
      chronic stroke (Experiment 3). Previous studies have demonstrated that older adults exhibit
      significant differences in motor cortical physiology compared to young adults, so Experiment
      2 will be performed to determine whether a similar association between sensorimotor alpha
      oscillatory phase and corticospinal excitability is present in healthy aging. Finally,
      Experiment 3 will be performed to determine if the expected association between sensorimotor
      alpha oscillatory phase and corticospinal excitability is also present after chronic stroke.
      Importantly, acquiring information regarding how the aged and damaged brain respond to EEG
      waveform oscillation-dependent closed-loop TMS will be critical for developing more effective
      TMS-based (i.e., closed-loop) interventions. In all experiments, TMS delivery will be timed
      to specific sensorimotor alpha oscillation phases. We expect the results of this work to
      provide new insights into how corticospinal excitability is affected by sensorimotor alpha
      oscillation phase, which could lead to more effective use of sensorimotor alpha
      oscillation-dependent neuromodulatory TMS protocols in the future.

      STUDY POPULATION: Up to 24 young healthy volunteers (ages 18-59), up to 24 older healthy
      volunteers (ages 60 and older), and up to 26 stroke patients (age 18 and older).

      DESIGN: Each experiment will begin with MRI to allow for co-registration with a frameless
      stereotactic device for the precise targeting of TMS. In Experiment 1, healthy young adults
      will receive single-pulse, closed-loop TMS to the motor cortex hand area (M1-hand) during
      sensorimotor alpha oscillation (a) troughs (i.e., maximum surface negativity), (b) peaks
      (i.e., maximum surface positivity), and (c) uncoupled from sensorimotor alpha oscillation
      phase (as measured with EEG) using a within-subject design. In Experiment 2, healthy older
      adults will complete the same procedures described for Experiment 1. In Experiment 3, chronic
      stroke patients will also complete the same procedures described for Experiment 1, except
      that TMS will be delivered to the ipsilesional M1-hand. For each experiment, up to 700
      single-pulse TMS pulses will be delivered (excluding pulses used to identify scalp hotspot
      and resting motor threshold), and all subjects will be given rest breaks as needed.

      OUTCOME MEASURES: For all experiments, the primary outcome measure is corticospinal
      excitability. The secondary outcome measure is effective intracortical connectivity between
      M1 and the rest of the brain. Exploratory outcome measures include MEP amplitude variability,
      TMS-induced oscillations, and resting state EEG brain connectivity.
