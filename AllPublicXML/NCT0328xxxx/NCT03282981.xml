  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One in four Veterans is affected by diabetes and will develop a diabetic foot ulcer. Diabetic
      ulcers are very challenging to manage and are the most common cause of leg amputation. Many
      advanced treatments are expensive and difficult to use in the clinic or at home. Those newer
      therapies have shown little success in healing diabetic foot wounds. The investigators'
      laboratory and animal work has suggested that a safe medication, currently used as an eye
      drop for treatment of glaucoma, can heal these ulcers. The investigators are proposing to
      test this drop (timolol) directly on the surface of the foot ulcer to see if can improve
      healing faster than the current standard of care. To do this, the investigators propose a
      &quot;randomized controlled trial&quot; with two groups of patients with diabetic foot ulcers: one will
      receive standard of care with timolol while the other will receive standard of care with a
      gel (hydrogel, as placebo medicine).

                  system at randomization). The ulcer with largest surface area meeting inclusion
                  criteria will be selected as index ulcer

               -  If two ulcers present with the same surface area, the ulcer of the longest
                  duration will be selected as index ulcer

          -  Documented Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) between 0.8 and 1.2 on the study limb or toe
             pressure over 65mmHg
