    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine if a behavioral intervention targeting maternal
      caregiving of young infants can increase infant sleep and reduce fuss/cry behavior, and
      thereby (1) reduce the incidence and/or severity of postpartum maternal depression and (2)
      improve the quality of the mother-infant interaction and subsequent child development.
      Specifically, the study team will investigate: (1) the effectiveness of the intervention
      compared to usual care; (2) if the effects of the intervention can be detected in the
      assessments of the quality of mother-infant interaction; (3) if there are prenatal and/or
      postnatal biomarkers that can help identify infants whose behavior is more likely to play a
      role in their mothers' depression; (4) if these markers differentiate which infants will be
      most responsive to the intervention(s); and (5), if assessments of brain function at birth
      and at 4-6 weeks of age provide biological nodal points for identifying the effects of the
      intervention on infant brain development. Participants will be recruited during their 2nd
      trimester, and will be randomly separated into one of two groups: a group that receives
      coaching in parenting techniques (4 in-person coaching sessions and 1 phone session) or one
      that receives treatment as usual.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Of the nearly 4 million mothers delivering live births each year in the United States,
      approximately 560,000 — or 14% — will develop major or minor depression within the first four
      months postpartum, when the rate peaks. This number dwarfs prevalence rates for gestational
      diabetes (2-5%) and is comparable to preterm birth (11.4%). Postpartum depression (PPD) has
      substantial consequences: poorer maternal quality of life, significant emotional suffering,
      and suicide risk. PPD predicts diminished mother-infant bonding, and poor outcomes in
      social-emotional and, in some groups, cognitive development. PPD is undertreated in part
      because women are reluctant to seek treatment due to the stigma associated with mental health
      care, logistical barriers to at-tending added health care appointments, and disinclination to
      take medications while breastfeeding. Of preventive interventions, few embed services in
      obstetrical care or leverage the unique mother-infant dyadic orientation of the childbearing
      period. The investigators developed a novel intervention based on the conceptualization of
      maternal depression as a potential disorder of the mother-infant dyad, and one that can be
      approached through psychological and behavioral changes in the mother — commencing before
      birth — that affect her and the child. PREPP (Practical Resources for Effective Postpartum
      Parenting) enrolls distressed pregnant women at risk for PPD, spans late pregnancy to the 6
      week postpartum check up, comprises four in-person 'coaching' sessions adjunctive to
      obstetrical (OB) prenatal and postnatal appointments, one phone session, and imparts (a)
      mindfulness and self-reflection skills, (b) parenting skills, and (c) psycho-education.

      caregiving of young infants can increase infant sleep and reduce fuss/cry behavior, and

      improve the quality of the mother-infant interaction and subsequent child development.
