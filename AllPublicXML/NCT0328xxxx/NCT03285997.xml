      If study subject's legal guardians who decide voluntarily to participate the clinical trial,
      and sign the Informed Consent Formed, study subjects eligible for participating this trial
      protocol were assigned to test group or control group with the ratio of 4:1 and receiving the
      test or control drug 1 time or 2 times.

      1. Part 1 If study subject's legal guardians who decide voluntarily to participate the
           clinical trial, and sign the Informed Consent Form, study subjects eligible for
           participating this trial protocol were assigned to test group and receiving the test
           drug 1 time or 2 times.

        2. Part 2 If study subject's legal guardians who decide voluntarily to participate the
           clinical trial, and sign the Informed Consent Formed, study subjects eligible for
           participating this trial protocol were assigned to test group or control group with the
           ratio of 4:1 and receiving the test or control drug 1 time or 2 times.

      The investigator will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the test product while clinical
      trial.

      Blood samples will be collected at visit 1 and visit 5 for immunogenicity evaluation. The
      study subject and their legal guardians will be educated to daily record AEs after
      vaccination on the patient diary to evaluate the safety.

      At visit1, blood samples will be collected from randomized study subjects and investigational
      drug will be intramuscularly injected. However, those who had not been vaccinated with
      influenza vaccine, will re-visit and have the 2nd vaccination, 4~5 weeks after the 1st
      vaccination.

      After 4~5 weeks since last vaccination, study subjects will visit and blood sample will be
      collected. And the serious adverse events occurred during 180 days after the final
      vaccination will be checked through the telephone visit.

      The study subjects with 1 dose of vaccine will have 4 visits including Visit 1~2 and Visit
      5~6. The study subjects with 2 dose of vaccine will have 6 visits including Visit 3~4.
