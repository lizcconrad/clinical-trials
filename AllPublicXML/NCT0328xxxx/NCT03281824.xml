    <textblock>
      This open-label study assessed the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      ALT-P7(HM2-Drug Conjugate) in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have
      progressed on previous Trastuzumab-based therapy. Patients received ALT-P7(0.3 mg/kg~5.4
      mg/kg, 7 groups) intravenously on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle.
