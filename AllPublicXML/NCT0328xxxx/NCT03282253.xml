  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investgatiors aimed to investigate the associations between serum levels
      of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1（SCD-1） and the disease severity as well as the presence of
      adverse clinical events, such as local complications, organ failure, mortality and so on.In
      this prospective study, participants were divided into two groups based on serum SCD-1
      concentration on admission and prospectively observe the disease severity and clinical
      outcomes of them.
