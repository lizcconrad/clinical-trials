  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to show that bifocal tDCS with an anodal stimulation on the orbitofrontal
      cortex and cathodic stimulation on supplementary motor areas is an effective treatment for
      patients with resistant and severe obsessive compulsive disorders.
