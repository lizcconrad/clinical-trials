    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of VAY736 administered subcutaneously
      (s.c.) every 4 weeks for 48 weeks. Approximately, 84 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1

             for 3 months prior to screening, during dosing, and for 4 months after stopping of
             investigational medication.

        Highly effective contraception methods include:

          -  Total abstinence from heterosexual intercourse (when this is in line with the
             preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient). Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar,
             ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable
             methods of contraception.

          -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
             hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking
             investigational drug. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status
             of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

          -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on the
             study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject.

          -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault
             caps). For UK: with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository

          -  Use of oral (estrogen and progesterone), injected or implanted hormonal methods of
             contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system
             (IUS) or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure
             rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception. In
             case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a
             minimum of 3 months before taking investigational drug.

        Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12
        months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age
        appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy
        (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks
        ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
        been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing
        potential.
