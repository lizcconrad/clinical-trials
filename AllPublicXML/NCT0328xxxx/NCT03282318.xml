    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate efficacy, safety and tolerability of ASP6294 in
      female participants with Bladder Pain Syndrome/Interstitial Cystitis (BPS/IC). This study
      will also investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ASP6294 in
      female participants with BPS/IC.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in average mean daily pain (MDP) at Visit 6/Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will record participant's MDP each day in the evening into an e-diary. The MDP is the average pain experienced over the past 24 hours. MDP is measured using the 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS), (0-10) with 0 being no bladder pain and 10 being the worst possible pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in average worst daily pain (WDP) at Visit 6/Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will record participant's WDP each day in the evening into an e-diary. The WDP is the worst pain experienced over the past 24 hours. WDP is measured using the 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS), (0-10) with 0 being no bladder pain and 10 being the worst possible pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in mean voiding frequency at Visit 6/Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The mean voiding frequency is the mean of the recordings of voiding frequency in the 3 day electronic micturition diary in the week prior to the visit, with at least 2 days recorded in that week.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in mean number of level 3 or 4 urgency episodes (using the PPIUS) per 24 hours as assessed with the 3 day electronic micturition diary within the week preceding the study visit, at Visit 6/Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The patient perception of intensity of urgency scale (PPIUS) is a 5-point categorical scale and has a range from 0-4. 0 meaning &quot;No urgency, I felt no need to empty my bladder, but did so for other reasons.&quot; and 4 meaning &quot;Urge incontinence, I leaked before arriving to the toilet.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of the Global Response Assessment (GRA) at Visit 6/Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The GRA is self-reported and is a 7 grade GRA used to evaluate a participant's clinical condition relative to Baseline. The GRA reads: As compared to when the participant started the study, how would the participant rate the participant's overall symptoms now? The 7 GRA grades are &quot;markedly worse&quot;, &quot;moderately worse&quot;, &quot;slightly worse&quot;, &quot;no change&quot;, &quot;slightly improved&quot;, &quot;moderately improved&quot; or &quot;markedly improved&quot;. A successful GRA response is defined as the scores &quot;moderately improved&quot; or &quot;markedly improved&quot; disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Bladder Pain/ Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Score (BPIC-SS) at Visit 6/Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The BPIC-SS is a psychometrically validated and reliable questionnaire with 8 questions concerning bladder pain over the previous 7 days. The BPIC-SS addresses urinary symptoms in 5 questions, all rated 0 - 4 (how often urinated because of pain, need to urinate just after previous urination, urination to avoid pain, pressure in the bladder and pain in the bladder), 2 questions address the impact of bladder pain (bothered by frequent urination during daytime and nighttime) and ends with a 0 - 10 NRS on worst pain over the last 7 days with 0 being no bladder pain and 10 being the worst possible pain. The total score will range from 0 to 38 with higher scores representing a worse situation, with a score of 19 or more indicating moderate/severe disease activity. Question 8 from the BPIC-SS is the question on worst bladder pain over the last 7 days on a 0-10 point NRS.</description>

               -  subject has genital tract condition or pelvic pathology (e.g., post-partum,
                  post-pelvic surgery, post-hysterectomy) that may complicate diagnosis and the
                  evaluation of pelvic pain and urinary symptoms. Note: A history of a Cesarean
                  section is not a reason for exclusion.

               -  subject has a known currently symptomatic bladder or ureteral calculi.

               -  subject currently has cystitis (radiation cystitis, Bacillus
                  Calmette-Guérin-induced cystitis, bacterial/tuberculous cystitis,

                  prior to the screening visit.

               -  subject has a known current neurologic disease or a defect affecting urinary
                  bladder function (e.g., neurogenic bladder, systemic or central neurological
                  disease, such as Multiple Sclerosis or Parkinson's disease).

               -  subject has a known current lower urinary tract malignancy. In case of positive

                  last 6 months and malignancy has been adequately ruled out by the investigator
                  according to local diagnostic procedures, the subject does not have to be

             except for curative treated localized non-melanoma skin cancer (e.g. basal cell or

          -  Subject has a known current psychiatric condition, mental incapacity, language barrier
             or the inability to read that would impair the subject's successful participation in
             the study.

          -  Result of the Visit 1/Screening serum pregnancy test is positive.

          -  Results of the Visit 1/Screening blood/urine samples indicate that the subject has
             clinically significant abnormal biochemistry, hematology or urinalysis safety
             laboratory values.
