  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An multi-stage mixed-method design will be employed to obtain both qualitative and
      quantitative data to address two study aims: (1) Evaluate and refine the delivery Reducing
      Disabilities in Alzheimer's Disease (RD- AD) training to advanced practice nurses and (2)
      Evaluate and refine the implementation of RD-AD by advanced practice nurses in their medical
      settings.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two waves of APNs (25 each wave/total 50) will receive RDAD training and be queried pre and
      post- training using both qualitative and quantitative procedures to determine: (1) Is RDAD
      training successfully received by advanced practice nurses? (2) Do they report it as relevant
      to improving the care they deliver to persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias
      (ADRD)? (3) Does RDAD training of advanced practice nurses improve their level of knowledge
      about ADRD, their skills in providing ADRD care, and their level of confidence in providing
      this care?

      A subset of advanced practice nurses (5 per wave, total of 10) will be recruited to implement
      RDAD as part of their ongoing care of persons with ADRD.
