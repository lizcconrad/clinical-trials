    <textblock>
      This study is carried out to find out the safety and recommended dose of CD137L-DC-EBV-VAX in
      nasopharyngeal cancer. CD137L-DC-EBV-VAX is a product made from one of our own immune system
      cells (dendritic cell, DC). Dendritic cells are immune cells that help to stimulate our
      body's T lymphocytes to fight cancer by presenting specific proteins from the cancer cells.
      The investigators have developed in the laboratory a highly effective dendritic cell which is
      primed to activate T cells with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) proteins. It is hoped that this
      will stir an immune response to recognize NPC cells and kill them as part of body's immune
      surveillance system.

      This study will involve two cohorts of patients, A and B. Patients are invited because they
      have either (A) locally recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer; or (B) stage 4 locally
      advanced nasopharyngeal cancer (N2 or N3 disease and/or T4) and is known to be associated
      with a high risk of distant relapse.

    <description>This cohort consists of patients with metastatic or locally recurrent NPC who have received systemic concurrent chemotherapy and have a favourable response of stable disease, partial or complete response. As up to 30% of these patients will suffer from relapse within 5 months of completion of chemotherapy, following definitive treatment, y, and treatment with CD137L-DC-EBV-VAX may activate T cell response against the tumor and prolong time to progression.</description>

          -  Prior investigational agents ≤ 4 weeks prior to registration.

          -  Known allergy to Tetanus and/or Diphtheria toxoid.

          -  Known brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. NOTE: symptomatic, and/or if they

             treated brain metastases who are deemed clinically stable and without radiological
             progression on PET, MRI or CT scan performed ≤ 8 weeks of study entry, are not
             excluded. NOTE: Primary nasopharyngeal cancers that directly invade the skull base and

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac

                  contraception

          -  Active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might recur, which may
             affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment including systemic
             corticosteroids. NOTE: These include but are not limited to patients with a history of
             immune related neurologic disease, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating)
             neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia gravis; systemic autoimmune disease
             such as SLE, connective tissue diseases, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease
             (IBD), Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, hepatitis; and patients with a history of toxic
             epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome should
             be excluded because of the risk of recurrence or exacerbation of disease. Patients
             with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies including thyroiditis managed with replacement
             hormones including physiologic corticosteroids are eligible. Patients with rheumatoid
             arthritis and other arthropathies, Sjögren's syndrome and psoriasis controlled with
             topical medication and patients with positive serology, such as antinuclear antibodies
             (ANA), anti-thyroid antibodies should be evaluated for the presence of target organ
             involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but should otherwise be
             eligible.

          -  Patients are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus,
             residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone
             replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to
             recur in the absence of an external trigger (precipitating event).

          -  Condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily
             prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study
             drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &lt;10 mg
             daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune
             disease. Patients are permitted to use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal,
             and inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Physiologic
             replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids are permitted, even if &lt;10 mg/day
             prednisone equivalents. A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g.,
             contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g.,
             delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted.
