  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of AUTO3 a CAR T cell treatment
      targeting CD19 and CD22 followed by limited duration of consolidation with anti-PD1 antibody
      in patients with DLBCL
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 2 phases, a Phase I or dose escalation phase and a Phase II or
      expansion phase. Patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL will be enrolled in both phases
      of the study. Eligible patients will undergo leukapheresis in order to harvest T cells, which
      is the starting material for the manufacture of the autologous CAR T product AUTO3 which is a
      CD19 and CD22 dual targeting CAR T cell product. Following pre-conditioning by a
      chemotherapeutic regimen, the patient will receive AUTO 3 intravenously as a single dose
      following which they will receive limited duration of consolidation therapy with an anti-PD1
      antibody and will then enter a 24-month follow-up period
