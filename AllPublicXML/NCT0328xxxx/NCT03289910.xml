  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well topotecan hydrochloride and carboplatin with
      or without veliparib work in treating patients with myeloproliferative disorders that have
      spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment,
      and acute myeloid leukemia or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as topotecan hydrochloride and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping
      them from spreading. Veliparib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving topotecan hydrochloride, carboplatin, and veliparib
      may work better in treating patients with myeloproliferative disorders and acute myeloid
      leukemia or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the compare the complete response/complete response with incomplete recovery
      (CR/CRi) rate of induction therapy with topotecan hydrochloride (topotecan)/carboplatin (T/C)
      with or without veliparib (V) or placebo (P) in myeloproliferative disorder associated
      leukemias and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate and compare the toxicities of T/C/V versus (vs.) T/C/placebo. II. To compare
      the 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in response to T/C/V vs.
      T/C/placebo.

      III. To detect and compare the presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) remaining after
      T/C/V vs. T/C/placebo.

      IV. Evaluate predictive biomarkers of response via assessment of pretreatment impaired
      homologous recombination via assessment of: next generation sequencing (NGS) panel for genes
      mutated in myeloid malignancies done as standard of care per institution; functional
      impairment of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage response via assessment of pretreatment
      samples radiation-induced RAD51 foci; topotecan-induced stabilization of topoisomerase I-DNA
      covalent complexes, which has recently been observed to be a critical predictor of response
      to combination of a topoisomerase I poison and PARP inhibitor in xenografts.

      V. To evaluate veliparib exposure and contribution to response (efficacy and toxicity).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 and topotecan
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) continuously over 24 hours and carboplatin IV continuously
      over 24 hours on days 3-7. Treatment repeats every 28-63 days for up to 3 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride and carboplatin as in Arm A. Patients also
      receive placebo PO BID on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28-63 days for up to 3 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

    <description>Will be reported at the end of the study separately for Arm A and Arm B with exact binomial 95% confidence intervals. The final analysis will be by a multivariable logistic regression model for the probability of response as a function of treatment arm, blast count group, and prior therapy status, which tests for an overall treatment difference while adjusting for disease subgroup.
