    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine therapy
      works in reducing high-grade cervical lesions in patients with human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV) and HPV. Vaccines made from HPV peptides or antigens may help the body build an
      effective immune response to kill the HPV virus and prevent cervical lesions from developing
      or coming back after being removed.

      At screening, potential participants will be tested for cervical human papillomavirus (HPV)
      infection (GeneXpert hrHPV assay and HPV DNA PCR) and undergo cervical colposcopy to confirm
      the absence of cervical cancer. If eligible, the participant will be randomized to receive
      either the 9-valent HPV vaccine or saline placebo.

      Participants will return 4 and 26 weeks later for the second dose of vaccine or placebo. At
      week 4, participants will have cervical colposcopy and undergo cryotherapy or loop
      electrosurgical excisional procedure (LEEP) as appropriate. Participants undergoing cervical
      cryotherapy will have cervical biopsies before the treatment. Participants will be followed
      with HPV testing (Gene Xpert and HPV DNA PCR) at weeks 26, 52, 78, and 104, and will have
      cervical cytology and colposcopy with biopsies at weeks 26, 52, and 104.
