  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the combination VS-6063, carboplatin, and
      paclitaxel. in the treatment of patients with ovarian cancer. The study will evaluate whether
      this regimen is safe. The study will also evaluate whether the regimen can reduce the amount
      of cancerous cells in your body. If you agree, you will be treated with VS-6063 by mouth, as
      well as carboplatin and paclitaxel infusions. Carboplatin and paclitaxel are approved by the
      FDA for the treatment of ovarian cancer. VS-6063 is considered experimental because it is not
      approved by the FDA for the treatment of cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal
             carcinoma, diagnosed within 6 months of completing their most recent
             platinum-containing chemotherapy.

             cytostatic) agents include (but are not limited to) hormones, monoclonal antibodies,

             UTI).

          -  Any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least one
             week prior to registration.

          -  Platinum-refractory ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma.

          -  Known second primary or prior malignancy diagnosed within 5 years of study start date

             discontinued at least three weeks prior to registration.
