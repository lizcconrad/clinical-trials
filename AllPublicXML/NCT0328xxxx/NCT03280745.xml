  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Volume replacement strategies and type of fluid used in patients undergoing
      cardiac surgery have changed during the last years. Currently used crystalloid solutes have a
      variable composition and a major impact on organ function and outcome. Additionally
      critically ill patients are prone to fluid overload, which is despite common perception, not
      a benign occurrence as it is associated with prolonged ICU- and hospital length of stay and
      increased mortality rates. Fluid resuscitation using bolus or continuous infusion of
      hypertonic saline was used for more than thirty years. Only a few studies have been conducted
      so far, but they showed that infusion of hypertonic saline results in less volume
      administered, increased renal function less weight gain in critically ill patients when
      compared to other crystalloids.

      Aim: This preliminary randomized controlled double-blind study aims to identify whether fluid
      resuscitation using hypertonic saline (HS) when used in addition to lactated Ringers solution
      results in less total fluid amount administered in patients following cardiac surgery.
      Additionally we want to evaluate whether the use of hypertonic saline results less need for
      pharmacological cardiocirculatory support, increased renal function, less postoperative
      volume overload shortened post-cardiac bypass immune suppression and increased postoperative
      outcomes.

      Study intervention: At admission to the ICU patients will receive 5ml/kg body weight of 7.3%
      NaCl or 0.9% NaCl by infusion pump over 60 minutes. If necessary, fluid resuscitation will
      thereafter be performed with Ringer`s lactate to normalize peripheral perfusion and to allow
      weaning of vasopressors.
