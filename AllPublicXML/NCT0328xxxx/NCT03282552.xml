    <textblock>
      High flow oxygen therapy has been applied after extubation in cardiac surgery patients with
      uncertain efficacy. The current authors plan to conduct a prospective, randomized, controlled
      study of nasal high flow therapy (NHF) application with high (60L/min) or low flow (40L/min)
      oxygen mixture administration versus standard oxygen treatment (Venturi mask) after
      extubation of patients undergoing elective or non-elective cardiac surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, nasal high flow (NHF) has been introduced for oxygen therapy in adults.
      Its indications have been expanded, especially in cases of acute hypoxemic respiratory
      failure.

      The device consists of an air/oxygen blender connected via an active heated humidifier to a
      nasal cannula, through a single limb, heated inspiratory circuit. It delivers a fraction of
      inspired oxygen (FiO2) from 21% to 100% with a flow rate up to 60 L/min. FiO2 adjustments are
      independent of the set flow rate so that the patient is given heated, humidified high-flow
      oxygen, with a flow that can be adjusted above the patient's maximum inspiratory flow rate,
      thereby increasing confidence about the actual FiO2 being delivered to the patient. These
      device characteristics make it more promising in comparison with conventional low- and
      high-flow oxygen devices (e.g., nasal cannula, non-rebreathing masks, Venturi masks),
      especially in patients with high inspiratory flow rates, such as patients with acute
      respiratory failure (ARF).

      The benefits arising from application of oxygen with high flow rates via NHF are

        1. reduction in the entrainment of room air and thus ensuring higher and more stable FiO2
           values,

        2. generation of positive airway pressures during expiration as a result of the expiratory
           resistance imposed to the patient's exhalation against the continuous high flow of
           incoming oxygen gas,

        3. improving mucociliary function and clearance of secretion by continuous heating and
           humidifying of the administered gas,

        4. reducing dead space ventilation and

        5. reducing work of breathing. All the aforementioned NHF mechanisms of actions exert
           various effects on the respiratory system, including improved gas exchange, lower
           respiratory rate and effort and improved lung mechanics which are correlated with more
           comfort and less subjective dyspnea.

      Respiratory complications after cardiac surgery can affect morbidity and mortality, and
      increase the healthcare cost. Advanced age, duration of extracorporeal circulation, history
      of significant underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease and phrenic nerve injury are the main
      prognostic factors for post cardiac surgery respiratory complications.

      Traditionally, low- and high-flow oxygen systems are used to reverse postsurgical respiratory
      complications with or without addition of continuous (CPAP) or bi-level (NIV) positive airway
      pressure.

      NHF might be superior for the prevention or treatment of those respiratory complications,
      since it can provide high-flow of heated and hydrated oxygen while the positive airway
      pressure created by the high gas flow can recruit alveoli and increase the end-expiratory
      lung volume.

      Studies applying NHF immediately after extubation in cardiac surgery patients revealed better
      oxygenation and less need for advanced methods of respiratory support compared to
      conventional oxygen devices , and similar results compared to noninvasive ventilation.
      However, Zochios et al, summarized all the available up to date data of NHF compared to
      conventional oxygen devices and non-invasive ventilation in patients undergoing
      cardiothoracic surgery and they did not find any further benefit by NHF use. The
      aforementioned discrepancy could be explained by the differences in the studied populations
      and NHF flow settings. The proposed initial flow rate differs among the studies, with some
      authors suggesting initial lower flows (35-40 L/min) that will be better tolerated by the
      patients and others suggesting initial maximal flows (60 L/min) to rapidly relieve dyspnea
      and prevent muscle fatigue.

      Aim The primary goal of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of NHF versus conventional
      oxygen systems on respiratory parameters (respiratory rate, pO2/ FiO2, spO2, use of accessory
      muscles, dyspnoea, comfort and tolerance by using the visual analogue scale) immediately
      after the extubation of cardiac surgery patients.

      The secondary goals of the study is to compare two different initial NHF flows of 60 L/min
      and 40 L/min, ICU Length of Stay, Hospital Length of Stay, rates of ICU re-admission and
      re-intubation and any other respiratory / non-respiratory complications and adverse events.
      Moreover, the rate of failure of the initial treatment will be recorded.

      Method

      This is a prospective, non-blinded, randomized study in post-extubated cardiac surgery
      patients. The study population will consist of three patient groups:

      The first group (Study Group 1) will include patients on NHF with initial settings of
      FiO2=60% and gas flow=60L/min.

      The second group (Study Group 2) will include patients on NHF with initial settings of
      FiO2=60% and gas flow=40L/min In the third group (control group) all patients will receive
      oxygen therapy according to the standard practice of our cardiac ICU department, i.e.,
      Venturi mask with FiO2=60% and flow of 15L/min.

      Patients in both study groups would be weaned off the NHF as follows; First reducing FiO2
      gradually to 50% , and then gradually reducing the gas flow (either from 60l/min or 40/min,
      depending on the study group) down to 30l/min, aiming at the final wean-off goal of 20l/min,
      if possible.

      Treatment failure will be defined as any crossover from one treatment to another due to
      patient's respiratory distress and discomfort. To be more specific, switch of gas flow from
      40L/min to 60L/min, crossover from either NHF group to standard practice (Venturi mask) or
      need for more advanced respiratory support such as non-invasive ventilation or invasive
      mechanical ventilation.

      Any implemented treatment would also be defined as &quot;failure&quot; when any FiO2 escalation &gt; 60%
      might be needed, either it is being recorded on Study group 1 &amp; 2 or Control group.
