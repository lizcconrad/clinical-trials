  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an online acceptance-based
      behavioural treatment for chronic pain designed for military, police, and veteran
      populations. Participants will be randomized into either the treatment condition, or the
      wait-list control condition, and asked to complete a battery of measures which underscore the
      key facets of the fear-avoidance model of chronic pain. The pre, post, and follow-up measure
      scores will be analyzed through the means of a 2 x 3 mixed model ANOVA which will assess the
      magnitude of changes between the treatment and wait-list control groups. The results will
      assist in establishing the effectiveness of the novel online treatment.

      This study is an extension of a pilot study that was conducted investigating an online
      acceptance-based behavioural therapy (ABBT) for chronic pain. The online treatment runs for a
      total of 8 weeks and includes interactive content to promote the participant's engagement
      with the treatment material. The treatment has been specifically tailored for military,
      police and veteran populations as it uses language and audio vignettes to which military,
      police and veteran individuals can easily relate. Based on promising results from a pilot
      study conducted using the online ABBT program, the investigators will be conducting a
      randomized control trial (RCT) of the treatment by randomly allocating participants into
      either a treatment group, or a wait-list control group. By comparing differences in the
      changes between the group's pre-post-and follow-up means on various pain and pain-related
      measures, insight will be gained on the utility of the treatment and the justification of its
      use. Clients who are new to the participating clinic participate in an intake appointment
      with the clinic's intake nurse, and during this appointment are informed about the different
      research projects currently being run at the clinic. Participants interested in the study
      will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria during their intake appointment. For
      this study, all eligible participants will be asked to complete an informed consent form
      prior to being issued a unique password and user ID for access to the online portion of the
      treatment. A treatment fidelity plan and data safety monitoring plan have been established to
      ensure treatment procedures remain consistent across groups, and that data integrity is
      monitored over the duration of the study. The treatment program is an eight module (8-week)
      ABBT for chronic pain. The online treatment material is administered via the WebCAPSI Therapy
      program. This is an online password-protected program which allows participants to progress
      through the treatment modules at their own pace. Each module is designed to cover a specific
      component of ABBT and will facilitate understanding of the components through audio files,
      veteran, military and RCMP-specific vignettes, text-based material, and homework
      exercises/assignments. Each module is designed to be completed in 60 minutes or less and
      participants have the option to return to the program and the modules as often as they like
      during the course of the treatment period. On the completion of each module, and facilitated
      through the WebCAPSI Therapy program, the participants are asked to complete a homework
      exercise to which they answer questions previously encountered throughout the module. The
      principle therapist responds to each homework exercise within 24-hours of its online
      submission, with feedback and encouragement. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted
      by randomly allocating participants into either the treatment or wait-list control group.
      Given the nature of the treatment and size of our clinic, a maximum of 10 participants can
      progress through the treatment at a time. The initial randomization with allot five
      participants into either group. Once the treatment group has completed the 8-week treatment,
      the five wait-list control group participants will then begin the treatment with five newly
      randomized participants. This process will continue until 20 participants have completed the
      treatment condition, and 20 the wait-list condition. Only one set of data will be used from
      each participant, in that, whatever condition they are allotted to first will be the data we
      use in our analyses. The participants will complete a battery of measures at the outset of
      the randomization process (both treatment and wait-list control conditions), and again at the
      end of the 8-weeks. A 3-month follow-up assessment will also be conducted to evaluate the
      maintenance of treatment gains. Only participants who complete at least 5 out of the 8
      modules will be considered to have &quot;completed&quot; the treatment, and therefore included in the
      analyses. A 2 x 3 mixed model ANOVA will be conducted (treatment vs. wait-list control; and
      pre-post-follow-up), to assess the magnitude of changes for main outcome variables between
      the treatment and wait-list control conditions . Treatment efficacy will be based on the
      significance and magnitude of the differences in the changes between the conditions, thus
      providing meaningful insight into the utility of the online ABBT treatment. A hierarchical
      regression model will be used to evaluate the influence of PTSD and depression symptoms on
      main outcome variables.
