    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of the medical device &quot;Excilor® Fungal Nail Infection&quot; in the
      treatment of toenail onychomycosis. Half of the participants will receive the tested product
      and the other half will receive a comparator (Amorolfin 5%). Patients will be followed during
      6 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>At the end of the study (day 168), evolution of the percentage of healthy surface versus baseline, was evaluated by a blinded investigator. Comparison with the comparator product.</measure>
    <time_frame>After 168 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage healthy surface was assessed using digital image analysis. Briefly, two macro-photographs (top and front) were made of the great toenail, placed beside a piece of graph paper to allow determination of the exact size of the nail during analysis (contour tracing). Consequently, all pictures were digitalised and recorded on the computer. Image analysis of the top picture was performed with Adobe Photoshop software. For each photograph, a blinded dermatologist traced the healthy surface.</description>

    <measure>At different time points, evolution of the percentage of healthy surface versus baseline, was evaluated by a blinded investigator. Comparison with the comparator product.</measure>
