    <textblock>
      This study compares LY900014, a drug that lowers blood sugar, with insulin lispro (Humalog).
      Both drugs are given by injection under the skin of the abdomen. The study will be conducted
      in healthy people to investigate how quickly and how much LY900014 is absorbed and the effect
      of different doses of LY900014 on blood sugar levels in comparison with insulin lispro. The
      study will last about 7 to 12 weeks for each participant, including screening and follow up.
      Screening is required within 28 days prior to entering the study.
