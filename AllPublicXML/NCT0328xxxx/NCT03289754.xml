  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of subjects who have recently
      undergone surgery with the iTotal® Cruciate Retaining (CR) Total Knee Replacement System
      (KRS) who have also had iPoly XE Tibial Inserts implanted.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is prospective and single-center. Subjects will be implanted with an iTotal® CR
      Knee Replacement System in conjunction with an iPoly XE insert. The study will include a
      minimum of 50 subjects and a maximum of 60 subjects at a single center. The study site will
      be located in Germany. The study subjects will be followed for 10 years post implant.

    <description>The implants are constructed to conform to the surface of the patient's femoral condyle and proximal tibia, replacing the damaged cartilage with a smooth articulating surface. The femoral component and tibial tray are manufactured from cobalt chromium molybdenum alloy. The tibial insert and patellar component are manufactured from ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.</description>

             attend all follow-up visits

          4. &gt; 18 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

         10. Loss of bone or musculature, osteonecrosis, neuromuscular or vascular compromise in
             the area of the joint to be operated on, to an extent that the procedure is
             unjustified

         11. Diagnosed with or receiving treatment for Osteoporosis

         12. Other physical disability affecting the hips, spine, or contralateral knee
