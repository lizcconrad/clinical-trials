  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the mass distribution of LLINs (long-lasting insecticidal nets) as a Malaria control
      strategy, populations are still continuously exposed to a high frequency of malarial
      inoculation in some countries. The situation can be explained by a swift increase in the
      resistance of Anopheles to common insecticides. To preserve the gains of insecticides and
      improve their effectiveness, a new generation of bednets treated with piperonyl butoxide
      combination insectides have emerged.But more evidence is needed to plead for scale up of
      their usage. The lack of information relating to the additional impact of that combination on
      the transmission of Malaria, its relative efficacy in real-life setting and its safety in
      users are the rationale for more investigation.This will be a randomized controlled study on
      a dynamic cohort of households with 1680, 0-10 years-old subjects in 30 villages will be
      recruited to compute the effectiveness of this new tool.

      The findings will be useful information for decision-making by national malaria control
      programs, their partners, the international community and the bednet manufacturers with
      regard to the effectiveness of the new combination of insecticides in real-life context. The
      results will also enable a better design of the tool in the future and a broader
      understanding of long-term dynamics for sustainability, as well as identification of some
      factors with negative impacts on the benefits of the strategy.
