    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine eligibility for the future clinical trial of gene
      therapy in adults with late-onset Pompe disease.

      This screening protocol will enroll up to 20 adults patients (&gt;=18 yo) with late-onset Pompe
      disease. Study assessments include review of medical history, vital signs, physical
      examination, muscle function testing, lung function testing, blood and urine collection,
      serum pregnancy test and ECG.

      The study results will be collected to perform descriptive statistical analysis and used to
      determine eligibility for the proposed clinical trial of gene therapy in the future.
