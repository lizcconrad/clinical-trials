    <textblock>
      The purpose of this First-in-Human Phase 1 study is to determine during the escalation part
      if AMG 701 given as weekly short term IV infusions is safe and tolerable followed by a dose
      expansion part to gain further efficacy and safety experience with AMG 701 in adult subjects
      with relapsed / refractory multiple myeloma. The study will be conducted in multiple sites
      and test increasing doses of AMG 701. The safety of subjects will be monitored by intensive
      assessments of vital signs, electrocardiograms, physical examinations, and laboratory tests.
