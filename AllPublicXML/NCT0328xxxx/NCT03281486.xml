  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An increased incidence of dental caries in association with poorly controlled diabetes has
      also been reported, Xerostomia (dry mouth) has been reported to be a common complaint of
      patients with diabetes, Without adequate saliva production, both hard and soft tissues of the
      mouth can be severely damaged and become more susceptible to infections. This 9 week,
      cross-over group, randomized, single center, study will evaluate the efficacy of HA
      formulation in alleviating dry mouth in type 2 diabetic patients.
