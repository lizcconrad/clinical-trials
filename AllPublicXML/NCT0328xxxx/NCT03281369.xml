  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase Ib/II, open label, multi-center, randomized study designed to assess the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor activity of immunotherapy-based
      treatment combinations in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic G/GEJ
      cancer (hereafter referred to as gastric cancer). Two cohorts will be enrolled in parallel in
      this study: the second-line (2L) Cohort will consist of patients with gastric cancer who have
      progressed after receiving a platinum-containing or fluoropyrimide-containing chemotherapy
      regimen in the first-line setting, and the first-line (1L) Cohort will consist of patients
      with gastric cancer who have not received prior chemotherapy in this setting. In each cohort,
      eligible patients will be assigned to one of several treatment arms.
