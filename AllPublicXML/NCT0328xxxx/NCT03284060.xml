  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social cognition refers to mental operations that enable people to perceive, interpret
      constantly changing social informations. These processes allow people to rapidly,
      effortlessly and flexibly perceive and interpret rapidly-changing social information, and
      respond appropriately to social stimuli. Besides, this ability gives meaning to the actions
      of others. Impairments in this field may largely underlie social dysfunctions and reduce
      adaptive skills. Moreover, social cognitive disabilities contribute more or less directly to
      behavioral disturbances and psychiatric symptoms The &quot;RC KID&quot; program involves a variety of
      exercises in a paper and/or pencil or a computerized format or role playing and a strategy
      coaching approach. &quot;RC KID&quot; targets the emotion recognition and social interaction.

      A little cartoon character (a pirate), is supposed to be very friendly and kind toward
      children. The pirate will accompany them throughout the program for an effective and positive
      reinforcement. The main goal of &quot;RC KID&quot; is to adjust to children's difficulties in daily
      life.

      Moreover, since the cognitive remediation benefit is complex to apply in daily life, the
      program is based on a metacognitive strategy.

      After a complete neuropsychological assessment and a psychoeducational session (with the
      child and the parents), 16 1-h-sessions of cognitive remediation with the therapist are
      proposed. Each session is composed of three parts: (1) computerized tasks focusing on
      specific emotion recognition components (20 min). RC KID is composed of 2 modules : Emotion
      recognition and social interaction. These tasks contain photo or video. (2) pen and paper or
      role playing tasks focusing on the same processes (20 min) (3) a proposal of a home-based
      task (during 20 min). Weekly, home tasks are proposed to the child and analyzed with the
      parents and the therapist. Indeed, home exercises are useful to promote the transfer of
      strategies to daily life and their subsequent automation. The heterogeneity of cognitive
      deficits in 22q11.2 deletion necessitates an individualized cognitive remediation therapy. In
      this regard, &quot;RC KID&quot; seems to be a promising tool.

      The second objective is to evaluate the impact of RC KID on behavior disorders. Method : a
      validation study using multiple single-case experimental designs. A thorough assessment,
      including a complete evaluation of components of social cognition but also clinical and
      neuropsychological assessments is proposed for each patient enrolled in the study.

      Investigators collect three kinds of baselines before the beginning of the cognitive
      remediation intervention: baselines specific of the targeted component (Emotion recognition
      and Theory of Mind), non-specific baselines (such as measures of neurocognition processes
      that should not be affected by the intervention), and intermediary baselines that is measures
      of social cognitive function linked with targeted processes but not directly concerned by the
      cognitive remediation program.

      These measures and the complete assessment will be repeated at the end of the intervention to
      highlight impacts of RC KID on social cognitive impairments, and 6 months later to
      investigate the possible long-lasting effects of the benefits.

    <description>Cognitive remediation program is a set of reeducation techniques and aims at restoring or compensating altered cognitive functions such as memory, attentional or executive functions, and social cognition. Therapists help individuals develop new information processing strategies designed to meet their needs and wishes. Specific therapeutic sessions are designed to generalize such strategies to everyday situations to reduce the impact of cognitive deficits on daily life. Thus, social cognitive training therapy helps the development of personal strategies specifically adapted to preserve skills and reduce the difficulties.
16 sessions (45 min) of cognitive remediation with the therapist are proposed, each session is composed of three parts:
pen and paper tasks focusing on specific emotion recognition component (20 min),
computerized tasks focusing on the same process (20 min),
a proposal of a home-based task (during 20 min).</description>
