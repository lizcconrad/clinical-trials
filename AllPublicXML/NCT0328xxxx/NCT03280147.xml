  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimum duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy for culture-proven neonatal bacterial
      sepsis is not known. Current practices, ranging from 7 days to 14 days of antibiotics, are
      not evidence-based. This is a randomized, active -controlled, multi-centric, non-inferiority
      trial to compare the efficacy of a 7-day course of intravenous antibiotics versus a 14-day
      course among neonates weighing &gt; 1500 g at birth with culture-proven bacterial sepsis that is
      uncomplicated by meningitis, bone or joint infections deep-seated abscesses. The primary
      outcome measure is a definite relapse by the same etiologic organism within 21 days after
      stoppage of antibiotics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The optimum duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated neonatal bacterial
      septicemia is not known. Pediatricians administer anywhere between 7 to 14 days of
      antibiotics, but these practices are not evidence based. C reactive protein (CRP) guided
      antibiotic duration is based on limited data and serial quantitative CRP is both cumbersome
      and not universally available. If it could be demonstrated that a 7-day course of antibiotics
      is not inferior to a 14-day course of antibiotics in terms of relapse rates of infection,
      then a 7 day course of antibiotics could be uniformly adopted, resulting in economic savings,
      shorter duration of hospitalization, less chances of hospital acquired infections, less
      chances of antibiotic induced adverse events and less antibiotic resistance. To test this
      hypothesis, a randomized, active-controlled, multi-centric, non-inferiority trial to compare
      the efficacy of a 7-day course of intravenous antibiotics with a 14-day course has been
      planned. Subjects weighing more than 1500 g at birth with suspected sepsis will be enrolled
      and observed for a 7-day period to see if they meet eligibility criteria for randomization.
      Subjects will be randomized on the 7th day of antibiotics, if the initial blood culture grows
      a non-Staphylococcus aureus bacterial organism, if they have no meningitis, osteomyelitis,
      septic arthritis or deep seated abscess and if the sepsis goes into clinical remission by the
      5th day and remains in remission up to the 7th day of sensitive antibiotics. Subjects in the
      14-day group will receive 7 more days of antibiotics after randomization, whereas those in
      the 7-day group will receive no further antibiotics after randomization. Subjects will be
      followed up for a 35-day period after randomisation. The key outcome will be treatment
      failure as measured by relapse within a 21-day period after completion of antibiotic therapy.
      Secondary outcomes will include definite or probable relapses within 21 and 28 days after
      antibiotic completion and within 28 and 35 days after randomisation. Other secondary outcomes
      will include secondary infections and adverse events. A total sample size of 700 (350 in each
      arm) will be required to detect a noninferiority margin of 3.5% with 80% power. Data safety
      monitoring board will monitor serious adverse events in the trial and will perform mid-term
      analyses at 1/3 and 2/3 recruitment, using stopping rules and p-values decided a priori.
