  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine if thigh muscle weakness and the lack of muscle
      activation that accompanies ACL injury and reconstruction can be improved with functional
      resistance training.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Profound quadriceps weakness is ubiquitous after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
      reconstruction, and current rehabilitation approaches are not successful in optimizing
      quadriceps strength and knee function even years after the surgery. We hypothesize that
      suboptimal strength and functional outcomes after ACL surgery are due to the lack of
      task-specific exercise elements during strength training. This application seeks to assess
      whether progressive functional resistance training during gait will significantly improve
      quadriceps function, neural excitability, and knee mechanics during gait. The proposed
      studies will not only lay the foundation for a novel training paradigm, but will also improve
      our understanding of the mechanisms mediating neuromuscular and biomechanical changes after
      functional resistance training.

    <measure>Knee flexion angle symmetry</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 8 weeks after the start of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The knee flexion angle will be gathered for both limbs using 3D motion capture and recorded while subjects walk and climb stairs. A symmetry score will be computed using the following formula: ((knee flexion angle of involved limb/knee flexion angle of the uninvolved limb)*100). Improvements in knee flexion angle symmetry from baseline to the end of intervention will be assessed and compared between groups.</description>
