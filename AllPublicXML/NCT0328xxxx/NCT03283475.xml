      The sample will be divided into two groups:- - Control group which will include 60 adult
      individuals between 18 and 35 years old who have BMI between 19 and 25, not complaining of
      any thigh contour deformities or skin redundancy with no history of body weight fluctuations.
      This group will be divided into two subgroups, 30 males and 30 females.

      The following measurements will be recorded :- Weight, height, thigh length, hip
      circumference, maximum buttocks circumference, upper thigh, middle thigh and lower thigh
      circumferences.

      - Patient group which will include 40 patients suffering from thigh lipodystrophy and contour
      deformities who will undergo surgical intervention after their assessment.

      After assessment, one of the following techniques will be selected:-

        -  Liposuction only.

        -  thigh lift.

        -  Liposuction assisted thigh lift.

  <detailed_description>

      Preoperative assessment:- Patients will be assessed regarding skin redundancy, history of
      weight loss and site of lipodystrophy whether deformity is proximal, distal or diffuse.

      The same measurements mentioned above will be recorded for the patient group before surgery.

      Preoperative photographs in anteroposterior, lateral and oblique positions will be taken.

      Informed consent will be signed by the patient before surgery illustrating possible risks and
      complications of the surgery.

      Postoperative assessment:- The outcomes will be evaluated 3 months after surgery regarding
      patient satisfaction and achievement of symmetry.

      Early complications will be assessed within one week after surgery including hematoma,
      seroma, surgical site infection and wound dehiscence.

      Late complications will be assessed at 3 months follow up including asymmetry, conspicuous
      scar and lymphedema.

      Postoperative measurements and photographs will be recorded and compared with preoperative
      ones.
