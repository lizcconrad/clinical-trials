  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the effect of redesigned transverse facial cleft treatment and traditional
      transverse facial cleft treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nine patients with transverse facial cleft were treated with redesigned repair using precise
      location of commissure. The main outcome measurement included scar, symmetry of the
      commissure. They were graded in five scores by five resident physicians who had never seen
      the patients. The results were compared with nine patients treated with classical transverse
      facial cleft repair, and eight patients seen in our clinic other than transverse facial
      cleft.
