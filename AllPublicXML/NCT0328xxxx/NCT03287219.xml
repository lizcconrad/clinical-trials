      Objectives:

      To describe and evaluate the mucosal staining efficacy of Methylene Blue MMX® tablets after
      total oral doses of 150 or 200 mg in patients undergoing a full colonoscopy for various
      reasons.

      Primary end-point(s):

      To evaluate the mucosal staining efficacy of Methylene Blue MMX® tablets after total oral
      doses of 150 or 200 mg.

      Secondary end-point(s):

      Bowel cleansing quality evaluated according to the validated Boston Bowel Preparation Scale
      (BBPS) after intake of 150 or 200 mg of Methylene Blue MMX® tablets during the intake of the
      bowel cleansing preparation.

      To collect data about safety and tolerability of Methylene Blue MMX® tablets after
      administration of single oral doses of 150 or 200 mg.

      Methodology:

      Open label, staining efficacy exploratory study.
