  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to develop and test the accuracy of a two-step post-extubation dysphagia
      screening and the effects of PED Care intervention on reducing time to resume oral intake,
      rates of penetration and intervention at 10 days postextubation, and incidences of 30-day
      aspiration pneumonia in adult patients with prolonged intubation (≥48 hours) under a
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) design.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endotracheal intubation is life-sustaining, but it may contribute to postextubation dysphagia
      (PED) increasing the risk of penetration, aspiration, and aspiration pneumonia. Up to 84% of
      extubated patients had PED and approximately 60% penetrated and aspirated that can lead to
      aspiration pneumonia. The aims of this three-year, two-stage study are: 1) to develop a
      two-step PED Screen involved oral stereognosis and cough reflex test for detecting
      penetration and aspiration, using a diagnostic accuracy study method; and 2) to test effects
      of a once daily, 7-day PED Care intervention on reducing time to resume oral intake, rates of
      penetration and intervention at 10 days postextubation, and incidences of 30-day aspiration
      pneumonia in adult patients with prolonged intubation (≥48 hours) from a medical center in
      Taiwan, using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design.

    <intervention_model_description>The first stage is to test the accuracy of a two-step Post-extubation dysphagia screening tool. Every participants will receive the screening and FEES examination.
The second stage of this study will be an intervention study. All participants will randomly assigned into the intervention or control group. The control group only receive the usual care in the unit they stay while the intervention group received additional 7-day, once-daily PED Care including oral exercise, oral cleaning and intake education.</intervention_model_description>
