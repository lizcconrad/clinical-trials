  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ToAST study is a pilot study aiming to establish the safety profile of using inhaled
      capsaicin challenge in patients with severe asthma. The investigators will also explore the
      differences in cough symptoms and threshold in patients with and without bronchial
      thermoplasty.

      ToAST is designed as a two-visit observational study. During visit 1, written consent and
      measurements of baseline asthma characteristics were completed; history and examination,
      questionnaires (Asthma Control Questionnaires and Leicester Cough Questionnaire, and basic
      lung physiological assessment were performed.

      At the end of visit 1, a cough monitor was attached to the subject to monitor cough frequency
      for the next 24 hours and this was returned at visit 2.

      Visit 2 followed within two weeks after visit 1, during which a full dose capsaicin cough
      challenge was performed. Emergency contact details were given towards end of visit 2 should
      any adverse events occur.

      Telephone call within 48 hours, Day 3 and Day 7: The purpose of these phone calls was to
      ensure that the patient had not developed any adverse effects to the capsaicin challenge.
