  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phototherapy has been largely used in rehabilitation programs due to its analgesic,
      antiinflammatory and healing effects. Lately, its effects of optimizing the results of
      resistance training on young individuals have been studied. However, there is a lack of
      studies on its effect on the elderly population. The objective of the present study is to
      verify the effect of Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) on the results of resistance training in
      the elderly. The study will be a randomized doubled-blinded controlled trial. 30 elderly men
      with age ranging from 60 to 80 years will be included and randomized between Placebo Group
      (placebo LLLT + Resistance Training) and LLLT Group (active LLLT + Resistance Training). All
      volunteers will be submitted to a control period of four weeks before the beginning of the
      resistance training, which will have 12 weeks of duration. The assessments will be done at
      baseline, after the control period and after the training period. The training sessions will
      be performed twice a week and the training protocol will be performed with repetition maximum
      periodization. The LLLT will be applied before the training sessions on eight points of the
      quadriceps muscles, leading to a total of 240 Joules on each leg. The placebo LLLT will be
      applied on the same way, but with the equipment turned off. The assessments will include
      muscle architecture by ultrasonography, muscle strength by isokinetic dynamometer and 1
      Repetition Maximum test of leg-extension and leg-press exercises, and functional capacity by
      the 6-Minute Walking Test, 30s Sit to Stand Test, Timed Up-and-Go Test and Stair Ascent Test.
