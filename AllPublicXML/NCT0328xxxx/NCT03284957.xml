      Primary Objectives:

      Dose Escalation: Part A (SAR439859 monotherapy); Part C (combination of SAR439859 with
      palbociclib)

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD) of SAR439859
           based on the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observance in monotherapy (Part A), and in
           combination with palbociclib (Part C)

      Dose Expansion: Part B (SAR439859 monotherapy); Part D (combination SAR439859 with
      palbociclib)

        -  To assess antitumor activity by Objective Response Rate (ORR) at the SAR439859
           recommended dose in monotherapy (Part B), and in combination with palbociclib (Part D)

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To characterize the overall safety profile of SAR439859 as monotherapy (Parts A and B),
           and in combination with palbociclib (Parts C and D)

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR439859 as monotherapy (Parts A
           and B), and of SAR439859 in combination with palbociclib (Parts C and D), as well as of
           palbociclib in combination with SAR439859 (Parts C and D)

        -  To evaluate antitumor activity of SAR439859 as monotherapy (Part A), and in combination
           with palbociclib (Part C) as well as the disease control rate (DCR) in Parts A, B, C,
           and D

        -  To evaluate ORR and DCR (Complete Response [CR], Partial Response [PR] and Stable
           Disease [SD] â‰¥6 months) in Parts B and D according to the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1)
           gene mutational status (mutant and wild type)

        -  To evaluate residual estrogen receptor (ER) availability with [(18)F] Fluoroestradiol
           Positron Emission Tomography (FES PET) scan (Part A)

      Duration of the study, per patient, will include eligibility period (screening period) of up
      to 4 weeks (28 days), treatment period (at least 1 cycle [28 days] of study treatment), and
      end of treatment (EOT) visit after the last study treatment administration (i.e. at least 30
      days post last treatment or until the patient receives another anticancer therapy, whichever
      is earlier). The expected enrollment period is approximately 26 months.
