    <textblock>
      In present study, we aimed to investigate the association between visceral adiposity index
      and overactive bladder symptoms in female patients aged over 18 years.Between January-2015
      and July-2017, 151 female patient with overactive bladder symptoms were evaluated in Recep
      Tayyip Erdogan University Training and Research Hospital Urology Department. Antropometric
      and laboratory features including serum lipid levels, AST, ALT, fasting glucose levels, and
      also urodynamic findings were recorded. Visceral adiposity index was calculated according to
      gender-specific formula. Participants were divided into two groups according to 7,55 cut-off
      level for visceral adiposity index levels. Statistical significance were discussed between
      two groups.

      Antropometric and laboratory features including serum lipid levels, AST, ALT, fasting glucose
      levels were recorded. Urodynamic study was performed all of patients to evaluate bladder
      functions. Over active bladder questionnaire-8 Turkish validated short form was filled out
      and recorded for each patients. Detailed medical histories of all patients were obtained
      before the study. Height, weight, and waist circumference (WC) were measured with the
      subjects in their underwear. Body mass Ä±ndex (BMI) was computed by the formula as the ratio
      of weight to the square of height (kg/m2). WC was measured on the line between the iliac
      crest and the lower costal margin parallel to the ground after subjects exhaled. Inclusion
      criteria of study was female patients who have over active bladder symptomes with or without
      urinary incontinence. Exclusion criterias of study were male gender, pregnancy, alcohol
      intake, bladder cancer history, previous incontinence surgery history, presence of
      neurological disease, urinary infection or bladder stone and pelvic radiotherapy history.
