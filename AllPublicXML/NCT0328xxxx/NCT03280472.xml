  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current project will test whether a computerized training program, Cognitive Bias
      Modification (CBM), can be used as a prevention inoculation tool to reduce vulnerability to
      anxiety among incoming college students. Those not in the CBM condition will complete a
      symptom tracking condition (ST). We will also test whether ST influences vulnerability to
      anxiety among incoming college students.

    <measure>Change in Student Adjustment to College Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants report on their past few days. The SACQ is administered at T1-T5. T2 occurs within ~1 week of T1/baseline. T2-T5 are spaced ~1 week apart from each other. Sessions are ~60-90 minutes.</time_frame>

    <measure>Change in Interpretations</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants report interpretations to a variety of situations. The IQ is administered at T1 and T4. T2 occurs within 1 week of T1/baseline. T2-T5 are spaced ~1 week apart from each other. Sessions are ~60-90 minutes.</time_frame>

    <description>CBM training. For those in the CBM condition, participants will complete a task. In this task, they will read ambiguous, two- to four-sentence social-related scenarios on the computer. The final word in the scenario will have a missing letter. Participants will type the missing letter. Participants will also be asked to answer a &quot;Yes/No&quot; comprehension question about the scenario. The missing letter will &quot;resolve&quot; the ambiguity of the scenario in a positive way, intended to train participants to have more positively-biased interpretations of ambiguous social information</description>
