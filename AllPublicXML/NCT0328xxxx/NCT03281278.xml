  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ineffective hemostasis or a paradoxical prothrombotic state of Acute-on-chronic liver disease
      (ACLF) has been well established. Thrombelastography measures the dynamics of thrombin
      production and provides a global assessment of coagulation incorporating the cumulative
      effect of the interactions at various levels between plasma components and cellular component
      of coagulation. And through the platelet mapping, it can help provide a picture of patients'
      function of platelet. This study aims to explore the predictive role of platelet mapping in
      ACLF prognosis, organ failure developments and short term mortality.
