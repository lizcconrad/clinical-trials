  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A majority of people undergoing rehabilitation following a stroke have a deficit of the
      dorsal flexors of the foot. The implementation of rehabilitation techniques in accordance
      with the recommendations of learned societies is not sufficient to compensate for this
      deficit. Also Kinesio Taping's method of Dr. Kenzo Kase has caught our attention by its
      action on muscle, joint, circulatory and pain functions.

      The use of taping would increase the duration of stimulation of the muscles of the
      dorsiflexors of the foot which would facilitate the motor recovery.

      Data from the literature do not support the conclusion that taping is effective, but no
      studies evaluating the efficacy of this technique in the foot-lift deficiency of the
      hemiplegic patient have been found.

      The investigators hypothesize that the use of taping in conjunction with common
      rehabilitation for hemiplegic patients following a stroke improves the stimulation of the
      muscles of the dorsiflexors of the foot with a positive impact on the walking.
