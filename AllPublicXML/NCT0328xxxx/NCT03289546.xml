  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore whether physical exercise, mindfulness training, or
      both interventions together can improve cognitive function in individuals with multiple risk
      factors for the development of dementia in the future.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will test the feasibility and acceptability of a combined mindfulness
      training + aerobic training intervention, vs. either alone or none to improve cognitive
      function in older adults with cognitive impairment. The investigators will also obtain
      estimates of effect sizes (and confidence intervals) on cognitive function. Preliminary
      analyses will be conducted to explore the mediating role of changes in aerobic capacity,
      physical activity, vascular risk factors, and mindfulness skills. Assessments will be
      conducted at baseline, 3-, and 6- months since baseline.

    <description>Exercise sessions will be led by CPR- and exercise-certified YMCA instructors and supervised by the senior research assistant. Sessions will consist of 10 minutes of warm-up, 40 minutes of aerobic exercise (walking on a treadmill), 10 minutes of cool down and stretching. Participants will receive heart monitors at the beginning of the study and will be trained by the senior research assistant to exercise targeting heart rates at 65-75% of the age predicted max heart rate or at an intensity of 12-13 in the Borg scale of the rate of perceived exertion.</description>
