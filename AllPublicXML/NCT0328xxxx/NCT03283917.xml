  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of daratumumab,
      ixazomib, and dexamethasone at standard doses can be given safely to patients with amyloid
      light chain (AL) amyloidosis.

      Researchers also want to learn the recommended dose of the study drug combination.

      This is an investigational study. Daratumumab and ixazomib are FDA approved and commercially
      available for the treatment of another type of blood cancer called multiple myeloma, although
      not in combination. Dexamethasone is FDA approved and commercially available to help prevent
      or treat certain side effects. The combination of daratumumab and ixazomib with dexamethasone
      is not FDA approved for the treatment of AL amyloidosis. It is currently being used for
      research purposes only.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 20 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will receive
      daratumumab, ixazomib, and dexamethasone. All participants will receive the study drugs at
      the same doses. Dexamethasone will be given at a lower dose during Cycle 1 and then a higher
      dose during Cycles 2 and beyond.

      Each cycle is 28 days.

      Participant will receive daratumumab by vein on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycles 1-2, then on
      Days 1 and 15 for Cycles 3-6, and on Day 1 of Cycles 7-12. The first 2 doses will be given
      over 6½ hours. After that, the doses may be given over 3½ hours if participant has no bad
      reactions.

      Participant will take ixazomib by mouth on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 1-12. Participant
      should take each dose of ixazomib on an empty stomach (no food or drink) at least 1 hour
      before or at least 2 hours after food, with about 8 ounces (1 cup) of water.

      Swallow the ixazomib capsules whole. Do not break, chew, or open capsules. If participant
      misses or vomits a dose of study drug at home, participant should not retake the missed or
      vomited dose. Participant should wait and take the next scheduled dose.

      Dexamethasone is given as a premedication before participant's dose of daratumumab to lower
      the risk of side effects. Participant will receive dexamethasone by vein over 15 minutes or
      by mouth on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1. Starting with Cycle 2 and beyond, dexamethasone
      will be given as a premedication before each dose of daratumumab and then again the next day.
      During weeks when participant does not have a daratumumab dose scheduled, participant will
      receive dexamethasone as a single dose 1 time a week.

      Participant will be given other standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects,
      such as infection and indigestion. Participant may ask the study staff for information about
      how the drugs are given and their risks.

      Participant should bring any empty bottles and any unused study drug to the clinic at each
      visit. Participant will be given a diary to record when participant takes participant's study
      drug each day.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-12:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn and a 24-hour urine sample will be collected
           for routine tests.

      On Day 8, 15, and 22 of Cycles 1 and 2 and Day 15 of Cycle 3-6, blood (about 1-2 tablespoons)
      will be drawn for routine tests.

      These tests may be repeated if the doctor thinks it is needed.

      Length of Study:

      Participant may continue taking the study drugs for up to 12 cycles, as long as the doctor
      thinks it is in participant's best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the
      study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant
      is unable to follow study directions.

      Participation on the study will be over after participant's last follow-up visit.

      Follow-up Visits:

      About 30 days after participant's last study drug dose:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn and a 24-hour urine sample will be collected
           for routine tests.

        -  Participant will have an ECHO to check participant's heart function.

      If participant stops the study drugs and the disease has not gotten worse, blood (about 4
      tablespoons) will be drawn and a 24-hour urine sample will be collected for routine tests
      every 90 days (+/- 30 days). The testing will stop after 24 months or if the disease gets
      worse, whichever comes first.
