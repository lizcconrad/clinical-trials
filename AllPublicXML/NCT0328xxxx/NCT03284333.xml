    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pivotal investigation is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the
      Cutera enlighten multi-wavelength 532 nm and 1064 nm Nd:YAG picosecond pulse duration laser
      and an investigational micro-lens array (MLA) handpiece attachment for improvement of acne
      scars.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, prospective, multicenter, pivotal study in up to 45 male or female
      subjects, age 18 to 65 years who desire laser treatment for the improvement of acne scars.
      Subjects will receive up to 6 laser treatments, spaced 6 weeks (± 2 weeks) apart with the
      Cutera enlighten laser with the Micro-Lens Array handpiece attachment. Subjects will be
      contacted by phone 7 days (± 2 days) after their first treatment for follow-up. Subjects will
      return to the site after all study treatments have been delivered for two follow-up visits: 6
      and 12 weeks (± 2 weeks) following their final study treatment.

        1. The Primary Efficacy Endpoint as the correct identification of the 12 weeks post final
           treatment photographs from the baseline by at least two of the three blinded reviewers
           in 75% of the patients and an improvement of one point in the ASAS.

        2. The Secondary Efficacy Endpoints as the:

             -  Efficacy of the Cutera enlighten laser with the Micro-Lens Array handpiece
                attachment treatment as assessed by the investigator starting from the 2nd
                treatment onward, and

             -  Subject satisfaction levels as assessed from the subject questionnaire completed at
                the final follow-up visit 12 weeks post final treatment.

        3. The Safety Endpoint as the safety of the Cutera enlighten laser with Micro-Lens Array
           handpiece attachment as assessed by the frequency and severity of device related adverse
           events,

        4. The Exploratory Analysis as the Efficacy of the Cutera enlighten laser with a Micro-Lens
           Array handpiece attachment for the improvement of skin quality as assessed by the
           investigator and/or blinded evaluators 12-weeks-post final study treatment.
