      This is a Phase III, randomized, two arms, double-blind (patient and assessor blinded),
      parallel active non inferiority controlled clinical trial with a 2:1 allocation. This trial
      was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab (produced by AryoGen
      Pharmed) plus FOLFIRI-3 compared with bevacizumab (Avastin®) plus FOLFIRI-3 in patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Patients who met the following criteria could be
      recruited to receive the mentioned intervention randomly. Inclusion criteria: male or female
      aged 18-75 years, mCRC verified histologically, Having one or more bi-dimensionally
      measurable lesions as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      criteria, Was not felt to be amenable to curative resection, With an (ECOG) performance
      status of ≤ 1, Life expectancy of longer than 3 months, Adequate organ and marrow function,
      May have received adjuvant therapy for primary colorectal cancer provided that at least 6
      months have elapsed from the time the adjuvant therapy was concluded and recurrent disease
      was documented, Patients with history of hypertension must be well-controlled (blood pressure
      less than/equal to 150/100), on a stable regimen of anti-hypertensive therapy.

    <description>Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg will be administered at day 1 every 2 weeks. Initially, it will be administered as a 90-min infusion. If the first infusion is well tolerated, the second will be delivered as a 60-min infusion, and if the 60-min infusion is well tolerated, all subsequent infusions will be given over 30 minutes. FOLFIRI-3 regimen consists of irinotecan 100 mg/m2 over 1 hour at day 1, leucovorin 400 mg/m2 at day 1 followed by a 46 hour 5-FU continuous infusion (2000 mg/m2) and irinotecan 100 mg/m2 over 1 hour on day 3 will administer.
