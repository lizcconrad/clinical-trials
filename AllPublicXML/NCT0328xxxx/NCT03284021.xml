    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to evaluate the effect of the 1550 nm fractional erbium-glass laser in
      patients with nonscarring alopecias. Participants currently living in the Chicago
      metropolitan area and meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be considered for enrollment.
      Participants will receive 5 sessions of laser, 30 days apart, to the area of alopecia on the
      scalp. Follow-up is at 150 days.

      This study was a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of this procedure.
