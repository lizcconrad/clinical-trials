  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multi-center study of P-BCMA-101 autologous T stem cell memory
      (Tscm) CAR-T cells in patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM.

      The study will follow a 3 + 3 design of dose-escalating cohorts. After a patient enrolls,
      leukapheresis will be performed to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells which will be
      sent to a manufacturing site to produce P-BCMA-101 CAR-T cells. The cells will then be
      returned to the investigational site and, after a standard chemotherapy based conditioning
      regimen, will be administered to the patient. Treated patients will undergo serial
      measurements of safety, tolerability and response.

    <description>P-BCMA-101 is an autologous, principally Tscm, CAR-T cell product (also called called a CARTyrin T cell product) targeting the myeloma selective protein BCMA. P-BCMA-101 cells are produced using a non-viral vector carrying the gene for an anti-BCMA Centyrin-based (small, fully human binding domain, designed to increase T cell persistence and decrease exhaustion) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Secondary to the large carrying capacity of the non-viral vector, P-BCMA-101 cells carry two additional genes, a selection gene used to manufacture a purified product and a &quot;safety switch&quot; gene to allow the cells to be eliminated if desired.</description>
