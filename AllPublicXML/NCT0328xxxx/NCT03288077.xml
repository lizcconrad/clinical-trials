  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Identifying non-pharmacological means of enhancing sleep is an important area of research for
      elite athletes. Research completed at the AIS has identified that some athletes have
      difficulties falling and staying asleep during both training and competition.

      There are a number of dietary components such as nutrients and certain dietary supplements
      that are purported to decrease sleep latency and increase quality of sleep. While many of
      these interventions have been investigated in isolation, no research has examined different
      combinations and/or amounts of these substances to determine the resultant effects on sleep.
      The results of such a systematic investigation could produce an effective diet based sleep
      product (&quot;Sleep Drink').

      The optimal components, amounts, and timing of intake of such a Sleep Drink will be explored.
      Additionally, the effects on sleep will be evaluated using the gold standard of sleep
      measurement: polysomnography.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18-40 year old males

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion: Exclusion criteria will include any observed or disclosed injury, illness,
             sleep or health issue which may disrupt the subject's performance or endanger their
             health. Participants will need to complete an adult screening tool, as recommended by
             Exercise and Sports Science Australia (ESSA), to assess this.

          -  Blood samples will also be collected to screen for magnesium, zinc and B12 which may
             influence nutritional impact on sleep. If subjects score above the reference ranges
             for these measures, they will be excluded.

          -  The Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) will be
             used to screen for sleep disturbances. If subjects score outside the reference ranges
             for these questionnaires, they will be excluded.
