  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the 1701-202 STRONG SCD study is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of 3 dose levels of IW-1701 compared with placebo when administered daily for
      approximately 12 weeks to patients with stable SCD. Exploratory objectives include evaluation
      of PK as well as evaluation of the effect of IW-1701 on symptoms of SCD, health-related
      quality of life, and biomarkers of pharmacodynamic (PD) activity.
