  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no available drug to treat the symptoms of neurodegenerative and vascular
      cognitive disorders that affect millions of people worldwide.

      Methylphenidate is indicated at high dose (1 mg/kg/day) in children having attention deficit
      and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and remains the best cognitive enhancer drug at lower dose.
      However, there is no proof of efficacy with chronic administration, outside ADHD, and concern
      remains about long-term cardiac and vascular risks in elderly and particularly in population
      with vascular risk factors and drug abuse in young people. Moreover, the effect appears to be
      very limited at the very advanced stage of dementia, for which the neuronal plasticity is too
      reduced to expect a benefit of training.

      Taken all together, we sought to develop a new paradigm of association of both
      pharmacological and non-pharmacological procedure to enhance the neuronal plasticity in order
      to expect a persistent effect on slight to mild cognitive disorders with benefit on
      ecological test (i.e. driving). Finally, short-term treatment would reduce the safety
      concerns.

      The concept will be to prove that low dose of methylphenidate associated with active
      cognitive training during 6 weeks can improve the cognitive function in healthy aged
      volunteers with a persistent effect at 3 months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Without severe chronic neurological or mental or psychiatric pathology

          -  Absence of cognitive impairment affecting autonomy (scores on the dementia scale of
             Mattis&gt; 130 and the IADL = 4)

          -  Subjects holding driving license B and continuing a driving activity

          -  Affiliate or beneficiary of a social security scheme

          -  Subject having signed informed consent

          -  Subject having agreed to be registered on the National File of Healthy Volunteers

          -  Patient willing to comply with all procedures of the study and its duration

          -  No planned changes in lifestyle (nutritional and physical, social interactions) during
             the life of the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Administrative reasons: impossibility of receiving informed information, inability to
             participate in the whole study, absence of coverage by the social security system,
             refusal to sign consent.

          -  Subject simultaneously participating in another clinical trial or in an exclusion
             period.

          -  Subject under tutelage or curatelle.

          -  Subject during breastfeeding or pregnancy. Given the age of the volunteers included in
             the study, women are expected to be menopausal. An FSH and LH assay is provided at V0
             and oral contraception will be recommended depending on the results.

          -  Subject not sufficiently fluent in the French language to understand the instructions
             necessary to carry out the cognitive tests.

          -  Subject with uncorrected visual pathology or motor pathology (orthopedic example)
             likely to interfere with the passing of tests.

          -  Subject with dependencies pre-existing to medicines, drugs or alcohol.

          -  Presence of contraindications to MRI: Claustrophobia, Anxiety crisis, Morphotype not
             allowing access to MRI, metal implant (eg a pacemaker), surgical clips Ferromagnetic,
             orbital or brain metallic foreign bodies).

          -  Hypersensitivity to methylphenidate or any other constituents of the product.

          -  Subject with a personal and / or family history of motor tics and Gilles de la
             Tourette syndrome.

          -  Subjects with a previous psychiatric history (based on the semi-structured psychiatric
             interview with the MINI of DSM IV): bipolar disease, psychotic state, severe
             depression, severe generalized anxiety. Dysthymia and an isolated history of
             depression do not constitute an exclusion criterion.

          -  Subjects consuming one or more psychotropic drugs or related products
             (antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptic drugs, daily use of benzodiazepine
             anxiolytics or other anxiolytics, vesperal hypnotic intake). A history of taking point
             hypnotics is not a criterion of exclusion. However, there should be no regular and
             regular intake in the previous 3 months and less than once a week (ideally, lack of
             intake would be desirable but would considerably limit the potential for inclusion).
             They will be asked not to change their habits during the study period.

          -  Subjects with dysthyroidism or cardiac arrhythmia, severe cardiovascular disorders,
             severe angina, recent myocardial infarction, uncontrolled severe blood pressure, angle
             closure glaucoma.

          -  Presence of one of the following treatments that can not be stopped for a period
             corresponding to 5 half-lives before inclusion: selective and non-selective MAOIs
             (nialamide and iproniazide, selegiline), other indirect sympathomimetics
             (phenylpropanolamine, pseudoephedrine, Phenylephrine), halogenated volatile
             anesthetics, guanethidine and related compounds.

          -  Treatment with alpha sympathomimetics (oral and / or nasal route) (etilefrin,
             midodrine, naphazoline, oxymetazoline, tetryzoline, tuaminoheptane, tymazoline),
             opiates and morphine derivatives. These concomitant treatments are contraindicated at
             baseline and throughout the study period.
