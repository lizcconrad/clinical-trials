      Evaluation of functional improvement after spa therapy in Fontcaude center, for knee
      osteoarthritis Background. Knee osteoarthritis is the first indication of spa therapy in
      rheumatology. This therapeutic represents a non pharmacological treatment and is recommended
      by OARSI.

      In order to obtain agreement for spa therapy, the center Fontcaude, needs to show clinical
      improvement for patients, as demonstrated in the Thermarthrose study. This center is near
      Montpellier and could improve patients localised in this area.

      Methods: randomised prospective clinical trial of patients with knee osteoarthritis.

      The spa therapy group received 18 days of therapy over 3 weeks. Patients in the control group
      received 18 days of therapy over 3 weeks after the 6-month follow-up visit.

      Follow-up was at 3 and 6 months, by a visit to the examination.

      The hypothesis of our study is to demonstrate clinical improvement at six months. The main
      endpoint is the number of patients achieving minimal clinically important improvement (MCII)
      at 6 months, defi ned as ≥19.9 mm on the visual analogue pain scale and/or ≥9.1 points in a
      normalised Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index function score.
