      This research study is studying proton radiation as a possible treatment for brain tumor that
      requires radiation.

      The radiation involved in this study is:

      -Proton Radiation

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Pilot Study to determine whether using proton therapy in
      participants that require craniospinal radiation (whole brain and spinal cord radiation
      therapy) with sparing of the bony spine will work. This is the first time investigators are
      examining bone sparing proton therapy in pediatric craniospinal radiation.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved proton radiation for this
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying proton radiation in participants that
      require craniospinal radiation. The standard of care for this procedure is photon radiation,
      which is very similar to proton radiation. The investigators believe that the precision of
      proton radiation may help to reduce the negative effects radiation has on the surrounding
      non-cancerous growing and developing tissue

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>IMPT using PBS delivery will be considered to be feasible as a VBS technique for CSI in pediatric patients if the rate of grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity were no more than 5% within 3 months after the completion of radiation treatment, within the range associated with conventional techniques of CSI. Toxicity will be assess using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0.</description>

    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are monitored both clinically and by MRI for any abnormality in spinal curvature.

    <measure>Disease Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Disease-free survival is measured from the start of radiation to the date of progressive disease based on imaging studies obtained as standard care or to the date of death due to any cause, whichever is earlier. Disease-free survival will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients without progressive disease and still alive will be censored at their date of last contact.</description>
