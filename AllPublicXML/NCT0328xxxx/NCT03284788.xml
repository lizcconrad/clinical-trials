  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of an acceptance-based therapy
      intervention on adolescents, to receive feedback about the program, and to learn about
      potential changes we could make to improve the program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Focus groups/pre-testing will be conducted to adapt the adult acceptance-based therapy (ABT)
      curriculum to adolescents.

      Participants will attend 2 baseline visits and adolescents will be randomized to the
      in-person ABT weight loss intervention or the self-guided at-home ABT weight loss
      intervention.

      In-person ABT will include 14 sessions over 6 months. Self-guided at-home ABT will include 14
      mailed handouts over 6 months. Information in the handouts will match what is being taught at
      the ABT sessions and mailed.

      A post-treatment visit and 6-month follow-up visit will occur.
