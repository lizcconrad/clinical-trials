    <textblock>
      This is a study, where the efficacy of Pressurized IntraPeritoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy
      (PIPAC) against peritoneal metastases will be evaluated. Furthermore, this study will focus
      on the best evaluation method, where both Quality of Life questionnaires, repeated histology,
      cytology and MRI will be used.

    <textblock>
      Patients with peritoneal metastases (PM) will be reviewed by the interdisciplinary tumor
      board and included based on predefined in- and exclusion criteria. Eligible candidates with
      primary colorectal or appendiceal cancers will be treated with intraperitoneal oxaliplatin
      delivered by the PIPAC procedure, while patients with other primary cancers will be treated
      with a combination of cisplatin and doxorubicin. Three PIPAC treatments will be scheduled in
      intervals of five weeks. MRI and QoL questionnaires will be performed at baseline and after
      three PIPAC treatments. If the patients respond to the PIPAC treatment, further courses of
      PIPAC can be planned at the tumour board meeting.

      In brief, PIPAC is performed during a standard laparoscopy using two access ports, where the
      magnitude of PM is evaluated using the Peritoneal Carcinosis Index and the Dutch 7 regions
      count. Afterwards, the peritoneum is biopsied at different regions and peritoneal lavage
      fluid is sent for cytology. Then, chemotherapy is aerosolised within the abdomen, and after
      30 minutes, the aerosol has been absorbed by the peritoneum, and the patient is closed
      according to departmental guidelines. The patients are expectedly discharged within 24 hours,
      and will after each PIPAC treatment be screened for adverse events using the CTCAE and
      Dindo-Clavien classification.

    <description>Peritoneal metastases (PM) from colorectal or appendiceal cancer will be treated with Pressurized IntraPeritoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy (PIPAC) using oxaliplatin 92 mg/m2 in 150 ml dextrose. Peritoneal metastases (PM) from other GI or gynecologic cancers will be treated with Pressurized IntraPeritoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy (PIPAC) using cisplatin 7.5 mg/m2 in 150 ml saline combined with doxorubicin 1.5 mg/m2 in 50 ml saline. PIPAC is performed during a standard laparoscopy with a capnoperitoneum of 12 mmHg and the aerosolised chemotherapy will be nebulized at a maximum pressure of 200 PSI and a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. There is no upper number of allowed PIPAC treatments, but they will be planned in series of 3 with 5 weeks interval.</description>
