    <textblock>
      A laproscopic imaging tecgnology that uses a synthetic agent to detect ovarian and pancreatic
      cancers at an early stage so that patients can get treatment early and prevent the disease
      from advancing to late stage leading to fatality or recurrence.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current methods of imaging techniques, CT, MRI and PET, fail to detect moderate volume of
      diffuse intraperitoneal tumor and provide limited functional information. White light
      laproscopy is capable of detecting small volume disease in only half of patients in clinical
      remission, missing occult disease in 30% of this patient population. In this study, a
      synthetic agent VM110 is to be tested for its ability to detect occult ovarian and pancreatic
      cancers. The agent is cleaved by proteases, cathepsin B, L, and S and plasmin in cancer cells
      and the fluorescent cleavage product is detected by near infra red imaging probe. High
      sensitivity of visualizaion of cancer cells can help detect sub-clinical disease otherwise
      unidentifiable by usual methods.

      Primary Objectives

        1. To investigate the safety and toxicity of escalating doses of VM110 administered IV
           prior to laparoscopic surgery.

        2. To define the appropriate dose of VM110 for use in future trials.

        3. To define the preliminary efficacy: the optimal dose of VM110 in detection of
           microscopic peritoneal tumor at laparoscopy not visible with standard white light
           laparoscopy. Areas visible with both standard white light and NIRF light, and areas
           visible only with NIRF light will be biopsied. Data from pathologic evaluation of these
           specimens will be used to determine the efficacy of VM110 with respect to its ability to
           detect occult disease not visible with standard white light

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Estimate sensitivity and specificity of VM110 detection

        2. Perform correlative pharmacologic and histopathological analyses

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with known or suspected pancreatic or ovarian carcinoma who will be
             undergoing clinically appropriate laparoscopic evaluation or treatment. Patients will
             not undergo laparoscopy solely for the purpose of participation in this trial.

          2. Patients must have evidence of disease either through elevation of tumor markers or
             radiologic evidence of disease

          3. Patient may be male or female and of any race / ethnicity.

          4. Participation in this trial will not significantly alter pre-surgical, surgical or
             post-surgical care

          5. ECOG PS of 0-1

          6. Patients should be free of active infection requiring antibiotics

          7. Any therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including immunologic agents, must be
             discontinued at least three weeks prior to registration

          8. Patients must have adequate:

               -  Renal function: serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x institutional upper
                  limit normal (ULN)

               -  Hepatic function: Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN , SGOT and
                  alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN

             of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective methods of contraception during the
             study and 8 weeks after. Highly effective contraception methods include combination of
             any two of the following:

               1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception, or;
