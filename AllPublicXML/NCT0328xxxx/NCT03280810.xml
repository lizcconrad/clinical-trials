  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beside these well-known symptoms (positive symptoms (such as delirium and delusions),
      negative symptoms (such as affective flattening and impoverishment of speech), disorganized
      behavior, patients with schizophrenia show different kinds of cognitive alterations and motor
      abnormalities. In schizophrenia, postural impairment could increase the attentional cost of
      daily motor tasks, leading to a lack of attentional resources, essential to achieve complex
      cognitive tasks. The intrication of cognitive and postural processings (both impaired in
      schizophrenia) can be explored by using of a dual-task paradigm.

      This study assesses a psycho-corporal training (8 weeks psycho-corporal training) benefits on
      both postural (increased automation of balance control) and cognitive processings (smaller
      impact of the dual-task condition on attentional performances) in population of patients
      suffering from schizophrenia.
