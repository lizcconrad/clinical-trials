  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is dedicated to empowering individuals close to an addicted person (i.e.
      concerned significant others, CSOs) to create changes in their family environment: changes
      that increase the likelihood of the addicted person seeking treatment.

      The Danish National Clinical Guideline for the treatment of alcohol dependence recommends
      that alcohol treatment centers offer interventions aimed at CSOs, providing them with the
      support and empowerment that will enable them to motivate the problem drinker to enter
      treatment. In the US, the Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT) intervention
      has been shown to offer the most effective support to CSOs. CRAFT has consistently
      demonstrated a two to three times' higher impact on getting individual with an alcohol use
      disorder (AUD) to attend treatment, compared to other kinds of interventions. Studies of the
      intervention so far have, however, been small, and the format used in the delivery of CRAFT
      has not been fully investigated.

      The aim of the present cluster randomized controlled trial is to implement and investigate
      CRAFT in a Danish context and with sufficient sample size. Consecutive CSOs will through
      cluster randomization be randomized to receive either CRAFT in a group format, CRAFT in an
      individual format, or a control condition, consisting of self-help material only. The primary
      outcome of the study will be the rate of individuals with AUD entering treatment following
      the intervention targeted at the CSOs within three months from its initiation. Data will be
      collected from all CSOs at baseline, three, and six months after baseline.
