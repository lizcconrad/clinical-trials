    <textblock>
      This research is to evaluate the effect of different antibiotics (Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride
      and Sodium Chloride Injection vs. β-lactam antibiotics for injection +/- Azithromycin for
      Injection) on the early deterioration or progression (&lt;72 h of treatment) of community
      aquired pneumonia and to study the effect of the early deterioration or progression on the
      progonosis of community aquired pneumonia.
