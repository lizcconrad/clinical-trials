    <textblock>
      In advanced cancer disease brain metastases are common, difficult to treat, and are
      associated with a poor prognosis. As new local and systemic therapies are eventually
      resulting in improved survival and quality of life for patients with brain metastases,
      negative neurocognitive effects of radiation therapy are becoming increasingly important as
      well as good loco-regional disease control of brain metastases.

      Concerning treatment, brain metastases remain a major clinical problem and a
      multidisciplinary approach to management should be adopted. Neurosurgical resection with
      postoperative whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is one major treatment option in solitary or
      symptomatic brain metastases. Furthermore, WBRT is recommended for multiple brain metastases.
      For a limited number of brain metastases stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been established
      as a highly effective treatment alternative.

      Recently, a new treatment approach combing neurosurgery with postoperative stereotactic
      radiotherapy (SRT) of the resection cavity is emerging. Based on available evidence,
      postoperative SRT of the resection cavity improves local control following surgery, reduces
      the number of patients who require whole brain radiotherapy, and is well tolerated (1).

      This protocol is aimed at primarily evaluating the safety and toxicity profile of SRT to the
      resection cavity following neurosurgical resection combined with SRT of potentially further
      unresected brain metastases, compared to postoperative whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT).
      Secondary, the local effect of SRT in patients with brain metastases will be assessed by
      measuring time to local recurrence (LR), local and loco-regional progression-free survival
      (PFS).

      Additional systemic treatment will be carried out according to the standards of the National
      Center for Tumor Therapy (NCT).

      Scientific Background: Brain metastases (BM) represent a significant healthcare problem. It
      is estimated that 20% to 40% of patients with cancer will develop metastatic cancer to the
      brain during the course of their illness 1. The most common primary sites are lung, melanoma,
      renal, breast and colorectal cancer 2. Options for patients with brain metastases had been
      limited to whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) or supportive care alone, and systemic
      chemotherapy was often discontinued. Historically, the best possible supportive care or
      whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) were the standard of care 1 aiming at temporary symptom
      relief. For WBRT, efficacy in symptom relief but also in prolongation of the median survival
      time by 3-6 months is well documented. To date, microsurgical approaches and SRS, both proved
      to be safe and efficient, offer alternative treatment options that potentially meet these
      concerns 6,7. After proving its efficacy in achieving local tumor control in the treated
      volume, SRS was used as a stand-alone treatment option in patients with oligometastases (one
      to four metastases) in the brain. There is a rapidly expanding recent body of literature on
      outcomes of single-fraction SRS or hypofractionated SRS targeting the resection cavity after
      surgical resection of BM. Several retrospective series assessed the efficacy and safety of
      postoperative SRS to the resection cavity 9 aiming at an enhanced local tumor control but
      also at avoidance of the neurotoxic late effects of WBRT. WBRT followed by SRS of the tumor
      bed leads to 1-year local control rates of 70-93 %, which is comparable to results after
      surgery followed by WBRT. Median survival was 12-18 months with a 1-year incidence of new
      metastases in the brain of 45-60 %.

      Trial Objectives: This protocol is primarily aimed at evaluating the safety and toxicity
      profile of SRS following neurosurgical resection and compares it to that of WBRT as the
      established standard of care. Secondary, the local effect of radiation therapy in patients
      with brain metastases will be assessed by measuring time to local and loco-regional
      recurrence, local and loco-regional PFS and overall survival at 12 months after treatment.

      Patients´Selection: Patients with the diagnosis of brain metastases from solid tumors that
      have undergone neurosurgical resection of one brain metastasis will be evaluated and screened
      for the protocol. All patients fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be
      informed about the study and included into the study if they declare informed consent.
      Registration for the study must be performed before the start of RT.

      Trial Design: The trial will be performed as a single-center two-armed prospective randomized
      Phase II study. Patients will be randomized into an experimental arm and a control arm. All
      patients will receive post-operative contrast-enhanced cranial MRI imaging and imaging will
      be assessed by a radiologist. All available MRI sequences, including SPACE will be taken into
      consideration for the definition of treatment target lesions. Patients for whom the
      post-operative MRI reveals more than 10 suspect intracranial lesions (all sequences taken
      into account) will not be included in the trial.

    <description>For radiosurgery, patients will be immobilized. Treatment planning including the MRI and planning CT should be performed 1 -2 weeks before SRT and treatment finished at latest 3-4 weeks after surgery. Planning should be as close to SRT as possible.
Organs at risk such as the brain stem, optic nerves, chiasm and spinal cord will be contoured. The Clinical Target Volume 1 (CTV1) will be defined as the resection cavity based on MRI and CT including T1 contrast enhanced changes around the resection cavity. The Clinical Target Volume 2 (CTV2) will be defined as a 3mm margin added to CTV1 by isotropic expansion and slightly adjusted as deemed appropriated by the experienced contouring physician. The Planning Target Volume (PTV) will be an additional margin of 1mm added to CTV2 by isotropic expansion.
Treatment planning will be performed using Accuray's Multiplan or subsequent approved treatment planning systems for Cyberknife.</description>

For low infratentorial lesions, the treatment volume may include the whole brain down to the second cervical vertbra.
RT will be applied with two portals (e.g. 87°and 273°) using a 6 MeV linear accelerator.
For WBRT, a total dose of 30 Gy in 3 Gy fractions will be applied.</description>
