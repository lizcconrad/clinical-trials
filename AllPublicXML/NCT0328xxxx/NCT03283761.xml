  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single-arm phase II, multi-institutional trial to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of the combination of nab-paclitaxel and FOLFOX (FOLFOX-A) as first line
      therapy for patients diagnosed with histologically-confirmed advanced gastric/GEJ
      adenocarcinoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will receive FOLFOX-A every 14 days of each cycle (1 cycle = 28 days).
      Nab-paclitaxel will be given at a dose of 150 mg/m^2 IV over 30 minutes, followed by
      oxaliplatin IV 85 mg/m^2 and leucovorin IV 400 mg/m^2 over 2 hours, and 5-FU as a continuous
      IV infusion over Day 1 and Day 2 (for a total dose of 2400mg/m^2 over 46-48 hours.).
      Radiographic assessment will be performed at baseline and every 8 weeks to evaluate response
      to treatment by RECIST Version 1.1 guidelines. Patients may continue to receive treatment
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             trial registration and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no
             evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least
             7 days prior to trial registration.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin, or other platinum agents.

          -  Known additional malignancy within the past 3 years. Exceptions include treated
             localized basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, in situ cervical or
             vulvar carcinoma that has undergone potentially curative therapy, superficial bladder
             tumors (Ta, Tis &amp; T1), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast and low grade
             prostate cancer (Gleason sore 6). Any cancer curatively treated &gt; 3 years prior to
             registration with no clinical evidence of recurrence is permitted.

          -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.
