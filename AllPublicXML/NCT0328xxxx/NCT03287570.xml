      The purpose of this study is verify the efficacy and safety of Cettum (Electric moxibustion)
      for patients with knee osteoarthritis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator targets the patients with knee osteoarthritis. After treatment in 3 groups -
      Cettum treatment, traditional indirect moxibustion treatment, and usual care groups - the
      investigators will compare the effects of pain relieving and daily performing improvement. So
      the investigators will confirm the efficacy of Cettum, and further the best treatment method.
      In addition, the investigators are going to evaluate the safety of abnormal reaction during
      the treatment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain NRS (Numeric Rating Scale) change</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Rating Scale is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity. The 11-point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing 'no pain' to '10' representing 'worst pain imaginable'.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>100mm Pain VAS (Visual Analogue Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patient is asked to indicate their perceived pain intensity along a 100mm horizontal line, where '0' represents 'no pain' and '100', 'unbearable pain'.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities) total</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC scale is widely used to evaluate the condition of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, including pain, stiffness, and physical functioning of the joints. The WOMAC scale measures 5 items for pain, 2 for stiffness, and 17 for functional limitation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EQ-5D-5L (EuroQol 5-Dimensions 5-Levels)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PGA (Patient Global Assessment)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patient may choose to answer the question of how much better the symptom has improved compared to the previous treatment: Very good, Good, Fair, Poor, Very poor.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Temperature sense threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigator attaches the temperature sensor to the measurement area and increase or decrease the temperature by starting with reference temperature. Warm pain threshold and heat pain threshold are recorded to compare the difference between the value at baseline and the value at the end of the treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Any unpredicted symptoms are checked at each visit and if any, the symptom, time of occurrence, and length of duration are recorded and reported.</description>
