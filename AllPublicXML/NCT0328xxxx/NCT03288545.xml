  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study that will test how an experimental drug (enfortumab vedotin) combined with a
      kind of anticancer drug called an immune checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) affects patients with
      cancer of the urinary system (urothelial cancer). This type of cancer includes cancer of the
      bladder, renal pelvis, ureter or urethra that has spread to nearby tissues or to other areas
      of the body.

      Patients will get the drugs twice every 21-day cycle. Patients will get enfortumab vedotin
      plus the CPI on day 1. Patients will get enfortumab vedotin only on day 8.

      This study will look at the side effects of giving the two drugs with each other. A side
      effect is a response to a drug that is not part of the treatment effect. This study will also
      test if the cancer shrinks with treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and anticancer activity of enfortumab vedotin given
      intravenously in combination with CPI therapy to patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      urothelial cancer. The primary goal of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability
      of enfortumab vedotin in combination with CPI therapy.

      The study will be conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation (enfortumab vedotin + pembrolizumab)
      and dose expansion (cohorts of enfortumab vedotin + CPI [either pembrolizumab or
      atezolizumab]).
