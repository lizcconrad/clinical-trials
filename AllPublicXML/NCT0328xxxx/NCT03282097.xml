    <textblock>
      The Decisions about Cancer screening in Alzheimer's Disease (DECAD) study is the first study
      to test if an evidence-based decision aid for AD caregivers can support decision-making about
      mammography and improve the quality of medical decision-making about breast cancer screening.
      This large randomized controlled trial will recruit 426 dyads of older women with AD and a
      family caregiver from 24 primary care practices in central Indiana to test this decision aid

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional conflict Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>0-2 days after the POST-Index PCP visit</time_frame>
    <description>The DCS includes 16 questions regarding a medical decision that they have made or that they are about to make. It is a validated and widely accepted measure of decision quality that has been used in previous studies of decision aids intended for AD caregivers</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Decision-making self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 0-2 days after the POST-Index post PCP visit</time_frame>
    <description>To measure decision-making self-efficacy, we will use the Decision Self-Efficacy Scale (DSE). The DSE is a validated, 11-item instrument that measures how confident the respondent is in their ability to make an informed medical decision, including SDM. We will adapt the DSE with five response categories (&quot;not at all confident&quot; to &quot;very confident&quot;) to measure caregiver decision-making self-efficacy for mammography decisions for their relative with AD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Record of mammogram</measure>
    <time_frame>15 month followup</time_frame>
    <description>We will review the patient's EMR to assess primary care notes, radiology records, and other documentation of a mammogram outside of the INPC. We will also ask caregivers at the 15 months post-intervention follow-up, via phone-administered questionnaire, if the patient received a mammogram at any time since intervention date and any burdens of the procedure for the patient or for them.</description>

    <description>The home safety guide is a two-page paper pamphlet developed by the American Geriatrics Society Foundation for Health in Aging. It provides tips about important actions older adults can take to prevent falls, poisoning, and bathroom hazards and protection against abuse, fire and other related hazards. We selected the home safety guide to account for the attention given to the intervention group but not to provide information that would bias the control group away from talking about mammography with the patient's PCP.</description>
