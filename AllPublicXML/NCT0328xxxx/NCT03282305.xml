  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a progressive liver disease ranging from simple
      steatosis to cirrhosis of the liver. Nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) without substantial
      hepatocellular injury is thought to be relatively benign whereas nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
      (NASH) is characterized by hepatocyte steatosis, ballooning, inflammation and varying degrees
      of fibrosis from none to cirrhosis. NASH is strongly associated with insulin resistance and
      metabolic syndrome and thus is recognized as a major public health concern as the most
      prevalent liver disease.

      Liver biopsy is the gold standard for a diagnosis of NASH. However, given the large
      population of patients at risk for NASH, liver biopsy is not a practical method for
      determining which patients may benefit from NASH therapy. Non-invasive methods to estimate
      inflammation and fibrosis are in clinical use, but there remains a dichotomy between gold
      standard inclusion criteria and end points that are utilized in clinical trials and real
      world diagnostic methods that are more common in clinical practice.

      Thus, the investigators would like to conduct an observational study to head-to-head compare
      the non-invasive methods and liver biopsy in differential liver steatosis and liver biopsy in
      a real-world setting. Also, by following up patients for a relatively long time (proposed 10
      years), the investigators can present the natural history of disease progression.

      GC-FLC is a cooperative consortium of principal investigators from academic institutions and
      community-based sites treating patients with NAFLD and NASH. The investigators will leverage
      the multidisciplinary expertise within this network in bio-banking, high-throughput
      technologies, and biomedical informatics to give investigators the power to analyze
      effectiveness data at many different levels of resolution, ranging from subsets of patients
      to very large populations.

      GC-FLC will use standardized data collection practices, study data monitoring, and an
      comprehensive observational protocol in order to increase the efficiency and minimize costs
      associated with performing clinical research while ensuring collection of detailed critical
      safety and effectiveness data on prescribed NASH therapies. GC-FLC engages community and
      academic practice providers as partners in the research to ensure rapid translation of
      research findings into improvement in healthcare quality and outcomes and to help engage
      scientists at the interfaces between clinical research and the community. Furthermore, GC-FLC
      provides the opportunity to pair-comparison between liver biopsy and non-invasive biomarkers
      in differential low-risk and high-risk population for treatment in real world settings.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults and children subjects aged &gt;= 6 years old

          -  Ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form (ICF) or provide assent
             in pediatric subjects

          -  Diagnosis of NAFLD; or a definite or probable diagnosis of NASH:

               1. A diagnosis of NAFLD will be defined by evidence of hepatic steatosis, either by
                  imaging or by histology, with no causes for secondary hepatic fat accumulation
                  such as significant alcohol consumption, use of steato-genic medication (e.g.
                  valproate, amiodarone, anti-retroviral medications, tetracycline, chronic
                  high-dose corticosteroids), or hereditary disorders (e.g. Wilson's disease,
                  Wolman disease, cholesteryl-ester storage disease);

               2. A definite diagnosis of NASH will be defined by steatohepatitis confirmed by
                  biopsy with correlating clinical evidence of non-alcoholic liver disease;

               3. A probable diagnosis of NASH will be defined by:

                  a.Elevated alanine amino transferase levels (ALT) of &gt;40 U/L; and b.Evidence of
                  hepatic steatosis on imaging; or c.Obesity, type 2 diabetes, or pre-diabetes.

                  alone is common in NASH and is not exclusionary)

               4. Autoimmune liver disease (biopsy evidence or clinical diagnosis of autoimmune
                  hepatitis or Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) requiring ongoing treatment,
                  imaging evidence of Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC))

          -  Prior bariatric surgery unless the surgery was performed more than one year before the
             biopsy diagnosis of NASH (i.e., NASH is present despite prior bariatric surgery);
