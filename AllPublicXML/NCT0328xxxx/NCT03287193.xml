  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Developmental diseases include more than 3000 diseases and can associate organ malformation,
      dysmorphism, development disorders and/or intellectual deficiency. Even though the
      considerable effort in the search for genes in the last 20 years has led to the
      identification of thousands of genes associated with Mendelian diseases, half of the
      individuals with severe development anomalies remain without a genetic diagnosis. It is
      important to pursue the ambition to contribute to the goal fixed by Europe, namely the
      identification of the large majority of genes responsible for rare diseases with development
      anomalies, and to be able to provide genetic counselling to patients and their families. In
      the past, scientific research to discover genes required a large number of families and
      individuals and was slow and expensive to carry out. Today, this approach has been
      facilitated by next generation sequencing.
