  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the extent to which diet and exercise may improve
      PAH through the modulation of insulin sensitivity. The central hypothesis is that
      dysregulated glucose metabolism elicits a response in PAH patients that can be modified by
      exercise and diet, thereby leading to improvements in pulmonary vascular disease.

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) leads to premature death as a consequence of increased
      pulmonary vascular resistance and right heart failure. PAH-targeted therapies developed over
      the past 20 years target excessive vasoconstriction. However, the pathobiology of PAH is more
      complicated, and includes dysregulated vascular cell proliferation, cellular metabolic
      abnormalities, and inflammation. Even with modern PAH therapies, current outcomes remain
      poor, with an estimated 3-year survival rate of only 55%. Thus, there is a clear need for
      more effective therapies, based on better understanding of the pathobiology of the disease.

      Insulin resistance has emerged as a potential new mechanism in PAH. Animal models of insulin
      resistance are associated with PAH, which reverses with the administration of insulin
      sensitizing drugs. Over the past decade there has been an epidemiologic shift in PAH, where
      the disease is increasingly observed in older, obese, and diabetic subjects. Low levels of
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in PAH, a feature of insulin resistance, have been
      observed and found to be a strong independent predictor of PAH mortality. Elevated
      glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) also correlates with PAH diagnosis and severity. As measured
      by the OGTT, idiopathic PAH patients have not only insulin resistance, but also an inability
      to mount an appropriate insulin response to a glucose challenge. These data point to
      dysfunction in the pancreatic beta cells of PAH patients. It is known that an exercise and
      low glycemic index diet intervention improves insulin sensitivity in pre-diabetic subjects.
