  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The phase III, efficacy trial of inactivated vaccine (vero cell) against EV71 has completed
      on March 2013 in China,and a follow up study for phase III clinical trial has completed on
      March 2014.

      On the basis of phase III, this study is the Phase IV, open-labelled research, in order to
      evaluate the 5-year immune persistence of EV71 vaccine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        In the prior phase III clinical trial, 10077 subjects in three counties (Ganyu, Sheyang and
        Taixing ) were enrolled ( Experimental group: 5044; Control group: 5043 ), with 1293 of
        them in immunogenicity subgroup (Experimental group: 648; Control group: 645). In Sheyang
        county, 3351 subjects were enrolled (Experimental group: 1676 ; Control group :1675) , with
        435 of them in immunogenicity subgroup (Experimental group: 418 ; Control group :418).

        The subjects in Sheyang immunogenicity subgroup with the following conditions were included
        in this study:

          -  Guardian(s) of the volunteer should be capable of understanding the written consent
             form, and such form should be signed before the infant being included into this study

          -  Received at least one injection of EV71 vaccine or the placebo in the phase III
             clinical trial

          -  Finished the blood sampling 64 months after the vaccination

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Received extra EV71 vaccination after the phase III clinical trial

          -  Refused to join the study
