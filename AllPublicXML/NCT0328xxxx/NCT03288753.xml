  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to evaluate patient satisfaction and audiological performance with
      their current cochlear implant speech processor, the Neuro 1, and to compare it with the
      satisfaction and performance obtained with the new speech processor, the Neuro 2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, cochlear implants (CI) are successfully used to rehabilitate severe to profound
      sensorineural hearing loss. Oticon Medical recently developed a new cochlear implant system,
      including a new implantable internal part (Neuro Zti) and a new speech processor (Neuro 1).
      This new speech processor automatically detects and adapts to the sound environment,
      increasing the ease of listening in all situations. A second version of this speech processor
      has very recently been developed, called the Neuro 2. The Neuro 1 and 2 share the same signal
      processing characteristics and the &quot;sound&quot; delivered to the patient is similar. However, the
      Neuro 2 offers better ergonomics (smaller size and weight, rechargeable batteries…). Some
      improvements available on the Neuro 2 may be particularly interesting for children.

      The aim of the present study is twofold: 1. Compare the satisfaction of adult and pediatric
      users for the speech processor Neuro 1 with their satisfaction for the Neuro 2, and 2. Show
      that audiological outcomes are at least as good for the Neuro 2 than for the Neuro 1.

      The participants come at the hospital for three visits. The Neuro 1 is evaluated during the
      first visit (V1). Evaluation of the Neuro 2 takes place during the second (V2, 15 days after
      V1) and the third (V3, 3 months after V2).

    <description>The listener has to rate his appreciation of the Neuro 1 and Neuro 2 device and the sound quality on 7 points scale. The outcome measure corresponds to averaged score. The questionnaire has been developed by Oticon Medical to investigate satisfaction patient for their current and future speech processors. This questionnaire is not validated in the literature.</description>

    <description>The speech material corresponds to the lists of Lafon designed for cochlear implant patients. Each lists contains 17 monosyllabic words. Speech comprehension is evaluated by the percentage of words and the percentage of phonemes correctly repeated. This double scoring is used to avoid floor or ceiling effects that could happen with only one of these measures.</description>
