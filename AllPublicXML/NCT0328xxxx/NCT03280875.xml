  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the EXO-MODE project is to develop an innovative algorithm for the personalisation
      of Concentric and / or Eccentric training programmes adapted to the individual to improve the
      efficiency and tolerance. This algorithm will make it possible to personalise trainings
      programmes according to the different profiles of subjects, determined on the basis of their
      personal characteristics (age, sex, comorbidities), their exercise capacity and muscle
      performance, their level of motivation and their perception of the workload, and of the
      principal objective of the training programme. The final goal is to develop a tool to allow
      elderly populations to exercise more easily and more effectively.

          -  Subjects who engage in moderate physical activity (Level 1 or 2 defined by the

             severe asthenia related to a non-stabilised disease, such as neoplasia, systemic
             diseaseâ€¦),

          -  Physical disability affecting the lower limbs or the pelvis that could impair or
             prevent exercise on a cycle ergometer, whether neurological (central or peripheral),
             arterial (i particular, arteriopathy of the lower limbs with a systolic index &lt; 0.6)
             or orthopaedic (degenerative or inflammatory rheumatism).
