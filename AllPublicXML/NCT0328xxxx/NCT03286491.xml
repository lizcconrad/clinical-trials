  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute coronary syndromes are among main complains for patients presenting to emergency
      department. Risk classification systems are used to classify patients to appropriate risks
      and help physicians manage diagnosis strategies and treatments. Purpose of this study is to
      develop a clinical decision support system for patients presenting to emergency department
      with the help of statistical machine learning.

      Acute coronary syndromes are among main complains for patients presenting to emergency
      department and create a burden to emergency departments and hospitals. Risk classification
      systems were developed and used to classify patients to appropriate risk groups. According to
      risk classification, different diagnosis and treatment modalities can be used and help
      physicians manage diagnosis strategies and treatments. Purpose of this study is to develop a
      clinical decision support system for patients presenting to emergency department with the
      help of statistical machine learning.
