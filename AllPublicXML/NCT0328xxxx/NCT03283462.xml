    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, single-center, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial enrolling
      60 healthy elderly subjects (30 placebo and 30 AMAZ-02 administration) who are ≥65 and ≤ 90

          1. Adults ≥65 and ≤90 years of age

          2. Able to travel to and from the University of Washington and Fred Hutch Cancer Research
             Center (FHCRC)

          3. Informed consent obtained

          4. 6 minute walk distance of &lt;550 meters

          5. ATP max 0.8 mM/sec (in the hand muscle)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have significant disease(s) or condition(s) which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may put the subject at risk because of their participation in the trial
             or may influence either the results of the trial or the subject's ability to
             participate in the trial

          2. Hospitalization within 3 months for major atherosclerotic events (defined as combined
             incidence of myocardial infarction, urgent target-vessel revascularization, coronary
             bypass surgery and stroke) and for any hospitalization within 2 months.

          3. Have any metal implants in the right limbs, including non-MRI compatible metal stents,
             titanium pins/markers, etc.

          4. Have an implanted cardiac pacemaker or other implanted non-MRI compatible cardiac
             device

          5. Chronic, uncontrolled hypertension as judged by the Investigator (i.e., Baseline SBP
             &gt;150 mm Hg, DBP &gt;90 mm Hg) or a SBP &gt; 150 mm Hg or DBP &gt; 95 mm Hg at the time of
             screening or baseline. If the initial BP reading is above these values, the reading
             may be repeated one time within 20 minutes of the initial reading.

          6. Body mass index &lt;18 or &gt;32 kg/m2

          7. Severe chronic kidney disease requiring treatment with hemodialysis or peritoneal

             Investigator)

         10. Clinically significant and chronic uncontrolled renal, hepatic, pulmonary, endocrine,
             neurologic disorders, bone, or gastrointestinal system dysfunction

         14. Suspicion, or recent history, of alcohol or substance abuse or tobacco use

         15. Subjects who in the opinion of the Investigator have a clinically significant abnormal
             12-lead ECG during the screening period. Presence of atrial fibrillation, varying
             degrees of AV block, existence of a left bundle branch block, or evidence of previous
             myocardial infarction.

         16. Subjects who are either unwilling to agree to refrain from using or are found to be
             using supplementary antioxidant vitamins (e.g., Coenzyme Q10, resveratrol,
             L-carnitine) from 7 days prior to dosing and throughout the treatment period

         17. Subjects who are either unwilling to agree to refrain from using or are found to be
             using the following dietary restrictions (pomegranate juice, walnuts, pecans,
             strawberry, raspberry blackberry) from 7 days prior to dosing and throughout the
             treatment period

         18. Are currently enrolled in a clinical trial involving an investigational product or
             non-approved use of a drug or device or concurrently enrolled in any other type of
             medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this
             study

         19. Have participated, within the last 30 days from a clinical trial involving an
             investigational product. If the previous investigational product has a long half life,
             3 months or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) should have passed
