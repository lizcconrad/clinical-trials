    <textblock>
      The gross tumor volumes of the primary site and the neck nodes (GTVnx and GTVnd) could be
      delineated according to the post-NACT tumor position and receive radical radiation dose,
      while the tumor disappear after NACT could be encompassed in the first clinical target volume
      (CTV1) and receive high preventive radiation dose. Through this method,it is more likely to
      achieve the ultimate goal that maximize the chance of cure while minimize the injury of
      surrounding normal tissues, maintaining organ function and life quality. Therefore, this
      stage II clinical trial was designed to study the prognosis and locoregional failure patterns
      of this target volume delineation method in LA-NPC treated with NACT plus CCRT.

    <description>The gross tumor volumes of the primary site and the neck nodes (GTVnx and GTVnd) were delineated in accordance with the head and neck magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and endoscopy, which obtained two weeks after the last cycle of NACT. The first clinical target volume (CTV1) was defined as the GTVnx plus a 5-10mm margin (2 to 3mm margin posteriorly) to encompass the high-risk sites of microscopic extension, the whole nasopharynx, and the location and extent of the primary tumor before NACT. The second clinical target volume (CTV2) was defined as the CTV1 plus a 5-10mm margin (2 to 3mm margin posteriorly) to encompass the low-risk sites of microscopic extension, the level of the lymph node located before NACT, and the elective neck area. The prescribed dose to GTVnx, GTVnd, CTV1 and CTV2 were 68Gy/30f, 62-66Gy/30f, 60Gy/30f and 54Gy/30f, respectively.</description>
