  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary efficacy objective of the study is to determine if adjunctive therapy of
      natalizumab 300 mg intravenous (IV) every 4 weeks reduces the frequency of seizures in adult
      participants with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. The secondary efficacy objective is to
      assess the effects of natalizumab versus placebo in drug-resistant focal epilepsy on
      additional measures of seizure frequency.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of natalizumab as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of adult subjects with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. The placebo-controlled phase is followed by a 6-month open-label phase during which all subjects receive natalizumab.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Log-Transformed Seizure Frequency during Weeks 8 to 24 of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8 to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Seizures included in efficacy analyses are focal aware seizures (previously termed &quot;simple partial seizures&quot;) with motor signs, focal impaired awareness seizures (previously termed &quot;complex partial seizures&quot;), and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (previously termed &quot;partial onset with secondary generalization&quot;). Focal aware seizures without motor signs will not be included.
Seizure clusters (where individual seizures cannot be distinguished) will be counted as 1 seizure per cluster on each day that they are present.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Responders</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8 to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Responders were defined as participants with a â‰¥50% reduction from Baseline in seizure frequency (number of seizures per 28 days) during Weeks 8 to 24 of treatment.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Seizure-Free Days Gained</measure>

    <description>Seizure free days gained will be standardized over 28 days during weeks 8 to 24 of treatment compared with baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Inadequate Treatment Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8 to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Inadequate treatment response will be defined as either modification of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) after Week 12 of the placebo-controlled phase due to lack of improvement or ongoing seizures or discontinuation of study treatment after the 8-week active run-in period due to lack of efficacy.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have focal epilepsy diagnosed on clinical grounds and as applicable supported by
             electroencephalogram findings [Scheffer 2017] and brain imaging. Participants with
             multifocal epilepsy may be included if all other entry criteria are met.

          -  Must have a drug-resistant epilepsy defined as failure of adequate trials of 2 (or
             more) tolerated and appropriately chosen and used AEDs (whether as monotherapies or in
             combination) [Kwan 2010].

          -  Experiences 6 or more seizures during the 6-week prospective baseline period and is
             not seizure free for more than 21 consecutive days during the prospective baseline
             period

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Focal aware seizures are the only seizure type.

          -  Diagnosis of generalized, combined generalized and focal, or unknown epilepsy

          -  Known progressive structural CNS lesion.

          -  History of seizures occurring in predominantly clustered patterns, as determined by
             the Investigator, over the 12 months prior to the Screening Visit (Week -6) or during
             the 6-week prospective baseline period, where individual seizures cannot be counted.

          -  History of status epilepticus within the previous 12 months.

          -  Known history or presence of non-epileptic seizures.
