  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized control trial is to gain clinical insight on the use of
      pulmonary artery denervation (PADN) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension
      (PAH). The primary objective is to assess effectiveness and safety of PADN for the treatment
      of PAH.

      The current study is designed as a multicenter, randomized and prospective study aiming to
      compare the change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) of PADN on PAH patients. Based on the
      previous studies, the 6MWD was 13±24 m after 6-month treatment using target drugs. And our
      previous data showed that 6MWD at 6-month after PADN procedure was 65±85 m. As a result, a
      total of 128 PAH patients was required, with 64 patients/per group at a ratio of 1:1
      randomization.

    <description>PADN was performed at three sites at the conjunctional area between the distal main trunk and the ostial left branch. The following ablation parameters were programmed at each point: a temperature of 45 ℃-50 ℃, energy ≤15 W, and a time of 120 seconds. The procedure would cease for 10 seconds if the patient felt intolerable chest pain during the procedure. The EKG and pressure lines (including cardiac output) were monitored and continuously recorded throughout the procedure.</description>
