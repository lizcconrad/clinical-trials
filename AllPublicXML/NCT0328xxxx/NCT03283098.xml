      This is a multiple dose, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study
      conducted in Chinese subjects residing in Mainland China with chronic kidney disease
      receiving hemodialysis. The treatment duration will be approximately 4 weeks with a post
      treatment followup of 4 weeks. A dose will be given at each scheduled hemodialysis session
      (Dose administered three times a week for 4 weeks, for a total of 12 doses).

          -  Male or female subject ≥ 18 and ≤ 70 years of age at the time of screening, with end
             stage renal disease receiving hemodialysis

          -  Subject must be receiving hemodialysis 3 times weekly for at least 3 months through a
             functioning permanent dialysis access prior to Day -2 and have adequate hemodialysis
             with a delivered Kt/V ≥ 1.2 or urea reduction ratio (URR) ≥ 65% within 4 weeks to

          -  Previous administration of AMG 416

          -  Subject has received cinacalcet within the 30 days prior to informed consent
             (treatment with cinacalcet is prohibited during the study)

          -  Subject has lost 500 mL or more of blood or plasma within 8 weeks of study drug
             administration or during the study period

          -  Anticipated or scheduled to have major surgical procedures during the study period
             such as kidney transplant or parathyroidectomy

             or cervical carcinoma in situ)

          -  Subject's 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening suggests unstable arrhythmia or
             other cardiac abnormality that could place the subject at increased risk, based upon
             the Investigator's opinion

          -  Subject has current or history of cardiovascular conditions such as uncontrolled
             hypertension, symptomatic ventricular dysrhythmias, Torsades de Pointes, angina
             pectoris congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Classification III or
             IV), myocardial infarction, coronary angioplasty, or coronary arterial bypass grafting
