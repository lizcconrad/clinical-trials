  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The VA's Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention is implementing an new program to
      increase suicide prevention outreach for Veterans at highest risk for suicide. Using a
      statistical model, REACH VET, short for Recovery Engagement and Coordination for Health -
      Veterans Enhanced Treatment, uses information from Veterans' health records to identify those
      who are at a higher risk for suicide, hospitalization, illness, or other negative outcomes.
      Once a Veteran is identified, his or her VA mental health or primary care provider reaches
      out to check on the Veteran's well-being and review their treatment plan to determine if
      enhanced care is needed. The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the implementation of
      this program in collaboration with the Partnered Evidence-based Policy Resource Center
      (PEPReC). The objectives of this evaluation are to evaluate how well this program is put into
      place using a strategy called virtual external facilitation, and to collect data about the
      cost of the program and the strategy.

      The VA's Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention is implementing an innovative new
      program to increase suicide prevention outreach and target Veterans at highest risk for
      suicide. Using a new predictive model, REACH VET, short for Recovery Engagement and
      Coordination for Health - Veterans Enhanced Treatment, analyzes existing data from Veterans'
      health records to identify those who are at a statistically elevated risk for suicide,
      hospitalization, illness, or other adverse outcomes. Once a Veteran is identified, his or her
      VA mental health or primary care provider reaches out to check on the Veteran's well-being
      and review their condition(s) and treatment plans to determine if enhanced care is needed.

      The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the implementation of REACH VET in
      collaboration with the Partnered Evidence-based Policy Resource Center (PEPReC).

      The objectives of this evaluation are to:

        1. evaluate the implementation of REACH VET using virtual external facilitation, and

        2. collect preliminary data about the cost and cost offsets.

      The proposed evaluation will examine the impact of a virtual external facilitation strategy
      on the implementation of REACH VET in 28 medical facilities across 7 Veteran Integrated
      Service Networks (VISNs) in a stepped wedge design. Primary implementation outcomes include
      reach, adoption, and implementation fidelity. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with
      implementation facilitators, Suicide Prevention Coordinator(s), clinical leadership, and
      providers to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of REACH VET and the
      experience of facilitation. Secondary data will be collected on the cost of the intervention
      and the cost of implementation strategy.

    <description>Facilitation is an evidence-based implementation strategy to support sites that have difficulty implementing innovative programs. Facilitation is a multi-faceted &quot;process of interactive problem solving and support that occurs in the context of a recognized need for improvement and a supportive interpersonal relationship (Powell et al., 2015).&quot; Facilitation has been used nationally across VA to implement a number of different clinical interventions. The current project will examine this minimally intensive version of implementation facilitation, virtual external facilitation.</description>
