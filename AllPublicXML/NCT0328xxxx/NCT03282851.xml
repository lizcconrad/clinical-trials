             (IMP) administration, safety laboratory tests, and all other study procedures.

          -  Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with history and/or current presence of clinically significant atopic allergy
             (for example, asthma including childhood asthma, urticaria, angio-edema, eczematous
             dermatitis).

          -  Subjects with hypersensitivity or allergic reactions, including known or suspected
             clinically relevant drug hypersensitivity to any components of the IMP formulations,

             QuantiFERON®-Tuberculosis (TB) Gold test or a history of tuberculosis, lifetime
             history of invasive systemic fungal infections (for example, histoplasmosis) or other
             opportunistic infections, including recurrent or chronic local fungal infections,
             frequent (more than 3 per year requiring treatment) chronic or recurrent infections,
             having previously been treated with tocilizumab or taken a recombinant monoclonal
             antibody.

          -  Subjects who have received a live vaccine within 12 weeks before enrolling in this
             study or planning for any such vaccination during the study or within 4 months after
             IMP administration.

          -  Other protocol defined exclusion criteria could apply.
