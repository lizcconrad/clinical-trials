  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community-dwelling older adults receiving support at home such as meals-on-wheels may lose
      the ability to preserve social, cognitive, and functional abilities, when becoming accustomed
      to and dependent of community aged care. When still able to cook older adults often hold some
      control over the foods that are prepared and which they eat, and which helps to foster
      identity. The purpose of this study is to evaluate community-dwelling older adults being
      involved in activities in relation to meals in a rehabilitation program.
