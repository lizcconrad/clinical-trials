    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 first-in-human (FIH) study evaluating single and multiple dose
      administration of AL-034 in healthy adult subjects. The aim is to examine the safety
      (including pharmacodynamic [PD] biomarker assessments), tolerability, and pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of increasing single ascending doses (SADs) (Part 1) and multiple ascending doses (MADs)
      (Part 2) of AL-034. The potential food effect will be investigated in healthy adult subjects
      at one or optionally 2 single dose level(s).

        INCLUSION CRITERIA Each potential subject must satisfy all of the following criteria to be
        enrolled in the study.

          1. Subjects must be a man or a woman between 18 and 55 years of age, extremes included.

          2. Female subject must be of non-childbearing potential, defined as:

               -  Postmenopausal A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months
                  without an alternative medical explanation. A high FSH level (&gt;40 IU/L or mIU/mL)
                  in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in
                  women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. In the
                  absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, 2 FSH measurements will have to be taken at
                  least 3 months apart, OR

               -  Permanently sterile Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy,
                  bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation procedures, and
                  bilateral oophorectomy.

             Male subjects must either:

               -  be surgically sterile (have had a vasectomy), or otherwise incapable of fathering
                  a child, OR

               -  if heterosexually active, have a partner who is postmenopausal (as defined
                  above), permanently sterile (as defined above), or otherwise incapable of
                  becoming pregnant, OR

               -  if heterosexually active with a woman of childbearing potential, agree to use
                  effective methods of contraception as detailed in Section 4.4, Prohibitions and
                  Restrictions, from screening onwards, and agree to continue to use the same
                  method of contraception throughout the study and for at least 90 days after the
                  last dose of study drug Contraceptive use should be consistent with local
                  regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for subjects participating
                  in clinical studies.

          3. Female subjects should have a negative pregnancy test at screening and on Day -1.

          4. Subjects must be non-smokers for at least 3 months prior to screening. Alios
             BioPharma, Inc 44 Proprietary and Confidential

          5. Subjects must have a body mass index (BMI; weight in kg divided by the square of
             height in meters) of 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2, extremes included. (Williamson 1993)

          6. Subjects must have a normal 12-lead ECG (based on the mean value of the triplicate
             parameters) at screening including:

               -  Normal sinus rhythm (heart rate between 50 and 100 beats per minute [bpm],
                  extremes included);

               -  QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) according to Fridericia's formula
                  (QTcF) ≤450 ms (Fridericia 1920);

               -  QRS interval &lt;120 ms;

               -  PR interval ≤200 ms.

               -  ECG morphology consistent with healthy cardiac conduction and function. Any
                  evidence of heart block is exclusionary. Any evidence of left or right bundle
                  branch block is exclusionary.

             Note: Retesting for abnormal QTc interval value that may lead to exclusion will be
             allowed once without prior approval from the Sponsor. Retesting may take place during
             an unscheduled visit in the screening phase. Subjects with a normal value at retest
             may be included.

          7. Subjects must be healthy on the basis of a medical evaluation that reveals the absence
             of any clinically relevant abnormality and includes a physical examination, medical
             history, vital signs, and the results of blood chemistry, blood coagulation and
             hematology tests, and a urinalysis performed at screening.

          8. Subject must be willing and able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions
             specified in Section 4.4, Prohibitions and Restrictions.

          9. In the Investigator's opinion, the subject is able to understand and comply with
             protocol requirements, instructions, and study restrictions and is likely to complete
             the study as planned.

         10. Subject must sign a separate if he or she agrees to provide an optional DNA sample for
             research. Refusal to give consent for the optional DNA research sample does not
             exclude a subject from participation in the study.

        4.3. EXCLUSION CRITERIA Any potential subject who meets any of the following criteria will
        be excluded from participating in the study.

          1. Subjects with a past history of cardiac arrhythmias (eg, extrasystoli, tachycardia at
             rest), history of risk factors for Torsade de Pointes syndrome (eg, hypokalemia,
             family history of long QT Syndrome) or history or other clinical evidence of
             significant or unstable cardiac disease (eg, angina, congestive heart failure,
             myocardial infarction, diastolic dysfunction, significant arrhythmia, coronary heart
             disease, and/or clinically significant ECG abnormalities), moderate to severe valvular
             disease or uncontrolled hypertension at screening. Any evidence of heart block or
             bundle branch block is also exclusionary.

          2. Subjects with any current or previous illness that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in
             administering study drug to the subject or that could prevent, limit, or confound the
             protocol specified assessments. This may include but is not limited to renal
             dysfunction (estimated creatinine clearance below 60 mL/min at screening, calculated
             by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] formula [Poggio 2005]),
             significant cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal (such as significant
             diarrhea, gastric stasis, or constipation that in the Investigator's opinion could
             influence drug absorption or bioavailability), endocrine, neurologic, hematologic,
             rheumatologic, psychiatric, neoplastic, or metabolic disturbances. Any condition
             possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy or other significant
             gastrointestinal tract surgery, such as gastroenterostomy, small bowel resection, or
             active enterostomy) will also lead to exclusion.

          3. Subjects with any history of clinically significant skin disease such as, but not
             limited to, dermatitis, eczema, drug rash, psoriasis, food allergy, and urticaria.

          4. Subjects with a history of clinically significant drug allergy such as, but not
             limited to, sulfonamides and penicillins, or drug allergy witnessed in previous
             studies with experimental drugs.

          5. Subjects with a history or current evidence of use of alcohol, amphetamines,
             barbiturates, recreational or narcotic drug use within the past 1 year, which in the
             Investigator's opinion would compromise subject's safety and/or compliance with the
             study procedures.

          6. Subjects with current HAV infection (confirmed by HAV antibody immunoglobulin M
             [IgM]), HBV infection (confirmed by HBsAg), and HCV infection (confirmed by HCV
             antibody) at screening. Evidence of clinically relevant active infection that would
             interfere with study conduct or its interpretation is also exclusionary.

          7. Subjects with current human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) or type 2
             (HIV-2) infection (confirmed by antibodies) at screening.

          8. Male subjects with pregnant partners.

          9. Male subjects who plan to father a child while enrolled in this study or within 90
             days after the last dose of study drug.

         10. Subjects who have taken any disallowed therapies as noted in Section 4.4, Prohibitions
             and Restrictions, and Section 0, Concomitant Medications, before the planned first
             dose of study drug.

         11. Subjects having used immune-modulating agents within 6 months prior the first dosing
             of study drugs, eg, immunosuppressants, IFN-α, or oral corticosteroids.

         12. Subjects having received an investigational agent or investigational vaccine or used
             an invasive investigational medical device within 12 weeks, or having received a
             biological product within 12 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the
             first dosing of study drugs.

         13. Subjects participating in another clinical or medical interventional research study.

         14. Subjects with

               -  ≥ Grade 1 laboratory abnormalities at screening as defined by the Division of
                  AIDS (DAIDS) Toxicity Grading Scale (see Appendix D); or

               -  Total bilirubin outside the normal range. Note: Retesting of abnormal laboratory
                  values that may lead to exclusion will be allowed once without prior asking
                  approval from the Sponsor. Retesting will take place during an unscheduled visit
                  in the screening phase. Subjects with a normal value at retest may be included.

         15. Subjects who had major surgery (eg, requiring general anesthesia) within 12 weeks
             before screening, or will not have fully recovered from surgery, or has surgery
             planned during the time the subject is expected to participate in the study, or within
             12 weeks after the last dose of study drug.

             Note: Subjects with planned surgical procedures to be conducted under local anesthesia
             may participate.

         16. Subject is an employee of the Sponsor, the Investigator or study site, with direct
             involvement in the proposed study or other studies under the direction of that
             Investigator or study site, as well as family members of the employees or the
             investigator.

        NOTE: Investigators should ensure that all study enrollment criteria have been met at
        screening. If a subject's clinical status changes (including any available laboratory
        results or receipt of additional medical records) after screening but before the first dose
        of study drug is given or before the follow-up period, such that he or she no longer meets
        all eligibility criteria, then the subject should be excluded from participation in the
        study.
