      The objective of this registry is to gather data on the clinical outcomes of Medtronic mitral
      repair products (Profile 3D™ and CG Future® annuloplasty systems) in the approved intended
      use up to 12 months from the day of procedure

      There is limited local evidence on mitral repair products in South Asia and a prospective
      post market registry will provide real world data on clinical outcomes.

      Patients suffering from mitral valve disease and indicated for a mitral valve repair
      procedure with Profile 3D™ and CG Future® annuloplasty system as part of standard of care, in
      accordance with the product label indications (instructions for use), contraindications, and
      warnings will be considered for study participation.
