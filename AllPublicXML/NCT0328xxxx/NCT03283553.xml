      This study evaluates a multi-component communication intervention in the outpatient setting
      to strengthen communication among women being actively treated for breast cancer and their
      support network of family members and friends. The intervention comprises: 1.) a
      patient-family agenda-setting checklist completed immediately before a regularly scheduled
      oncology visit, 2.) facilitated registration for the patient portal (for patient and family
      member, as desired by the patient), and 3.) education (as relevant) on access to doctor's
      electronic visit notes. The study team will conduct a two-group randomized trial to examine
      feasibility of the protocol and to compare quality of communication with oncology providers,
      understanding of patient's cancer, confidence in managing patient's care and satisfaction
      with cancer care between patient-companion dyads who are in the intervention group (n=35) and
      patient-companion dyads who receive usual medical oncology care (n=35).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer among survivors in the US. Most patients with breast
      cancer receive help from family in making complex decisions about treatment, handling
      logistically demanding care coordination, and managing symptoms and side effects. Although
      family members (as defined by each patient) play a vital role in cancer care, they are not
      formally recognized or assessed in care delivery, and their need for information and support
      is typically unmet. Lack of attention to family in care delivery is an important gap that too
      often leaves families without adequate information about patient health and treatments. This
      may prevent families and patients from engaging in open conversations, cause them unnecessary
      anxiety, and negatively affect the quality of cancer care and delivery.

      Communication is particularly important in cancer care, as the optimal course of action is
      determined through longitudinal discussion of prognosis, treatments, and patient goals,
      preferences, and concerns. Strategies to improve communication for serious illnesses such as
      cancer have been developed, but typically target a specific decision, conversation, or
      setting, most often the inpatient hospital. There is growing agreement that communication
      among patients, families, and providers should be initiated early and continue throughout the
      disease trajectory. However, little is known about how to provide both patients and families
      with access to timely information about patient health and mechanisms to communicate directly
      with health care providers, as proposed in this study.

      The goal of this study is to test a multicomponent intervention to strengthen communication
      and longitudinal partnerships among women with breast cancer and their family members. Recent
      work by the study team has demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, and benefit of
      intervention components which will be combined into a single model of care. The study team's
      preliminary studies indicate that clarifying patient and family expectations regarding the
      role of family and providing family with timely and comprehensive information about patient
      health (as desired by the patient) leads to more effective family involvement, more frequent
      patient-family-provider interactions, more patient-centered communication, and greater
      preparedness to manage care.

      This study will evaluate the feasibility of delivering a multicomponent communication
      intervention in the outpatient setting comprising: 1.) a patient-family agenda-setting
      checklist completed immediately before a regularly scheduled medical oncology visit with a
      participating medical oncologist, 2.) facilitated registration for the patient portal (for
      patient and family member, as desired by the patient), and 3.) education (as relevant) on
      access to doctor's electronic visit notes. The study will focus on patients who typically
      attend medical oncology visits with a family member or trusted friend who are already present
      and involved in communication. This study will enroll up to 70 patients who are in active
      treatment for breast cancer, up to 70 family member/friend &quot;companions&quot; and up to 14 medical
      oncologists. The study team will compare patients and companions who are in the intervention
      group (n=35 dyads) with patients and companions who are in the control group and receive
      usual medical oncology care (n=35 dyads). This study will compare quality of communication
      with medical oncology providers, understanding of patient's cancer, confidence in managing
      patient's care, satisfaction with cancer care, and symptoms of anxiety after 3 months and 9
      months of follow-up.

    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome will be measured from a 4-item questionnaire that assess knowledge that is considered to be essential to making informed treatment decisions in serious illness, including: 1.) understanding of illness, 2.) knowledge of disease status, 3.) awareness of disease state, and 4.) expectation of duration of life (months, years, or decades). Each item will be coded 1 or 0 to reflect the presence or absence of each element of illness understanding. The study team will use scoring that is adapted to reflect patient stage of disease. These four items will be summed to construct a summary score (range: 0-4) that reflects illness understanding. This measure has been found to be responsive to communication with oncologists.</description>

    <description>Outcome will be measured with the short-form 10-item version of the FAMCARE questionnaire, a validated multi-item instrument that was developed to assess family perspective on cancer care. Respondents are asked to rate 10 items that relate to emotional support, personalization of care, support of decision-making, accessibility, and coordination. Response categories include &quot;very satisfied&quot; (2 points), &quot;satisfied&quot; (1 point), or &quot;not satisfied&quot; (0 points), and the 10-items may be summed to yield a total score (range: 0 to 20) with higher scores reflecting greater satisfaction.</description>

    <ipd_description>This research involves the collection of data and identifying information from approximately 154 diverse study participants including up to 14 medical oncology clinicians, 70 breast cancer patients, and 70 family member or friend companions. The final dataset will include self-reported demographic and health status measures, information from electronic health records, and information about participant experiences. Even though the final dataset will be stripped of identifying information prior to analysis, the study team believes that there remains a possibility of deductive disclosure of subjects. Upon written request from members of the research community, the following resources will be shared: documentation of the process for accessing the study data and constructing the analytic dataset; the codebook for the master analytic dataset; the analytic plan for each study aim; the algorithms used for measurement of outcome variables; surveys and questionnaires.</ipd_description>
