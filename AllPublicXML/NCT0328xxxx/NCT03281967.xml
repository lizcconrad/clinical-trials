  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to compare the outcomes after a surgical procedure with
      minimally invasive Ponto surgery (MIPS, test group) and tissue preservation surgery (control)
      for placing Oticon Medical Ponto implants and abutments.

    <measure>Numbness (sensibility) around surgery area</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of the study is to investigate the difference in numbness around implant after MIPS procedure (test, this investigation) and a surgery with soft tissue preservation (control, from a previous study, C47) for implanting Oticon Medical implants and abutments.
Two different sensibilities will be tested by means of a broken wooden cotton swab/bud (q-tip): gnostic (with cotton side) and vital (with broken, sharp wooden side) sensibility. The measurement locations will be standardized at specific positions from surgery location, and the same location (with respect to the surgery site) will be used for sensibility measurement for each patient visit. Both the area (diameter in cm) and the degree (scale form 0 (no complaints) to 10 (maximum complaints)) will be monitored. Additionally, patients' subjective sensibility judgment around surgery area on a scale of 0-10 will be recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain perception by patient</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Investigate and compare patient perceived pain.
For pain measurement, the patient is asked if pain around the implant is present. If it's present, duration is assessed (more or less than 6 weeks present). In addition, increase of pain is assessed during manipulation of the abutment (tightening of or tapping on the abutment). The patient is asked to score the perceived pain on a scale of 0-10; with 0 being no pain at all and 10 being the highest pain the patient had ever experienced.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Implant survivability</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Investigate and compare implant survivability.
Implant survivability is monitored by following upon patients and recording implant losses if and when they occur. The investigators do not expect multiple patients to have an implant loss. However, this may happen due to different reasons. The investigators would track the circumstances under which the implant loss occurred and the time between implant installation and loss.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgical wound healing time</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Investigate and compare healing time after surgery.
Follow-up visits after surgery will assess the healing of wound. This will be a yes/no assessment to be answered by the attending physician. The investigators will also evaluate skin reactions using the Holgers Scoring Scheme and record any medications that were given to aid in skin healing.</description>
