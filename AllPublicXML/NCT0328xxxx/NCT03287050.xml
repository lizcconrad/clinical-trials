    <time_frame>15 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will be determined by the proportion of subjects who receive 4 doses of pembrolizumab and at least one session of treatment of SBRT (Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy) within 15 weeks from the first dose of pembrolizumab.</description>

    <measure>The number of grades 3-5 drug related adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days post last dose</time_frame>
    <description>The number of grades 3-5 drug related adverse events (AEs) will be recorded. AEs will be graded using the CTCAE v4.03</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The percentage of patients that respond to treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>51 weeks (up to 17, 3 week doses)</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of patients that achieve either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Response will be reported separately using RECIST and irRECIST criteria.
CR (RECIST): Disappearance of all target lesions, determined by two separate observations conducted not less than 4 weeks apart. There can be no appearance of new lesions CR (irRECIST): Disappearance of all lesions in two consecutive observations not less than 4 wk apart PR (RECIST): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. There can be no appearance of new lesions PR (irRECIST): ≥50% decrease in tumor burden compared with baseline in two observations at least 4 wk apart</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival (PFS) time</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progressive disease (PD) or death, whichever occurs first. PFS will be reported separately using RECIST and irRECIST.
PD (RECIST): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions PD (irRECIST): At least 25% increase in tumor burden compared with nadir (at any single time point) in two consecutive observations at least 4 wk apart</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have a histologic diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma

          -  Subjects must have radiologic evidence of metastatic disease with measurable disease
             by RECIST 1.1 criteria other than the target lesion(s) for SBRT

          -  Subjects must have at least 1 metastatic lesion previously not radiated that is
             amenable to SBRT per treating radiation oncologist.

          -  Subjects must have had progression of disease within 12 months of platinum-containing
             chemotherapy (chemotherapy could have been given in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or
             metastatic setting) for urothelial cancer

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 to 2 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance
             Status: an attempt to quantify cancer patients' general well-being and activities of
             daily life. The score ranges from 0 to 5 where 0 is asymptomatic and 5 is death.)
