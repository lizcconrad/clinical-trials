  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial the measurement of whole body water will be compared to the standard method of
      measuring the body weight as treatment guidance in patients with decompensated heart failure.
      The Seca mBCA 515 [medical Body Composition Analyser] will be used to quantify the whole body
      water by using bioelectrical impedance analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will include 153 participants hospitalized in the University Hospital in Basel.
      Daily measurements of whole body water and body weight will be performed in each person until
      diuretic treatment is stopped or the patient is discharged from hospital, respectively.

      Primary endpoint is the correlation between reduction of whole body water (in kg) and
      reduction of body weight (in kg) in patients with decompensated heart failure receiving
      forced diuretic treatment (max. deviation +/- 1kg).

    <description>To provide a more exact comparison of total body water and body weight, fatty mass will be subtracted from the body weight. Subsequently the absolute difference between the reduction of the total body water (in kg) and the reduction of the body weight (in kg), in which fatty tissue (in kg) was subtracted, will be calculated (e.g. (BW day 1- FT day 1) - (BW day 2 - FT day 2) = reduction of BW without fatty tissue).</description>
