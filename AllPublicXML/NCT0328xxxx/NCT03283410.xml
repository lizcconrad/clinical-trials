  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Propofol's dose-response curve is know for the average adult but propofol's plasmatic
      concentration under total intravenous anesthesia differences between young and elderly must
      be modeled. Adaptative clinical trial (Dixon's Up and Down) for determination of ED95% of
      propofol concentration for hypnosis under general anesthesia for young and elderly adults.

      Propofol's dose-response curve is know for the average adult but propofol's plasmatic
      concentration under total intravenous anesthesia differences between young and elderly must
      be modeled. Method: adaptative clinical trial (Dixon's Up and Down method) for determination
      of ED95% of propofol concentration (plasmatic, Marsh model) for hypnosis (BIS ranging from 40
      to 60) under general anesthesia for young and elderly adults.
