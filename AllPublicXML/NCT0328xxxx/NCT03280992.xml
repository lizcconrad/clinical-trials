  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to constitute a prospective cohort of all the patients presenting
      to the adult emergencies of the University Hospital Centre (CHU) of Rennes for a septic
      syndrome of community origin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe septic syndrome (SSG) and septic shock (CS) are two frequent and serious complications
      of infectious diseases. In this context, the optimization of the management of septic
      patients from their reception in the emergency services must be a priority. However there are
      no predictors of progression or severity in patients admitted to emergencies despite the
      recommendations emphasizing the need for screening and early therapeutic management. Many
      scores have been proposed for intensive care unit but they remain difficult to extrapolate to
      other services because they are very comprehensive and require information that is difficult
      to obtain for emergency physicians.
