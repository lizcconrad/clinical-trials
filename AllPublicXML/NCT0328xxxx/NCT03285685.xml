      1. BACKGROUND: Temporomandibular Dysfunction (TMD) is a disease characterized by a set of
           signs and symptoms that may include joint noise, pain in the mastication muscles,
           limitation of mandibular movements, facial pain, joint pain and / or dental wear. Pain
           appears as a very present and striking symptom, with a tendency to chronicity. This is a
           difficult treatment condition often associated with psychological factors such as
           anxiety. Chronic pain involved modifications in the neuronal excitability, therefore,
           the neuromodulation withTranscranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) appears as a
           possible strategy for the treatment. Some studies have shown improvement in subjects
           with chronic pain using tDCS, however, it needs further investigation of its therapeutic
           effect.

        2. PROBLEM: Despite the wide range of strategies used to treat patients with TMD, some
           patients have a temporary and / or unsatisfactory relief response, which generates
           hypotheses that emotional components often underlie treatment refractoriness, and
           development of a memory for pain. Thus, it is evident the need for a therapy that acts
           directly on the central nervous system (CNS). This action can occur through medications,
           however, many individuals are refractory or have side effects such as dependence and /
           or tolerance. In this way, the importance of new treatments involving neuromodulation
           and neuroplasticity mechanisms, such as tDCS, is highlighted, which may become a
           complementary alternative to the different types of treatment already in use. Besides
           corroborating with the need to give preference to reversible and non-invasive
           procedures.

        3. HYPOTHESIS: The investigators believe that the use of anodic tDCS in the treatment of
           patients with TMD presenting with chronic pain will have a positive effect, promoting a
           decrease in painful symptoms through a Central Nervous System (neuromodulation) action
           in comparison to placebo stimulation. Because of the mutual influence between pain and
           psychological factors, it is expected that the analgesic effect will have a positive
           effect on anxiety levels. In addition, it is believed that a more intense analgesic
           effect occurs in the DLPF stimulation group of the cortex compared to the M1 stimulation
           group, since this region demonstrates to be responsible for the processing of the
           emotional component of the pain, often underlying the refractoriness to treatment

        4. AIM: To evaluate and compare the efficacy of anodic tDCS, applied in different cortical
           regions (M1 and DLPFC), in the pain and anxiety levels in individuals with chronic pain
           due muscular TMD.

    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analogic scale allows us to convert subjective sensations as pain on numerical data. A 10cm scale where 0cm is no pain and 10cm the worse imaginable pain, will be used and the subjects will be asked to mark a point on the scale representing their pain. This instrument will be used to compare the VAS values before and after the intervention.</description>

    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change Scale (PGICS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Global Impression of Change Scale (PGICS) is an understandable, adequate, easy-to-use instrument capable of measuring the perception of change in health status and satisfaction with the treatment of individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain. It is a one-dimensional measurement instrument in which individuals rate their improvement associated with intervention on a 7-item scale ranging from 1 (no change) to 7 (Much better).</description>

    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The STAI is used to evaluate objectively both aspects of anxiety: trait and state. Thus, the anxiety state will assess the level of anxiety at the specific time the test is performed and the anxiety trait will investigate the individual's willingness to react to stress situations. It is an instrument with 40 descriptive statements about the feelings of the person, distributed in two parts (trace and state of anxiety), in which each part is formed by 20 affirmations and the answers are given in scale of the type Likert of four points (1 - absolutely not the 4 - very much). The score in each questionnaire ranges from 20 to 80, with an anxiety level rating of: low (20 to 33), mean (33 to 49) and high (49 to 80).</description>
