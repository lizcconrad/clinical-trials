  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A control and a post-stroke subject with right-side chronic hemiparesis were studied. The
      post-stroke subject underwent 30 sessions of balance-perturbed training while walking on an
      instrumented treadmill where the Balance Assessment Robot (BAR™) randomly delivered pushes to
      pelvis in various directions at various speeds and at various perturbation amplitudes. The
      investigators assessed kinematics, kinetics, electromiography and spatio-temporal responses
      to outward-directed perturbations commencing either at foot contact of the left or the right
      leg.

    <description>Stroke survivor, 6mon post stroke resulting in right-sided hemiparesis, 53yrs old, had completed a 2mon rehabilitation program prior to the study. He underwent 30 training sessions with the Balance Assessment Robot (BAR™) within a 10-week period, each consisting of 10-15min of unperturbed treadmill and 30-45min of perturbation training. Perturbations were delivered in the forward, backward, left and right direction, occurring every 6sec, at the left leg initial contact and the right leg initial contact. Two training sessions were spent to determine adequate treadmill speed (0.4m/s) and perturbation amplitude (60N), followed by the first assessment session. After the last training session, assessment was repeated using the same parameters plus 90N perturbation amplitude.</description>

    <description>The BAR™ has got six degrees of freedom (DOF) that interface to the pelvis of a walking subject. Five DOFs (translation of pelvis in sagittal, lateral and vertical directions; pelvic rotation and pelvic list) are actuated and admittance-controlled, providing transparent haptic interaction with negligible power transfer; the remaining DOF (pelvic tilt) is passive. The BAR™ is capable of delivering perturbations in the directions forward/backward and left/right, but for the purpose of this study only &quot;outward&quot; perturbations in the frontal plane were considered.</description>
