  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized parallel study for evaluation of the efficacy and safety of
      long-term nocturnal high-flow nasal cannula therapy (HFNC: with the myAIRVO2 as HFNC in this
      study) in stable COPD patients with the global initiative for chronic obstructive lung
      disease (GOLD) stage 2-4, PaCO2 &gt;= 45 Torr and hypercapnia who require home oxygen therapy
      (HOT) using COPD exacerbation (Moderate or Severe).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An abroad study of the stable COPD patients was reported that HFNC usage decreased the
      frequency of COPD exacerbation.

      In addition, the result of the pilot study (NCT02545855) of the stable COPD patient in Japan
      is indicated that HOT with HFNC improved their QOL and PaCO2 by comparing to HOT only.

      Therefore, this study is planned to indicate the efficacy of HFNC which can increase the
      ventilation efficiency and have the function of heated humidification, by comparing HOT with
      HFNC to HOT only.
