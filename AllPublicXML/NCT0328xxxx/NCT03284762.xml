  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to collect additional information of Xarelto treatment in routine
      clinical practice. Patients affected by atrial fibrillation and who will get Xarelto as a
      prophylactic treatment against stroke and systemic embolism (Stroke Prevention in Atrial
      Fibrillation) will be observed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study takes place in Korea and Taiwan. Approximately a total of 1200 patients will be
      included in the study within 12 months. The observation period for each patient is 1 year
      from enrollment into the study, or until withdrawal of consent or lost to follow-up. Patients
      will be followed according to routine medical practice and the frequency of visits and
      procedures will be performed under routine conditions.
