  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of AUTO3, a CAR T cell treatment
      targeting CD19 and CD22 in paediatric or young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B
      cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 2 phases, a Phase I or dose escalation phase and a Phase II or
      expansion phase. Paediatric or young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B cell ALL
      will be enrolled in both phases of the study. Eligible patients will undergo leukapheresis in
      order to harvest T cells, which is the starting material for the manufacture of the
      autologous CAR T product AUTO3 which is a CD19 and CD22 dual targeting CAR T cell product.
      Following pre-conditioning by a chemotherapeutic regimen, the patient will receive AUTO3
      intravenously as a single or split dose and will then enter a 24-month follow-up period.
