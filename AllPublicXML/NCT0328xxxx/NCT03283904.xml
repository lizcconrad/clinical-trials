  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of AS:Sk is to improve physical activity levels and health-related outcomes of
      children from the Skelmersdale area of West Lancashire through a school-based physical
      activity multi-component intervention.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The multi-component intervention is the third and final phase of the AS:Sk project. It will
      be implemented and evaluated in four of the seven participating schools. The remaining three
      schools will act as controls and will not implement any physical activity intervention during
      the period of the research project. Schools will be randomly assigned to either intervention
      or control conditions. The multi-component intervention will involve multiple areas of the
      schools' curricula, environments, or policies being targeted. Decisions regarding these
      intervention components will be influenced by what was deemed effective, and feasible within
      phase 2 of the project. Phase 2 included a four week trial of three different single
      component physical activity interventions across all participating schools. Phase 3 will be
      implemented for at least eight weeks and if successful, it would then be rolled out in the
      control schools at the end of the project. Participants from both intervention and control
      schools will take part in the measures for evaluation in this third and final phase of the
      project.
