  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled study comparing the efficacy of cryolipolysis
      versus ATX-101 (deoxycholic acid) for the treatment of upper back fat. Participants currently
      living in the Chicago metropolitan area and meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      considered for enrollment. The treatment sites are the right and left upper back fat areas.
      The right and left sides of the upper back fat will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive
      cryolipolysis, while the contralateral side will receive ATX-101.

      This study was a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of this procedure.
