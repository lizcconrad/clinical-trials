  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, single-center, non-randomized, non-controlled study. This study aims
      to explore the effect of T-lymphocyte subsets changes in immunologic reconstitution and
      prognosis in lymphoma patients who were treated by autologous stem cell transplantation.

      High dose chemotherapy combined with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation is
      the consolidation treatment for advanced lymphoma patients and approved for treating
      recurrent and refractory lymphoma by prolonging progression-free survival significantly while
      also improving quality of life. Evidences to date, have validated that changes of
      T-lymphocyte subsets after autologous stem cell transplantation associated closely with
      immunologic reconstitution, and have produced amazing effects in prognosis. Whether
      T-lymphocyte subsets changes could serve as an effective index for prognosis has been a
      serious question for lymphoma patients treated by autologous stem cell transplantation. In
      this study, the investigators explore the changes of T-lymphocyte subsets in lymphoma
      patients before and after autologous stem cell transplantation, and evaluate the significant
      effect of T-lymphocyte subsets changes in immunologic reconstitution and prognosis in these
      patients.
