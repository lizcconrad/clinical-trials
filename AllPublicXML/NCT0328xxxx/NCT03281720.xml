  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine how feasible and accurate identifying and
      removing specific lymph nodes in the axilla (armpit) after neoadjuvant systemic therapy is
      when patients present with breast cancer that has spread to lymph nodes in the axilla. The
      specific lymph nodes removed would be determined at the time of diagnosis. If a biopsy proves
      that cancer has spread to a lymph node, a titanium clip will placed in it to mark it for
      future removal. That lymph node will be removed after systemic therapy and compared with the
      rest of the lymph nodes removed from that region.

    <description>After patients have completed their neoadjuvant systemic therapy, they will have a Savi Scout® electromagnetic reflector placed into the clipped axillary lymph nodes.
The surgeon will then use the Savi Scout detector intraoperatively to identify and remove your clipped lymph nodes prior to removing the remainder of the axillary lymph nodes in a surgery called an &quot;axillary dissection&quot;.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologic diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, clinical stage T0-3 N1-3 (maximum
             three abnormal axillary nodes on ultrasound exam) M0.

          2. Core needle biopsy (or fine needle aspiration (FNA)) of an axillary node documenting
             nodal disease at time of diagnosis and prior to preoperative systemic therapy or
             surgery. Clinical care marker clip placed in the abnormal axillary nodes identified at
             ultrasound at the time of core needle or FNA of an axillary node that documented nodal
             disease.

          3. Subjects must be undergoing neoadjuvant systemic therapy (or have just completed it)
             prior to the surgical intervention.

          4. No prior axillary lymph node surgery for pathological confirmation of axillary status.

          5. No nitinol (nickel-titanium) allergy. The Savi Scout ® marker device contains nitinol.

          6. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14
             days prior to receipt of chemotherapy. NOTE: Females are considered of child bearing
             potential unless they are surgically sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral
             tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are naturally postmenopausal for at
             least 12 consecutive months

          7. Females of childbearing potential must be willing to abstain from heterosexual
             activity or to use 2 forms of effective methods of contraception from the time of
             informed consent until 30 days after chemotherapy discontinuation. The two
             contraception methods can be comprised of two barrier methods, or a barrier method
             plus a hormonal method or an intrauterine device that meets &lt;1% failure rate for
             protection from pregnancy in the product label.

          8. As determined by the enrolling physician or protocol designee, ability of the subject
             to understand and comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active infection requiring systemic therapy

          2. Has a known additional malignancy that is active and/or progressive requiring
             treatment; exceptions include basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ
             cervical or bladder cancer.

          3. Any distant metastasis by imaging and biopsy (cM1)

          4. Patients not receiving neoadjuvant systemic therapy.
