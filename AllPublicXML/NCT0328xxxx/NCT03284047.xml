    <textblock>
      This is a two part study to measure and observe the efficacy of botulinum toxin A for the
      treatment of gummy smiles.

      Part A will randomly compare three different doses of botulinum toxin type A
      (abobotulinumtoxin A) for the treatment of upper anterior gummy smile with larger gingival
      exposure (&gt; 4 mm).

      Part B will assign one of two doses of botulinum toxin type A for participants with smaller
      gingival exposure (&lt; 4 mm).

      Follow-up visits with photography will occur 4 and 12 weeks after their treatment. Subjects
      currently living in the Chicago metropolitan area and meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will
      be considered for enrollment.

      This study is a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of this procedure.
