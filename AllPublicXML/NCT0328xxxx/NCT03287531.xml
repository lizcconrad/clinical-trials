      This study was to determine the effect of conventional therapy and low level laser therapy on
      pain and function in patients with temporomandibular joint dysfunction. sixty patients with
      myofascial pain syndrome of TMJ are randomly classified into two groups with thirty patients
      in each group; Group I received traditional exercise. Group II received low level laser
      therapy in addition to traditional exercise. All outcome measures including Pain and
      function, were evaluated before and after the treatment program.
