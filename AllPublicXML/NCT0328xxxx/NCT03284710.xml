      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immune response to an HIV clade C
      vaccine and to an MF59- or alum-adjuvanted clade C Env protein in healthy, HIV-uninfected
      adults.

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity to vCP2438 (an HIV
      clade C vaccine) and to an unadjuvanted or MF59- or alum-adjuvanted bivalent clade C gp120 in
      healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.

      The study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected participants aged 18 to 40 years. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to one of 4 groups. [describe further]

      Study visits will include a physical examination, an interview and/or questionnaire, HIV
      testing and HIV risk-reduction counseling, and urine and blood collection. A subset of
      participants will provide rectal fluid, cervical fluid, semen, or stool samples.

             control/placebo in an experimental vaccine trial, the HVTN 107 PSRT will determine
             eligibility on a case-by-case basis. For volunteers who have received an experimental
             vaccine(s) greater than 5 years ago, eligibility for enrollment will be determined by

               -  If a person has been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension during
                  screening or previously, exclude for blood pressure that is not well controlled.
                  Well-controlled blood pressure is defined as consistently ≤ 140 mm Hg systolic
                  and ≤ 90 mm Hg diastolic, with or without medication, with only isolated, brief
                  instances of higher readings, which must be ≤ 150 mm Hg systolic and ≤ 100 mm Hg
                  diastolic. For these volunteers, blood pressure must be ≤ 140 mm Hg systolic and
                  ≤ 90 mm Hg diastolic at enrollment.

               -  If a person has NOT been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension
                  during screening or previously, exclude for systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mm Hg
                  at enrollment or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mm Hg at enrollment.

         25. Bleeding disorder diagnosed by a doctor (eg, factor deficiency, coagulopathy, or
             platelet disorder requiring special precautions)

         26. Malignancy (Not excluded from participation: Volunteer who has had malignancy excised
             surgically and who, in the investigator's estimation, has a reasonable assurance of
             sustained cure. or who is unlikely to experience recurrence of malignancy during the
             period of the study)

         27. Seizure disorder: History of seizure(s) within past three years. Also exclude if
             volunteer has used medications in order to prevent or treat seizure(s) at any time
             within the past 3 years.

         28. Asplenia: any condition resulting in the absence of a functional spleen

         29. History of hereditary angioedema, acquired angioedema, or idiopathic angioedema.
