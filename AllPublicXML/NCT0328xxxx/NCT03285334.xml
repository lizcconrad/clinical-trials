      enrollment of the patient after diagnosis, radiographic evaluation, and signing the informed
      consent.

      allocation of the patient to either intervention or control group. After anaesthesia and
      access cavity, the first root canal sample will be taken. Endodontic treatment will be
      completed in one visit. The second root canal sample will be taken. Patients will be asked to
      evaluate their postoperative pain level using VAS scale at 6, 12, 24 hours, and daily up to 5
      days. Patients will record the number of analgesics if any taken.

      After diagnosing the case as asymptomatic pulp necrosis and confirming that the patient
      conforms to all eligibility criteria, (R.S) will enroll the patient in the study.

      the operator will complete treatment of all cases in single visit as following:

        1. Anesthetizing the tooth using inferior alveolar nerve block technique

        2. Removal of Caries and/or coronal restorations completely with sterile bur and rubber dam
           will be applied.

        3. Preparation of access cavity using another sterile round carbide bur size 3 and Endo-z
           bur .

        4. (R.S) will take the preinstrumentation root canal sample (S1)

        5. Confirming the patency of the root canals using stainless steel hand K-files size #10
           and #15 . Working length will be determined .

        6. In the intervention group, (R.S) will perform mechanical preparation in a 3D manner
           using Xp-endo Shaper single file in an endodontic motor at a speed of 800 rpm and a
           torque of 1 Ncm.

        7. In the control group, mechanical preparation will be done using rotary iRace files
           (#25/0.04, #30/0.04, and #40/0.04) at a speed of 600 rpm and a torque of 1.5 Ncm. The
           canal will be irrigated and recapitulated after the use of each instrument.

        8. EDTA gel will be used as a lubricant. The canals will be thoroughly irrigated using 3ml
           of 2.5% sodium hypochlorite.

        9. The canal will then be dried by using sterile paper points and then flushed with 5 ml of
           5% sodium thiosulfate to inactivate the NaOCl. The postinstrumentation sample (S2) will
           be taken from the canals.

       10. Master cones will be fitted to the working length and a radiograph will be taken to
           ensure proper length.

       11. (R.S) will complete obturation using AdSeal resin-based root canal sealer .

    <description>The intra-canal bacterial count will be determined using culture technique in the microbiological department, Cairo University. Samples in RTF vials will be dispersed with vortex for 30 seconds by the laboratory technician. The RTF solution will be serially diluted one-tenth dilution and spiral plated onto the agar medium. The plates will be incubated at 37â‚’c aerobically and anaerobically.
The resultant anaerobic growth will be quantified by evaluating the colony forming units (CFU) on the agar medium under the microscope and the number of CFU per milliliter of each dilution will be calculated for each sample.</description>
