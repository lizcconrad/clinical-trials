    <textblock>
      This Phase III study is designed to evaluate the activity and safety of KX2-391 Ointment in
      adult subjects when applied to an area of skin containg 4-8 stable, clinically typical
      Actinic Keratosis lesions on the face or scalp.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a double-blinded, multicenter, activity, and safety study of KX2-391
      Ointment administered topically to the face or scalp of subjects with actinic keratosis.

      The study consists of Screening, Treatment, Follow-up, and Recurrence Follow-up Periods.
      Eligible subjects will receive X consecutive days of topical treatment, to be applied at the
      study site. Activity (lesion counts) and safety evaluations will be performed.
