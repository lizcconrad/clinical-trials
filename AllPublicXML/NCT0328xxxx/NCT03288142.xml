  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators at Northwestern University will partner with Omron Healthcare Co., Ltd.
      (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Omron&quot;) to conduct a randomized controlled trial of a
      hypertension personal control program (HPCP), known as Lark HTN Pro with a home blood
      pressure monitoring device (HBMD) compared to a HBMD alone. The overarching goal of this
      study is to investigate the effects of the HPCP on blood pressure, blood pressure
      self-management behaviors, and healthy lifestyle behaviors among adults with hypertension.

    <description>The intervention group will receive all the interventions provided to the control group. In addition, intervention group participants will install on their mobile phone the hypertension personal control program (HPCP) (&quot;Lark HTN Pro&quot;), which is a smartphone application. The intervention group will have the HPCP installed on their iOS device during their initial office visit (screening/baseline) and will successfully take a reading from their HBMD. The HPCP has blood pressure, medication, and weight monitoring, including periodic reminders for the user to measure blood pressure, measure weight, and take their medication(s). The HPCP provides real-time feedback based on user input, such as out-of-range measurements and has additional features designed to encourage behavior change in areas such as dietary intake, physical activity, sleep, and stress reduction. Users can set goals and receive guidance and feedback through the app.</description>

    <description>Control group participants will be provided with a home blood pressure monitoring device (HBMD) (Omron BP761N Bluetooth Smart Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor) and will be instructed in its use at the baseline study visit. Participants will also receive an information sheet describing home blood pressure monitoring that gives advice for how to respond to different home readings. At the baseline visit, participants will be instructed to install an Omron application to their smart phone device (to monitor use of the HBMD). Participants will continue to receive all routine care, including anti-hypertensive medications as prescribed by their regular clinicians.</description>
