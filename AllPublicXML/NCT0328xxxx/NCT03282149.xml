      Preliminary Evaluation of Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of XT-150 for the Treatment of
      Osteoarthritic Pain.

      Subjects for whom replacement knee surgery is recommended will be enrolled in the study. A
      single injection of a DNA plasmid with a variant Interleukin-10 (IL-10) transgene will be
      injected into the synovial capsule of the knee.

      This is a first in human, dose-range, safety and efficacy study.

          1. Male or female, between 18 and 90 years of age, inclusive. Women who are not of
             child-bearing potential in the same age range.

          2. Sufficiently severe OA of knee to require/have recommended knee replacement surgery or
             be unsuitable for knee replacement surgery or be unsuitable for knee replacement
             surgery based on co-morbidities or orthopedic considerations; be free of local or
             intra-articular infection.

          3. Symptomatic disease because of osteoarthritis, defined as one or more of the following
             Verbal Numerical Rating Scale (VNRS) scores:

               1. a worst pain of at least 7 at any time during the preceding week (based on scale
                  of 0 to 10, with 10 representing &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;).

               2. a worst stiffness of at least 7 at any time during the preceding week (based on a
                  scale of 0 to 10, with 10 representing &quot;stiffness as bad as you can imagine&quot;).

          4. Stable analgesic regimen during the 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          5. Inadequate pain relief (mean &gt;5 mean on Brief Pain Inventory-Severity Scale) from
             prior therapies lasting 3 months.

          6. In the judgment of the Investigator, acceptable general medical condition

          7. Life expectancy &gt;6 months

          8. Male participants who are heterosexually active and not surgically sterile must agree
