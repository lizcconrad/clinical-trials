      The Bentley InnoMed &quot;BeGrow Stent System for Newborns and Infants&quot; is a stent delivery system
      indicated for intraluminal placement in the pulmonary arteries of newborns and infants for
      the treatment of Pulmonary Artery Stenosis.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Single lesion(s) which can be treated with a 6 mm BeGrow stent (only one stent per
             lesion allowed).

          -  Pulmonary artery stenosis - patient must at least have one of the following diseases:

               -  Haemodynamically relevant proximal or distal branch pulmonary artery stenosis
                  with a reduction of the vessel diameter when the vessel/patient is large enough
                  to accommodate a stent,

               -  Haemodynamically relevant stenosis of the main pulmonary artery segment that
                  results in elevation of the Right Ventricle (RV) pressure, provided that the
                  stent definitely will not compromise a functioning pulmonary valve and will not
                  impinge on the pulmonary artery bifurcation,

               -  Any degree of stenosis in patients with single ventricle circulation

               -  Critically ill postoperative cardiac patients when it has been determined that
                  branch pulmonary artery stenosis is resulting in a definite haemodynamic
                  compromise in a patient/vessel of any size, particularly if balloon dilatation is
                  unsuccessful

          -  Signed written informed consent (by parents/legal guardians)

          -  Lesion can be accessed with a guide wire or balloon catheter

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The following lesions are excluded from treatment with BeGrow stent:

               -  Shunt stenosis

               -  Valvular and subvalvular pulmonary stenosis

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to the stent material (L605 cobalt-chromium).

          -  Patients too small (weight &lt; 2 kg) to allow safe delivery of the stent

          -  Patients with clinical or biological signs of infection.

          -  Patients with active endocarditis

          -  Patients with known allergy to acetylsalicylic acid, other antiplatelet agents or
             heparin.

          -  Presence of other previously implanted stents in the same lesion or in close proximity
             to stent (direct stent-stent contact)

          -  Patients with known coagulation disorder
