  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of CHRP-BB - an integrated
      bio-behavioral approach that incorporates the use of PrEP - with an evidence-based behavioral
      approach aimed at enhancing PrEP adherence and HIV risk reduction among high risk PWUD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PWUD remain a priority population as they represent a critical conduit for new HIV
      infections, which are transmitted through preventable drug- and sex-related HIV risk
      behaviors. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) - the daily self-administration of antiretroviral
      medication - has enormous potential to bolster primary HIV prevention outcomes among PWUD.
      PrEP is a FDA-approved biomedical HIV prevention strategy recommended by the CDC and WHO for
      key populations, including PWUD. Despite unequivocal evidence supporting PrEP, its scale-up
      has been nearly absent among high risk PWUD. Moreover, adherence to PrEP is crucial if it is
      to be effective with high risk individuals. Recent research, however, indicates that optimal
      PrEP adherence may be compromised by neurocognitive impairment (NCI), particularly among
      PWUD. Due to chronic drug use, related lifestyle experiences, and other health challenges,
      many PWUD experience NCI to the extent that it impedes medication adherence, HIV risk
      reduction, and treatment retention. In a recent HIV prevention trial, over a third of high
      risk PWUD on opioid replacement therapy (ORT) had moderate to high levels of NCI and,
      moreover, were less likely to reduce their HIV transmission risk vs. those without NCI. The
      potentially disruptive impact of NCI must therefore be addressed when designing contemporary
      intervention strategies targeting PWUD. Contemporary approaches must also be cost-effective
      and usable in real-world treatment settings, such as methadone maintenance programs (MMPs)
      where high risk PWUD are concentrated and can be readily reached with primary prevention. To
      date, however, primary prevention efforts have largely relied on singular strategies (e.g.,
      methadone or PrEP alone) with modest HIV risk reduction outcomes for PWUD. Instead, advancing
      combination approaches capable of harnessing the synergy and efficiency possible via multiple
      evidence-based strategies is most effective. This combination strategy is especially
      important when intervening with high risk PWUD with NCI due to the potential decreased
      effectiveness of PrEP when adherence is suboptimal, thereby necessitating behavioral
      interventions that focus on reducing HIV risk and increasing PrEP adherence. Building on
      promising preliminary work, the proposed trial will fill a critical void by testing an
      integrated bio-behavioral approach that incorporates the use of PrEP with an evidence-based
      behavioral approach and, using innovative strategies, enhances PrEP adherence and HIV risk
      behavior in a manner that accommodates NCI among PWUD.

    <description>A self-reported assessment will measure several aspects of HIV risk-taking behaviors, including a measurement of any high risk behavior (sexual or injection-related) as well as measurements of event-level (i.e., partner-by-partner) behaviors. &quot;Any&quot; risk behavior will be dichotomously parsed as those who have engaged in HIV transmission risk behaviors with those of unknown or HIV negative status. Urine toxicology tests will also be used to collect substance use data.</description>

    <description>Patients assigned to the CHRP-BB will receive a weekly HIV risk reduction and PrEP adherence group level intervention led by two facilitators trained and supervised by the PI, a licensed clinical psychologist. It is a substantially shortened version of the comprehensive Holistic Health Recovery Program (HHRP)-based interventions that have been identified as demonstrating evidence of effectiveness in two randomized clinical trials. The CHRP-BB, which includes four 50-minute groups (1 group per week), will contain only content that relates explicitly to drug- or sex-related HIV risk reduction and PrEP adherence. Participants in both conditions will receive routine clinical services (i.e., daily methadone and case management).</description>

    <description>The time-and-attention-matched control condition for the proposed research will be a time and contact-matched, non-contaminating support group for individuals in recovery modeled after similar groups offered in the community. There will be no overlap between the content of the comparison intervention and experimental intervention although the basic structure will be the same. Thus, each participant will be asked to attend four 50-minute weekly group sessions led by two trained facilitators. Participants in both conditions will receive routine clinical services (i.e., daily methadone and case management).</description>

    <description>The CHRP-BB intervention is a theory-based, manual-guided, HIV risk reduction and PrEP adherence intervention. It is an integrated evidence-based intervention that uses a coping skills training approach to primary prevention and is delivered in a small group modality by two trained intervention facilitators using a motivational enhancement therapeutic style to address high risk drug- and sex-related HIV risk behaviors and PrEP adherence. Importantly, the CHRP-BB intervention includes specific behavioral and mHealth strategies designed and tested to accommodate difficulties stemming from moderate to severe neuro-cognitive impairment (NCI).</description>
