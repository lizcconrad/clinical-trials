      This study evaluates the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of cobimetinib and HM95573
      in patient with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib, open label, multicenter dose escalation study designed to assess the
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of oral dosing of cobimetinib and HM95573
      administered in combination in patients with histologically/cytologically confirmed, locally
      advanced, or metastatic solid tumors with RAS- or RAF-mutation for which standard therapies
      either do not exist or have proven ineffective or intolerable. Treatment will continue until
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any other discontinuation criterion is met.

      There are two stages of this study: Stage 1, a standard 3+3 dose escalation, and Stage 2, an
      indication specific dose expansion. Stage 1 is designed to establish the combination MTD for
      cobimetinib and HM95573. To acquire additional safety and PD data to more fully inform dose
      selection, up to six additional patients may be enrolled to backfill cohorts at dose levels
      that have been shown to not exceed the MTD.In Stage 2, the potential RP2D will be
      investigated in five indication specific expansion cohorts.
