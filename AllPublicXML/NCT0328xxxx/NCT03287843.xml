  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to compare the outcomes of early versus late surgical resection in patients
      who underwent curative total mesorectal excision after neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Half of
      the participants will undergo surgery before 8 weeks, while the other half will undergo
      surgery after 8 weeks.
