  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ prolapse(POP) is a common health problem and has significant negative effects on
      woman's quality of life. Transvaginal mesh procedure is a durable reconstructive surgery, but
      the mesh kits are expensive for underdeveloped countries. Our preliminary trial showed that
      the use of self-tailored mesh had good success rate (91.8% at 1-year follow-up) and low
      complication rate. The trial is designed to compare self-tailored titanium-coated
      polypropylene mesh procedure with mesh-kit in the treatment of POP stage III-IV in terms of
      efficacy, safety and cost-effective .

      The trial is a randomized controlled multi-center non-inferiority trial. The primary outcome
      measure is success rate at 1-year follow-up. The second outcomes are subjective improvement
      of quality of life, complications and costs. Analysis will be performed according to the
      intention to treat principle. Based on comparable success rate of 90% and 10% as the
      margin(beta 0.2 and one sided alpha 0.025), about 312 patients in total from 11 centers will
      be recruited per group including 10% drop-out. The aims of the research are to demonstrate
      whether self-tailored mesh is non-inferior to the mesh-kit. The finding of this research
      might influence the treatment selection for POP in China.

    <description>Subjects will be considered a success if they meet the definitions of anatomic cure and deny vaginal bulging symptoms, and no additional treatment for prolapse(surgical or pessary use).
Anatomic cure is defined as leading edge above the hymen (i.e Ba, C, Bp&lt;0 cm) Symptomatic cure is defined as the absence of vaginal bulge symptoms as indicated by a negative response question 3 of the pelvic floor distress inventory- 20 (PFDI-20): &quot;Do you usually have a bulge or something falling out that you can see or feel in your vaginal area?</description>

    <description>This procedure is transvaginal mesh implantation surgery for POP patients. Self-cut mesh procedure is an economic pelvic reconstructive surgical operation with use of specially designed puncture needles and self-cut mesh, which mainly provide anterior and apical compartments support, with posterior compartment reinforced by bridge technique repair. The mesh pieces used in this surgery was cut from a single piece of mesh material(TiLOOP 10*15cm) which is much cheaper and readily available. Patients could have transvaginal hysterectomy concomitantly.</description>
