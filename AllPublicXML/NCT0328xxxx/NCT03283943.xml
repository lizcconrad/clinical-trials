  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is postulated that focal sensitizing radiotherapy may potentiate the effectiveness of
      durvalumab. The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of 2 different
      dose levels of focal sensitizing radiation therapy given with durvalumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Durvalumab is a PDL-1 inhibitor, part of class of agents (called checkpoint inhibitors)
      designed to increase the ability of the immune system to recognize and work to eliminate
      cancers. Checkpoint inhibitors have been studied in recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal and
      Fallopian cancers, and on their own show a low level of activity.

      Radiation therapy is usually used in women with recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal and
      Fallopian cancers to palliate symptoms related to progressive disease. However, radiation is
      know to modify the cancer immune environment and to release tumour antigens. These actions
      may potentiate the function of immune checkpoint inhibitors.
