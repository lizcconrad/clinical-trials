  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Measurement of plasma chromogranin A remains the most commonly used biomarkers for both
      screening and monitoring of patients with gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours
      (GEP-NET), despite several limitations that include: lack of a reference CgA standard; wide
      variations depending on the used assay in different laboratories; and varying sensitivity
      ranges from 60 to 90% with low specificity &lt;50%, depending on the population studied.

      Surprisingly, and to the best of our knowledge, only three studies with small numbers of
      participants have been published that have investigated possible effects of food intake on
      the measurement of CgA. Most have been performed in healthy controls or patients on treatment
      with proton pump inhibitors for chronic gastritis (up to n = 11 per group) but only one study
      has investigated patients with GEP-NET, where n = 6 patients with gastric NET were included.

      In this study, the investigators aim to assess the time dependent effects of normally
      ingested diet (5-item English breakfast; or tea or coffee; or ongoing fasted state) on plasma
      chromogranin A measurements, using timed measurements over 180 min following an &gt; 10 hours
      overnight fast, in a randomised double-crossover design. The investigators aimed to include
      25 - 35 patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of a GEP-NET of varying primary
      tumour location, tumour stage, grade; and presence or absence of treatment with long acting
      somatostatin analogues; as well as 10 - 15 healthy controls. In an additional small subgroup
      of patients who are initiated on treatment with GLP-1 analogues i.e. for type 2 diabetes or
      obesity, the investigators aim to establish whether injection of GLP-1 analogues has any
      effects on plasma CgA measurements.
