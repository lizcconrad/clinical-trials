  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context: Psychiatric disorders (anorexia nervosa, depression, anxiety based school refusal)
      are a major public health concern in adolescence. Their treatment is a challenge for the
      families, the health care system and society. The treatment is complex and non-standardized.
      In clinical practice, the relational dimension between the stakeholders is recognized by all.
      Nevertheless no study has ever crossed their perspectives about therapeutic alliance in
      adolescent psychiatry.

      Objective: to explore, within a qualitative approach, how a therapeutic alliance is
      established in three different clinical situations according to the adolescents, their
      parents and their physicians by crossing their perspectives.

      Methods: This is a national (France) multi-center qualitative study based on 180
      semi-structured interviews. Participants (purposively selected until data saturation) came
      from three different sub-samples: (i) adolescents with anorexia nervosa (N =20) plus their
      parents (N=20) and their physicians (N=20), (ii) adolescents with depressions (N=20) plus
      their parents (N=20) and their physicians (N=20), and (iii) adolescents with anxiety-based
      school refusal (N=20) plus their parents (N=20) and their physicians (N=20). Data are
      collected through open ended semi structured interviews and independently analyzed with NVivo
      V.11 software by three researchers according to the principles of Interpretative
      Phenomenological Analysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  adolescents, boys and girls, aged 12 to 18 years, speaking fluent French, with (i)
             anorexia nervosa according to DSM 5 criteria (ii) depressive disorders (dysthymia,
             depressive episode) according to DSM 5 criteria (iii) anxiety-based school refusal
             according to four criteria:

               1. refusal to attend school (to operationalize this first criterion, adolescents
                  were included if they had not attended school at all for at least one month
                  before starting treatment); (2) presence of a DSM-5 anxiety disorder (except
                  obsessive-compulsive or post-traumatic stress disorders) with emotional upset at
                  the prospect of attending school; (3) absence of a DSM-5 conduct disorder; and
                  (4) parental knowledge of the adolescent's whereabouts during the period of
                  non-attendance.

                  that led to treatment that had begun at least six months earlier and clinically
                  determined to be well enough to participate in a research interview.

          -  receiving treatment for at least 6 months

          -  one parent at least agrees to participate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  acute symptoms and serious somatic and/or psychiatric co-morbidities
