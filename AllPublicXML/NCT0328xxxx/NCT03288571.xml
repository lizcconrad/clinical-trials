      Wharton Jelly derived Mesenchymal stem cells will be injected in the renal parenchyma of
      patients with Diabetic Nephropathy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mesenchymal stem cells are to be isolated from Umbilical cord Wharton's Jelly obtained after
      normal full term delivery.

      Samples will be tested for any bacterial or fungal growth as well as endotoxin and
      mycoplasma. The specific markers for MSCs identification will be analyzed by flow cytometry.

      Cell suspension will then be injected in the renal parenchyma of patients diagnosed with
      diabetic nephropathy.
