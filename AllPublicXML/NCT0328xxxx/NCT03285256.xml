  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective memory is the ability to implement an intention to the future (e.g. remember to
      take medication, attend a scheduled meeting), and has receive little attention in addiction.
      The investigators propose that prospective memory plays a critical, yet unrecognized, role in
      major human behavior change such as that required in addiction treatment. This study will
      determine the preliminary efficacy of prospective memory training in improving memory and
      executive functions while reducing illicit drug use in methadone patients. Participants will
      be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: an experimental memory training program or
      one of two comparator memory training programs.

    <description>The experimental memory training will be implemented as a computer program that uses state-of-the-art immersive technology to simulate prospective memory in everyday life in which one must remember to carry out tasks throughout the day, while engaging in current ongoing activity. Participants are asked to imagine they have a work-at-home job (ongoing activity), which is an independent program (CogMed QM) designed to train working memory, but that they also need to remember to carry out a number of tasks throughout the day. Using a touch screen, participants will need to touch objects in the simulated environment to appropriately interact with these stimuli according to their pre-assigned tasks.</description>
