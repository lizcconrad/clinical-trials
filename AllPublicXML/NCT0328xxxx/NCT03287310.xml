  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK3511294 is a humanized monoclonal antibody antagonist of Interleukin (IL)-5 which is known
      to block binding of IL-5 to the IL-5 receptor complex, causing a reduction in the circulating
      population of eosinophils. This is a single ascending dose FTIH study to investigate safety,
      tolerability, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of GSK3511294,
      administered SC in subjects with mild to moderate asthma maintained on a low-medium daily
      dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or ICS/long acting beta-agonist (LABA), and short
      acting beta-agonist (SABA). The subjects will attend a pre-screen visit of up to 12 weeks
      before dosing for assessment of blood eosinophils. Eligible subjects with blood eosinophils
      &gt;=200 cells per microliter (cells/ÂµL) will undergo a screening period of up to 4 weeks. The
      subjects will then be randomized into 5 cohorts. In each cohort, the subjects will be
      randomized to receive a single dose of GSK3511294 or placebo in a ratio of 3:1. The follow-up
      period will be up to 40 weeks post dose and will be dose-dependent. The scheduled maximum
      duration for each subject will be up to 44 weeks including up to 28 days of screening.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a multi-center, double-blind study in which subjects will be allocated to five cohorts. The subjects in each cohort will be randomized to receive GSK3511294 and placebo in a ratio of 3:1. In each cohort, dosing will be staggered: one subject will receive GSK3511294 and one subject will receive placebo at least 72 hours before the remaining subjects in that cohort are dosed. The remaining subjects will be dosed if the review of all safety data up to 72 hours after dosing of the first two subjects in each cohort is satisfactory.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects should be between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing
             the informed consent.

          -  Blood eosinophils of &gt;= 200 cells/ÂµL at screening.

          -  A physician diagnosis of asthma (mild or moderate, as defined by the Global Initiative
             for Asthma [GINA], 2017) at least 12 months prior to the start of the study. The
             reason for diagnosis of asthma should be documented in the subject's source data,
             including relevant history and investigations - specifically evidence of airway
             hyper-responsiveness, airflow variation (peak flow rate or forced expiratory volume in
             one second [FEV1]) or reversible airflow obstruction.

          -  Historical evidence of airway hyper-responsiveness, airflow variation (peak flow rate
             or FEV1) or reversible airflow obstruction should be recorded in the subject's source
             data. If historical evidence of airway hyper-responsiveness, airflow variation (peak
             flow rate or FEV1) or reversible airflow obstruction is not available the subject may
             be included if there is evidence of reversibility on pre-screening or screening.

          -  A screening pre-bronchodilator FEV1 &gt;= 60% of predicted normal value.

          -  Asthma Control Test score &gt; 19.
