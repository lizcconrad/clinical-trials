  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critical power is an important threshold in exercise physiology, and is an important
      determinant of the ability to tolerate high-intensity exercise. The ability to tolerate such
      exercise is drastically impaired in certain chronic conditions, such as type 1 diabetes.
      Whilst the most important physiological factors that determine critical power have yet to be
      determined, previous work from our laboratory suggests that it is related to the speed of
      oxygen uptake at the onset of exercise. This study will look to utilise &quot;priming&quot; exercise as
      an intervention to improve the speed of these oxygen uptake &quot;kinetics&quot;, and thus critical
      power and exercise tolerance in individuals with type 1 diabetes. We hypothesize that oxygen
      uptake kinetics will be faster and critical power will be higher when exercise is performed
      with compared to without a prior bout of high-intensity priming exercise in a population of
      individuals with type 1 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ability to tolerate high-intensity exercise, or exercise tolerance, is a key factor that
      can influence clinical outcomes in a range of conditions. The &quot;critical power&quot; is an
      important physiological threshold that demarcates exercise intensities that can be sustained
      for prolonged periods (i.e. below critical power) from intensities that result in exhaustion
      in a relatively short period of time (i.e. 2-30 minutes, above critical power). Critical
      power is therefore a key determinant of exercise tolerance. The speed with which oxygen
      uptake rises at the onset of exercise (i.e. oxygen uptake &quot;kinetics&quot;) has been shown by work
      from our laboratory to be a key determinant of critical power. One intervention that can
      acutely improve the oxygen uptake kinetics is the performance of a prior bout of
      high-intensity exercise, known as &quot;priming exercise&quot;. Patients with type 1 diabetes have
      previously been shown to have impaired exercise tolerance compared to healthy controls. The
      performance of priming exercise therefore represents a potential intervention to acutely
      improve oxygen uptake kinetics, and therefore critical power and exercise tolerance, in type
      1 diabetic individuals. The purpose of this study is therefore to assess the influence of
      priming exercise on oxygen uptake kinetics and critical power in a population of type 1
      diabetic individuals.
