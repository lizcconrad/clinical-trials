  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Elastin is a unique protein providing elasticity, resilience and deformability to
      dynamic tissues, such as lungs and vasculature. Elastin fibers are characterized by their
      high affinity for calcium. However, calcified elastin is more prone to the degrading effects
      of proteases and, in turn, partially degraded elastin has an even higher affinity for
      calcium. A disturbed balance between proteases and anti-proteases is a major underlying
      mechanism in the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Virtually the
      only protein that can protect elastin from calcification is matrix Gla-protein (MGP), which
      needs vitamin K for its activation. In COPD patients, a lower vitamin K status is found when
      compared to control subjects and an inverse association exists between vitamin K status and
      elastin degradation. In addition, vitamin K status is lower and elastin degradation is
      accelerated in Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) users.

      VKAs are widely used. Nowadays, an increasing number of patients uses direct oral
      anticoagulants (DOACs), which do not influence vitamin K status. The hypothesis of this study
      is that discontinuation of VKAs results in an improved vitamin K status and deceleration of
      elastin degradation. In order to test this hypothesis, an observational pilot study will be
      conducted in which the change in elastin degradation- quantified by plasma desmosine
      concentrations - in patients who discontinue use of VKAs will be used as primary endpoint.

      Study design: Observational study. Study population: A total of 30 VKA users who will
      discontinue the use of VKAs. Elastin degradation rate (quantified by plasma desmosine levels)
      and vitamin K status (quantified by measuring plasma levels of dephosphorylated
      uncarboxylated (dp-uc)MGP) will be measured during the use of VKAs and approximately 6 months
      after discontinuation of VKAs. Furthermore, the VKORC1 polymorphisms will be determined.

      Main study parameters: The primary endpoint is the change in the rate of elastin degradation
      quantified by the plasma desmosine assay. Secondary endpoints are the change in vitamin K
      status quantified by measuring plasma levels of dp-ucMGP, the relation between desmosine and
      dp-ucMGP and differences of desmosine and dp-ucMGP levels among subjects with different
      polymorphisms of the vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductase complex 1 (VKORC1) gene.

    <description>Approximately 6 months after discontinuation of VKAs one additional venipuncture will be performed for determination of dp-ucMGP and desmosine.
At baseline two additional blood collection tubes will be drawn for determination of dp-ucMGP, desmosine and VKORC1 polymorphisms. Since this is during one of the last regular International Normalized Ratio (INR) testing at the anticoagulation clinic, no additional venipuncture has to be performed at this moment.</description>
