      The postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding were selected in this cross-sectional study.
      The basic characteristics information and endometrial blood flow energy index of endometrium
      were detected by color power Doppler ultrasound, and the energy histogram of endometrium was
      obtained. The specimen of uterine cytology and endometrial tissue were obtained through
      minimally invasive endometrium sampler, which were diagnosed by pathology. The statistical
      data were used to detect endometrial and precancerous lesions to observe the endpoint, and to
      provide the energy histogram model of the early warning endothelial diseases.

      The postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding are selected in this cross-sectional study.
      The uterine bleeding in patients with blood system diseases, reproductive organ outside the
      uterus, other organs cancer metastasis to the uterus are excluded. The objects are divided
      into two groups(patients with endometrial benign diseases and patients with endometrial
      cancer and precancerous diseases) according to endometrial cytological and histological
      pathology. The endometrial thickness, basic characteristics information and endometrial blood
      flow energy index, endometrial vascularization index, blood flow index are detected by color
      power Doppler and the energy histogram of endometrium is obtained using a Voluson E8 (GE
      Medical Systems, USA) ultrasound system. Moreover,The specimen of uterine cytology and
      endometrial tissue are obtained through minimally invasive endometrium sampler, which were
      diagnosed by pathology.
