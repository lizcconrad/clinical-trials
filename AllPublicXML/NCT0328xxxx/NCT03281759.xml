  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate early and delayed effects of Transcranial LED
      Therapy (TCLT) and determinate whether this therapy is effective for cognitive rehabilitation
      of Diffuse Axonal Injury patients after Traumatic Brain Injury.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial of patient with diffuse axonal injury (DAI) secondary to
      severe Traumatic Brain Injury in its acute stage (less than 8h). It will be recruited thirty
      adult patients who will receive thirty minutes at three times per week for 6 weeks (18
      sessions) of transcranial stimulation. Fifteen of them will be stimulated with LED helmet and
      the rest with a sham helmet identical to the LED one, but only with a similar red light
      emission. Patient who meet inclusion criteria will be assessed with Glasgow Outcome Scale
      Extended (GOS-E) evaluation in at least five different periods (Admission, before and after
      each stimulation, and at 3 and 6 months later in outpatient followup).
