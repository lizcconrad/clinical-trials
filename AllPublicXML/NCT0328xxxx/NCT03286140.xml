  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EVRA study evaluates the effects of early endovenous ablation on ulcer healing in
      patients with chronic venous ulceration. Half the patients are randomised to receive early
      endovenous ablation (within 2 weeks) and half to standard care
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large number of patients (around 1% of the adult population) suffer from an ulcer (break in
      the skin surface) near the ankle. In most people, such an injury should heal up within a week
      or two. However, when there is an underlying problem with the skin, ulcers do not heal and
      may result in longstanding (chronic), painful, smelly and embarrassing wounds. The ulcers are
      often due to varicose veins in the legs, which can cause skin breakdown and ulcer formation.
      To get the ulcer to heal, the current best treatment is to wear a tight compression bandage
      with multiple layers, with which about 60% of these ulcers will heal within 24 weeks. There
      is evidence that treatment of the varicose veins by surgery will prevent the ulcer from
      returning after it has healed. Recent studies have suggested that newer techniques of
      treating varicose veins, such as injecting a medicine into the varicose vein (sclerotherapy)
      or treating the vein with heat ablation to seal it (using laser or radiofrequency), in an
      outpatient setting may help the ulcers to heal more quickly and (like surgery) reduce the
      chance of the ulcer coming back. These techniques can be carried out in the outpatient
      setting and are much better tolerated by patients in comparison to surgery. The aim of this
      study is to see whether early treatment of varicose veins using sclerotherapy or heat
      ablation helps with healing.

Resource use will be multiplied by UK unit costs obtained from published literature, HRG costs, and manufacturers' list prices to calculate overall costs. A standard tariff will be applied for each bandage change. Utilities (QALYs) will be calculated from the EQ-5D questionnaire administered to patients</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Current leg ulceration of greater than 6 weeks, but less than 6 months duration

          -  Able to give informed consent to participate in the study after reading the patient
             information documentation

          -  Patient age &gt; 18 years

          -  Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) ≥ 0.8

          -  Superficial venous disease on colour duplex assessment deemed to be significant enough
             to warrant ablation by the treating clinician (either primary or recurrent venous
             reflux)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of deep venous occlusive disease or other conditions precluding superficial
             venous intervention (at the discretion of local research team)

          -  Patients who are unable to tolerate any multilayer compression bandaging / stockings
             will be excluded. However, concordance with compression therapy can be variable for
             patients at different times. Patients who are generally compliant with compression,
             but unable to tolerate the bandages for short periods will still be eligible to
             inclusion. A period of non-compliance with compression bandages will not be considered
             a protocol violation, but a normal variation within the spectrum of 'standard
             therapy'.

          -  Inability of the patient to receive prompt endovenous intervention by recruiting
             centre

          -  Pregnancy (female participants of reproductive age will be eligible for inclusion in
             the study, subject to a negative pregnancy test prior to randomisation)

          -  Leg ulcer of non-venous aetiology (as assessed by responsible clinician)

          -  Patient deemed to require skin grafting
