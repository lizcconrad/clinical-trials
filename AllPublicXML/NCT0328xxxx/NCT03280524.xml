    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled and blind clinical trial with 60 type 2 diabetes patients
      divided into 2 groups of 30 patients each, Control Group (CG) and Treatment Group (TG). The
      TG will receive self-care guidelines with feet and 12 sessions of foot reflexology, while the
      CG will only receive the guideline.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of reflexology on the quality of life
      and functional capacity of patients at risk for diabetic neuropathy. This is a randomized,
      controlled and blind clinical trial with type 2 diabetes patients. The eligibility criteria
      are 10 years or more of diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, between the ages of 50 to 75 years,
      both sexes, and registered in the Primary Health Care Unit of São João or in the Diabetes
      Education Center in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. As exclusion criteria, it will be considered
      the presence of ulcers in the feet, amputations of the lower limbs, deficits in cognitive
      abilities, and previous treatment using reflexology. For the calculation of the sample size,
      a pilot test will be conducted with 8 diabetic patients. It will be used the statistical
      software Biostat® 5.3. The sample found was of 60 patients who were divided into 2 groups of
      30 patients each, Control Group (CG) and Treatment Group (TG). The TG will receive self-care
      guidelines with feet and 12 sessions of foot reflexology, while the CG will only receive the
      guideline. For the evaluations, it will be applied the instrument for quality of life (SF-36)
      and for functional capacity, the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire. This research will
      follow the standards set by resolution 466/12 of the National Health Council, for research
      with human beings and will be conducted in accordance with the ethical recommendations of the
      Declaration of Helsinki.

    <intervention_model_description>The patients will be taken to a room reserved for the procedure. First, the patients answer the research instruments and then they will be asked to lie supine on a stretcher. The feet of the patients will be cleaned with water (37ºC) and mild soap and then will be dry with paper towels. The next phase consists in the application of foot massage, that will follow the Lourenço's Protocol (2012), which consists of 14 steps of relaxation massage. Each step will have duration of 1 minute, 3 procedures by week, by 4 consecutive weeks. The research instruments, SF-36 and Stanford Health Assessment Questionnarie will be applied before the first and after the last procedure.</intervention_model_description>
