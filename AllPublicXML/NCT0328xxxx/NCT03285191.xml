  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease affecting the joints and
      can lead to joint pain, swelling, redness and stiffness and can cause deformity, loss of
      strength and immobility. This cross-sectional qualitative study aims to explore the burden of
      established RA by conducting semi-structured Concept elicitation (CE) interviews (60 minutes
      duration) and real-time data capture task. The conceptual model developed from this data will
      be used to support the development of GSK3196165, a recombinant human monoclonal antibody
      (mAb) targeted for the treatment of RA. The CE interviews will explore the subject experience
      of RA and will collect information about symptoms, disease impact on functioning and health
      related quality of life (HRQoL), and treatment experiences/impacts of the condition and the
      language used by subjects to describe them. Following the CE interview, subjects will be
      asked to complete a brief symptom ranking exercise where they will need to rank how
      bothersome each RA symptom is and how important it would be to improve with treatment on a
      1-5 numerical rating scale (NRS). After the interviews, the real-time disease experience of
      subjects will be captured by the real-time data capture app-based activity over a period of 7
      days. Approximately 30 English-speaking subjects from the United States (US) with RA who are
      inadequate responders of conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs
      (csDMARDs) and/or (bDMARDs) will participate in the interviews and of these, 10 subjects will
      be offered the opportunity to participate in the real-time data capture sub study.

    <description>A subgroup of ten of the thirty subjects participating in the CE interviews will be asked to take part in the real-time data capture task over the course of 7 days and during this time a series of 5-7 questions/tasks will be asked to subjects via the application to explore the experience of the symptoms, HRQoL impacts, treatment of RA and any day-to-day variability that exists in real time'.</description>

    <description>Data obtained from the CE interviews and real-time data capture as well as literature reviews will be used to develop a conceptual model for RA. Symptom, impact, and treatment concepts which have been identified will be grouped into domains and displayed visually and any identified relationships or trends between domains will also be included in the model. A contents key will be developed to show the source of the concept.</description>
