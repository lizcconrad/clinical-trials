  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean deliveries are the most commonly performed surgery in the United States and account
      for 32.9% of all births.8,9 The ASA recommends the use of neuraxial opioids of post-cesarean
      analgesia partly because respiratory depression in the obstetric population, as measured by
      intermittent respiratory rate and pulse oximetry, is reported to be low (0-1.2%).10,11
      Respiratory depression lacks a standard definition,12 but the most sensitive means of
      detecting respiratory depression is hypercapnia.1,3 Two recent studies using continuous
      hypercapnia (&gt;50mmHg PaCO2) monitoring demonstrated higher rates of respiratory depression
      (17.8-37%) in healthy, non-obese women receiving intrathecal opioids for post-cesarean
      analgesia.13,14 In addition, supplemental opioids are required in the majority of women
      receiving intrathecal morphine and may increase the risk of respiratory depression.11,14
      Anesthesiologists debate whether neuraxial opioids or intravenous patient controlled opioid
      analgesia (PCA) are the safest practice for postoperative analgesia in obese parturients
      following cesarean delivery. The ASA recommendations to employ neuraxial analgesia
      post-cesarean delivery does not differentiate between non-obese and obese women who now make
      up 30.3% in US women of child-bearing age.2 Obesity has been described as a risk factor for
      respiratory depression in those receiving opioids via any route of opioid
      administration,11,15, 17 but whether obesity itself is the risk factor or associated
      co-morbidities such as sleep apnea is debated.

      Studies are conflicting whether intrathecal opioids or patient controlled intravenous opioids
      cause more respiratory depression. Several studies have documented the incidence of
      respiratory depression with IV PCA; the rates range from 0.19% to 5.2%, which are equivalent
      or higher than those reported for intrathecal opioids. (Hagle 16). Dalchow et al.
      demonstrated higher rates of hypercapnia in patients receiving intrathecal opioid compared
      with those receiving intravenous opioid via patient controlled analgesia in nonobese women
      following cesarean delivery. (Dalchow)

      The Topological Oscillation Search with Kinematical Analysis (TOSCA) monitor allows a
      noninvasive method to measure transcutaneous carbon dioxide levels, with relative accuracy
      compared to arterial carbon dioxide monitoring.4-7 No studies have examined transcutaneous
      carbon dioxide levels in obese women following cesarean delivery using any form of
      postoperative analgesia. The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial using
      continuous transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitoring to evaluate the degree of respiratory
      depression in obese women receiving neuraxial opioid compared to intravenous opioid via PCA
      for post-cesarean analgesia.

      Two studies have demonstrated high rates of hypercapnia in non-obese women following
      administration of intrathecal morphine for cesarean delivery in the postpartum period.
      (Dalchow, Bauchat) Dalchow et al. demonstrated higher rates of hypercapnia in women receiving
      intrathecal diamorphine than intravenous morphine delivered via patient controlled analgesia.
      It is unclear whether intrathecal morphine causes more or less respiratory depression than
      intravenous opioid delivered via patient-controlled analgesia in obese women.

      This study will add to the understanding of respiratory function in the immediate postpartum
      period in obese women using opioids via intrathecal or intravenous routes. This study will
      better inform guidelines for the postpartum analgesic route of choice in the obese obstetric
      population and allow the investigators to make recommendations for the detection and
      prevention of respiratory depression after opioid administration in the obstetric population.

      Objective is to examine the transcutaneous carbon dioxide levels in obese women using either
      intrathecal morphine or intravenous patient-controlled hydromorphone for post-cesarean
      analgesia.

      The hypothesis is carbon dioxide levels will be significantly higher in obese women receiving
      intrathecal morphine versus obese women receiving intravenous patient controlled intravenous
      hydromorphone.
