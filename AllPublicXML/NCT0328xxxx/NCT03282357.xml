  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare the proportion of Nasolabial Folds (NLFs) with treatment success in the Radiesse and Restylane groups at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment success is defined as the proportion of treated NLFs with a ≥ 1-point improvement from baseline, as assessed by a blinded evaluator on a 5-point Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) scale (0 = Absent, 1 = Mild, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Severe, and 4 = Extreme).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare the proportion of Nasolabial Folds (NLFs) with an &quot;improvement&quot; in the blinded evaluator's Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) score at Month 6 between the NLFs treated with Radiesse versus Restylane.</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The GAIS is a 7-point scale ranging from -3 (very much worse) to +4 (very much improved).
An &quot;improvement&quot; on the GAIS for the blinded evaluator will be classified who rated subjects as &quot;improved&quot;, &quot;much improved&quot;, or &quot;very much improved&quot;. The pre-treatment photograph will be used as a reference to assess the level of improvement at Month 6.</description>

             investigator at baseline.

          -  3. Both folds must have the same NLF score at baseline.

          -  4. Has signed an informed consent.

             agent, hormonal methods, IUD, surgical sterilization, abstinence) during the study.
             Women will be considered if one of the following conditions is documented on the
