  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing an evidenced-based
      high intensity interval training program (HIIT) to improve physical function in patients with
      knee osteoarthritis (OA).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will be assigned to the single-arm of the study in which all participants
      will receive 12 weeks of HIIT, delivered twice per week. The primary outcome will examine the
      feasibility and acceptability of the 12 week HIIT program in patients with knee OA symptoms
      ranging from mild to severe. The investigators will determine adherence to and tolerability
      of HIIT, acceptability, and recruitment and retention rates during the 12 week program.
      Additional outcomes will include physical function, knee OA symptomatic burden (pain), static
      standing balance, isometric knee extensor and flexor strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, and
      body composition.

    <description>The WOMAC, a measure of lower extremity pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and function (17 items), will be used to measure overall symptomatic burden of knee OA. Each item is scored from 0-4 (none, slight, moderate, severe, and extreme). Items are added to calculate a total WOMAC score ranging from 0 (no problems) to 96 (extreme problems). A higher score means a worse outcome.</description>
