      This is a multicenter, open-label, two-population, single-arm study with a sequential
      dose-escalation and dose expansion in adult subjects with progressive forms of MS (Population
      A) and in adult subjects with RRMS (Population B).

      This study will evaluate the safety of ATA188 administered by intravenous (IV) infusion.
      ATA188 will be selected for each subject based on matching at least 2 human leukocyte antigen
      (HLA) alleles shared between ATA188 and the subject including at least 1 HLA-restricting
      allele.

      Subjects will receive 2 cycles of treatment with each cycle consisting of a 15-day treatment
      period (with 3 infusions, each given approximately 7 days apart, on Days 1, 8 [±2 days], and
      15 [±2 days]). Following the third dose of both treatment cycles, subjects will undergo a
      20-day observation period. After completion of cycle 2, 20-day observation period, subjects
      will enter a follow-up period with 11 monthly (every 28 ±5 days) visits. Together, subjects
      will be observed for at least 1 year after the first dose of ATA188.
