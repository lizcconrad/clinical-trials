      To evaluate efficacy and safety profile of DC bead TACE in patients with hepatocellular
      carcinoma in Taiwan.

      This is a multi-center, retrospective, single arm study to explore safety and efficacy of DC
      bead TACE in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Taiwan

      Retrospective analysis of medical records of all patients who underwent DC Bead TACE at
      National Taiwan University Hospital, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, and Taichung
      Veterans General Hospital from 2010-2017/7.

      All statistical data were analyzed with SPSS software (SPSS, IBM North America, New York, NY,
      USA). Demographic and baseline lab data are presented by using descriptive statistics
      Student's t-test. Survival analysis will includes all patients.
