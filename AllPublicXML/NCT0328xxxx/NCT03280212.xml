  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is a common disease after minor head trauma, especially in
      elderly patients. This medical condition is characterized by blood collection in the subdural
      space, which can result in severe neurological impairment. Current standard of care is the
      evacuation of the CSDH by means of different surgical approaches. Although clinical and
      surgical outcomes are satisfying in most cases, considerable morbidity and mortality as well
      as recurrence rates of 3-31% are frequently reported. Therefore a non-surgical approach for
      the treatment of CSDH would be desirable. Tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic drug has
      been shown to decrease hematoma volume in a small cohort of patients suffering from CSDH. The
      present study is designed to test the hypothesis that TXA can reduce the volume of CSDH.
      Volume measurements of residual CSDH after burr-hole surgery will be performed during study
      course to quantify treatment success. The trial is designed as a randomized controlled pilot
      study, where half of the patients will be assigned to daily intake of TXA, whereas the other
      half will receive medical treatment according to current practice without TXA prescription.
      The primary endpoint of the study is defined as volume change in milliliters (mL) after 4-8
      weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints are hematoma volume change at 8-12 weeks, the rate of
      patients with resolution of the CSDH after 4-8 weeks and 8-12 weeks days, as well as the rate
      of reoperation during study course due to hematoma extension and neurological deterioration.
      Additionally the neurological outcome and the drug compatibility will be estimated as
      secondary objectives.

Participants of the Tranexamic Acid (TXA) arm will receive the study drug, TXA. Participants of average body weight (60-100kg) will receive TXA according to a 500mg three times daily (TID) dose regimen. Weight deviations from this range will see dose adjustments as follows: participants &lt;60kg will receive 500mg two times daily (BID), and participants &gt;100kg will receive 1000mg BID.</description>
