      Anti-viral therapy in Alzheimer's disease will investigate the efficacy of treating patients
      with mild Alzheimer's disease with the U.S.A marketed generic anti-viral drug Valtrex
      (valacyclovir, 500mg oral tablet). Valacyclovir at 2 g to 4 g per day, repurposed to treat
      Alzheimer's disease, will be compared to matching placebo in the treatment of 130 mild AD
      patients (65 valacyclovir, 65 placebo) who test positive for herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1) or
      HSV2. The study will be a randomized, double-blind, 18-month Phase II proof of concept trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many viruses are latent for decades before being reactivated in the brain by stress, immune
      compromise, or other factors. After the initial oral infection, herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1)
      becomes latent in the trigeminal ganglion and can later enter the brain via retrograde axonal
      transport, often targeting the temporal lobes.

      HSV1 can also enter the brain via olfactory neurons directly. HSV1 (oral herpes) and HSV2
      (genital herpes) are known to trigger amyloid aggregation and their DNA is commonly found in
      amyloid plaques. Anti-HSV drugs reduce Aβ and p-tau accumulation in brains of infected mice.
      HSV1 reactivation is associated with tau hyperphosphorylation in mice and may play a role in
      tau propagation across neurons. In humans, recurrent reactivation with newly produced HSV1
      particles, 'drop by drop,' may produce neuronal damage and eventually lead to
      neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, partly due to effects on amyloid
      and tau. Clinical studies show cognitive impairment in HSV seropositive patients in different
      patient groups and in healthy adults, and antiviral treatments show robust efficacy against
      peripheral HSV infection. The study team will conduct the first-ever clinical trial to
      directly address the long-standing viral etiology hypothesis of AD which posits that viruses,
      particularly the very common HSV1 and HSV2, may be etiologic or contribute to the pathology
      of AD. In patients with mild AD who test positive for serum antibodies to HSV1 or HSV2, the
      generic antiviral drug valacyclovir, repurposed as an anti-AD drug, will be compared at oral
      doses of 2 to 4 grams per day to matching placebo in the treatment of 130 patients (65
      valacyclovir, 65 placebo) in a randomized, double-blind, 78-week Phase II proof of concept
      trial. Patients treated with valacyclovir are hypothesized to show smaller decline in
      cognition and functioning compared to placebo, and, using 18F-Florbetapir PET imaging, to
      show less amyloid accumulation than placebo over the 78-week trial. Apolipoprotein E genotype
      at baseline, as well as changes in cortical thinning on structural MRI, olfactory
      identification deficits, and antiviral antibody titers from baseline to 78 weeks, will be
      evaluated in exploratory analyses. In patients who agree to lumbar puncture, plasma and CSF
      acyclovir will be assayed to establish the degree of CNS penetration of valacyclovir in mild
      AD, and the investigators will obtain CSF Aβ42, tau, p-tau for subset exploratory analyses
      with changes in outcome measures. If this trial is successful, the investigators will apply
      for funding to conduct a larger, multicenter, Phase III study using a study design that will
      be informed by the results of this Phase II trial. This innovative Phase II proof of concept
      trial clearly has exceptionally high reward potential for the treatment of AD.

          4. Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 1 (mild dementia). Physician Evaluation

          5. A family member or other individual who is in contact with the patient and consents to
             serve as informant during the study Patient Report

          6. Patient retains capacity to consent for him/herself or retains the capacity to
             identify a surrogate who will consent on his/her behalf. Patient Report

          7. At screening, patients must test positive for serum antibodies to HSV1 or HSV2.
             Patients that test equivocal (index between 0.90-1.09; &lt; 0.90 is negative and &gt; 1.09
             is positive) will repeat the test within 6 weeks at a repeat visit. If the results are
             negative at the second test, the patient will not enter the study. If the results are
             equivocal or positive at the second test (first test was equivocal), we will enroll
             the patient in the study because &quot;equivocal&quot; indicates the presence of antibodies that
             do not reach the minimum threshold.

          8. Use of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, and concomitant psychotropic
             medications (other than highdose benzodiazepines), will be permitted throughout the
             trial. Doses of these medications will need to be stable for at least 2 months prior
             to study entry. Any changes to the medication will be documented in the participant
             research chart. Medications given for other medical reasons, e.g., anti-diabetic or
             antihypertensive medications, will not be altered for the purposes of this trial and
             the patient's primary physician may adjust such medications as medically indicated
             throughout the trial. Details of concomitant medication use will be documented at all
             visits and will be available for statistical analysis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Caregiver is unwilling or unable, in the opinion of the investigator, to comply with
             study instructions. Physician Evaluation

             psychosis, bipolar disorder or current major depression by DSM-5 criteria. Prior
             history of major depression will not be exclusionary (25% of older adults have a
             lifetime history of major depression). Physician Evaluation

             lateral sclerosis. Physician Evaluation

          8. Clinical stroke with residual neurological deficits. MRI findings of cerebrovascular
             disease (small infarcts, lacunes, periventricular disease) in the absence of clinical
             stroke with residual neurological deficits will not lead to exclusion. Physician
             Evaluation

          9. Acute, severe, unstable medical illness. For cancer, patients with active illness or
             metastases in the last 12 months will be excluded, but past history of successfully
             treated cancer will not lead to exclusion. Physician Evaluation

             puncture. Physician Evaluation

         16. For MRI, metal implants and pacemaker, and claustrophobia such that the patient
             refuses MRI. In the investigators' experience, these exclusions occur in less than 5%
             of patients with mild AD. MRI is required for VALAD. Patient Report/ Physician
             Evaluation

         17. Radiation exposure in the prior 12 months that, together with Florbetapir PET, will be
             above the FDA annual radiation exposure threshold. This will be determined by a

             affect UPSIT scores, UPSIT score &lt; 12/40 (10 out of 40 is scored by chance in this
             multiple-choice test) indicating congenital anosmia. In the investigators' experience,
             less than 3% of cases are excluded for having one or more of these exclusionary
             criteria. If a patient is excluded from the olfaction component, the patient will
             still be eligible for the main protocol and all other study procedures. Patient
