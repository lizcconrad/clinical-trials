    <textblock>
      In the previous study, the investigator established a predictive model for non-sentinel lymph
      node involvement in early breast cancer (cT1-2cN0, 1-2 SLNs involvement). To validation the
      clinical value of the model, the investigator design a prospectively research using the model
      guiding for further axillary lymph node dissection in SLN-positve early breast cancer.

      In the previous study, a predictive model for non-sentinel lymph node involvement in early
      breast cancer (cT1-2cN0, 1-2 SLNs involvement) was established. This model was designed for
      predicting the status of non-sentinel lymph node in cT1-2cN0 with 1-2 SLNs involvement breast
      cancer based on peripheral blood CK19 and contrast-enhanced ultrasound. The investigator
      previously tested this model comparing with MSKCC model in a same population and confirmed a
      result of satisfactory low false-negative rate and high AUC. This model had a potential
      practise value in clinic applying. For further validation, the research group design the
      CK19B trial to prospectively using this model in decision strategy of whether receiving ALND
      in 1-2SLNs+ patients. If the model predictive result is negative, the risk of nSLNs
      involvement is estimated very low and the patients should be avoid ALND, even radiotherapy no
      matter the surgery is mastectomy or conserving. If the model result is positive, then further
      ALND or radiotherapy should be accepted by patients to decrease the risk of local and
      regional recurrent. A prospectively and conditional grouping method is planned for this
      cohort study. The primary endpoint is disease-free survival (DFS) in two groups, the second
      primary endpoint is local recurrent rate (LRR) and overall survival (OS).
