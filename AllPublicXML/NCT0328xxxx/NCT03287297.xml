  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as carbohydrate intolerance of varying
      severity with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. The diagnosis of gestational
      diabetes is important, because of the increased risk of adverse maternal and feto-neonatal
      outcomes. In addition, GDM also confers a future risk of type 2 diabetes to mothers and their
      fetus. Dietary components associated with GDM risk include macronutrients, micronutrients,
      and individual foods, such as refined carbohydrates, saturated fats, soft drinks and
      processed meats. The Pre-pregnancy dietary patterns may affect women risk of developing GDM.
      A diet high in red and processed meat was associated with a significantly elevated risk.

      *Aim of the work: To investigate associations between maternal dietary patterns and GDM.

        -  Patients and Methods:

             -  Study design: A cross sectional study was conducted.

             -  Study site: GDM Outpatient Clinic of Assiut University Hospital.

             -  Study population: The study will include all pregnant women at 24th to 28th
                gestational age, who attending to GDM Outpatient Clinic during the period of The
                Study.

             -  Inclusion criteria include pregnant women at 24th to 28th age of gestation.

             -  Exclusion criteria include pre-gestational diabetic women and pregnant women before
                and after 24th -28th week of gestation.

             -  Instrument: Structured designed questionnaire: Which consists of socio-demographic
                characteristics, Medical and obstetric history and other risk factors for GDM
                including previous GDM, family history of diabetes, twins in current pregnancy,
                history of PCO and macrosomic baby in current or previous pregnancy, also contains
                information about regularity and frequencies of daily meals taken by the women, and
                information about food group frequencies per week, food groups like vegetables,
                fruits, fast food , red and processed meat, fish and seafood, whole grains, cereal
                fiber, sweetened beverage, dessert food and use of multivitamins.

             -  Data collection: Direct interview will be done with each participant separately for
                filling the food frequency questionnaire by the researcher himself during the
                period from January 2017 to June 2017

        -  Clinical examination:

             -  BP (mmHg)

             -  Pulse

             -  Body Weight (kg)

             -  Height (cm)

             -  BMI

      Laboratory Examination

        -  OGTT (75gm) 2hr

        -  HBA1c (if Bl. Glucose â‰¥ 200mg/dl).
