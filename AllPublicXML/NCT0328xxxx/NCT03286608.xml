  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to leverage existing data from a large observational prospective study on
      dementia, the Three-City study, to investigate the relationship between intakes of
      polyphenols and the risk to develop dementia in the 12 years following dietary assessment.

  <detailed_description>

      The study sample includes 1,329 subjects followed for up to 12 years fro dementia after
      dietary assessment. The aim is to identify a pattern of polyphenol intake (based on 26
      flavonoid and non-flavonoid polyphenol subclasses ascertained using a 24-hour dietary recall)
      associated with the risk of dementia and AD over 12 years in the 3C Bordeaux cohort.
