      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of AUTO2, a CAR T Cell Treatment
      Targeting BCMA and TACI, in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 2 phases, a Phase I/dose escalation phase and a Phase II/expansion
      phase. Patients with relapsed and relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma will be enrolled in
      both phases of the study. Eligible patients will undergo leukapheresis in order to harvest T
      cells, which is the starting material for the manufacture of the autologous CAR T product
      AUTO2. AUTO2 has a dual target BCMA (B cell maturation antigen) and TACI (Transmembrane
      activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor). Following
      pre-conditioning by a chemotherapeutic regimen, the patient will receive AUTO2 intravenously
      as a single or split dose and will then enter a 12-month follow-up period.
