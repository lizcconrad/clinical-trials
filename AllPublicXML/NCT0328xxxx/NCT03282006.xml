  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Febrile urinary tract infections and urosepsis are common and potentially serious infections
      that require effective antimicrobial treatment. The duration of parenteral treatment depends
      on oral alternatives. These alternatives are few and due to antimicrobial resistance,
      quinolones are &quot;standard of care&quot;. The increased use of quinolones is concerning because of
      its negative ecological aspects and it is confirmed an increasing incidence of resistant
      E.coli to quinolones in Norwegian isolates.

      Pivmecillinam is an antibiotic with high susceptibility to E.coli but the evidence for
      treating febrile urinary tract infections is insufficient. This trial will investigate the
      efficacy and safety of pivmecillinam in treating pyelonephritis and urosepsis caused by
      E.coli.

      The hypothesis is that urosepsis can safely be treated with pivmecillinam when it is given
      after 2-3 days with empirical i.v. antibiotics.

      This trial will be conducted at Vestfold Hospital, Norway, and is a prospective observational
      study with intention to treat. Participants will be consecutively included among hospitalized
      patients suffering from urosepsis - see eligibility criteria. After 3 days with parenteral
      antibiotics, when clinical improvement and absence of fever/leukocytosis is confirmed, the
      participants will start on pivmecillinam 400mg four times daily and be discharged.
      Pivmecillinam is to be taken for one week. The participants will be contacted by phone on day
      4, 10 and 33 (days after admission). On day 17 (test of cure, TOC) they will meet for
      physical examination. They will report symptom score (standardized schema) on day 0, and 17.
      Urine samples will be collected on day 10 and 17. Blood samples on day 17. All data will be
      stored anonymously. The trial will be monitored by extern resources.
