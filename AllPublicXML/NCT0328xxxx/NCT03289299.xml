      This study evaluates the use of carfilzomib, lenalidomide, daratumumab, and dexamethasone in
      subjects with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). Subjects will receive treatment in
      3 phases - induction (6 cycles), consolidation (6 cycles), and maintenance (12 cycles). Each
      cycle is 28 days.

    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center phase 2 study of carfilzomib, lenalidomide, daratumumab, and
      dexamethasone in subjects with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). Myeloma remains
      incurable with the current approaches. The typical natural history of myeloma is one of
      repeated relapses, accompanied by genetic evolution and development of new abnormalities,
      which are often responsible for drug resistance. The presence of a precursor phase of
      smoldering myeloma, and the ability to identify those at the highest risk of progression,
      sets the stage to examine the possibility that we can cure the disease through early
      intervention. In order to potentially achieve this, we need to develop a highly effective
      combination that includes the most active drugs from different classes. Carfilzomib in
      combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone results in high response rates and deep
      responses in subjects with newly diagnosed myeloma. Daratumumab in combination with
      lenalidomide results in high response rates in relapsed refractory disease. All these drugs
      are well tolerated and subjects are able to stay on them long term as a maintenance
      treatment. The combination of the carfilzomib, lenalidomide, daratumumab and dexamethasone
      presents the potential to enhance the effectiveness of the regimens. We hypothesize that this
      combination will lead to deep response including a higher proportion of minimal residual
      disease (MRD) negative disease among those with high risk smoldering myeloma and may
      translate into cure or long term disease quiescence.
