    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the current proposal is to test the acceptability and feasibility of a
      group-based transdiagnostic treatment, termed Safety Aid Reduction Treatment (START),
      delivered to rural Veterans. The anticipated results of the proposed study include: 1) START
      will be both acceptable and feasible to Veterans and mental health care providers, alike and
      2) START will lead to meaningful reductions in symptoms of anxiety and depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an intervention pilot project examining the acceptability, feasibility, and utility
      of a group-based transdiagnostic treatment delivered to rural Veterans. Approximately 5.2
      million Veterans reside in rural communities across the United States, making it difficult
      for them to access quality medical and mental health (MH) care. The Department of Veterans
      Affairs (VA) established Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) to improve access to
      healthcare for rural Veterans; however, these clinics often lack MH specialists including
      psychiatrists and psychologists, limiting the breadth of specialty services available. As
      such, MH care is often delivered by primary care providers or MH clinicians who (a) lack
      familiarity with evidence-based interventions and (b) lack the time needed to implement such
      intensive therapies. Group-based cognitive behavioral protocols that target a number of
      different diagnoses are likely to be more attractive in these settings and therefore more
      readily disseminated. Such protocols, often referred to as transdiagnostic treatments, are
      based on the theory that emotional disorders share common features and therefore respond to
      common therapeutic procedures. One such treatment, termed Safety Aid Reduction Treatment
      (START), has received increasing empirical support. This group-based transdiagnostic
      treatment is designed to address cognitive and behavioral strategies, otherwise known as
      safety aids, that are common across a number of psychiatric conditions (e.g., anxiety
      disorders, trauma- and stressor-related disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related
      disorders, and depressive disorders) and used to reduce anxiety. START has been found to
      effectively reduce psychopathology in community-based clinical samples and more recently
      among Veterans at the Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System (SLVHCS). However, the
      utility of this treatment has yet to be examined in rural settings. Thus, the primary aim of
      the current proposal is to test the acceptability and feasibility of a group-based
      transdiagnostic treatment, termed START, delivered to rural Veterans at CBOCs. Because this
      is a pilot project, we will not emphasize symptom reduction, as we will likely be
      underpowered to detect treatment effects. Nevertheless, a secondary aim of the project is to
      examine the utility of START by gathering data on symptom change, which will be used as pilot
      data for a subsequent grant proposal. For this pilot project, Veterans (N = 24) will be
      recruited from two of the five Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System (SLVHCS)
      CBOCs. The anticipated results of the proposed study include: 1) START will be both
      acceptable and feasible to Veterans and mental health care providers, alike and 2) START will
      lead to meaningful reductions in symptoms of anxiety and depression. Findings from the
      current study will help to advance our understanding of the amelioration of anxiety and
      depressive disorders among Veterans.

    <description>START includes many of the key elements found in empirically supported treatments for emotional disorders including a) psychoeducation regarding the nature of distress and b) exposure to internal sensations and external situations that are connected to one's distress response via identification and reduction in safety aids. Safety aids discussed in the current protocol include cognitive avoidance, situational avoidance, checking behaviors, reassurance seeking, avoidance of bodily sensations, companions, and use of alcohol and other substances.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data sets underlying this project will not be shared outside the VA, except as required under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), for a number of reasons. First, data will be used by the research team to answer additional research questions. Further, veterans may be hesitant to participate in research in which the data will be shared outside the VA and this may act as a barrier to participation and/or benefit from treatment.</ipd_description>
