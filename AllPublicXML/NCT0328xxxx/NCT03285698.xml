  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both DermACELL® and Integra® Bilayer Wound Matrix are indicated for deep soft tissue coverage
      and serve as a biological matrix for cellular migration. The current thinking about the
      utility of these products is to apply over the wound surface and wait until the graft is well
      vascularized (granular bed/neodermis). At that point a split thickness skin graft can be
      applied over this area to cover and heal the wound. This study will determine whether human
      allograft or xenograft will create a durable neodermis that is more supportive of accepting
      of a split thickness skin graft. Patients who do not receive Split thickness skin grafts will
      be assigned to the second cohort for observation of healing rates.

      This is a prospective, randomized, single site, clinical research trial comparing the
      clinical outcomes of DermACELL® compared with Integra® Bilayer Wound Matrix in dermal
      regeneration. A total of 100 subjects will be randomized into either the DermACELL® (n=50) or
      Integra® Bilayer Wound Matrix (n=50) treatment group. An interim analysis will be performed
      when both groups have enrolled 25 subjects. Subjects will receive either DermACELL® or
      Integra® Bilayer Wound Matrix in the operating room for coverage of deep soft tissue defects
      in the lower extremity. Subjects will then be followed in the outpatient clinic. Once the
      neodermis has been sufficiently generated, a split thickness skin graft (autograft or
      allograft) will be applied in the operating room. The split thickness skin graft application
      site will be then followed to observe viability.
