      In a double-blinded, randomized, parallel controlled design, patients with schizophrenia
      spectrum disorder will be exposed to active or sham repetitive transcranial magentic
      stimulation (TMS) which was guided by functional magnetic resonance image (MRI). Smoking
      reduction/cessation and brain functional connectivity changes will be assessed at baseline,
      different stages of rTMS and/or follow-ups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroimaging studies suggest that high rate of smoking in patients with schizophrenia may be
      due to an overlap of nicotine addiction related circuitries and schizophrenia related
      circuitries, such that schizophrenia impact some of the same circuitries that increase risks
      for severe nicotine addiction in general. Those identified overlapping circuitries have been
      linked to several key features of nicotine addiction and can be represented by resting state
      functional connectivities. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides a non-invasive
      means for altering brain electrical neural activity. TMS has been approved by FDA for
      treatment of depression. Other applications have not been approved but it has been used in a
      wide range of clinical research especially in neurology and psychiatry. There are
      preliminarily significant improvements in treatments of smoking cessation in schizophrenia
      using TMS with small samples, but those treatments are not robust in larger samples. The high
      inter-subject variability limits the efficacy of TMS treatment in schizophrenia patients. We
      aim to develop a TMS method targeting special brain circuits that are both smoking cessation
      and schizophrenia related. If the corresponding brain circuits were successfully modulated,
      the treatment efficacy will be significantly improved and schizophrenia patients will benefit
      from the TMS treatment of smoking cessation.
