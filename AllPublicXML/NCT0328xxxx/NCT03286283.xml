    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of J-Plasma in the reduction of facial
      wrinkles and rhytides. It is a multi-center, single arm, evaluator-blind prospective study of
      55 study subjects who are seeking a procedure to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and
      rhytides and will be conducted at up to 5 investigational centers in the United States. Each
      study subject will receive one procedure with J-Plasma at enrollment. Follow-up will occur
      immediately following the procedure, at 10 days, 1, 3, and 6 months after enrollment.

      The study objective is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the J-Plasma system for use
      in dermal skin resurfacing.

      This is a multi-center, single arm, evaluator-blind prospective study of 55 study subjects
      who are seeking a procedure to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and rhytides at up to 5
      investigational centers in the United States.

      Study subjects that meet study eligibility criteria and have provided informed consent will
      be enrolled in the study. During the procedure, the investigators will use J-Plasma on
      applicable facial zones to reduce wrinkles and rhytides.

      Study subjects will be followed immediately following the procedure, at 10 days, 1, 3, and 6
      months post-procedure for study assessments.

      Study enrollment is expected to occur over 3-6 months. Imaging and study assessments will
      continue through 6 months post-procedure. Total study duration is expected to be
      approximately 9-12 months.

      Primary study endpoints will be assessed at 3 months following the procedure.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a multi-center, single arm, evaluator-blind prospective study of 55 study subjects who are seeking a procedure to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and rhytides. Enrolled study subjects will receive one procedure with J-Plasma at enrollment. Wrinkle severity will be assessed using the Fitzpatrick Wrinkle and Elastosis Scale (FWS) at baseline and at each follow-up time point. Scores at each follow-up time point will be compared to the scores at baseline for each enrolled subject.</intervention_model_description>
