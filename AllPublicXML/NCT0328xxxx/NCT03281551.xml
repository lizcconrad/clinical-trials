    <description>Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD19 will be evaluated for safety and efficacy in patients with relapsed/ refractory B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/B cell Lymphoma. The CAR consists of a CD19 targeting antibody scFv with two intracellular signaling domains derived from CD3 zeta and 4-1BB. Autologous T cells will be gene-engineered with the CAR gene using a lentivirus vector. Prior to T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning treatment. After T cell infusion, the patients will be evaluated for 24 months for adverse reactions, persistence of CAR T cells and efficacy.</description>
