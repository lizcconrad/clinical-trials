  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rapid ventricular pacing (RVP) is a technique to obtain flow arrest for short periods of time
      during dissection or rupture of the aneurysm. RVP results in an adequate fall of blood
      pressure which presents as an on-off phenomenon. It is not clear whether repetitive periods
      of pacing are harmless for the patient. Silent cardiac and cerebral infarcts may be
      undetected. The investigator will study the safety of RVP, particularly for the heart and the
      brain, retrograde by studying troponin levels and magnetic resonance imaging or computed
      tomography.

      Rapid ventricular pacing (RVP) is a technique to obtain flow arrest for short periods of time
      during dissection or rupture of the aneurysm. RVP results in an adequate fall of blood
      pressure which presents as an on-off phenomenon. The technique facilitates the dissection and
      manipulation of cerebral aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and can be
      lifesaving in the case of an intraoperative bleeding or rupture. In a former study blood
      pressure and clinical outcome were used as study parameters. However it is not clear whether
      repetitive periods of pacing are harmless for the patient. Silent cardiac and cerebral
      infarcts may be undetected if only clinical outcome is taken as a study parameter. In this
      retrograde study, the investigators will study the safety of RVP, particularly for the heart
      and the brain, using magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography and troponin levels.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of repetitive periods of RVP on the
      oxygenation of the heart and brain using magnetic resonance imaging and troponin levels both
      markers for ischemia damage.

    <description>During surgery patients allocated to this group will undergo RVP. Subjects receive Magnetic Resonance Imaging or Computed Tomography as standard of care, pre-and postoperatively. To screen for rapid ventricular pacing induced micro-infarcts, the contralateral hemisphere(contralateral to the hemisphere operated on) and fossa posterior will be evaluated. Troponin levels are determinated preoperatively and 24 hours postoperatively by blood sample as standard of care. Maximum cTnl level and cTnl level 24 hours will be compared.</description>

    <description>No rapid ventricular pacing is applied during surgery. Subjects receive Magnetic Resonance Imaging or Computed Tomography as standard of care, pre-and postoperatively. To screen for induced micro-infarcts, the contralateral hemisphere(contralateral to the hemisphere operated on) and fossa posterior will be evaluated. Troponin levels are determinated preoperatively and 24 hours postoperatively by blood sample as standard of care. Maximum cTnl level and cTnl level 24 hours will be compared.</description>
