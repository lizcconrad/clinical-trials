  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the clinical non-inferiority of 1 month (short-term) vs 6 months
      (long-term) of dual anti-platelet therapy in patients undergoing percutaneous intervention
      implanted sirolimus -eluting stent with abluminal grooves containing a biodegradable polymer
      in High Bleeding Risk patients with coronary artery disease.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, double -blind,multi-center,randomized controlled trial. Approximately
      1,720 subjects in high bleeding risk with coronary artery disease will be enrolled in no more
      than 40 research centers in China. All participants met the inclusion criteria will be 1:1
      randomized to 1 month or 6months of DAPT after implanting Firehawk™ coronary stent. Clinical
      follow-up will be carried out at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months, 2 years after index
      procedure.The primary study endpoint is Net Adverse Clinical and Cerebral Events (NACCE), a
      composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), cerebral vascular accident (CVA)
      and major bleeding ([BARC] definition) at 12 months. Subjects that complete of 12 months
      follow-up will be regarded as having completed the primary endpoint. The secondary study
      endpoints contain cost-effectiveness at 12 months, ARC defined stent thrombosis (ST) ; NACCE
      ;major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE),major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events
      (MACCE),target lesion revascularization (TLR),target vessel failure(TVF) , major bleeding at
      30 days,6,12 and 24 months of follow-up.
