  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect data that will increase understanding of Fabry
      disease history and progression, in treated and untreated patients with Fabry disease. The
      data from FOS may provide guidance to healthcare professionals about disease treatment
      options.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to year 20</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, pathologic, or unintended change in anatomical, physiologic, or metabolic function as indicated by physical signs, symptoms, or laboratory changes occurring in the registry, whether or not considered product-related. This includes an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition. An AE or ADR that meets one or more of the following criteria/outcomes is classified as SAE whether considered to be related to the pharmaceutical product or not: death, life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalizations, a persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect and important medical events.</description>

    <description>An infusion-related reaction (IRR) is defined as an AE that has been assessed as at least possibly related to treatment with Replagal and occurs during an infusion or up to 24 hours post Replagal infusion.</description>

        The FOS registry is open to participants with Fabry disease irrespective of their
        treatment. Participants may be untreated, currently treated or have been previously treated
        with Replagal, or any other approved treatment for Fabry disease. There is no predetermined
        sample size.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants must have a documented diagnosis of Fabry disease

               -  This may include a genetic mutation analysis. The collection of the genetic
                  mutation analysis result is optional and dependent on the participant providing
                  their consent for this data to be used in the FOS registry.

               -  Participants can be untreated, currently or previously treated with Replagal, or
                  any other approved treatment for Fabry disease.

          2. Signed and dated written informed consent from the participant

               -  For participants aged less than (&lt;) 18 years (or as per local regulation), parent
                  and/or participant's legally authorized representative (LAR), and assent of the
                  minor, where applicable, is necessary.

               -  If a participant is unable to read or if a legally acceptable representative is
                  unable to read, an impartial witness should be present during the informed
                  consent discussion and should sign and personally date the informed consent.

               -  Informed consent must be obtained from LARs for cognitively impaired participants
                  when applicable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Participants currently enrolled in ongoing blinded clinical trials (drugs or devices;
        includes all blinded trials) will be excluded from the Registry.
