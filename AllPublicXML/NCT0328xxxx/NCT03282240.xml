      This randomized, modified double-blind, active-controlled, multi-center trial will assess the
      safety and immunogenicity of the high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV-HD) compared
      to either the licensed or investigational high-dose trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV-HD) in
      adults.

      This randomized, modified double-blind, active-controlled, multi-center trial will be
      conducted in healthy adults (≥ 65 years) to assess the safety and immunogenicity (geometric
      mean titers and seroconversion for the 4 virus strains at 28 days post vaccination) of the
      high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV-HD) compared to one of the high-dose trivalent
      influenza vaccines (TIV-HDs) containing either the B strain from the primary lineage
      (TIV-HD1; licensed vaccine [Fluzone® High-Dose] for the 2017-2018 Northern Hemisphere [NH]
      influenza season) or the B strain from the alternate lineage (TIV-HD2, investigational TIV-HD
      containing an alternate B strain).
