  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In brief, this study sets out to understand if exercise training can reduce the frequency and
      severity of hot flushes associated with breast cancer treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In detail, the aim of this research project is to investigate whether improving temperature
      control mechanisms including vascular function, with exercise training is beneficial in
      alleviating hot flushes in breast cancer patients and their associated quality of life
      symptoms. Participants will be recruited at least 3-months post breast cancer treatment
      (surgery, radio-therapy, chemotherapy). This time point has been chosen for this study to
      allow patients to fully engage in the exercise intervention following treatment. All
      participants will be asked to attend the laboratory at Liverpool John Moores University on 4
      separate occasions; 2 visits pre- and 2 visits following the exercise intervention for data
      collection including measures of vascular health, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and
      fitness. The investigators will also gain information on food intake and incidence of hot
      flushes across a 7-day period pre- and post the intervention.

    <measure>Change in Thermoregulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from pre- to post- 16 week exercise intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will wear a tube-lined suit that allows manipulation of skin temperature by heating the water passed through the tubes. Core temperature will be increased by 1 degree (monitored using a temperature pill) with sweat rate and skin temperature recordings taken at 5minute intervals across 1 hour of heating. Thermoregulation will be compared during this hour to that of the post-exercise intervention re-test.</description>

    <measure>Change in Skin Blood Flow</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from pre- to post- 16 week exercise intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The change in skin blood flow will be measured using laser Doppler probes at the forearm.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cerebral Blood Flow</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from pre- to post- 16 week exercise intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change in cerebral blood flow will be assessed using transcranial Doppler ultrasound to measure brain blood flow.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Vascular Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from pre- to post- 16 week exercise intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Vascular function will be measured via endothelial-dependent flow mediated dilation of the brachial artery and reported as a percentage change.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Vascular Structure</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from pre- to post- 16 week exercise intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Vascular structure will be measured at the carotid artery using ultrasound imaging to clearly visualise the artery. The image will be adjusted so artery wall thickness can be clearly seen with a 30 second recording taken at 3 different angles. The average of the three angles will be calculated with results reported as change in millimetres.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete a partially supervised 4 month exercise program consisting of 3-5 sessions/week at a moderate intensity (40-75% heart rate (HR) reserve) at Liverpool Lifestyles gyms. Participants will be given free access to the Wellness Key SystemÂ© when using the Lifestyles exercise equipment which allows researchers to remotely track the exercise intensity of participants accurately.</description>
