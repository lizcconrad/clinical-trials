      This research study is studying a drug as a possible treatment for ER-positive Breast Cancer

      The drug involved in this study is:

      -Ribociclib

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      This research study is a Pilot Study of two different doses, which is the first time
      investigators are examining this study drug at the different dosage, for early breast cancer.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved ribociclib in combination with
      aromatase inhibitors as a treatment option for advanced/metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer.

      In this research study, The investigators are comparing the safety and efficacy of ribociclib
      given at two different doses given on different schedules during a period of 28 days.

      Ribociclib is a drug designed to block certain proteins called cyclin-dependent protein
      kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6). These proteins are needed for cells to divide and may also control
      the ability of certain cancers to grow. The investigators believe that ribociclib may stop
      the participant cancer cells from growing and dividing by blocking these CDK4/6 proteins.

    <description>The study treatment will be considered safe and reasonably well tolerated if more than 2/3 (66%) of participants complete 12 months of Ribociclib treatment (with ≥75% of intended doses). Failure to complete 12 months of the study treatment may be the result of dose delays, dose reductions, death, or withdrawal from the study.
Participants may be held off Ribociclib due to the occurrence of adverse events. Adverse events will be assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4). If these adverse events resolve to grade 1 within 7 days or less, Ribociclib will be resumed at the same dose as previously given. If the toxicities require more than 7 days to return to grade 1, Ribociclib will be reduced by one dose level. A maximum of two dose level reductions will be allowed on the trial before the participant is removed. Ribociclib can be held for a maximum of two cycles (56 days) before the participant will be discontinued from the clinical trial.</description>

          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers
             of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing,
             it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as
             the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal
             product.

          -  Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements. Patient has impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI
             disease that may significantly alter the absorption of the study drugs (e.g.,
             ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome,
             or small bowel resection).

          -  Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or cardiac repolarization
             abnormality including any of the following:

               -  History of angina pectoris, symptomatic pericarditis, coronary artery bypass
                  graft (CABG) or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study entry.

               -  Documented cardiomyopathy.

               -  Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) &lt;50% as determined by Multiple Gated
                  acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO) detected during screening.

               -  History of cardiac failure, significant/symptomatic bradycardia, Long QT
                  syndrome, family history of idiopathic sudden death or congenital long QT
                  syndrome or any of the following:

               -  Known risk to prolong the QT interval or induce Torsade's de Pointes.

               -  Uncorrected hypomagnesemia or hypokalemia.

               -  Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) &gt;160 mmHg or &lt;90 mmHg.

               -  Bradycardia (heart rate &lt;50 at rest), by ECG or pulse.

               -  On screening, inability to determine the QTcF interval on the ECG (i.e.:
                  unreadable or not interpretable) or QTcF &gt;450 screening ECG (based on a mean of 3
                  ECGs).

          -  History of hypersensitivity to ribociclib or any of its components.

          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible. These
             participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the safety of ribociclib is not
             established in pregnant women. For this reason and because CDK4/6 agents as well as
             other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of
             child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of treatment, and for at least 3 months after the completion of
             treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Prior
             to study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy
             during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional
             pregnancy. In addition, men enrolled on this study should understand the risks to any
             sexual partner of childbearing potential. All WOCBP must have a negative pregnancy
             test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of the investigational
             agent(s). Registration may occur prior to this pregnancy test. If the pregnancy test
             is positive, the patient must not receive protocol treatment and must not be enrolled
             in the study. WOCBP is defined as follows: Any female who has experienced menarche and
             who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal
             ligation, or a bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea
             &gt; 12 consecutive months, or women on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with documented
             plasma follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt; 35 mIU/ml). Even women who are using
             oral, implanted, or injectable contraceptive hormones or mechanical products
             (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent pregnancy or practicing abstinence or
             where partner is sterile (e.g. vasectomy), should be considered to be a WOCBP.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             throughout the study and for 8 weeks after study drug discontinuation. Women are
             considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12
             months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g.
             age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child
             bearing potential. Highly effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement
                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.

               -  In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment. Note: While oral
                  contraceptives are allowed, they should be used in conjunction with a barrier
                  method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction
