      Objectives: 1.- To compare the level of oxygenation achieved during muscular training with
      conventional oxygen systems (nasal cannulas) versus nasal High-flow oxygen therapy. 2.-To
      compare benefits achieved with both systems, in terms of: level of exercise during training;
      effort tolerance in the 6 minutes walking test (6MWT); improvement of dyspnoea and
      Health-related quality of life (HRQoL). And analyse the effects of nasal High-flow oxygen
      therapy on the acute exercise in a subgroup of patients.

      Method: Multicentric randomized clinical trial. Patients with ILD in fibrotic phase who
      present oxygen desaturation during 6MWT (SpO2 mean ≤ 85%) will be included consecutively.
      Will be randomized in two groups: ILD patients with conventional oxygen (EPIDOC) and ILD
      patients with nasal High-Flow oxygen therapy (EPIDOAF). Both groups will perform a Pulmonary
      Rehabilitation Program. Oxygen will be titrated respectively to flow and FiO2 needed to
      maintain SpO2 ≥ 90% during training with both systems. Evaluation measures: SpO2 during
      training in both groups; dyspnoea (mMRC scale and CRQ dyspnoea); exercise capacity (6MWT) and
      HRQoL (self- administered KBILD questionnaire and SF36). In a subgroup of patients will be
      compared time of endurance exercise to evaluate the effects of nasal high-flow oxygen therapy
      in the acute exercise.
