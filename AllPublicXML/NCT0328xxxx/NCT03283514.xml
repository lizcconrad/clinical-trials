  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esthetic is a major factor in complete denture (CD) success. Patient involvement in esthetic
      project plays a crucial role in denture acceptance and patient satisfaction. Historically,
      teeth choice and arrangement were made according to Frush and Ficher's recommendations
      focusing on natural looking of esthetics. Dentists may also propose to restore the dentate
      state looking for denture when preextraction data are available. Recently, a patient-centered
      approach based on attractivity has been proposed and may lead to in an appearance
      transcending the laws of nature.

      The aim of the present study was to investigate actual denture esthetic expectations in a
      French edentate population followed in a university dental clinic (Rothschild Hospital ,
      AP-HP).

      Inclusion criteria : being currently edentulous within at least within the maxillary arch,
      literate French speakers, willing and able to complete the survey in a single sitting.
      Clinical data collection was made by a unique examiner and concerned length of edentulism,
      antagonist arch, existence of preextraction data, smile attractivity opinion. The respondents
      completed a questionnaire identifying their age, sex, educational and income level. Patients
      were also asked for their denture look preference among 4 esthetic projects: 1) restoring
      pre-extraction (dentate) looking, 2) restoring actual denture looking, 3) creating natural
      looking, 4) creating perfect looking, 5) no opinion. Each project was explained similarly by
      the same examiner. Statistical analysis using a Pearson Chi-squared test at a 0.05 level of
      significance was conducted for associations between esthetic projects preference and tested
      variables.
