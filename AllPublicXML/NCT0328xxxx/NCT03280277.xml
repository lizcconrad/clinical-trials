  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well ferumoxytol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) works in imaging lymph nodes in patients with rectal cancer that has spread from where
      it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes. Ferumoxytol is a form of very small iron
      particles that are taken up by cells in normal lymph nodes and may work better in imaging
      patients with rectal cancer when given with MRI.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine feasibility of administering ferumoxytol and obtaining ferumoxytol enhanced
      magnetic resonance (MR) images in patients with resectable locally advanced rectal cancer
      with enlarged or suspicious lateral pelvic lymph nodes before starting neoadjuvant
      chemoradiation therapy and again before total mesorectal excision.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect detailed information about the location of ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron
      oxide (USPIO)-MRI detected lymph nodes prior to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy and again
      prior to total mesorectal excision.

      II. To compare the sensitivity and specificity of ferumoxytol enhanced MR imaging in
      assessment of pathological lymph nodes with those of non-USPIO-MRI and positron emission
      tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ferumoxytol intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes and then after 24-36 hours
      undergo ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI before start of chemoradiotherapy and before surgery at week
      12.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4-6 weeks.
