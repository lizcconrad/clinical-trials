      The BeGraft Plus PMCF Trial investigates the efficacy of the BeGraft Peripheral Plus Stent
      Graft System in the treatment of iliac stenotic or occlusive lesions (TASC A, B, C and D). An
      expected total of 20 patients with TASC A and B lesions and an expected total of 50 patients
      with TASC C and D lesions will be treated. The lesion is located within the native Iliac
      arteries. Prior to stenting with the BeGraft Peripheral Plus Stent Graft System,
      pre-dilatation can be performed according to the physician's discretion. Also post-dilatation
      can be performed according to the physician's discretion. Patients will be invited for a
      follow-up visit at 1, 6 and 12 month post-procedure. The primary efficacy endpoint of the
      study is the primary patency at 12 months. The primary safety endpoint is the freedom of
      periprocedural Serious Adverse Events (SAEs). Secondary endpoint include primary patency rate
      at 1 and 6 month, stent graft occlusion rate at pre-discharge, 1, 6 and 12 month follow-up,
      anke-brachial index (ABI) at 1, 6 and 12-month follow-up, amputation rate at 1, 6 and
      12-month follow-up, performance success rate, freedom from target lesion revascularization
      (TLR), technical success and clinical success at 1, 6 and 12-month follow-up.

      The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate, in a controlled setting, the
      long-term safety and efficacy of the BeGraft Peripheral Plus Stent Graft System in clinical
      settings post CE-certification when used according to the indications of the IFU with focus
      on the treatment of complex TASC A, B, C and D iliac lesions.

      Patients will be selected based on the investigator's assessment, evaluation of the
      underlying disease and the eligibility criteria. The patient's medical condition should be
      stable, with no underlying medical condition which would prevent them from performing the
      required testing or from completing the study. Patients should also be geographically stable,
      willing and able to cooperate in this clinical study and remain available for long-term
      follow-up. A patient is considered enrolled in the study after obtaining the patients
      informed consent, if there is full compliance with the study eligibility criteria and after
      successful guidewire passage through the study target lesion.

      Prior to the index procedure the following tests and clinical data will be collected:
      informed consent for data collection, demographics, medical history, medication record,
      physical examination, clinical category of chronic limb ischemia (Rutherford category) and
      resting ankle-brachial index (ABI).

      During the procedure, the vascular access can be achieved to the investigator's standard
      clinical practice. After successful lesion passage, diagnostic angiography of the lesion area
      and distal run-off is performed and angiographic measurements (vessel diameter, percentage
      stenosis and lesion length) are collected. At the physician's discretion, the patient
      receives at least 1 BeGraft Peripheral Plus Stent Graft System. Pre- and post-dilatation are
      according to the physician's discretion. No other adjunctive therapies (atherectomy, laser)
      are allowed. The complete iliac vasculature should be treated in one single session, staged
      interventions are not allowed. All outflow-limiting lesions must be treated according to the
      hospital treatment standard.

      The regular follow-ups are necessary to monitor the condition of the patient and the
      stent/procedure. Patients will be invited for a follow-up visit at 1, 6 and 12 months after
      the index procedure. The following data will be collected during these follow-up visit:
      medication record, physical examination, rutherford categorization, ABI and color flow
      doppler ultrasound.
