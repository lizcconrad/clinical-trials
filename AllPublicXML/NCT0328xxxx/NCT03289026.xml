    <textblock>
      This study attempts to observe the effectiveness and safety of aripiprazole in hospitalized
      patients with acute schizophrenia episode, and to compare the different drug regimens that
      may be involved in order to clarify the characteristics of the population for taking
      aripiprazole and provide reference for clinical rational drug use.

    <textblock>
      The control of acute schizophrenia effectively and rapidly will build up the confidence of
      patients on treatments. These early effects may influence the long-term compliance and
      prognosis of patients. Aripiprazole is an important drug in first line treatment of
      schizophrenia. However, at present in China, the application of aripiprazole in some patients
      with acute schizophrenia is not appropriate, leading to poor control of the positive symptoms
      of the acute phase.

      The purpose of this single-arm, open-label trial is to study the situation of the use of
      aripiprazole in hospitalized patients with acute schizophrenia episode, and to compare the
      different drug regimens that may be involved in order to supply important information for
      optimizing treatment strategies of hospitalized patients characterized by positive symptom.

      The hospitalized patients characterized by positive symptom with acute schizophrenia episode
      were recruited. At the time of enrollment, the demographic, symptomatic and laboratory data
      was collected. After the completion of the baseline assessment and examination, the patients
      were given aripiprazole. Clinical evaluation was performed at 1、2、4 and 8 weeks after
      treatment, including the therapeutic efficacy and adverse drug reactions ,and monitoring of
      laboratory data.
