      This is a single arm, open-label, Phase 1b study of pembrolizumab for patients with
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (ALL) whose disease has relapsed after receiving allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell
      transplant.

    <description>This study will assess if the study drug is promising for further study. The study drug will be considered promising if at least 4 patients receive a clinical benefit or if any complete response is seen. Clinical benefit is defined as either stable disease, partial remission or complete remission to treatment.
Complete remission (CR) will be defined as achieving a morphologic leukemia free state by achieving all of the following criteria: bone marrow myeloblasts &lt; 5% by morphologic assessment; AND absence of circulating blasts with phenotypic or morphologic features of leukemia (e.g. Auer rods) AND no evidence of extramedulary disease.
Partial remission (PR) will be defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in bone marrow blast percentage to 5-25% or marrow blasts &lt; 5% with persistent Auer rods, flow cytometric or cytogenetic disease.
SD will be defined as ≤ 5% increase in blasts or decreased blast percentage in the bone marrow that does not meet the criteria for PR.</description>
