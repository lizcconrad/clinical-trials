    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess the safety and ability of a Panblok H7 influenza
      vaccine adjuvanted with AS03 or MF59 to generate an immune response after 2 doses separated
      by 28 days. Three different antigen dose levels of Panblok H7 will be tested.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, phase 2 study to assess safety and immunogenicity of
      Panblok H7 vaccine at three antigen dose levels (3.75, 7.5, and 15 μg) adjuvanted with AS03
      or MF59. The main purpose of this study is to assess the safety and ability of the
      recombinant Panblok H7 influenza vaccine adjuvanted with AS03 or MF59 to generate an immune
      response after 2 doses separated by 28 days in healthy males and nonpregnant females, aged 18
      to 49 years, inclusive. The expected study duration is approximately 13.5 months per
      participant.

             partner sterilization at least 6 months prior to the female participant's Screening
             Visit, and this male is the sole partner for that participant (the information on the
             male partner's sterility can come from the site personnel's review of the participant
             medical records or interview with the participant on her medical history); male condom
             combined with a vaginal spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository); male
             condom combined with a female diaphragm, either with or without a vaginal spermicide
             (foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository).

             months, or plans to receive immunosuppressive therapy/cytotoxic treatment during study
             participation.

          5. Have an active neoplastic disease or a history of any hematologic malignancy. However,
             participants with superficial skin cancer who do not require intervention other than
             local excision are not excluded.

          6. Have long-term use (≥14 consecutive days) of glucocorticoids including oral or
             parenteral prednisone or prednisone equivalent (&gt;20 mg total dose per day) or
             high-dose inhaled steroids (&gt;800 µg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent)
             within 1 month prior to screening in this study. However, participants on low-dose
             inhaled steroids (≤800 µg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent) or topical
             steroids are not excluded.

          7. History of schizophrenia, bipolar disease, psychosis, or severe personality disorder.

          8. History of hospitalization for psychiatric illness, attempted suicide, or having been

             following the second dose of the study vaccine (Screening Visit through Day 50).

         11. Have an acute or chronic medical condition that, in the opinion of the site
             investigator, would render vaccination unsafe or would interfere with the evaluation
             of responses. This includes all PIMMCs such as Guillain Barré syndrome, narcolepsy,
             and current or history of autoimmune or chronic inflammatory disease.

         12. Have an acute illness, including body temperature greater than 100.4°F, at screening,
             immediately prior to each vaccination or, per participant report, within 3 days prior
             to each vaccination in this study.

         13. Received an experimental agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood product, or
             medication) within 1 month prior to screening in this study or expect to receive an
             experimental agent during the study period.

         14. Are participating or plan to participate in another interventional clinical trial

         19. Have a first degree relative with narcolepsy.

         20. Have any laboratory test result or clinical findings (including vital signs) that
             singly or in combination are likely to unfavorably alter the risk-benefit of
             participation or to confound study safety or immunogenicity results. participants
             cannot be rescreened based on abnormal laboratory test results.

         21. Alanine aminotransferase (AST) &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), or bilirubin
