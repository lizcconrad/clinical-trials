  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) is the cornerstone of blood sugar monitoring. As HbA1c is formed by
      the covalent reaction of glucose with hemoglobin throughout the lifespan of the red blood
      cell (RBC), it is used as a surrogate marker for integrated mean blood glucose over time. The
      HbA1c value therefore is dependent on the average amount of time the RBC spends in the
      circulation (mean RBC age or MRBC). However, our previous studies measuring red cell lifespan
      using either an age cohort label (ex vivo labeling with biotin) or a population label (stable
      isotope) have demonstrated, contrary to established dogma, that the MRBC varies substantially
      among individuals and is sufficiently variable to affect HA1c interpretation in a significant
      percentage of individuals with diabetes. Although the stable isotope method is suitable for
      clinical studies, it has limited potential for application to large population of subjects. A
      potential alternative to the stable isotope approach that could be applied routinely to the
      average patient in the clinic is measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) concentration,
      a reflection of RBC heme turnover. In general, the primary advantage of applying exhaled
      breath analyses to human clinical diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring is that this
      technique is noninvasive, safe, simple, and provides near-real time measurements. The purpose
      of this observational study is to optimize the collection of eCO in a normal control
      population followed by measurement in a cohort of subjects previously assessed by either the
      SI or biotin methods for comparison.

    <textblock>
      Recently Investigators have demonstrated that RBC lifespan has substantial inter-individual
      variation even in people without diabetes or obvious hematologic diseases affecting RBC
      lifespan (5,6). Investigators combined Endocrinology-Hematology research group has taken a
      leading role in applying state-of-the-art methods for RBC survival measurement.The published
      articles articles are now cited when investigators refer to the state of the art
      understanding of true RBC lifespan (7). Using a biotin labeling method that involves ex vivo
      labeling of cells with biotin and then re-infusion of those cells, Investigators were able to
      demonstrate that RBC lifespan is sufficiently heterogeneous even in the hematologically
      normal population with normal reticulocyte count to significantly affect HbA1c interpretation
      (5). Recognizing the limitations of the safe but relatively invasive biotin technique,
      Investigators more recently developed a stable isotope (SI) in which RBC heme is labeled with
      orally administered 15N-glycine (6). This is a benign and noninvasive technique and expands
      the scope of RBC lifespan studies to sizable epidemiologic and physiologic studies, a number
      of which investigators are initiating and planning.

      However, the feasibility of making the findings translatable to widespread patient care has
      been perceived as a limitation to the merit of answering these scientific questions. The SI
      approach still requires multiple blood measurements over months (6). This proposed project is
      designed to test the feasibility of a method to satisfy the unmet clinical need for measuring
      RBC survival easily, noninvasively, and inexpensively. The goal is to access most individuals
      with or at risk for diagnosis of diabetes in or near most doctors' offices. Over the next
      year Investigators intend to determine whether exhaled alveolar carbon monoxide (eCO), a
      measure of heme breakdown and hence of RBC turnover, can be used in this manner to provide a
      single point measure of RBC lifespan. Interestingly, heme metabolism is the only known
      endogenous source of carbon monoxide in people (8) and there are recent studies by others
      suggesting its potential for measuring RBC lifespan (9,10) Now that technology has advanced
      to measure CO with sufficient sensitivity and cost, investigators will explore the use of
      instrumentation at the same time investigators expand their studies using the SI approach.
      The results from this method will be compared with a previous small population of subjects
      that had lifespan measured by biotin and/or SI technique.

    <time_frame>four consecutive weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In this preliminary phase of the study we use a device that has not been used in the United States before (Carbolyzer II, Taiyo, Japan) as a surrogate marker for red blood cell (RBC) removal or turnover in human subjects. Published studies and the company literature for the Carbolyzer mBA-2000 would suggest sufficient capability for the purposes of such measurements. This project will test more rigorously the validity of these specifications for this application. First, the detector will be standardized in more detail with measurement of the CO content of defined mixtures in the range needed for sufficient sensitivity. The device will calibrated prior with known concentrations of a mixture of carbon monoxide in air at three points (0-3-12 ppm). In addition, investigators will evaluate alternative CO detection devices for suitability which do not alter the experience of the participating subject or the accompanying risks and benefits.</description>
