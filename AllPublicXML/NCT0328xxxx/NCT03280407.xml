  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main clinical hypothesis is that compared to radio-chemotherapy for low and mid rectal
      tumors or surgery for high rectal tumors neoadjuvant chemotherapy reduces the rate of distant
      relapse without increasing the rate of local relapse.

      The aim of the present study is to compare long term and short term outcomes in rectal cancer
      patients undergoing standard treatment (radio-chemotherapy/surgery) or experimental
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy/surgery Furthermore, early surgical and medical complications, the
      functional outcome, toxicity and quality of life (QoL) may be improved if radiotherapy can be
      avoided.

      Exploratory analyses are planned in order to find potential predictive markers for selecting
      patients to either radio-chemotherapy/surgery or neoadjuvant combination
      chemotherapy/surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment of locally advanced but resectable cancer in the middle or lower
      rectum is preoperative radio-chemotherapy and in the upper part initial surgery. The clinical
      benefit from radio-chemotherapy is primarily through a reduction in local relapse but the
      treatment is associated with acute toxicity and long term functional dysfunction.
      Subsequently, it is important to select patients with high risk of local relapse. Intense
      systemic combination chemotherapy reduces the risk of distant relapse and increases survival
      in the postoperative setting. The biological rationale is eradication of micrometastases and
      hence it may be anticipated that earlier, i.e. neoadjuvant, combination therapy may improve
      systemic control.
