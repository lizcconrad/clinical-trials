  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SHARE-CC is an intervention for families facing the challenges of chronic conditions.
      SHARE-CC (Support, Help, Activities, Resources, and Education) addresses the need for both
      members of a care dyad to be actively involved in current and future care planning. This
      intervention aims to increase knowledge of services, improve communication skills and
      well-being, and facilitate the understanding of care values and preferences in order to
      create a mutually agreed upon care plan. This intervention will be tested in a randomized
      control trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project offers a unique and timely opportunity to evaluate the feasibility,
      acceptability, and efficacy of the SHARE-Chronic Conditions psycho-social intervention. The
      project will adapt the SHARE intervention, for use with dyads facing the challenges of
      chronic conditions. The six-session SHARE-CC program will be implemented and evaluated using
      a randomized controlled trial with 240 participants in northern Ohio, the San Diego and San
      Francisco Bay areas in California, and New Jersey.

      The SHARE-CC intervention addresses the need for a structured approach that targets both
      members of a care dyad and empowers them to be actively involved in current and future care
      planning. It has great potential to not only improve psychosocial outcomes for families, but
      to also impact healthcare decision-making and utilization.

      Persons with chronic conditions and their caregivers will be interviewed prior to (Time 1)
      and after participating (approximately 4 months post-Time 1) in the SHARE-CC intervention or
      PWCC control group.

    <description>Six weekly &quot;SHARE for Chronic Conditions (SHARE-CC)&quot; sessions will be conducted in the dyad's home or another location preferred by the participants. A care plan (the SHARE plan) is created that reflects the mutual decisions made by the dyad as a result of their participation in the SHARE-CC program. The SHARE plan is intended to help the caregiver (CG) ensure the PWCC's values and preferences are supported when decisions have to be made in an emergency or in the end stages of the disease. SHARE plans will be documented in a notebook that also contains information on key topics and provides links to local and online resources and services.</description>

    <description>Each of the 6 SHARE-CC sessions are structured similarly, starting with the dyad reviewing goals of the session, the CG &amp; PWCC meeting jointly or separately with the SHARE-CC Counselor around session-specific material, &amp; ending with a review of material, addressing questions, &amp; previewing the next session. Sessions titles are: Communication &amp; Health Education; Care Values; Care Preferences; Family, Friends, &amp; Community Resources; Taking care of yourself—taking care of each other; &amp; Take Action Now.
The SHARE plan will be developed throughout the sessions and reflects the consensus achieved because of participating in SHARE-CC. It is intended to ensure that the PWCC's values &amp; preferences are supported when decisions have to be in the future.</description>
