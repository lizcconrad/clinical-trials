  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of cosmetics is an important source of exposure to many chemicals including endocrine
      disruptors. Recently, national and international scientific recommendations have been issued
      to limit exposure to chemicals during pregnancy. However, the perception and the use of
      cosmetics by pregnant women is still little studied. The objectives of the PERICOS study are
      to identify the risk perception and the attitudes regarding cosmetic's use by the pregnant
      women.

      Understanding the risk perception, the knowledge, attitudes and expectations of women about
      the use of cosmetics during pregnancy will help to set up effective strategies to improve
      prevention of chemical exposure.

      A qualitative study of 60 pregnant women using six focus groups (9-11 pregnant women per
      group) was implemented study in Auvergne Region, France. Six focus groups will be conducted
      until data saturation.

      The women will be recruited from the Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital (maternity type III
      - 2 groups), the private clinic in Beaumont (maternity type II - 2 groups), the Saint-Flour
      hospital center (maternity type I - 1 group), and from liberal health professionals (1
      group).

      If a women is found to be eligible, she will be invited to participate in the study. The
      focus group discussions will be conducted in a private room in the maternity of the women.
      They will last approximately 2 hours and will be led by an interviewer using an interview
      grid.

      All interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed, coded and computerized for analysis with
      the NVIVO v11 software.
