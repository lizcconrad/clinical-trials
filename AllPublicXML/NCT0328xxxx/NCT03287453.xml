    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies how well educational intervention works in improving knowledge
      and screening rates of colorectal cancer. An educational intervention, such as viewing an
      inflatable colon, PowerPoint presentation, or flip books/flipcharts, may help improve
      knowledge about colorectal cancer and how often people get checked for colorectal cancers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To increase colorectal cancer (CRC) knowledge, attitudes, positive behavior change, intent
      for screening, and screening among at-risk groups.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants attend educational sessions comprising of an inflatable colon interactive
      exhibit that allows visitors to walk through a colon while seeing images, or a PowerPoint
      presentation that contains messages that are tailored to meet the cultural and linguistic
      needs of Black/African Americans, Appalachians, and Hispanics/Latinos, and flip books/flip
      charts. Participants also receive a copy of the study information sheet which contains the
      basic elements of informed consent and a pre-education session knowledge survey.

    <description>Change in knowledge will be examined as a function of the important covariates: race/ethnicity, sex, age, education and primary language. A paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be used to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in pre and post session scores. The paired t-test provides a hypothesis test to determine whether pre and post session assessment mean scores differ from each other in a significant way under the assumptions that the paired differences are independent and identically normally distributed. The test statistic is t with n-1 degrees of f</description>

    <description>Will be correlated with key outcomes, specifically actual screening and actions promoting colorectal cancer screening (e.g., encouraging colorectal screening with family/friends). Multivariable logistic regression analyses will be conducted to examine the impact of knowledge change and strength of intentions on these binary outcomes (screened/not screened and encouraged/did not encourage colorectal screening) controlling for important covariates such as sex, race/ethnicity, age, education and primary language.
