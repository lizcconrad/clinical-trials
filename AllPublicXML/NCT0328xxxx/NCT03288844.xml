  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, multicentre, prospective, non-pharmacological follow-up study of the
      clinical trial HOLOCORE. All patients transplanted with Holoclar in the HOLOCORE clinical
      trial who consent to participate will be enrolled in this prospective study and observed for
      at least 12 months.

    <textblock>
      HOLOCORE FOLLOW-UP prospective study offers the opportunity to collect long-term efficacy and
      safety data after one or two treatments with Holoclar. Moreover, since Holoclar (study drug
      used in the main HOLOCORE interventional clinical trial) is suspected to improve the success
      of keratoplasty in those patients candidate to receive this treatment but no data were
      collected in the three previous retrospective studies (HLSTM01, HLSTM02 and HLSTM04) on
      Holoclar, this follow-up study has been thought to observe the progress of the disease and to
      collect data on keratoplasty and evaluate the benefits of Holoclar in subsequent keratoplasty
      in patients treated once or two times with Holoclar.

      All patients treated in the HOLOCORE clinical trial who consent to roll over to the present
      extension study at the end of the HOLOCORE will be observed for a follow-up period which may
      vary from a minimum of 12 month for the last patient to a maximum of 57 months for the first
      patient entered.

      A total of approximately 70 patients is expected (all patients who completed the HOLOCORE
      study).

      In case the last enrolled patient undergoes to Keratoplasty at the Last Visit of the
      Follow-up study, this will consequently lead to a prolongation of the study up to further 12
      months for all patients.

      The subjects will be enrolled and observed at the same investigational centers where they
      were recruited for the HOLOCORE clinical trial.

      No drug will be administered for the scope of this study. Ophtalmological visits including
      pictures collection and quality of life evaluations will be performed every 6 months.

        All eligible patients who entered the core HOLOCORE study will be asked consent to roll
        over into this extension study before their inclusion. Approximately 70 patients will be
        enrolled in this study.

        Safety population: all patients entering the study. The adult safety population will be
        used to explore efficacy. Efficacy data collected on paediatric population will be only
        listed.
