    <description>A standard 3+3 trial design will be used for Decitabine dose escalation cohorts.
The number of cohorts is three. The subjects will be administered Decitabine on every seven days in a 28day cycle and Decitabine is sequential administered with Paclitaxel.
Cohort 1: Decitabine 15mg/m2, Cohort 2: Decitabine 20mg/m2, Cohort 3: Decitabine 25mg/m2</description>
