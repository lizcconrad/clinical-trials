      The current study adresses the effect of two different computer-based cognitive training
      programmes (Brain+ Evolution and Scientific Brain Training PRO) on attention and executive
      functions in patients with Parkinson's disease. The patients are assigned to one of three
      groups. Two training groups with each their programme, and a control Group. The training
      groups will train at home for 8 weeks with follow-ups every second week. The control group
      will not train at home, but will also receive a follow-up with computer-based stimuli
      (computerized Card game) every second week, to minimize the possibility that a possible
      effect is due to the follow-up's with a professional, and not due to the computer training at
      home.
