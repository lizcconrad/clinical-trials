  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Haemodialysis (HD) patients constitute a vulnerable population with considerable health
      needs. They are often older persons with comorbid chronic conditions. Despite the substantial
      technical care they receive, these patients indicate that the quality of the human
      relationship that develops with nurses-the pivotal element in the care this population
      receives-can become therapeutic. This feature of the human relationship constitutes the
      cornerstone of the humanistic practice (caring practice) that all nurses should adhere to.
      However, according to some authors, such practice tends to fade over time. In 2012, a pilot
      study allowed to test an educational intervention based on Watson's Theory of Human Caring,
      the aim of which was to optimise nurses' humanistic practices. The intervention, first
      developed in Quebec and adapted in Switzerland by a committee of experts, was delivered to a
      group of nine HD nurses (Canton of Vaud, Switzerland) and evaluated. Preliminary results
      (qualitative and quantitative) showed the intervention to be highly feasible and acceptable.
      Moreover, in terms of preliminary outcomes, participating nurses appeared to strengthen their
      caring attitudes/behaviours toward HD patients post-intervention. Quantitative analyses of
      patients' questionnaires showed that HD patients perceived significant changes in nurses'
      caring attitudes/behaviours and maintained their level of quality of life (QoL) over time,
      which is a definite gain for this population. In light of these positive results, it is
      important to pursue this line of investigation in order to examine more accurately the
      intervention's effects on both nurses and patients. To this end, the investigators propose
      conducting a mixed-methods cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) to assess the effects of
      an educational intervention to strengthen humanistic practice among nurses working in HD
      units in French Switzerland, on perceived quality of the nurse-patient relationship (NPR),
      nurses' team cohesion, nurses' quality of working life (QoWL), and HD patients' QoL.
      Knowledge acquired in the course of the study will contribute to strengthen nurses'
      humanistic practice, a key factor in HD patients' QoL.

    <time_frame>30 months</time_frame>
    <description>NPR will be measured with the French version (EIIP-70) of the Caring Nurse-Patient Interaction Scale (CNPI-70). This tool comprises 70 items across 10 dimensions that capture each of Watson's 10 CF. It allows nurses to selfevaluate their frequency of caring attitudes/behaviours. More specifically, the EIIP-70 covers the following dimensions: humanism (6 items), hope (7 items), sensitivity (6 items), relationship (7 items), emotions (6 items), problem solving (6 items), teaching (11 items), assistance (10 items) and existential factors (6 items). Respondents must choose from five responses ranging from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). This tool was validated on 377 nursing students and demonstrates good psychometric properties (Cronbach's alphas for the ten sub-dimensions range from .73 to .91).</description>

    <measure>Nurses' team cohesion</measure>
    <time_frame>30 months</time_frame>
    <description>Team cohesion will be measured with the Group Environment Questionnaire (GEQ), which was subsequently adapted for work teams. Like the original, the French version contains 18 items and encompasses the four dimensions of team cohesion, namely, respondent's social-related attraction to the group (5 items, 1 of which is reverse scored), respondent's task-related attraction to the group (4 items, 2 of which are reverse scored), social-related group integration as perceived by respondent (4 items, 2 of which are reverse scored), and task-related group integration as perceived by respondent (5 items, 1 of which is reverse scored). The response scale ranges from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The questionnaire was tested on a sample of nurses from another healthcare institution. No major comprehension difficulties emerged. Cronbach's alphas for the different dimensions run from 0.71 to 0.81.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Nurses' quality of working life (QoWL) - nurses</measure>
    <time_frame>30 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of working life (QoWL) will be measured with a scale developed by Elizur and Shye (70), translated and validated in French. The scale is composed of 16 items exploring different dimensions of QoWL : psychological (items 1-4), physical (items 5-8), social (items 9-12) and cultural (items 13-16). Respondents must choose from six answers on a Likert scale ranging from &quot;a very large part&quot; to &quot;very little&quot;.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hemodyalisis patients' quality of life (QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life (QoL) of HD patients will be explored with a French version of the WHOQOL-BREF. This scale is a generic instrument that serves to explore perceived QoL and the impact of health problems on QoL. It comprises 26 items exploring four dimensions: physical health (7 items), psychological health (6 items), social relationships (3 items), and environment (8 items). It also contains two items measuring overall QoL, which is an added advantage of this instrument. Respondents must choose from five responses on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 5 (completely). The WHOQOLBREF yields an overall &quot;QoL profile&quot; score on a scale of 0 to 100, as well as scores for each dimension. A high score indicates a high perceived QoL. The French version translated and validated, and has shown perfectly satisfactory psychometric properties, and good acceptability by the population with a non-response rate below 5%.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nurse-patient relationship (NPR) - patients</measure>
    <time_frame>30 months</time_frame>
    <description>NPR will be explored with the French version (EIIP-70) (66) of the Caring Nurse-Patient Interaction Scale (CNPI-70) (for a description of dimensions, see Nurse section). Only the person addressed has been changed in order to adapt the items to the patient's viewpoint. The scale has been validated on a French population of patients living with HIV and presents perfectly satisfactory psychometric properties (Cronbach's alphas from 0.75 to 0.85). The scale allows HD patients to assess nurses' caring attitudes and behaviours.</description>
