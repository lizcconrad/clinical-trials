  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improvement in the functional functioning and dyspnea of COPD patients after a rehabilitation
      program (RHB) is assessed by exercise tests and questionnaires difficult to replicate outside
      specialized centers.

      In order to monitor the eventual decline of patients in the course of their RHB management,
      Chair Rise Tests (3CRT-1CRT-5STS) and short questionnaires were developed (CAT-DIRECT). The
      goal of this prospective, multicenter, real-life study is to compare the change in several
      functional function tests and questionnaires of quality of life and dyspnea related to daily
      activities. In addition, MCIDs of the 3CRT and the DIRECT questionnaire (Disability Related
      to COPS Tool) were specified.
