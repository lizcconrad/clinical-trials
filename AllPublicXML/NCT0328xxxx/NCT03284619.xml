  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigational device is the Magnetic resonance imager linear accelerator. Five (5) patients
      with bone metastases will be treated with palliative intention in this study. The goal is to
      confirm the pre-clinically demonstrated technical accuracy and safety of the newly developed
      MR-Linac in the clinical setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center prospective proof of concept study including accuracy and safety
      aspects according to R-IDEAL stage 1 criteria. Five (5) patients with bone metastases will be
      treated with palliative intention in this study. Treatment will consist of a single fraction.

      The MR linear accelerator (MRL) integrates a radiotherapy accelerator and a diagnostic
      quality 1.5T MRI, enabling soft-tissue visualization during the actual radiation delivery for
      improved targeting. This enables on-line treatment optimization for precise radiation
      delivery. Better visualization of the tumour targets and the surrounding healthy tissues, at
      the exact moment of treatment, makes it possible to adapt the dose to the actual anatomy
      while optimally sparing normal tissues.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety of the treatment system (a dose distribution accuracy ≤ 5% will be considered acceptable). Incidence of acute toxicity (CTCAE grade 2 are higher) and incidence of Serious (unexpected) Adverse Events will be measured.</measure>
    <time_frame>During treatment (Day 0). For patient safety patients will be contacted at day 1, week 2 and week 12 after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Safety of the system: System behaves in accordance with the workflow and risk mitigation plan, Dosimetric safety: An independent dosimetry check before start irradiation (Oncentra) and an independent dosimetry during irradiation (second chamber) will be used. For the overall process a dose distribution accuracy ≤ 5% will be considered acceptable.
Patients safety: by reporting any acute toxicity &gt; grade 2 (according CTCAE version 4.0 for acute toxicity) and any Serious (Unexpected) Adverse Events (S(U)AE) within 12 weeks after treatment</description>
