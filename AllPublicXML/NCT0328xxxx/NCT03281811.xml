  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well photodynamic therapy works in treating patients
      with mycosis fungoides that does not respond to treatment. Photodynamic therapy uses a drug,
      such as aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride, that becomes active when it is exposed to light.
      The activated drug may kill cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in refractory tumors and plaques
      of mycosis fungoides (MF).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of sequential PDT and radiation therapy (RT). II. To determine
      the side effect profile of PDT in MF.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the quality of life during and after treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride topically and undergo photodynamic therapy
      on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning at week 24, patients undergo radiation
      therapy daily for 4 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 8 weeks.

          -  Provide written informed consent

          -  Willing to return to enrolling institution for follow-up (during the Active Monitoring
             Phase of the study)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior radiation to the same site deemed to be too high of level of radiation for
             retreatment

          -  Photosensitivity disorder, including but not limited to porphyria, or concomitant
             photosensitizing drugs that place the patient at an elevated risk of developing severe
             side effects to PDT or RT

          -  Skin cancer other than actinic keratosis, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Lactation and a radiation field which would include the breast or nipple or deemed to
             place the mother or child at elevated risk of radiation exposure (evaluated by MRP,

          -  An allergy to a component of Levulan

          -  Women of childbearing potential (post-menopausal or not of child-bearing potential) is
             defined by: 1 year of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea or surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at
             least 6 weeks ago; oophorectomy alone must confirmed by follow up hormone level
             assessment to be considered not of child-bearing potential, defined as all women
             physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using basic methods of
             contraception which includes:

               -  Total abstinence (Periodic abstinence and withdrawal are not acceptable methods

          -  Co-morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment
             of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or
             interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the
             prescribed regimens

          -  Immunocompromised patients and patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             positive and currently receiving antiretroviral therapy; NOTE: Patients known to be
             HIV positive, but without clinical evidence of an immunocompromised state, are
             eligible for this trial

          -  Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
