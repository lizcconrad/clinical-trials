    <textblock>
      This study examines a computer-based attention bias modification training as an augmentation
      of individual cognitive behavioral therapy for pediatric anxiety.

      All participants will receive interviews to assess how they are doing in general, including
      general mood, degree of nervousness, and behavior. Each participant and one of his or her
      parents will be interviewed separately and together. Participants are asked to complete tasks
      involving problem-solving, attention, and emotion that involve looking at pictures,
      remembering things, testing reaction times, and making simple choices.

      Participants with anxiety will first meet with a psychologist for 12 weeks of individual
      cognitive behavioral therapy. In addition, participants will be randomly and blindly assigned
      to receive either an active computer-based attention bias modification training task or an
      inactive/placebo version of this task, administered as part of their therapy treatment. The
      active training is thought to help anxiety whereas the inactive training is thought to have
      no effect.

      The purpose of this part of the study is to understand the best way to help children and
      adolescents who are having problems with anxiety. However, more research is needed to find
      the best way to help such children and adolescents. During and after the treatment, each
      participant will complete verbal and written symptom ratings.

      Those who have not improved by the end of the study will be offered other treatment for 1 to
      3 months, and the clinicians will help with finding subsequent aftercare. Those who improve
      with treatment will continue therapy at NIH until an outside physician is able to assume
      responsibility for monitoring medication.

      Objective: The goal of this protocol is to test the efficacy of a computer-based attention
      bias modification training (comparing active vs. placebo) as an augmentation of individual
      cognitive behavioral therapy for youth with anxiety disorders.

      Study Population: A total of 120 children and adolescents (8-17 years old) will be recruited
      to participate in this treatment trial.

      Design: Participants' psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses will be assessed by clinical
      interview. Participants will engage in 12 weeks of individual cognitive behavioral therapy in
      addition to being randomized to receive either an active or placebo version of a
      computer-based attention bias modification training.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures to be examined are change in scores on the
      Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale and Clinical Global Impression Scale across treatment.
