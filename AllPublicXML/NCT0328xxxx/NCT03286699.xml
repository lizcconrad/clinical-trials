  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the research is to provide a first critical test of the novel scientific idea
      that a combined diet and exercise intervention may ameliorate shortening of leukocyte
      telomere length (LTL) in cancer survivors with a history of non-muscle invasive bladder
      cancer (NMIBC) compared to a diet only intervention.

    <description>The behavioral weight loss intervention strategies will not be limited to, self-monitoring, goal setting, problem solving, mastery skills, social support, and relapse prevention. Participants will receive a standard behavioral weight control program, delivered on a one-on-one basis. They will attend in-person sessions (~30-45 minutes) with time to: distribute intervention materials, interact with the participant, identify participants that need additional support, and conduct the intervention. Each in-person visit focuses on a specific behavioral topic related to weight loss to address eating behaviors. Subjects will also participate in phone calls with the interventionist (~10 minutes). Depending on the week, subjects will have between 10 and 45 minutes of total intervention contact.</description>
