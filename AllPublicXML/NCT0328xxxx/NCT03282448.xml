    <textblock>
      This pilot study will explore the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a
      family-based treatment, using HIPAA-compliant video-based communication technology, for
      adolescents (pregnant and post-delivery) with peripartum depressive symptoms within the
      context of home visiting.

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of the pilot study is to partner with two Federal Maternal, Infant and Early
      Childhood Home Visiting (HV) Program sites to implement a family-based treatment for
      depression, using HIPAA-compliant video-based communication technology, in adolescent mothers
      (pregnant and post-delivery). This implementation-effectiveness hybrid trial includes
      depressed adolescent mothers and their adult family members.

      It has three aims:

        1. Explore the feasibility of integrating the treatment model into two Federal HV Program
           sites in New Hampshire.

        2. Test the acceptability of the treatment model among depressed adolescent mothers and
           their families.

        3. Explore preliminary impacts of the treatment on maternal depressive symptoms and
           parenting attitudes, family emotion regulation, and family functioning at two months
           post-intervention.
