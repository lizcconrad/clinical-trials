  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) is the most frequent of
      myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative syndromes, as defined by the WHO classification of myeloid
      malignancies. The median age at diagnosis is around 70 years with a strong male predominance.
      CMML is a clonal disease of the bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell mainly characterized by
      persistent monocytosis (&gt;1x109/L) and the presence of immature dysplastic granulocytes in the
      peripheral blood of CMML patients. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) remains the
      only curative option in CMML. However, CMML patients are rarely eligible for this kind of
      therapy, mainly due to their advanced age. The gold standard treatment of CMML thus remains
      hydroxyurea, which is usually initiated when the disease becomes proliferative, and
      demethylating agents, which could be efficient in the most aggressive forms of CMML.
      Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of CMML remains poorly understood and new therapies are
      urgently needed for patients in treatment failure.

      In recent years, a large numbers of gene mutations have been discovered in CMML, none of
      which are specific of this entity, as they can be encountered with different frequencies in
      other myeloid neoplasms. These mutated genes encode signaling molecules (NRAS, KRAS, CBL,
      JAK2, FLT3 and several members of the Notch pathway), epigenetic regulators (TET2, ASXL1,
      EZH2, IDH1, IDH2,.) and splicing factors (SF3B1, SRSF2, ZRSF2). Mutations in the
      transcription regulators RUNX1, NPM1 and TP53 have also been reported in CMML. However, the
      role of these mutations in leukemogenesis is still unclear. CMML is also characterized by
      defects in monocyte to macrophage differentiation. These defects in monocyte differentiation
      can be attributed to the presence of immature dysplastic granulocytes that secrete high
      levels of alpha-defensins HNP1-3 that antagonize the purinergic receptor P2RY6 in CMML
      patients. These CD14-/CD15+/CD24+ immature granulocytes that belong to the same clone than
      the leukemic monocytes seem to have immunosuppressive properties ressembling those of the
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDCS) described in solid tumours. Whether these immature
      granulocytes contribute to autoimmune manifestations or immunoescape and progression of CMML
      is a conendrum and remains to be determined.

      In this context, the proposed project aims at identifying news insights into the
      pathophysiology of CMML through a better definition of the phenotype and function of
      monocytes and immature granulocytes that characterize this pathology.
