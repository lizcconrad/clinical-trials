  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The classic physiopathology of cardiogenic shock is explained by a systolic ventricular
      failure, responsible for a decrease in cardiac output associated with high systemic vascular
      resistances (SVR). This theory is currently challenged in light of the data collected in the
      SHOCK study, which assessed outcome of early revascularization versus initial medical
      stabilization, in cardiogenic shock following myocardial infarction.13 A sub-study
      highlighted depressed SVR in the population with ischemic cardiogenic shock, related to a
      systemic inflammatory response syndrome.14 Furthermore, mean FEVG was 30% in the SHOCK
      trial,13 with a similar distribution with post myocardial infarction heart failure patients
      without signs of shock.15-19 Thus, alteration of myocardial contractility can be only
      moderate in cardiogenic shock and isn't the only cause responsible for the hemodynamic
      instability.20 Recent studies suggest the important roles of the peripheral vascular system
      and neurohormonal system in the genesis and prolongation of cardiogenic shock.12 Vasodilation
      caused by nitrous oxide synthase activation27 explains the absence of compensating
      vasoconstriction observed during the SHOCK trial13, and leads to decreased systemic and
      coronary perfusion, thus increasing myocardial ischemia and initial ventricular dysfunction.
      28,29 Cotter et al. conducted an interesting study of hemodynamic evaluation of various
      cardiac conditions where they observed a significant variability in the peripheral vascular
      status, with systemic vascular resistances collapsed in certain patients (similar to those
      observed in septic shock) and rather close to normal or very high resistances in other
      patients.21 However these data were obtained from a selected group of patients without
      differentiating the etiology of cardiogenic shock. Finally, the majority of available studies
      were limited to cardiogenic shock whose etiology was myocardial infarction.

      Therapeutic management of cardiogenic shock is based in first intention on an inotropic
      support by Dobutamine.11,23 However, better outcomes on contractility and microcirculatory
      state have been observed with the use of a vasopressor support by Norepinephrine, suggesting
      the importance of SVR decreasing in genesis of cardiogenic shock.14,24 Recent reviews showed
      very few data on inotropic treatment and association with vasopressor support,22 hence the
      low level of recommendations in current guidelines.11,23

      So far it is crucial to accurately characterize hemodynamic status and in particular the
      systemic vascular resistance for patients with cardiogenic shock. Important variabilities in
      hemodynamic profiles observed in Cooter's trial could explain the difficulty in defining an
      optimal therapeutic strategy.

      the investigators hypothesize that the hemodynamic profile, particularly SVR, of patients
      with cardiogenic shock is different depending on their etiology. Ischemic cardiogenic shock
      should be characterized by lower SVR, in relation to a major role of systemic inflammatory
      response syndrome. On the contrary, non-ischemic cardiogenic shock could be associated with
      normal or elevated SVR, and thus could explain the variability in distribution of SVR.
