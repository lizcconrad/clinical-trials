  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wearable, commercially-available physical activity monitors are being increasingly
      incorporated into chronic pain self-management interventions as a tool to help patients set
      goals and to tailor intervention content based on patient progress. Yet older adults from
      resource-challenged communities may face significant barriers to using these monitors and
      reporting activity data. Our pilot study will focus on wearable monitor use among older
      adults in Detroit with chronic musculoskeletal pain, testing the feasibility and validity of
      various technology-based strategies for reporting daily step count data. The study will also
      assess whether six weeks of monitor use is associated with improvements in functioning,
      relative to a control group.

    <description>Participants in the STEPS (Seniors Tracking Exercise for Pain Self-management) intervention will receive a commercially-available, wearable physical activity monitor. They will be asked to wear this monitor during waking hours for 6 weeks, reporting their daily step count every evening. The way in which participants report steps will change every 2 weeks. For the first 4 weeks of the study, participants will report via Interactive Voice Response (IVR) calls for 2 weeks and SMS text messages for 2 weeks. For the final two week period, research staff will help participants to set up the monitor to automatically send daily step counts to STEPS project staff. This can be done through a smartphone, tablet, or computer.</description>
