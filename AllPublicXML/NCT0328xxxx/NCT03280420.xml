  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this work is to compare between early (3days) and late(7days) removal of urinary
      catheter after acute urine retention in patients with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia under
      Tamsulosin treatment.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized study, Men with acute urinary retention secondary to benign
      prostatic hyperplasia were catheterized and then, if they fulfilled the entry criteria, were
      randomly assigned to receive 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride for three days or seven days,
      After that the catheter was removed and the ability to void unaided assessed.

After catheter removal, patients will be allowed to void and will be discharged home who will have a successful void more than 200 cc of urine. Patients who will fail to void will be re-catheterized and will be prepared for prostatectomy.</description>
