        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 to 85

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid tumors

          -  Patients will be received femoral venepuncture for apheresis by cell separator, which
             is the necessary process to perform following adoptive cell immunotherapy.

          -  Estimated life expectancy &gt; 3 months

          -  Adequate hematologic function, with WBC ≥ 3000/microliter, hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL (it is
             acceptable to have had prior transfusion), platelets ≥ 75,000/microliter; PT-INR &lt;1.5
             (unless patient is receiving warfarin in which case PT-INR must be &lt;3), PTT &lt;1.5X ULN

          -  Adequate renal and hepatic function, with serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL, bilirubin &lt;
             1.5 mg/dL (except for Gilbert's syndrome which will allow bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL), ALT
             and AST ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  known conditions associated with high risk of bleeding, known history of hemorrhagic
             diathesis

          -  Platelet count &lt; 50 000 G/L

          -  Active bleeding

          -  Patients with a history of autoimmune disease, such as but not restricted to,
             inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis,
             scleroderma, or multiple sclerosis. Autoimmune related thyroid disease and vitiligo
             are permitted.

          -  Patients with obstructive jaundice

          -  Patients with Spleen hyperfunction

          -  Presence of an active acute or chronic infection including: a urinary tract infection,
             HIV (as determined by ELISA and confirmed by Western Blot). Patients with HIV are
             excluded based on immuno-suppression, which may render them unable to respond to the
             vaccine; patients with chronic hepatitis are excluded because of concern that
             hepatitis could be exacerbated by the injections.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women，or lack of effective contraceptive treatment for
             women of childbearing age.;
