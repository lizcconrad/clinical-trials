  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research hypotheses that preoperative formal hypnosis session reduces perioperative
      anxiety among women undergoing a hysterectomy for pelvic gynecological cancer. The key
      objective is to estimate the effect of preoperative hypnosis on preoperative anxiety among
      this population

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety is present preoperatively in 40% of patients. The operated subjects are on average
      20% more anxious than the general population, according to a study of 2013. Cancer as well as
      surgery modifying the body pattern and impairing femininity are risk factors for preoperative
      anxiety. Recent work in both children and adults has shown that significant levels of
      preoperative anxiety increase the risk of postoperative complications and the occurrence of
      postoperative emotional and behavioral disorders. The consequences of hysterectomy increase
      patients' anxiety, for fear of affecting femininity, and the modification of the body
      regimen. The prevention of preoperative anxiety in such population is therefore a major
      issue.

    <description>Caregiver Accompaniment Time (CAT) + preoperative hypnosis session (experimental arm): The hypnosis session is performed by a nurse trained in medical hypnosis; this interview lasts approximately one hour and is carried out 5 to 15 days before the hospitalisation. During the hypnosis session, the patient is free to choose what issues she wants to address. The patient will then go from a state of ordinary consciousness to a modified state of consciousness. This state will allow her to activate her own resources to handle difficulties, especially anxiety. Using a post-hypnotic suggestion, the patient will be able to revisit her work at any time she needs</description>

    <description>CAT is performed in routine care for all patients after the announcement of the illness by a trained nurse, if possible on the same day as the consultation or before the consultation of anesthesia. This is an interview of approximately 45 minutes to listen to the patient, to answer her questions and to re-explain the information delivered to her. The patient will tackle the history of the disease and then the treatment, this time dedicated evolves according to the desire of the patient and her ability to accept the disease. The patient can express her feelings, then the family circle is evoked talking about the resource persons and the future. The purpose of this interview is to obtain the autonomy of the patient by the setting up of supportive care</description>
