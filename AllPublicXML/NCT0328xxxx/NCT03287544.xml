  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Linguistic training is traditionally the gold standard for rehabilitation of aphasia after
      stroke and efficacy criteria count early stage, intensity as well as personalized treatment.
      To date, no clear evidence showed a specific effect of any therapy in the acute phase of
      aphasia after stroke. This study aims to compare the effect of a combined therapy
      (linguistic/communication) versus a linguistic therapy on communication performance in
      patients in the acute phase of aphasia after a first stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty to 25% of strokes cause aphasia. Speech and language therapy is the well-known
      standard treatment of aphasia after stroke although it is based on weak scientific evidence.
      To date, the efficacy criteria of aphasia rehabilitation are early stage, intensity as well
      as personalized treatment. Usually these patients receive in acute phase a linguistic
      training focused on the linguistic impairment. This approach is based on the cerebral
      plasticity postulate. However the superiority of this practice compared to other methods has
      never been shown. Moreover the benefit of the combination gathering linguistic treatment with
      communication treatment has to our knowledge never been studied.

      In the present study investigators propose to compare the effect of a combined
      linguistic/communication rehabilitation versus a linguistic treatment. To do so,
      investigators will recruit patients with aphasia after a first stroke, in the acute phase.
      After a allocation to the &quot; combined &quot; and &quot; linguistic &quot; groups, all the patients will have
      a comprehensive language and neuropsychological assessment before and after 3 months of
      rehabilitation, and finally 6 months after the onset.

      The &quot;linguistic&quot; group will have a rehabilitation only focused on linguistic processes
      whereas the &quot;combined&quot; group will have a linguistic training as well as communication
      training. The therapy will be personalized and the therapists will exclusively use
      standardized linguistic and/or communication toolboxes of rehabilitation containing dedicated
      activities.

    <intervention_model_description>There are two arms in the protocol: one experimental arm corresponding to the &quot;combined&quot; rehabilitation (linguistic/communication) compared with another arm corresponding to the &quot;linguistic&quot; rehabilitation.
All included patients, after allocation based on aphasia severity to the &quot; combined &quot; and &quot; linguistic &quot; groups, will have a first evaluation (E1: language, neurologic and neuropsychological exams) within 7 days after the onset. Then after a 3 months rehabilitation period they will be assessed (E2: language, neurologic and neuropsychological exams). At 6 months after the onset they will finally have the last assessment (E3: language, neurologic and neuropsychological exams).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>After the allocation in the groups, rehabilitation is not done blindly since the speech therapist knows what activities he offers to patients. However, the evaluations carried out by a speech therapist, are done without the knowledge of the rehabilitation group.</masking_description>
