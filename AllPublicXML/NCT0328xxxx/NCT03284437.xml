  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how early cognitive training (participation/involvement
      in activities to stimulate the brain) in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) affects the number of
      patients who experience delirium (confusion) and cognitive impairment (problems with
      thinking). Reports have shown that 30% to 80% of all ICU patients will have some type of
      cognitive impairment: remembering, paying attention, solving problems, organizing, and
      working on complex tasks for some time after they leave the hospital.

      Occupational therapy will do an assessment after an order is received from the doctor. The
      patient will be randomly placed into one of two groups. If the patient is in group A then
      they will continue with occupational therapy as normal. If the patient is assigned to group B
      then they and the family will have access to an activity cart found there in the ICU unit,
      directed by the nurses. The family will work with the patient on a daily basis to complete
      activities that are appropriate for the patient based on the occupational therapist's
      assessment. All patients in the study will receive medical care as usual.

      Information about the patient's recovery in the hospital will be collected. In addition,
      patients and/or their family member will complete surveys at 6 months and 1 year after
      enrollment to see how they have recovered and if there are continuing issues. The two groups
      of patients, those who received the early cognitive training and those who did not, will be
      compared statistically to see if there are any differences in how well they recovered. Since
      this intervention involving family members working with the patient has not previously been
      evaluated, the study will also examine the feasibility of conducting these activities in the
      ICU setting.

    <textblock>
      This pilot study will assess the feasibility of implementing a randomized clinical trial
      testing an early cognitive training program for patients in the ICU. This cognitive training
      program was developed at Mount Carmel Health System in conjunction with occupational
      therapists and has not been previously evaluated.

      Specific Aim 1: To evaluate whether the trial can accrue a sufficient number of patients
      within a reasonable time period to complete a randomized trial for efficacy.

      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate whether the trial can be conducted as designed.

      Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the likelihood that the trial can retain a sufficient number of
      patients through the end of follow-up.

      Assessments include the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (MoCA), Richmond Agitation and
      Sedation Scale (RASS), Confusion Assessment Method in the ICU (CAM-ICU) and a validated
      quality of life survey.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must be in the intensive care unit, i.e., either the surgical intensive care
