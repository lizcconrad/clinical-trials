  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      STRATUS will evaluate the use of small-volume (&quot;soft-draw&quot;) blood collection tubes for
      laboratory testing in reducing anemia and transfusion in intensive care unit patients without
      significant adverse consequences. This is a simple, cost-neutral intervention that could
      improve the quality of patient care and reduce the harms of frequent laboratory testing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The STRATUS Pilot Study is a prospective observational study (before-after design) to assess
      the feasibility of implementing a full-scale randomized trial powered for clinical outcomes
      (RBC transfusion, incidence and severity of anemia). Identification of barriers and
      facilitators of implementation will enhance the conduct of the full-scale trial and
      facilitate incorporation of the intervention into routine practice.
