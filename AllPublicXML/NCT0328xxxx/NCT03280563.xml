  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of several
      immunotherapy-based combination treatments in participants with metastatic HR-positive,
      HER2-negative breast cancer who have progressed during or following first-line metastatic
      treatment with a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor such as palbociclib, ribociclib,
      or abemaciclib. The study will be performed in two stages. During Stage 1, participants will
      be randomized to fulvestrant (control) or an atezolizumab-containing doublet or triplet
      combination. Those who experience disease progression, loss of clinical benefit, or
      unacceptable toxicity may be eligible to receive a new triplet combination treatment in Stage
      2 until loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicity. New treatment arms may be added
      and/or existing treatment arms may be closed during the course of the study on the basis of
      ongoing clinical efficacy and safety as well as the current treatments available.
